Now I'd like to introduce Badri Kothandaraman, our President and Chief Executive Officer. Badri?
Badri Kothandaraman: Good afternoon, and thanks for joining us today to discuss our first quarter 2025 financial results. We reported quarterly revenue of $356.1 million, shipped approximately 1.53 million microinverters and 170.1 megawatt hours of batteries and generated free cash flow of $33.8 million. Our Q1 revenue included approximately $54 million of Safe Harbor. As we exited Q1, our battery channel inventory was normal, while our microinverter channel inventory was a little elevated. For the first quarter, we delivered 49% gross margin, 22% operating expenses and 27% operating income, all as a percentage of revenue on a non-GAAP basis and including the net IRA benefit. Mandy will go into our financials later in the call. Our customer service NPS held steady at 77% in Q1 as compared to 78% in Q4. The average call wait time increased slightly to 3.5 minutes, largely due to the winter storms in the US. We are continuing to invest in AI and machine learning to make our support experience faster, smarter and more helpful. Let's cover operations. Our global capacity is around 7.25 million microinverters per quarter, 5 million of those are in the US. In Q1, we shipped approximately 1.21 million microinverters from our US contract manufacturers booking 45x production tax credits. Our domestically produced microinverters help residential lease/PPA providers and commercial asset owners to qualify for the 10% domestic content ITC adder. We expect to ship approximately 1 million microinverters from the US in Q2. Q1 was our second quarter of building the IQ Batteries in the US using domestically manufactured microinverters, battery management systems and packaging, while sourcing cell packs from China. We shipped 44 megawatt hours of batteries from our Texas facility, a strong step forward as we continue scaling US production. Let's cover tariffs. The newly announced 145% tariff on products from China, along with the 10% reciprocal tariffs on import from other countries is expected to have minimal impact on our microinverters and accessories. Thanks to the excellent work our team has done to diversify its supply chain. However, our batteries will be more impacted as we currently source battery cell packs from China. These tariffs are expected to reduce our gross margin by approximately 2% in Q2 of '25. The effect of the tariffs is limited in Q2 due to us having pre-tariff inventory. Starting in Q3, we anticipate a 6% to 8% total gross margin impact after accounting for pricing adjustments. We expect the gross margin impact to gradually lessen over the subsequent quarters as our mitigation efforts take effect. We are moving with 10C. We have already identified tangible sourcing options outside China and we are fast tracking the qualification. These efforts are progressing quickly, and we expect to fully offset the impact starting in Q2 '26. As always, tariff policy remains fluid and may evolve with future government decisions. Let's come to the regions. Our US and International revenue mix for Q1 was 74% and 26% respectively. In the US, our revenue decreased 13% in Q1 compared to Q4, primarily due to seasonality and softening in customer demand, partially offset by Safe Harbor revenue of $54 million. The overall sell through of our products was down 18% compared to Q4. In addition to seasonality, installation activity was negatively impacted by one of the large national lease providers facing financial challenges. The US solar market remains under pressure from high interest rates and many installers, lease providers and distributors are navigating through a tough environment. That said, there are some encouraging signs. In California, installers are growing more confident selling NEM 3.0 systems, supported by strong battery attach rates. At the same time, power prices continue to rise across several key regions. We are staying focused on product innovation, quality and customer experience. Our upcoming fourth generation battery is designed to lower total system costs for backup. Our complementary offerings, like Busbar PCS and NEM expansion software help customers unlock even more value. In Europe, our revenue increased 7% in Q1 due to shipping the FlexPhase battery in Germany as compared to the prior quarter, while our overall sell through declined a little by about 9%. The overall business environment across the region is still challenging, but we are maintaining our discipline on controlling the channel as well as expanding our served available market by introducing a number of new products. I'll provide additional color on our key markets in Europe, the Netherlands, France, Germany and UK. In Netherlands, the demand softened slightly in Q1 in line with typical winter seasonality. The market continues to shift from solar only to solar plus battery solutions, which help avoid export penalties and enable participation in retail energy markets. We started shipping our new IQ EV charger into the region and recently introduced backup capability for our batteries, further strengthening the value proposition. In France, the market has slowed down following the recent utility rate cuts and we expect the demand to be muted over the next two quarters. However, a significantly lower VAT is set to begin in October, which should help spark a rebound in solar. France remains a key long-term growth market for us given our leadership position and the country's low solar penetration. We started shipping our new IQ EV charger into France, and we also plan to introduce hot water heater compatibility in the second quarter, allowing homeowners to increase their self-consumption. We also added backup capability for our batteries, further strengthening resilience offering. In Germany, we are ramping sales of our new IQ Battery 5P with FlexPhase and the new IQ EV charger. The typical installations are three phase in Germany and we are seeing a 30% backup attach for our batteries, a strong indicator of the growing demand for resilience. We are also preparing to launch our Balcony Solar product imminently in Germany in Q2, which expands our addressable market by approximately 400 megawatts annually. We believe these product introductions position us well for meaningful growth in both sell-in and sell-through over the coming quarters. The UK market continues to perform well for us as we strengthen our relationships with the retail energy providers in the region. We already started shipping our newest IQ EV charger, and we plan to introduce backup capability in Q3 of this year, further expanding our energy resilience offering. We remain underpenetrated in several European countries, including Italy, Spain, Belgium, Luxembourg, Switzerland, Austria, Sweden, Poland, and others, and we see them as important pillars of our long-term growth strategy. Over the coming months, we plan to introduce our full product portfolio across more of Europe, including IQ Microinverters, IQ Battery FlexPhase with backup, our latest and the greatest EV charger, AI powered energy management software and the solar graph installer platforms. We continue to make steady progress in other regions. In Puerto Rico, we are seeing a very sharp rise in demand for our higher domestic content battery, driven by an increased need for resilience. In India, sales of our IQ8P microinverters continued to grow and we are also shipping our batteries into the region. We are encouraged by the early signs of strong product market fit in both the urban and rural areas. In Brazil, new fire safety recommendations such as rapid shutdown should support continuous growth of our IQ8P microinverters. Now let's turn to our Q2 guidance. We expect Q2 revenue to be in the range of $340 million to $380 million. This includes approximately $40 million in Safe Harbor revenue, which we define as sales made to customers who plan to install the inventory over more than a year. We are currently about 80% booked to the midpoint of our revenue guidance. For IQ Batteries, we expect to ship between 160 and 180 megawatt hours during the quarter. Let's talk about new products, starting with IQ Batteries. Our fourth generation IQ Battery is all set to ramp up production in this quarter. This system includes the IQ Battery 10C. The IQ Combiner 6C and the Meter Collar. The IQ Battery 10C delivers the same 10 kilowatt hour capacity while using 60% lesser wall space, thanks to its fully integrated battery management and power conversion. When paired with the IQ Combiner and the Collar, the system significantly simplifies backup, eliminating the need to relocate loads, install current transformers, or run high current wiring. For both homeowners and installers, the improvement is substantial. What once took four boxes on the wall can now be done with just two. We have successfully completed the required Meter Collar testing with PG&E and four other utility companies. We expect to begin pilots in May. We have now expanded the IQ Microinverter family into 58 countries and plan to grow that number further by the year end. In Japan, we expect to begin production shipments this week through a distribution agreement with ITOCHU Corporation, one of the country's largest trading companies. Recently Tokyo became the first Japanese city to mandate rooftop solar on new home builds. Given the typically small roof areas in Tokyo, system design can be complex, which is exactly where our Enphase IQ8P microinverter shine, offering the flexibility and scalability needed to maximize production and reliability from every rooftop. In Q2, we plan to launch our IQ Balcony Solar product in Germany and Belgium with additional countries in Europe and Asia to follow in 2025. The product offers a simple, efficient way for apartment dwellers to harness solar energy from their balcony. Built on our proven AC-coupled architecture, the system allows the users to plug in one-to-four panels directly into a standard wall outlet. We plan to offer pre-wired kits that include IQ Microinverters and the Balcony gateway enabling fast setup and seamless monitoring through the Enphase app. In the event of a grid outage, the system also supports sunlight backup via an auxiliary socket located on the IQ Balcony Gateway product. Let's come to our IQ8P-3P commercial microinverter, a product that is steadily gaining traction. We have over 650 commercial sites live across the US, averaging about 35 kilowatts per system with consistent positive feedback from the field. These three-phase microinverters now ship from the US with increased domestic content that help qualify for the 10% ITC add-up, a meaningful advantage for commercial asset owners. And we expect the momentum to grow with the upcoming IQ9 microinverter, which is purpose built for 480 volt three-phase systems, unlocking even more of the commercial market. Let's talk about IQ9. So IQ9 microinverters are powered by cutting edge gallium nitride technology. These microinverters are engineered for the future with support for 18 ampere DC input current, higher AC voltages and three-phase configurations. Designed specifically for small commercial systems, IQ9 will support 480 volts AC, the most common commercial voltage in the US. The first models will deliver peak output power of 427 watts and 548 watts, making them ideal for pairing with today's most powerful residential and commercial solar panels. IQ9 uses GaN based bi-directional switches that allow us to reduce conduction losses and increase power density. While we are currently operating at similar switching frequencies to maintain compatibility with our existing transformer design, gallium nitride or GaN gives us the foundation to enable much higher frequencies and even greater efficiency in future products like IQ10. Thanks to GaN, IQ9 already delivers efficiencies that meet or exceed prior generations with a sleek, compact footprint. We expect to begin internal installations at Enphase facilities soon ahead of a full production launch in Q4. On the portable power front, we began shipping the IQ PowerPack 1500 to customers in US and Canada. This compact 1.5 kilowatt hour solution brings together our core strengths Enphase in a box, which is advanced power electronics, battery management and intelligent software into a smart portable product designed for home backup, travel and emergencies. IQ PowerPack marks our entry into the portable consumer energy market. We see this as a meaningful growth vector and plan to expand the product family in 2025 to address many more use cases and reach many more countries. Let's dive into EV charging. In late 2024, we began shipping our next generation IQ EV charger into Europe. We are now active in 14 countries across the region. This is one of our most advanced residential chargers till date, designed to work seamlessly with the Enphase Energy system or as a high performance standalone system. Smart features like green charging help homeowners maximize solar usage, while intelligence scheduling reduces energy costs during peak hours, delivering both sustainability and savings. We are excited to expand the availability of the IQ EV charger throughout this year into more European countries as well as into Australia, Brazil, India, and the US where we will position it as a premium feature rich offering. With strong early momentum, we expect continuous growth this year and beyond. Our IQ Energy management software supports grid services programs, VPPs in regulated markets like the US and energy market participation in deregulated markets like Europe and Australia. In the US, we are active in 26 programs across key states such as California, Colorado, Massachusetts, North Carolina and Texas. These programs discharge batteries during peak demand supporting the utilities. As electricity rates become more complex, we believe our AI powered software differentiates us, maximizing ROI and reducing the payback period. Let's cover Solar Graph, our all-in-one installer platform. We are investing in major enhancements, including a one-click Express editor for customized proposals, a Gen-AI powered in-app assistant, integration with racking and expanded C&I capabilities all aimed at making Solar Graph even more intuitive. The platform is now available to residential and commercial installers in the US, Canada, Brazil, Germany, Austria, Netherlands and France with plans to expand into additional countries in the coming quarters. Solar Graph continues to evolve as a strategic part of our software ecosystem, helping installers sell faster design smarter as well as scale efficiently. Let me conclude. While the global policy environment remains fluid with tariffs, with interest rates and subsidies constantly evolving, we are moving quickly to realign our supply chain to minimize downside across a range of scenarios. While we cannot control the macroeconomic conditions, we can absolutely control our response. This means doubling down on what has always made Enphase successful, relentless product innovation, world class reliability and exceptional customer service. Looking ahead, our strategy is clear. We are driving revenue growth through a wave of new products, starting with our fourth generation system, which delivers the lowest installation cost of any Enphase solar plus battery solution till date. In Europe, our SAM is expanding rapidly with the launch of our FlexPhase Battery with backup, the IQ EV charger and the upcoming IQ Balcony Solar kit. We are empowering installers with tools like NEM expansion software to expand legacy systems, Busbar PCS software to avoid main panel upgrade and dynamic tariff optimization software in European markets to help save money for the homeowner. And with our upcoming IQ9 microinverters, we expect to unlock a 10 gigawatt opportunity in commercial solar while driving cost per watt improvement across our residential business, as the world faces rising power prices and increasing grid instability, Enphase is becoming leaner, faster and more innovative. We are energized by the future and firmly focused on delivering value for our customers, partners and shareholders. With that, I will turn the call over to Mandy for her review of our financials. Mandy?
Mandy Yang: Thanks, Badri, and good afternoon, everyone. I will provide more details related to our first quarter of 2025 financial results as well as our business outlook for the second quarter of 2025. We have provided reconciliations of these non-GAAP to GAAP financial measures in our earnings release posted today, which can also be found in the IR section of our website. Total revenue for Q1 was $356.1 million. We shipped approximately 688.5 megawatt DC of microinverters and 170.1 megawatt hours of IQ Batteries in the quarter. Q1 revenue included approximately $54 million of safe harbor revenue. In December 2024, we signed a safe harbor sales agreement for a total amount of approximately $95 million to ship in the first-half of 2025. As Badri mentioned, we define safe harbor revenue as any sales made to customers who plan to install the inventory over more than a year. Non-GAAP gross margin for Q1 was 48.9% compared to 53.2% in Q4, primarily due to lower bookings of 45x production tax credit and product mix. GAAP gross margin was 47.2% for Q1 compared to 51.8% in Q4. Non-GAAP gross margin without net IRA benefit for Q1 was 38.3% compared to 39.7% in Q4, primarily due to product mix. GAAP and non-GAAP gross margin for Q1 included $37.9 million of net IRA benefit. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $79.4 million for Q1 compared to $83.3 million for Q4. The decrease was the result of restructuring actions initiated in the fourth quarter of 2024. GAAP operating expenses were $136.3 million for Q1 compared to $143.5 million for Q4. GAAP operating expenses for Q1 included $50.9 million of stock based compensation expenses, $2.9 million of amortization for acquired intangible assets and $3.2 million of restructuring and asset impairment charges. On a non-GAAP basis, income from operations for Q1 was $94.6 million compared to $120.4 million for Q4. On a GAAP basis, income from operations was $31.9 million for Q1 compared to $54.8 million for Q4. On a non-GAAP basis, net income for Q1 was $89.2 million compared to $125.9 million for Q4. This resulted in non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.68 for Q1 compared to $0.94 for Q4. GAAP net income for Q1 was $29.7 million compared to $62.2 million for Q4. This resulted in GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.22 for Q1 compared to $0.45 for Q4. We exited Q1 with a total cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and marketable security balance of $1.53 billion compared to $1.72 billion at the end of Q4. We paid-off the entire principal amount of $102.2 million for our 2025 convert that came due on March 1st. As part of our $1 billion share repurchase program authorized by our Board of Directors in July 2023, we repurchased 1,594,105 shares of our common stock in Q1 at an average price of $62.71 per share for a total of approximately $100 million. We have a remaining $298.7 million authorized for further share repurchases. In addition, we spent approximately $12.1 million by withholding shares to cover taxes for employee stock vesting and options in Q1 that reduced the diluted shares by 203,358 shares. We expect to continue this anti-dilution plan. In Q1, we generated $48.4 million in cash flow from operations and $33.8 million in free cash flow as approximately $70 million of revenue in Q1 was prepaid last quarter. Capital expenditure was $14.6 million for Q1 compared to $8.1 million for Q4. Now let's discuss our outlook for the second quarter of 2025. We expect our revenue for Q2 to be within the range of $340 million to $380 million, which includes shipments of 160 to 180 megawatt hours of IQ Batteries. The Q2 revenue outlook includes approximately $40 million from a safe harbor sales agreement signed in December 2024. We expect GAAP gross margin to be within a range of 42% to 45%, including 2 percentage points of new tariff impact. We expect non-GAAP gross margin to be within a range of 44% to 47% with net IRA benefit and 35% to 38% before net IRA benefit, including 2 percentage points of new tariff impact. Non-GAAP gross margin excludes stock based compensation expense and acquisition related amortization. We expect the net IRA benefit to be between $30 million and $33 million on estimated shipments of 1 million units of US microinverters in Q2. We expect our GAAP operating expenses to be within a range of $136 million to $140 million, including approximately $58 million estimated for stock-based compensation expense, acquisition related expenses and amortization and restructuring, and assay impairment charges. We expect our non-GAAP operating expenses to be within a range of $78 million to $82 million. For the year of 2025, we expect our GAAP tax rate of 21% to 23% and a non-GAAP tax rate of 15% to 17%, including IRA benefits. With that, I will open the line for questions.
Operator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And your first question today will come from Praneeth Satish with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Praneeth Satish: Thanks. Good evening. Maybe just starting with the Q2 guidance, so it includes 2 percentage points of gross margin headwind from the tariffs. It sounds like that could go to 6% to 8% in Q3. So it would seem as if you're not fully passing through the entire incremental tariff cost to customers. And I guess maybe if you could just talk about what's driving your decision to absorb some of these costs versus passing them through, because I would imagine that many of your competitors are also sourcing battery cells from China? So maybe if you could talk through that.
Badri Kothandaraman: Yes, you're right. Let me give a big picture. First of all, due to these tariffs and that is 145% tariffs on imports from China and 10% tariff on imports from other countries. So due to that, we are glad that our microinverters and accessories aren't affected much, and that's because our supply chain has done a fantastic job of global diversification. So that's the first good news. On batteries, more than 90% and I would venture to say 95% of the cells made in the world they come from China. We are no exception. We use Chinese sources for the cell packs. We have two ways that we produce batteries. One is we make batteries overseas, the full system. And the second is we get cell packs into the US and then we make the entire system, the rest of the system inside the US. As you can see when we bring it into the US, you have high US cost of manufacturing, but you have your tariff only on the cell packs that is coming in, plus any associated raw materials that are coming in from China or the other places. So it therefore turns out for us that whether we make it domestically or whether we make it outside the US, our costs are becoming approximately the same and the cost impact is significant. Why did we chose -- yes, we are going to pass fast a portion of it but we are going to absorb majority of the impact. And why is because first of all, we think we can recover this effect in a couple of quarters, in two to three quarters, that's what we mentioned. And what are we doing about it? Our job number one is to get cell sources outside China qualified. That's the job number one, which we have already identified the sources. We are working in aggressive task force mode and we expect to qualify these sources early next year. Therefore, considering that the impact is going to be only for a couple of quarters, two to three quarters, not couple of quarters, two to three quarters, we decided we would pass on a portion to the installers and we would absorb the majority ourselves. Now, I said 6% to 8% is the total impact in Q3. First of all, we aren't going to be that much impacted beyond 2% in Q2 because we have pre-tariff inventory. Then from Q3 onwards, that basically goes away. And we essentially are going to have an impact of about 6% to 8% as a result of all of these actions. We expect that impact, the gross margin impact to continuously improve as we go from Q3 to Q4 to Q1 and the impact to become zero in Q2.
Praneeth Satish: Got it. That's very helpful. And then just right or wrong, there seems to be a bit of paralysis on the customer side as we wait for clarity around IRA. For the Q2 guide, are you accounting for any worsening of demand trends in Q2 as we wait for clarity or making any adjustments for Nova exposure in the guide? And then maybe on the flip side, do you think that sell-through could accelerate in the second-half once we get IRA clarity? I guess, what are you hearing from your dealers on any pent-up demand? Thank you.
Badri Kothandaraman: Yes. I said a few things. I said my bookings right now is about 80%. So the guidance that we gave, we have accommodated that bookings in place, which is actually healthy. So that's the first thing. Yes, the lack of certainty is definitely a factor. One of the large national lease providers as you mentioned in financial trouble is another factor. What that financial trouble causes is basically our installers have difficulty in managing their cash flow. When our installers have very difficult in managing the cash flow, the originations suffer in Q1. Because the origination suffered, we do not see enough pull through from the distributors to the installers. Because as you must imagine, life must be pretty tough for them in terms of cash flow, but the good news is there are a lot of lease financiers now today compared to what there were two years ago. So it is a matter of time where those installers pick up the alternate financiers and hopefully restart the business again. However, that basically created a gap in Q1. And that's what we talked about. Our sell through was a little lower than normal. And having said that, we are entering the best seasonal part of the year. Q2 normally is the best-in terms of seasonality. Q1 to Q2 is what I'm talking about. And for Enphase specifically, what we have going for us, we expect to ramp our fourth generation batteries in Q2. We expect to ship meaningful volumes in production this quarter. And we basically, we expect that our cost for our backup installations will be equivalently as good as you know grid -- almost as good as grid type. We have done a great job in gaining market-share till now on our batteries, supporting grid tide installations with our third generation. This presents a huge opportunity for us to capture the backup market as well with a solution that is low cost. Earlier, we used to have a lot more components in our third generation system for backup. Now those will get significantly lesser because of two things. One is we have the collar, the second is we have a 10 kilowatt hour battery now instead of a 5 kilowatt hour battery. So specifically to Enphase, we are well-positioned to capitalize on the battery market. We also -- the clarity in terms of the policy will definitely give us a boost in the latter half.
Praneeth Satish: Thank you.
Operator: And your next question today will come from Phil Shen with ROTH Capital Partners. Please go ahead.
Phil Shen: Hi all, thanks for taking my questions. You talked earlier, Badri, about the margin trajectory as we get through even the first part of next year. Can we talk about what the revenue cadence might look like? So for Q3, is $375 million on the table. Would you expect Q4 to be up quarter-over-quarter or down and if you feel like you can share even Q1 of next year, that would be fantastic. Thanks.
Badri Kothandaraman: Right. Phil, you know, that we normally don't guide for Q3 or Q4, but we have a few vectors going for us. I just talked about the fourth generation system, and we believe that's a huge factor for Enphase. Then we specifically regarding the US, we have the IQ9 that is going to be turning on in Q4. Then coming to Europe, all of the new products -- we have introduced a large array of new products, which we are already seeing some good traction, namely the FlexPhase Battery, which provides three phase backup for many countries in Europe. The Balcony Solar, which basically, we are about to introduce it this quarter. So it's no longer something out there. It's going to ramp-in this quarter. Balcony Solar is going to address , for example, the TAM in Germany alone is 400 megawatts. And after Germany, we are going to go to Belgium and many other European countries. After that, we will go to Japan and India as well. So we expect new product to also be introduced in Q2. And the next one is our IQ EV charger, the latest EV charger. We did a good job ramping-up so that we can service all 14 countries in Q1. And now we got to grow from strength to strength there in terms of installer partnerships and EV charger partnerships in general through other companies there. So while the policy situation, et cetera, is uncertain, Enphase is trying to control our destiny by introducing new products, by having discipline and these are the new product vectors that we are relying on for growth.
Phil Shen: Okay. Thanks Badri,. Back to margins for a bit here. You talked about, I think the -- down 6% to 8% or 6% to 8% impact on Q3 margins. I think you mentioned that was the growth -- sorry, the net impact. Can you share what the gross impact is on tariffs on Q3?
Badri Kothandaraman: Well, no -- I don't have the gross impact. All we are saying is, we are passing a small amount of percentage increase to the customers. We are taking a number of other actions to like, for example, we do have some work that we can do on the raw materials for the batteries moving them out of China. So all of that work is going to happen. Those are what I call as improvements and a lot of vectors there, 1,000 little things we are going to do in order to continuously improve our gross margin impact.
Operator: And your next question today will come from Brian Lee of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Brian Lee: Hey guys, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the questions. I guess first question would just be, it sounds like you're passing through a little bit of the price on the tariff impact on batteries in the back half of the year. So you've been doing pretty well, 170 megawatt-hours of shipments quarter here to start the year, you've never had that kind of strength in the first-half, second-half usually better, but given tariff impact uncertainty and then maybe a little bit of price you're having to pass through, like what's the view on shipment volumes for battery storage in 3Q and 4Q? Can you continue to grow into the second-half? I guess that's also in the context of a new battery ramping. So just wondering kind of what's the volume view on top of what's happening with respect to cost and margins.
Badri Kothandaraman: Yes, I mean this is a great battery. First of all, our third generation system was 5 kilowatt hours, fourth generation system is 10 kilowatt hours. We had separate battery management, separate power conversion in the third generation system. We have combined it and it's got deep level of integration, a combination of power conversion as well as battery management, resulting in cost decline. And then we are talking about the balance of system. In the balance of system, we have eliminated what was called the system controller in the third-generation. And now we have eliminated that box, replacing it with a small Meter Collar which is trivial to install. So bottom line, what I'm trying to tell you, Brian, is that the system cost for the Enphase installed with backup is going to be significantly reduced. And yes, the battery itself might go up a little bit in pricing, but the overall system cost reduction is quite good and quite tremendous. So we expect to continuously grow on batteries. We also expect to continue to grow on batteries in Europe. For the first time, we have had three-phase backup, a full three-phase backup. And that was not available so far. I told you about the Germany, the battery attach is 80%, 90%. But of that battery attached, how many have backup, 30% have backup. We are able to serve those 30% now. And we are extending that to everywhere in Europe. And we expect our batteries to significantly improve. That is why we are taking very swift efforts to realign the supply chain to have non-China sales in our source of supply.
Brian Lee: That's super helpful. Maybe just a follow-up on that then Badri. So I think you guys were talking about doing something in the close to 35% gross margin on battery storage. If you kind of back-out the 6 to 8 percentage point tariff impact in the back half here, it implies your battery storage margins are going to be zero or negative, definitely negative in the US. So to get to back to kind of that 35% level, which I think you're inferring by Q2 of 2026, like how gradual is that? Or is that all just going to happen in like a quarter or two as you basically switch to non-China suppliers, it sounds like over Q1 or Q2 or is it all going to just happen in Q2? Maybe a little bit more color on the cadence, please? Thanks.
Badri Kothandaraman: Yes. So basically, I told you about the impact in Q2 being small, which is clear. So the remaining quarters left, I also told you -- sorry, Q2 '26, I told you the impact is zero. So we are talking about three quarters basically. And in these three quarters, the efforts we are going to be engaging are two things. We are one is we are going to move the cells, the source of cells to, outside China and multiple sources . That's what we are already working on. Then the second is any raw materials used in the batteries which we use a lot of raw materials that are sourced from China those also we need to move away to low tariff countries. And as you imagine that the latter activity is a continuous activity. And the cell activity can turn on quickly, but that might need about three months-to ramp. So basically, my guidance to you is these numbers are rough numbers. 6% to 8% impact in Q3, but every quarter, Q4 '25 should be better than Q3. Q1 '26 will be better than Q4 '25 and Q2 '26 should disappear to zero.
Operator: And your next question today will come from Mark Strouse with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Mark Strouse: Great. Thank you very much. So, Badri, I just want to confirm on that last point with the battery adjusting the supply chain. The raw materials, the packed, it's still the same LFP chemistries, right? Or is there any redesign or recertification that would be needed of your product? And would that be added on top of this timeline that you're talking about through 2Q '26?
Badri Kothandaraman: Yes. Good question. It is -- the whole point is to keep our LFP and we are not moving away from LFP. So -- and also the trick is how do we do this without redesigning everything. And so, right now our plans is mainly associated with the cell. However, the normal qualifications will be required because cell is the most basic entity of the battery and we need to make sure we do the appropriate qualifications.
Mark Strouse: Okay. That's great. And then just kind of near-term, wanted to go back to the 2Q guide. You said you're 80% booked into the midpoint of the guide. And I think you mentioned this in the past, it's been closer to 85% at least the last couple of quarters. Just kind of your thoughts on going with that 80% number instead of 85%, just kind of what gives you the confidence to go with that higher number?
Badri Kothandaraman: Last quarter we reported two weeks late that was February 4th. This time, this is April 22nd. So which we are fine. There 80% is good. We expect to be 100% booked soon.
Mark Strouse: Thank you.
Operator: And your next question today will come from Colin Rusch with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.
Colin Rusch: Thanks so much, guys. Given the VPP functionality that you guys can enable as well as some of the analytics, can you talk a little bit about market share gains, how you're seeing that sales process evolve and whether you're using price as a lever to take up market share a little bit here as you go forward?
Raghu Belur: Yes. Hey, Colin, this is Raghu. When you think about battery sales as well as actually EVSEs as well, it's now more than just batteries being used for providing resiliency or time of use or peak shifting. What you're seeing is this new value proposition that adds on to it, which is using your batteries to provide to either -- to participate in energy markets in de-regulated markets or a VPP construct where the utility can use your battery and discharge it and pay you for it. And so, at the end of the day, what that means is just improves the ROI for the homeowner and reduces the payback period. So the better that you can do it is actually a value proposition. You can be better than the competition. What I mean by that is providing very high quality APIs for your partners and that they can and then drive the battery and discharge the battery as needed, charge the battery as needed and participate in energy market. And all of that value proposition, which is good for the homeowner is the value proposition also that drives the adoption of your batteries. If we do it better than our competition, then clearly we gain market share. And that's what we are driving towards. We see that number of our partners buy our batteries because of our VPP and market steering capabilities.
Colin Rusch: That's super helpful. And then just from a logistics perspective, it looks like there's going to be some disruption in and around container ships. Can you talk a little bit about how you guys are mitigating that risk and what you're seeing in early returns on any of those elements so far?
Badri Kothandaraman: Colin, can you kindly repeat that question, because....
Colin Rusch: Sure. I mean just from a logistics perspective and shipping, like if you're still importing from Asia on key components, what you're seeing from a logistics perspective in terms of disruption on available ships, space, getting through customs, any sort of incremental expenses that we could be thinking about, just make sure we're paying attention to all of those software costs.
Badri Kothandaraman: Yes. I mean we do already see we make and maybe all of the folks do not know on this call, 85% of our microinverters are made in the US today, 85% of our global microinverter shipments are from the US. So already there is a healthy logistics train of raw materials, et cetera, coming into the US so that we can make our microinverter. So we don't expect any changes to that because we have diversified that well and we have not had any problems with logistics so far. On batteries also, 40%, I would say, let me say, we shipped 170 megawatt hours in Q1. 44 megawatt hours were made in Texas, approximately 25%. So how that works? Is we ship cell packs into Texas. We make microinverters in Texas. We make battery management in Texas. We make the enclosures at another state in the US. We make the chassis also in a neighboring state. So therefore, what is once again important there is the raw materials for making all of those. And our supply-chain is, we established this over three to four quarters ago. So for us, this is a -- although it is a disruption, for us, it's not that we have to learn everything from scratch. We have already ramped-up on a few areas. And we expect that 44 megawatt hours, which I said of US making batteries, we expect that to keep going up as we proceed into the year.
Colin Rusch: Thanks guys.
Operator: And your next question today will come from Christine Cho with Barclays. Please go ahead.
Christine Cho: Good evening. Thank you for taking my question. I was wondering, could you remind us what the manufacturing plans were for 10C? I thought the initial rollout was going to have the US inverters shipped to China and then assembled there and shipped back to the US before all this tariff news and then the domestic content version was going to come out later. So first of all, is this correct? And if it is, are you changing these plans so that you're not importing the full battery into the US, which will be subject to a higher nominal tariff? And if that's the case, does this impact the rollout of 10C at all if you do have to change plans?
Badri Kothandaraman: No, it does not roll out the impact of 10C. We are starting with the non-domestic version and that is correct. The microinverters for the non-domestic version will be made in the US and the rest of the battery is made outside the US but being shipped in. But we are quickly in about two months to three months’ time, we will quickly realign the supply-chain to have the domestic content product also available for the 10C. So right now, whatever we plan to ship in the second quarter will be the non-domestic version. And in a couple of months from then, the domestic version will be available.
Christine Cho: Okay. And then your guide for the 2Q quarter on top line and battery shipments are about the same as 1Q. And even if I am to add back the 2 percentage points of the tariff impact, would you imply your gross margins are still down about 150 bps at the midpoint. What exactly is driving that? And even though you talk about being diversified on the supply-chain for microinverters and having a lot of domestic suppliers. So maybe you might not directly be seeing tariffs, but aren't your suppliers still seeing price increases on their raw materials in this inflationary environment?
Badri Kothandaraman: Well, I mean, we said that the 2% increase was attributed to the tariffs for the current quarter. However, on batteries, I mean what you said is right. We plan to ship a smaller quantity than the usual full quarter quantity on batteries, while the fourth generation battery is new and let us say I ship and which I'm not guiding to the number. Let us say I ship 30 megawatt hours off the fourth generation battery and that would come with a little more tariff compared to the inventory that we will have on the third generation tariff. Hence, we guided to the 2% there. That's all.
Operator: And your next question today will come from Andrew Percoco with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Andrew Percoco: Great. Thanks so much for taking our questions. I do just want to again come back to this battery storage concept for a second. I'm just curious, you mentioned at the beginning of Q&A, I think 95% of LFP sales come from China. So presumably, a lot of your competitors and peers are also trying to get their hands on the supply you guys are working on. So just curious how you see the cost environment for that non-China supply evolving over time and the conversations you've had with some of those suppliers? And then second to that, just trying to figure out, when you talk about getting to 0% gross margin impact by the second quarter of 2026, how much of that is dependent on just completely exiting China from an LFP perspective versus taking action on price? Just trying to get a sense for breakdown there. Thank you.
Badri Kothandaraman: Yes. 95% of the LFP sales in China, yes, that's right. Don't forget that there are some Korean suppliers who do make NMC and we have never used NMC we've never liked NMC that's our opinion LFP is what we like in terms of safety so that's the first one. Then the question that you asked it is the biggest factor that affects the battery tariff is the cell you cannot get away from that. So if we cannot, meaning if our plans do not materialize for transferring the cells, that's a problem and then we would have to look at passing more of the cost impact to our customers. But right now, the right thing to do is we get the battery sales diversified out of China and we are working, we are not talking about unnamed suppliers, we are working with two great suppliers, and we have very tangible plans, we have tangible schedules. And since the timeframe we are talking about is two to three quarters, we thought the right thing to do is to basically absorb a fraction, a significant fraction of it ourselves and return back to normalcy very quickly.
Andrew Percoco: Understood. Thank you for that. And maybe just to ask a higher level question here. I know you guys don't guide beyond one quarter, but I guess, how do you envision the market evolving over the balance of the year? You obviously have IRA uncertainty, which might not be resolved until 3Q, 4Q at some point? Obviously, tariffs have had an impact on recession concerns and consumer sentiment. So how do you expect the demand environment to evolve over the balance of the year just given the level of uncertainty and the impact that has had on broader consumer sentiment, which obviously could lead into and have an impact on end market demand for residential solar. So just curious how you're thinking about that at a higher level. Thank you.
Badri Kothandaraman: Yes. I mean, look, Q1 is usually the seasonally worst quarter. We are past Q1. Q2, Q3 and even Q4 to an extent are normally, are the good seasonal quarters. So we are expecting that. In addition, our value proposition, the value proposition of solar and batteries relies a lot on utility rates and it is not exactly that the utility rates are going down everywhere. They are in fact going up. And so, as long as that happens the ROI of tomorrow will be better than today. And so utility rates is an important factor. You saw what is happening to NEM 3. NEM 3, just to remind you, did away with net metering and there is a small feed-in only small export compensation. That caused the battery attached in California to go to 90%, so it was a very difficult transition. We don't like how abruptly the transition was done, but at the end of the day things are looking more stable in California in terms of solar and storage with a very healthy value proposition. And that healthy value proposition came from the fact that utility rates are high. So that's a factor that will always be going for us. Then you have the explosion in AI. The explosion in AI, what it's going to cause is electricity supply is going to get stretched both front of the meter as well as behind the meter and we are not here to argue which one is better but you know it is that what we do is behind the meter, while a lot of capacity is put in place front of the meter. That's got a long cycle of approval the front of the meter. So we think in order to be balanced or in order to have a proper energy security for America, we need to have a thriving behind the meter business in addition to front of the meter. And behind the meter, we are talking about every home is a power plant, mini power plant, solar-plus-storage. And so, I think it is only a matter of time when people start seeing this and there is clarity on IRA, the ITC and PTC and I think demand will be unlocked after that.
Operator: Your next question today will come from Maheep Mandloi with Mizuho. Please go ahead.
David Benjamin: Hi, this is David Benjamin for Maheep. Thanks for taking our questions. Does your Q2 guide assume any negative impacts from higher tariffs on Southeast Asia modules and the impact on US soil demand?
Badri Kothandaraman: No, we don't deal with modules from Southeast Asia.
David Benjamin: Okay. So you don't see any impact on overall solar demand. And then another question -- okay.
Badri Kothandaraman: Overall solar demand maybe utility scale, maybe impacted to an extent. We don't expect any demand -- any impact on residential.
David Benjamin: Okay. Thank you. And then you did mention that channel inventory was slightly up. Is that in Europe or is the US? And does that imply like any potential new destocking?
Badri Kothandaraman: No, the channel inventory is, okay, is up because when your sell-through goes down, the channel inventory can go slightly up, out of our usual targets. Our targets are between eight and 10 weeks. So -- but when your sell-through is down more than what you anticipated, then that can go slightly up. The ways to recover it back are quite simple, not ship much into the channel and then improve the sell-through in a seasonal quarter like Q2, which is bound to have more sell-through in Q2 than Q1. So we believe it's a normal cycle, and we are disciplined to control the amount of material in the channel with that discipline, it should come back quickly inbound.
Operator: Your next question today will come from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Jefferies. Please go ahead.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Hey, good afternoon, team. Thank you guys very much. Appreciate it. Maybe just follow-up on the last question a little bit further. Can you talk about what you're seeing in terms of end market demand, right? You talked about restocking and now destocking here and seemingly in the second quarter. What are you seeing in terms of year-over-year volume metric trends? I know you provided obviously second quarter, but can you talk about volumetric trends were at large, A. And then B, can you talk a little bit more about safe harbor as well? It seems like you're implying that the substantive amount of the $95 million is contemplated in the first-half and with fairly little safe harbor contemplated in the back half, but maybe you could talk about maybe early indications on that front?
Badri Kothandaraman: Yes. I'll answer the second question first. Safe harbor, you're right, $54 million was in Q1, we said $40 million approximately in Q2. And right now we do not yet have safe harbor plans, meaning our customers haven't yet asked for them, but I'm sure that if they want stock due to something else, we will advise in the second quarter call. Volumetric trends. So, Volumetric trends is -- we talked about it so far the Q1 is the weakest in terms of demand, and now we had -- we talked about a large national leasing provider basically having some financial difficulties. So because of that, our installers have stumbling blocks and they need to recover, and they will recover by going to new financiers. In that time, the installation start. And so, that's why we saw a little bit worse sell through from our distributors to installers in Q1. We believe that there are a lot of financiers, other financiers now who can really pick-up the business. So we believe that, that trend will stop and normal sell through will take over. So we expect the normal seasonality to show up from Q1 to Q2. In addition, these one-time effects will take some time to clear. As for Q3 and Q4, I talked about it at length. There is some policy clarity that has to come. But for us, we are not stopping like what I said. Our fourth generation system is -- we expect to ship our fourth generation system product in the current quarter, and that makes backup extremely easy and extremely cost effective. So we expect to do that. We expect to introduce IQ9 in the fourth quarter, diversifying ourselves into the 480 volt, three phase small commercial business. IQ9, by the way, I talked at length about the innovation with GaN. With GaN, we are able to get our cost structure very similar to the prior generation, but provide 10% more power. So that means the cost per watt would be 10% down compared to our prior generation. So we have all of these vectors. And then, I talked about the utility rates going up. So we expect general growth through the year, primarily due to our new products and policy clarity will also help a little bit.
Operator: Your next question today will come from Kashy Harrison with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.
Kashy Harrison: Hi, good afternoon. Thank you for taking the questions. Just two quick ones for me. My first question, on the topic of GaN, are there alternative sources for gallium outside of China? Just trying to think through risk mitigation in the event that the trade war potentially gets worse before it gets better.
Badri Kothandaraman: Yes, we have talked about this at length with our sources we have more than one source all of them are comfortable that they have it covered we are not worried about it.
Kashy Harrison: Okay. And then my follow-up, you indicated that -- excuse me, you indicated that Europe is still challenging, but your sell-through was down 9%, which doesn't sound that bad from a seasonality perspective. And so I'm just curious, what are you seeing that makes you characterize the entirety of the region as challenging? Is it just France or is there some other dynamic that we need to be thinking about? Thank you.
Badri Kothandaraman: No, I think we talked about that, that is the piece. The sell-through was a little down at 9%. But what I said is we introduced new products into the region. That's why our numbers were up. And we talked at length about all of the initiatives in Netherlands. In Netherlands, net metering will disappear in 2027. That means all of the customers are going to be looking forward to a battery solution in order to conserve or in order to lower their electricity bill. So it is a huge opportunity as well. But that will become a solar plus a storage market. We are working with our installers and the retail energy providers to transition that market properly. And the second one is France. We talked about the utility rate going down, but there again I think it is a short-term blip for a couple of quarters. We expect the VAT to be reduced there and we also expect the utility rates to go back up according to what we -- the public news available. So I think that one what we are doing, we are constantly introducing new products. Our three phase battery with backup we will introduce there shortly. We have introduced our newest IQ EV charger. We are introducing hot water heater capability there. That is, today in France, the feed in tariff is only EUR0.4 per kilowatt hour. And when you have EUR0.4 per kilowatt hour, it does not make sense to export energy. You would rather save energy. And if I take that solar energy and I divert it, steer it towards the hot water heater, that's a much better use of the energy. So that solution will be available in this quarter, current quarter. So I talked about that. Germany is really where we had a nice uptick in Q1, and that is because of the FlexPhase battery where we introduced three phase with backup. So what we are doing in Europe, although the market isn't terribly strong yet, our SAM has increased from strength to strength through these new products. And that's why we are more positive on Europe. That's why you saw our revenue went up in Europe.
Operator: Your next question today will come from Austin Moeller with Canaccord Genuity. Please go ahead.
Austin Moeller: Hi, good afternoon. Just my first question, given the administration's announcement of new tariffs on panels in Southeast Asia, I assume that your supply chain team is not expecting that a trade deal with China, be it Vietnam will benefit inverter or battery manufacturing and you're just going to accelerate the diversification of your supply chain out of China?
Badri Kothandaraman: Yes. I mean, that's the general plan. We are accelerating the move specifically for batteries. We have already completed for microinverters like what I said, microinverters and accessories, they're almost done. That's right.
Austin Moeller: Okay. And just a follow-up. So I mean, the general assumption here is US installers are advanced, procuring inverters and batteries and waiting to sell product probably once interest rates go down. So do you think that the persistent high interest rate level right now is limiting some of the demand from customers to install ahead of potentially the 30% investment tax credit being repealed in 2026?
Badri Kothandaraman: Yes, the high interest rates is absolutely an important factor. In the residential solar business, 60% of the business used to be loans. And now it has changed to leases and probably 30% is still with loans. And anything you're doing on the interest rates there will help and will help for demand. That's right.
Austin Moeller: Great. Thanks for your insight.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And your next question today will come from Joseph Osha with Guggenheim Partners. Please go ahead.
Joseph Osha: Hi, everybody. Hi, Badri. Thanks for taking my question. Sorry to belabor this question of cell supply, but are you saying, say, a year from now that you think you'll be able to source LFP from outside of China at the same price you can get it from inside China? Or are you saying that you're going to pay what you have to pay and pass that on to customers? I'm trying to understand what your view of this is.
Badri Kothandaraman: Yes, I mean, B, but meaning the second option that you said, but the prices of those fills aren't that high?
Joseph Osha: I'm sorry, I don't follow. So you're saying that you think cells will be more expensive relative to your current.
Badri Kothandaraman: No. Let me tell you what. The cell pricing, the cell pricing is affordable, even if it -- let us say, goes up by 20%, it is affordable. But when you take a cell in China and you put it into a product, for example, you assemble it in any place, even outside China, even outside the US, you have to pay the 145% extra tariff because the cell is in China. Now what you could do is again to diversify your supply chain, you could make your cells, let us say Eastern Europe, you could make your cells in Eastern Europe, LFP cells, you could bring it in to the US, you could have a packing facility in the US and you could get in other raw materials into the US. It will be significantly cheaper to do because you no longer pay the 150% -- 145%. So even if those basic cells were 20% higher, it doesn't matter.
Joseph Osha: Okay. But clearly it's going to be more expensive than the status quo was prior to the tariffs and when you were able to source out of China without 145%. Right?
Badri Kothandaraman: Yes, if you want to be legally right, it is going to be expensive, but does it matter? It doesn't matter.
Joseph Osha: Okay. Thank you for clarifying.
Badri Kothandaraman: That's right.
Operator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Badri Kothandaraman for any closing remarks.
Badri Kothandaraman: All right, thank you for joining us today and for your continued support of Enphase. We look forward to speaking with you again next quarter.
Operator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2024 Q4  (2025-02-04 16:30:00) =====
Operator: Good afternoon, everyone and welcome to the Enphase Energy’s Fourth Quarter 2024 Financial Results Conference Call. All participants will be in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today’s presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please also note, today's event is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the floor over to Zach Freedman. Please go ahead.
Zach Freedman: Good afternoon and thank you for joining us on today’s conference call to discuss Enphase Energy’s fourth quarter 2024 results. On today’s call are Badri Kothandaraman, our President and Chief Executive Officer; Mandy Yang, our Chief Financial Officer; and Raghu Belur, our Chief Products Officer. After the market closed today, Enphase issued a press release announcing the results for its fourth quarter ended December 31, 2024. During this conference call, Enphase management will make forward-looking statements including, but not limited to, statements related to our expected future financial performance, market trends, the capabilities of our technology and products, and the benefits to homeowners and installers, our operations, including manufacturing, customer service, and supply and demand, anticipated growth in existing and new markets, the timing of new product introductions, and regulatory and tax matters. These forward-looking statements involve significant risks and uncertainties, and our actual results and the timing of events could differ materially from these expectations. For a more complete discussion of the risks and uncertainties, please see our most recent Form 10-K and 10-Qs filed with the SEC. We caution you not to place any undue reliance on forward-looking statements and undertake no duty or obligation to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future events, or changes in expectations. Also, please note that financial measures used on this call are expressed on a non-GAAP basis unless otherwise noted and have been adjusted to exclude certain charges. We have provided a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures in our earnings release furnished with the SEC on Form 8-K, which can also be found in the Investor Relations section of our website. Now, I’d like to introduce Badri Kothandaraman, our President and Chief Executive Officer. Badri?
Badri Kothandaraman: Good afternoon, and thanks for joining us today to discuss our fourth quarter 2024 financial results. We reported quarterly revenue of $382.7 million, shipped approximately 2 million microinverters and 152-megawatt hours of batteries and generated free cash flow of $159 million. Our overall channel inventory remained normal as we exited the fourth quarter. For Q4, we delivered 53% gross margin, 22% operating expenses and 31% operating income, all as a percentage of revenue on a non-GAAP basis, including the net IRA benefit. Mandy will cover the financials later in the call. Let's cover customer service. Our worldwide Net Promoter Score was 78% in Q4, the same compared to Q3. Our average call wait time decreased to 2.8 minutes from 4.4 minutes. We are working to further reduce wait times by leveraging AI and rolling out software fixes. Let's talk about operations. Our global capacity is around 7.25 million microinverters per quarter with $5 million in the U.S. In Q4, we shipped approximately 1.7 million microinverters from our U.S. contract manufacturing facilities, booking 45x production tax credits. We also introduced a higher domestic content skew for two of our products, the IQ8X Microinverters and the IQ8P commercial Microinverters in Q4 to help the commercial asset owners qualify for a 10% domestic content IPC adder. We now offer higher domestic content Microinverters that cover both residential and commercial solar applications and continue to see good demand for these products from lease, PPA and commercial markets. We expect to ship 1.2 million units -- Microinverters from our U.S. contract manufacturing facilities in Q1. We also began shipping the IQ Battery 5P, our third-generation battery system from our U.S. contract manufacturing facilities during Q4, utilizing domestically made microinverters, battery management systems and enclosures while sourcing cell packs from China. We shipped 6.7 megawatt hours of batteries from our Texas contract manufacturing facility in Q4. We continue to evolve our sourcing strategy to maximize domestic content opportunities and diversify our geographic exposure. Let's cover the regions. Our U.S. and international revenue mix for Q4 was 79% and 21%, respectively. In the U.S., our revenue increased 6% in Q4 compared to Q3, driven by 11% increase in microinverter sales. This increase was due to strong demand for our higher domestic content microinverters. Our battery sales were down 8% in Q4 compared to Q3 due to lesser channel restocking as we had previously anticipated. Our overall sell-through of products was flat in Q4 compared to Q3. We are generally seeing stable demand in the U.S., both in California as well as outside of California. NEM 3.0 currently represents 66% of our installs in California with a 45% attach rate for our own batteries. The adoption of batteries is steadily increasing across the U.S. due to new tariff structures like Mentry, VPP programs and the need for resilience. In Europe, our revenue was down 25% in Q4 compared to Q3, while our overall sell-through declined by 13%. The overall business environment across the region is still challenging, but we are maintaining discipline on controlling the channel and expanding our served available market by introducing new products. I'll provide some additional color on key markets in Europe, The Netherlands, followed by France, Germany and the U.K. In the Netherlands, demand remains weak but has stabilized. The market is transitioning away from solar-only systems to solar plus batteries, which avoids export penalties and allows participation of residential solar plus battery systems in energy markets. We announced new collaborations with two retail energy providers during Q4 that enabled homeowner access to dynamic tariffs and participation in the imbalanced markets, both of which can improve payback to better than six years even without net metering. We expect to announce more partnerships with Dutch energy providers in the future, and see gradual improvement in this market as we progress through 2025. We also started shipping our new IQ EV chargers into Netherlands in the fourth quarter. In France, the market is slowing down due to the recent utility rate cuts. France remains a key long-term growth market for us, given our leadership and low solar penetration. We started shipping our IQ EV chargers into France in the fourth quarter. We plan to introduce hot water heater compatibility in Q2, enabling homeowners to do heating with excess solar car green heating. We also plan to introduce backup capability for our batteries, further enhancing resilience for homeowners. As the feed-in tariffs in France gradually reduce, the value of solar plus batteries along with home energy management continues to rise. In Germany, we are excited about a few new products that will expand our reach. In early January, we started shipping the IQ Battery 5P with FlexPhase, a new product to customers in Germany, Austria, and Switzerland. The early feedback has been very positive, and we see an opportunity to increase share in the region now that we have three phase backup capability. We also recently started shipping our new IQ EV chargers into Germany. In addition, we expect to introduce our IQ Balcony Solar solution in Q2. We believe Enphase microinverters are ideal for small systems, and this product is expected to increase our served available market in Germany by approximately 400 megawatts per year. A bright spot for us is the UK, where we are growing steadily. We recently announced that our systems are integrated into Octopus Energy smart import and export tariffs, such as the Intelligent Octopus Flux that is designed to optimize the charging and discharging of solar plus battery systems aiming to provide customers the best rates for buying and selling electricity. We expect to start shipping our new IQ EV chargers into the UK shortly in Q1. We are still underpenetrated in many countries in Europe, including the UK, Italy, Spain, Belgium, Luxembourg, Switzerland, Austria and Poland. While each country faces its own unique challenges and opportunities. Homeowners are prioritizing safety, reliability, quality, savings and an all-in-one app experience for their home energy system, which aligns well with our core strengths. We plan to introduce our entire suite of products, the IQ8 microinverters, both single and three-phase batteries with backup, the new IQ EV chargers and the AI-powered home energy management software, along with the Solargraf Installer Platform across a lot more European countries throughout 2025. We continue to make incremental progress in other regions. In India, our IQ8P and IQ8HC. These are the high-powered microinverters. Those sales continue to ramp, and we began shipping the IQ Battery 5P in December. We also recently started shipping the high-powered IQ8P microinverters into Vietnam and Malaysia, further expanding into Southeast Asia. Additionally, we are building momentum in Thailand and Philippines, steadily ramping up businesses in these growing markets as demand for high-quality, reliable energy solution continues to rise. Let's cover Japan. We are especially excited about Japan's 1.3 gigawatt solar market where we recently began piloting installations and plan to ship IQ8HC Microinverters in Q2. The Tokyo metropolitan government subsidies for MLPC make the market even more attractive for consumers. Japan solar landscape aligns well with small systems, 2 to 3 kilowatts complex roofs, strong demand for quality. These are all well aligned with our strengths. Let's come to Q1 guidance. We are guiding revenue in the range of $340 million to $380 million. We anticipate recognizing approximately $50 million in safe harbor revenue in Q1, partially offsetting seasonality. We define safe harbor revenues any sales made to customers who plan to install the inventory over more than one year. We are approximately 85% booked to the midpoint of our overall revenue guidance. We expect to ship between 150 megawatt hours and 170 megawatt hours of IQ batteries, slightly higher than Q4. Before we talk about new products, let's discuss the growing importance of energy market participation in many markets worldwide. REPs or Regional Energy Providers and VPP programs are offering homeowners attractive ROI by utilizing their solar plus battery systems to buy and sell energy. We believe Enphase Energy Systems offer best-in-class reliability, customer support and API integration, which are important for REPs and VPP programs. We look forward to sharing with you our progress in these markets as we go through 2025. Let's cover new products starting with IQ batteries. As I said before, our third-generation battery continues to gain traction in the U.S. as well as worldwide. In the U.S., we introduced two key system enhancements to improve flexibility and reduce costs. The first is Busbar Power Control software, which allows homeowners to install larger solar and battery systems without costly main panel upgrades. The second is power control software for NEM expansion, enabling homeowners in California to expand legacy NEM systems without any penalty. These advancements provide homeowners with increasing flexibility and cost savings and are being well received by installers. We are making excellent progress with our fourth generation IQ battery, which offers 60% less wall space, thanks to its integrated battery management and power conversion architecture. The battery pairs with our IQ Meter Collar and new Enhanced Combiner, reducing installed costs by approximately $300 per kilowatt hour for a typical backup system, making us highly competitive across all use cases. We have achieved UL compliance for the Meter Collar, and we are now working on getting approval from the California utilities. We expect to pilot our fourth-generation battery in the U.S. in the first quarter. IQ8P-3P Commercial Microinverter with its new three-phase cabling system is ideal for 208 volts, small commercial solar installs between 20 kilowatts and 200 kilowatts. We have over 516 sites in the U.S. with an average size of 40 kilowatts and the feedback so far has been positive. These three-phase microinverters are now shipping from the U.S. with increased domestic content, offering a 10% ITC added for commercial asset owners, which should drive up demand even further. One more positive thing to note is that our IQ8 residential and commercial microinverters are now in compliance with the Build America Buy America Act -- BABA. Let me provide an update on IQ9, covered by gallium nitride technology. The IQ9 family is built for higher DC input current handling up to 18 amps versus IQ8, which handles up to 14 amps. IQ9 also supports a wide range of AC grid voltages, including 240-volts, 208-volts and 480-volts for both residential and commercial markets, leveraging GaN high-voltage transistors. These microinverters deliver high AC output power of 427 watts and 548 watts at a lower cost. We remain on track to launch IQ9 in the second half of this year for both residential and commercial markets with a significant SAM expansion driven by compatibility with 480-volts AC commercial systems. Let's dive into EV charging. We started shipping our new IQ EV charger across several countries in Europe tapping into a $1.4 billion annual market. The next-generation smart charger is designed to work seamlessly as part of our Enphase Energy system or as a powerful standalone charger. Key features of this new IQ EV chargers include dynamic face switching and fine grained current control for efficient green charging, dynamic load balancing, ISO 15118, support for AC bidirectional vehicle expansion and compatibility with MID meter for Germany as well as compatibility with OCPP cloud software 2.01, making it a very comprehensive and future-ready solutions. In Q4, we began shipping the IQ PowerPack 1500 products to customers in the U.S. and Canada. This 1.5 kilowatt hour smart portable energy system incorporates all of Enphase's core technologies of power conversion, battery management and software, you should think about it as Enphase in a box. During the recent LA fires, Enphase donated PowerPack 1500, along with an organization card empowered by light to support relief efforts with some firefighters who are using them to power their communications gear. We are excited to enter this growing consumer market and plan to expand the PowerPack globally in 2025. Let's talk briefly about Solargraf, our Installer Platform. We added a lot of new features to Solargraf in 2024 with the ease of doing design as a goal. Solargraf is now available to installers in the U.S., Canada, Brazil, Germany, Austria, Netherlands, France with plans to expand into more countries in the coming quarters. Looking ahead, we are working on key enhancements to Solargrafs, including auto route detection, ultra-fast proposals, UI/UX overhaul and expanded C&I features making Solargraf even more powerful and in Q2. Let me conclude. We successfully navigated a challenging 2024, generating strong free cash flow and profitability while bringing down channel inventory to normalized levels. We entered 2025 with a continued focus on operational efficiency product reliability, customer service, product breadth and geographic expansion. We have also doubled down on U.S. manufacturing for microinverters and batteries, which we believe is good for our customers, economy and for Enphase. There is some uncertainty around government policies for our industry, both in the U.S. and abroad. But one trend is very clear. Centralized grids need more support to keep up with the increased electricity demand. Unsubsidized free markets are increasingly turning to distributed energy systems to help balance the grids through our REPs and VPP programs. We see this trend increasing and getting stronger as we look ahead and believe we are well positioned there. We believe our new products will help drive gradual revenue growth throughout 2025, with safe harbor ordering in the U.S. having the potential to accelerate growth as we progress into the second half of 2025. We remain committed to delivering best-in-class solutions and are energized by the road ahead. With that, I will turn the call over to Mandy for her review of our financials. Mandy?
Mandy Yang: Thanks, Badri, and good afternoon, everyone. I will provide more details related to our fourth quarter of 2024 financial results as well as our business outlook for the first quarter of 2025. We have provided reconciliations of these non-GAAP to GAAP financial measures in our earnings release posted today, which can also be found in the IR section of our website. Total revenue for Q4 was $382.7 million. We ship approximately 878 megawatt DC of Microinverters and 152.4 megawatt hours of IQ batteries in the quarter. Non-GAAP gross margin for Q4 was 53.2% compared to 48.1% in Q3. GAAP gross margin was 51.8% for Q4 compared to 46.8% in Q3. Non-GAAP of gross margin without net IRA benefit for Q4 was 39.7% compared to 38.9% in Q3. The non-GAAP gross margin for Q4 included $51.9 million of net IRA benefit. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $83.3 million for Q4 compared to $81.6 million for Q3. The increase was driven by higher R&D expense related to the launch of multiple new products in the first half of 2025. We continue to invest in new products, customer service and geographic expansion. We implemented a restructuring plan in November 2024 to reduce our operating costs and align our workforce and cost structure with current market conditions. We expect to reduce our non-GAAP operating expenses to be in the range of $75 million to $80 million a quarter by the second quarter of 2025. Sales operating expenses were $143.5 million for Q4 compared to $128.4 million for Q3. Sales operating expenses for Q4 included $47.9 million of stock-based compensation expenses, $2.9 million of amortization for acquired intangible assets, and $9.4 million of restructuring asset impairment charges. On a non-GAAP basis, income from operations for Q4 was $125.9 million, compared to $101.4 million for Q3. On a GAAP basis, income from operations was $54.8 million for Q4 compared to $49.8 million for Q3. Our non-GAAP basis net income for Q4 was $125.9 million compared to $88.4 million for Q3. This resulted in non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.94 for Q4 compared to $0.65 for Q3. G&A income for Q4 was $62.2 million compared to $45.8 million for Q3. This resulted in GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.45 for Q4 compared to $0.33 for Q3. We exited Q4 with a total cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and marketable securities balance of $1.72 billion compared to $1.77 billion at the end of Q3. As our 2025 converter is coming due in March this quarter. We plan to use our existing cash to pay off the entire principal balance of approximately $102 million. As part of our $1 billion share repurchase program authorized by our Board of Directors in July 2023, we repurchased 2,883,438 shares of our common stock in Q4 at an average price of $69.25 per share or a total of approximately $199.7 million. We have a remaining $398 million authorized for further share repurchases. In addition, we spent approximately $5 million by withholding shares to cover taxes or employees start vesting in options Q4 that reduced the diluted shares by 68,532 shares. Respect to continuing this anti-dilution point. In Q4, we generated $167.3 million in cash flow from operations and $159.2 million in free cash flow including approximately $110 million of customer prepayments. Capital expenditure was $8.1 million for Q4 compared to $8.5 million for Q3. We expected our capital expenditure to stay within $50 million in 2025. Now let's discuss our outlook for the first quarter of 2025. We expect our revenue for Q1 to be within a range of $340 million to $380 million, which includes shipments of 150-megawatt hour to 170-megawatt hour of IQ batteries. In December 2024, we signed a safe harbor sales agreement for a total amount of approximately $95 million to ship in the first half of 2025. As Badri mentioned, we defined safe harbor revenue as any sales made to customers who plan to install the inventory over more than a year. The first quarter of 2025 revenue outlook includes approximately $50 million from the safe harbor sales agreement. Although we received a lump sum of $95 million due to safe harbor for expected shipments in the first half of 2025. Under normal circumstances, this would have been recognized organically over eight quarters at an average of approximately $12 million per quarter. Going forward, the $12 million should be considered as part of the baseline each quarter to reflect the true run rate of our business. Coming back to Q1 guidance. We expected gross margin to be within a range of 46% to 49%. We spent non-GAAP gross margin to be within a range of 48% to 51%, with net IRA benefit and 38% to 41% before net IRA benefit. Non-GAAP gross margin excludes stock-based compensation expense and acquisition-related amortization. We expect the net IRA benefit to be between $36 million and $39 million, an estimated shipment of 1.2 million units of U.S.-made microinverters in Q1. We expect our GAAP operating expenses to be within the range of $143 million to $147 million, including approximately $52 million estimated for stock-based compensation expense, acquisition-related expenses and amortization, and restructuring and asset impairment charges. We expect our non-GAAP operating expenses to be within a range of $81 million to $85 million. We expect our GAAP and non-GAAP annualized effective tax rate, excluding discrete items for 2025 to be at 18%, plus or minus 1% with IRA benefit. In closing, we managed well with our financial discipline through a difficult global environment in 2024. We maintained profitability and strong gross margins. In addition, we generated approximately $480.1 million of free cash flow in 2024 and exited the year with $1.72 billion in cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and marketable securities while repurchasing 4.5 million shares of our common stock for approximately $391.4 million. With that, I will open the line for questions.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, at this time, we will begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from Brian Lee from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead with your question.
Brian Lee: Hey, everyone. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question, and good job on the quarter here. Maybe for Mandy or Badri, just trying to understand the guidance, because there's a little bit of moving parts with the safe harbor. So, if we take the $50 million out, obviously, that's implying like a base line of 310 for Q1. And if we look at the past three years or so, typical seasonality, maybe up like high-single-digits sequentially into 2Q. And then we add $45 million on top of that to be recognized as we think about kind of the framework for Q2 modeling. And then just -- is there a visibility for any more safe harbor revenue as you move through the year kind of second half? What are your customer discussions around that?
Badri Kothandaraman: Yes. So let me just give a brief on that. The way you should think about the $95 million safe harbor, we think, is this $95 million if it had not been for safe harbor, would have been recognized over eight quarters. That's approximately $12 million a quarter of core revenue. So when you talk about the $310 million, I would add another $12 million to it that makes it $322 million. So take roughly the $380 million in Q4, $382 million. And going down to $332 million, that is in line with about 15% seasonality that is typically expected from Q4 into Q1. To answer your question, is there any more safe harbor deals that will be done later this year? We don't know. But of course, there is some drive towards safe harbor. One is we saw the domestic content guidance basically reducing for inverters as well as for racking. So that's one incentive. The second incentive is, obviously, if there is anything on the step downs for ITC, for example, some customers may want to take that into consideration and do safe harbor. So we are having those discussions with the customers. And we will inform you, hopefully, in the next conference call, if there is anything more.
Brian Lee: Okay, fair enough. And then maybe just a follow-up question on, you're starting off the year with some good momentum on the battery storage front just based on the volume guidance here for Q1, but you're also in the midst of, like you said, piloting the new 10C battery. And just wondering how much of this is sort of phasing out the older generation battery, what kind of visibility do you have on picking up new volume, maybe market share as you move through 2Q and beyond on the 10C? And should we expect a near pocket? Or are you expecting kind of sequential growth on battery storage volumes throughout the balance of year, similar to kind of what you've seen in past years? Thank you.
Badri Kothandaraman: Yes. Good question. We do expect to sequentially grow in batteries throughout 2025. If you see what happened in 2024, our sell-through gradually increased through 2024. Basically, let me cover two things. Internationally, we have introduced the third-generation battery and it was, by and large, a battery that was for grid-tied applications in Europe, because the power is relatively stable there. Now what we did, and I'm not sure whether you've got it, it is -- we have introduced variant of that battery called FlexPhase. FlexPhase is a battery that is capable of operating in either three-phase or a single phase configuration, and it can do back up on all three phases. It is perhaps the smallest AC-coupled battery that can do backup on all three phases. And in some regions like Germany, Austria and Switzerland, backup is more an emotional requirement than a need. So, they are all worried about energy security. And so we introduced this FlexPhase battery and we expect to convert entire Europe to the FlexPhase battery in 2025. So, that's the dynamics in Europe. And by the way, every emerging market will need 3-phase battery with backup. The U.S. is a little bit unique. We have single phase here. And so in the U.S. which we are very excited about, we are working on the fourth generation better. That fourth generation battery has got a much smaller footprint. The wall space is 60% smaller and we are able to do that because we are able to able to combine our power conversion, battery management into -- we're integrate and able to achieve a much smaller form factor. So, basically, we are very excited about that battery. And then another important development there is this battery will work along with the Meter Collar for backup in addition to a new combiner that will also release at the same time. So, originally, we had another component card system controller that's going away now replaced by a combination of the meter color and the combined, which is substantially cheaper. Basically, all the labor in installing the system controller goes away. Net-net, what happens, like I talked about, we reduced the installation cost by $300 per kilowatt hour, making both grid tide as well as backup systems easy to install within phase. And following up on that, we have achieved UL compliance on the Meter Collar. We are now working to gain the approval of the California utilities. We expect to pilot our energy systems in March of this quarter. And then we do expect to get strong traction from installers. We have done -- we have had multiple meetings with installers. We have introduced the battery. We have had excellent reception, and we look forward to ramping and growing the business continues.
Operator: Our next question comes from Phil Shen from ROTH Capital Partners. Please go ahead with your question.
Phil Shen: Everyone, thanks for taking my questions. I had a few follow-ups on the safe harbor, can you share with us if there was any safe harbor revenue in Q4? And then of the $50 million of safe harbor in Q1 and maybe $95 million total, how -- what's the split between micros and batteries? And then also, can you share who the $95 million safe harbor is with, if you can't share the name, just directionally, what kind of player and so forth? Thank you.
Badri Kothandaraman: Yes. We are not going to share any customer names. The safe harbor is mostly on microinverters and then the answer in Q4 is there is -- we define deliberately this time safe harbor as essentially what we expect will be installed over one year timeframe. There are a few small deals that are run rate deals that will that will get consumed in one to two quarters. That happened at a much smaller rate. We do not consider them safe harbor. They are usual run rate business. The $95 million is what we are considering safe harbor, and you should think about that as $12 million of core revenue third quarter.
Phil Shen: Okay, got it. Thank you. And then in terms of -- on a go-forward basis, I think Brian was talking about how sequentially Q2 could be up single digit -- high single-digits quarter-over-quarter in terms of growth for revenue. Can you – don’t want to get to maybe $1.5 billion of revenue for the year, do you think you can hit $400 million per quarter run rate, maybe in the back half of the year? I know you don't provide official guidance, but I wanted to just get a feel for what the cadence might be for the rest of the year. And then shifting to tariffs for just a moment. We've learned a lot about this anode AD/VCD, there could be 850% type tariffs on the anode part of the battery. To what degree are you guys preparing for that? And how can you deal with it overall, given that retroactive tariffs could become effective sometime this month? Thank you.
Badri Kothandaraman: Yes. We don't provide guidance for the second quarter or the rest of the year. But I'm extremely excited by both our progress on new products. We are introducing a whole area of new products. You saw in Q4, we introduced the new EV charger into a $1.4 billion served available market. We introduced our IQ portable energy system which we plan to extend in other places. January, we introduced the FlexPhase battery, that is the three-phase battery with battery with backup -- smallest AC cupboard three-phase backup. We are making excellent progress on our fourth-generation battery like what I just now answered. The Meter Collar has passed UL [ph] compliance. We are looking forward and to start piloting that product. And then I did mention about IQ9. IQ9, we are also very excited. The IQ9 will provide more power, 10% more power for approximately similar cost. And the early results are looking quite good. We expect to finalize our design in the first quarter, and we expect to start doing verification and release that product. So, I do expect to grow throughout the year because we are introducing a lot of new products. We are diversifying IQ9, for example, will allow us to participate in the 480-volt market, which we haven't participated till now. We are only participating in the 208-volt world market. So, GaN allows us to do all of those. We expect to introduce that product later in the second half of 2025. So let me stop there. Raghu will answer the question on anode ADCBD.
Raghu Belur: Yes. So with regards to anode ADCD, obviously, it is something that's very new. We are tracking it closely. It's still an investigation. And there are still a lot of unknowns with regards to whether it is the anode material being imported in that gets the tariff or will the entire sell or sell back at the tariff. In general, our plan is from a supply chain point of view is to have geographic diversity, which we have done on the microinverter side and as well as we're prepared to do that on the battery side. So all of these things, given the tariff issues, the ADC issues, et cetera, we're being very proactive, which we have already started in diversifying the supply chain.
Operator: Our next question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith from Jefferies. Please go ahead with your question.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Hey. Good afternoon, team. Thank you guys very much. Appreciate the time. Maybe just following-up on the last viewer's questions. I know it a little bit early to guide shall we say. But obviously, you've got a number of tailwinds here when you think about the IQ9 coming in the back half, also fourth gen introduction. In theory, you guys have alluded to potentially higher margins, maybe 60% of these new products, 45% of fourth gen maybe or upwards of. I mean, as you think about those products leading into the back half of the year, can we expect a margin uptick? I noticed obviously in 1Q here, there's a little bit of a downtick here versus what you guys just put up. Is there a mix dynamic in 1Q? And really, as you think about the back half of the year, as those new products roll in, are there any offsets that you would otherwise see? And then related, is there a pricing dynamic that we should be watching as it pertains to the updated IRS cost allocation tables for MLPs, right? I know that dropped here from 36% to 25% of late. Does that change anything in the pricing and up-pricing potential we might have seen earlier? And could that be a headwind itself? Or conversely, could maybe the dynamics around Powerwall 3 and the separation between the solar qualification versus the battery piece helped drive incremental sales and stabilize backdrop a little bit. Sorry, a lot in there, but I wanted to squeeze it all in.
Badri Kothandaraman: Yes. Our pricing strategy is quite simple. We price on value added with respect to competition. We also have a very robust world-class cost program. So, I keep getting this question all the time in the last six years. My answers are the same. We have a pricing team. We have a cost team. We make excellent progress on both. And we basically -- if we need to drop price on batteries, because we don't add that much value, we will, at the same time, we work on cost reduction opportunities. And the results prove that today, we are at a non-GAAP gross margin without the IRA benefit, we are reporting approximately 39.7%. The number for Q1, the guidance we gave is between 38% and 41%, you should just interpret that as regular product mix that is fluctuating. So our numbers will fluctuate. Do I expect us to get better? I do expect us to get better in general. I do expect us to improve. For example, IQ9 brings in a lot of tricks with gallium nitride. We are able to go from four silicon fabs to two gallium nitride fabs. And because we are using what is called as a bidirectional switch instead of four unidirectional switches, we will now use two bidirectional switches. Therefore, there is some intrinsic cost reduction. We expect to be running those FETs at a frequency that is greater than 100 kilohertz in the future. And when you run those FETs at a greater than 100 kilohertz in the future, you longer need a big transformer. For example, if you are able to run them at 10 times higher frequency, from 100 kilohertz, if you're able to run at 1 megahertz, you should be able to get a transformer reduction by 1 over route 3, which is a 66% reduction in the transformer size. While we are not there, our -- I mean, we call that as internally as moonshot so that we can gain that benefit and give customers ultra small inverters, we are extreme -- which are extremely cost competitive. So it will help both customers as well as us in terms of gross margin. On the fourth-generation battery, we have excellent levels of integration. and that is about to come in imminently. On the fifth-generation battery, which we are working on, we expect to release our fifth-generation, I haven't talked about it too much, but we are always working on N and N+1. So, our fifth-generation battery will come out in Q1 2026, one year from today. And that also has got a drastic cost reduction associated with it. I'll give you more highlights on that in the next call on why. That will use prismatic cells. It's got an energy density that is 50% higher. We'll share more details. So, in general, we are making advances in our products that fundamentally improve the cost structure. So while we will price attractively price based on value that we add to the end customer, we expect our cost to get continuously better. And the combination of which will result in a steady uptick in gross margins for us.
Operator: Our next question comes from Colin Rusch from Oppenheimer. Please go ahead with your question.
Colin Rusch: Thanks so much guys. Just looking at some of the activity and payments from the treasury and some of the weather, can you just talk about how healthy the channel is right now? Are you seeing folks with any sort of liquidity issues? What are you looking at in terms of payables and some -- not payables or receivables and any sort of issues around some of those kind of medium-sized installers that you guys work with?
Badri Kothandaraman: Yes, I mean, look, we work with distributors. So most of our business goes through distributors who are reasonably healthy. And to tell you the truth, our receivables, the AR is in good shape. And it is in good shape in Q4 as compared to Q3. But if you ask me in the channel, you asked me a question, how is the health of the channel. While Enphase manages the channel inventory closely, I mean, installers do -- are having a difficult time. There is no question. There is no question that installers are having a difficult time. There is cash flow to installers is always a problem, right? And now the business has moved predominantly from loan to lease. There are a lot of new players coming. There are established players, of course, so installers robustness, cash flow is always an issue. And what is going to change that? And some of that is probably welcome for the industry because then it weeds out the weak players and then the industry generally becomes stronger. But what the industry needs in order to improve steadily in 2025 is improved quality, improved service better and more stable financing options. They're all required. So I won't sugarcoat it that everything is okay. It is the stretched time -- Bright spots are in California, things are stabilized. I'll talk about the L.A. fires briefly as well. A lot of questions on whether the L.A. Fires is causing a problem, causing a disruption. Of course, it is unfortunate project. However, the L.A. Fires probably caused a disruption for a couple of weeks. But now we find that the activity is back in full flow in that region. There were about 10-plus ZIP codes that were affected and face homes in those regions, about 500 homes with Enphase solar and storage were damaged. But overall, those zip codes only had a couple of thousand homes. So limited exposure, and those are in the process of rebuilding. The installers had that problem. But in general, California has, I would say, bounced back from before. I don't find installers saying I don't know how to sell NEM 3.0. On the contrary, they are getting more confident, they know how to sell NEM 3.0. Outside California, it's still tough because the economics in many places are there due to low utility rates, the economics aren't -- I mean are weak. The East Coast is doing relatively well, again, due to high utility rates. So now, let me stop in that.
Colin Rusch: Thanks so much. And just as you transition to the IQ9 and changed some of the componentry, can you talk a little bit about any sort of issues around tariffs and any sort of supply chain elements that you have to navigate here are at risk as you start looking at production of the new product?
Badri Kothandaraman: Yes. Look, I mean, the phenomenal thing our team has done -- our operations team has done is -- we don't expect any impact on tariffs for Microinverters. Because overtime, we have diversified the supply chain so much. We are manufacturing now in the U.S. We are manufacturing in China, India. So you could ask us saying how about the raw materials that comes in from China into the U.S. I mean, we have we have reduced that exposure to very limited. So basically, there, diversified the entire supplier base that it is a non-issue. And I expect it to be a non-issue for IQ9 as well. If your question is about GaN and GaN -- the gallium nitride, that's also a non-issue. Our suppliers our supplier, the dominant supplier that we will use is based in Europe and another supplier based in North America as well as Japan. So our exposure is limited. And in fact, I would say we are not worried about it for IQ9.
Operator: Our next question comes from Andrew Percoco from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead with your question.
Andrew Percoco: Great. Thanks so much for taking my question. Maybe just switching gears a little bit, Badri, you sound pretty confident in terms of the outlook for the industry and your business overall. I'm just curious, just given your balance sheet position, given where the stock is, is there an opportunity to maybe lean into buybacks more heavily or capital return more heavily just given maybe a dislocation in what you view the intrinsic value of the stock and where the stock is trading and just given the balance sheet and the outlook for the business that you've kind of portrayed over the balance of this call?
Badri Kothandaraman: Right. I've articulated our strategy there before. Let me tell you that again, we first -- we take care of the needs of the business, number one. We ensured that all of the capital needs for the business taken care, whether if we want to buy something for manufacturing batteries in the U.S. manufacturing microinverters in the U.S., increasing capacity, diversifying with one more contract manufactured buying test capacity, all of those that's our first choice or buying in new pieces of software make the company run better. So that's our first priority. If we have enough left over left over from there, we look for M&A opportunities, M&A opportunities that increase the total value of the company. What kind of opportunities are out there new technology on batteries, new technology on home energy management, maybe looking more into the commercial front, small commercial, where I think we could use some. So, we look at that. And many of them -- I mean, we'll -- over time, we become allergic to big acquisitions. We'd like to do small teams, bolt-on acquisitions is what we would like to do. And then once these two are taken care of, as long as the share price is below a conservatively estimated intrinsic value, then we buy stock. So, last quarter, you'll be happy to note that we bought close to 2.8 million shares. We thought it's a good use. So we spent about $200 million in cash buyback. In the past, we had done up to $100 million per quarter. And so we plan to do that with the guidance from our board. We plan to have the same strategy. And if we believe the share prices are undervalued, which we think they are, and you can expect similar action from us going forward.
Operator: Our next question comes from Christine Cho from Barclays. Please go ahead with your question.
Christine Cho: Good evening. Thank you for taking my question. You talk about piloting with the California utilities for the Meter Collar. I think I have heard that the back and forth between Tesla and the utilities had taken some time for their meter collar. And maybe it's just going to be longer because they were first. But how long are you expecting your pilot to take? And then I'm sure you need their approval, but can you just walk through what other steps are needed before you can start selling them and the expected time line?
Raghu Belur: Sure. There is a prescribed time line that is proposed by the Public Utilities Commission. Of course, I mean, I will not comment about anything that happened before. Our experience thus far has been generally very positive. We have -- they've been very engaged with us. They've been -- you have to get through all your certification first. So, first and foremost, if we get through the primary UL certification, which we completed, and that in and of itself is a pretty big deal. Once you're through that, they have additional tests that they want to do, both at the Meter Collar level, which is a unit level, as well as the system level. And that's the process that we are in. There's a lot of discussion that happens with their engineering teams in order us to explain to them how the whole -- how the device works as well as how the entire system works. And then we go through systemic testing with them. Each utility is slightly different than the other so we are working with all three of the IOUs simultaneously and get at different stages of testing. That's about what I can say thus far. But our experience has been, thus far, quite positive.
Christine Cho: Okay, great. And then just moving on to the safe harboring. The $95 million that you mentioned, was that mostly in response to the domestic content updates that came out last month and the desire to safe harbor under the old DC table since you only have like 90 days to do that? Or was it driven by everything going from Section 48 to 48e or something else? So, just any color there would be helpful.
Badri Kothandaraman: Yes, I think it was mostly a risk mitigation strategy overall. It could include domestic, it could include ITC, et cetera.
Operator: Our next question comes from Praneeth Satish from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead with your question.
Praneeth Satish: Thanks. Good evening. Just on the fourth generation battery, I think you previously indicated that the pilot would start in Q4. Now it looks like it's starting in Q1 or March. I guess what drove that slight shift in timing? And then how should we think about the time line for ramping battery sales? I guess at what point do you think you could see the next-gen battery cross over 50% of your battery mix? Could that happen in Q2 or Q3 of this year?
Badri Kothandaraman: Yes, I mean we always told you the first quarter. So, we are exactly there. We did not talk about Q4. So, now the next question is when do you think we will ramp and how much -- and when we will get to 50%? We expect, assuming the piloting goes well and we expect to start ramping in Q2. And typically, in our experience, it takes a couple of quarters for us to ramp to the 50% level and maybe one quarter more to 80% level. That's been our experience. This is a new product. So, there could be something more unique there, but this has been our experience.
Praneeth Satish: Okay, that’s helpful. And then the timing between your battery generation from what I can tell, kind of looking historically, it's been around three, four years. But now you're talking about a fifth generation battery just one year after the fourth generation launch. I guess what's driving this acceleration in your product development cycle? Are you seeing competitors iterate at the same speed. And if not, if you're releasing new generations of batteries faster than peers, then can we expect to see the gross margin just continue to climb at least on the battery side over the next two to three years?
Badri Kothandaraman: Yes. I mean, just for reference, we released our third-generation battery in June of 2023. So, we are talking about Q1, and that's approximately, let's say, 18 to 24 months. Now, -- and just for users to recollect, we launched our first-generation battery number one in 2020. That was -- we started shipping in Q3 of 2020. Within about 18 months, we launched the second generation. And then like what I said, the third generation in June of 2023. We have become better at doing these batteries. We have an expert team now which understands how to do this IP both hardware, software, app, and there is a lot of complications. Sometimes we fall flat, sometimes we miss our commitments, but we have generally gotten more confidence. So, our fifth generation battery, we like the one I said, is coming out in Q1 2026, that one we started working on over a year ago. It usually starts off in the CTO team. And then we do essentially technology feasibility, then a small team starts off and then we officially kick it off. So, it's not new. There is always overlap like what I said, we work on both -- and then plus one at any come time. So, that's why we think we will get on -- we will lock ourselves on to that timeframe, 12 to 18 months, you should expect from us is a steady cadence of batteries coming up.
Operator: Our next question comes from Mark Strouse from JPMorgan. Please go ahead with your question.
Mark Strouse: Great. Thanks for taking our questions. Helpful call. I just have one quick question remaining. When you look at the safe harbor activity that's in the 1Q and 2Q guide this year, and maybe even kind of your safe harbor activity pre IRA. Is there anything to call out as far as both gross and operating margins. Should we assume that those kind of align with corporate average or anything that we should be adjusting for in our model? Thank you.
Badri Kothandaraman: No, you should just be assuming they are at our usual gross margins.
Mark Strouse: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Kashy Harrison from Piper Sandler. Please go ahead with your question.
Kashy Harrison: Good afternoon and thanks for taking the questions. I just want to go back to the original questions earlier in the call, just to make sure we're all on 100% the same page. So, you mentioned $95 million of safe harbor that you booked at in 4Q. You highlighted $50 million in 1Q. So should we expect the rest of the $45 million to roll over in 2Q? Or are you saying that there's some other dynamic we need to be thinking about?
Badri Kothandaraman: No, you're right, it will roll over into Q2.
Kashy Harrison: Okay. Thank you. And then just one follow-up on the domestic content front. Can you speak to the net -- what you think the net cost of your system is now that you could theoretically qualify for both the solar and store side and how that would compare to the net cost of say, a power wall 3P rather quick, that my might qualify on the storage side, but not the solar side. I'm trying to see if today on a net basis for backup, you would be cheaper or because of the domestic content benefit or you would still need the fourth-gen to get to that point on where you're cheaper? Thank you.
Badri Kothandaraman: We do qualify today our domestic content is well more than 40% on batteries today. So we do qualify already. We are making those batteries in Texas. We shipped 6.7 megawatt hours of batteries in Q4. We expect to ship a lot more in Q1.
Operator: Our next question comes from Joseph Osha from Guggenheim. Please go ahead with your question.
Joseph Osha: Thank you. Just one question for me as it relates to the return of capital. I'm curious if all you have contemplated simply just making a commitment to repurchase a certain amount of stock per year regardless of the level as opposed to some timing activity you've been engaged? And wouldn't that make more sense?
Badri Kothandaraman: No. I think I told you our strategy is very simple, very clear. First, take care of the needs of the business, take care of M&As and then if money is left, we look at buying a conservative amount below the intrinsic value.
Joseph Osha: Okay. So perhaps I misspoke. Obviously, you need to take care of the business first…
Badri Kothandaraman: We did that exactly and if you saw, we did about $200 million of buyback in Q4, we've been very steady in the past quarters in 2024, we did approximately up to $100 million every quarter. And we plan to execute a similar strategy with the approval of our Board in 2025.
Joseph Osha: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Maheep Mandloi from Mizuho. Please go ahead with your question.
Maheep Mandloi: Thanks for taking the question. Just on the safe harbor, as part of your pick on that, but do you hear the safe harbor is financed to third-parties or directly to the companies or [indiscernible]? And secondly just wondering on European gross margin, it looks like European gross margin slightly lower than U.S. gross margin?
Badri Kothandaraman: We could not hear that question well. But if you're asking about customer details, we aren't going to be talking about customer details there.
Maheep Mandloi: Got it. No, the second part was just on the European gross margins versus the U.S. gross margins.
Badri Kothandaraman: Yes. In the past, I've clarified it, the European gross margins are at similar levels as the U.S. gross margin and pricing strategy is the same. Our prices are also approximately the same list prices with distributors. So we don't see any difference.
Operator: Our next question comes from Dylan Nassano from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead with your question.
Dylan Nassano: Yes, hi. Thanks for taking my question. Can you just talk a little bit about what kind of trends you might be seeing with market share across battery markets, solar-only markets and then specifically within the TPO players?
Badri Kothandaraman: We don't really comment about market share. But in general, what we can say is that, especially as you look at the Gen-4 product that's coming out. It's the generation four product is not just the battery to be very clear. It is the battery, it's the new combiner, which has a whole host of new capabilities. It's got a substantial amount of integration that as we talked about, the system controller that we had previously that was doing the actual -- what's called the microgrid interconnect device function. All of that has been significantly simplified. That is resulting in as much as $300 per kilowatt-hour reduction in cost to the installer it's a combination of both savings and labor by going to the Meter Collar as well as the savings in the product cost as well. So, just by moving to that new technology, you're seeing substantial amount of savings. So, what that allows us to do is be very competitive, not just in the grid-type case, which we were, which we have always been, even with the third generation system. Now, we are very, very competitive even with the backup scenario, while retaining all the benefits of the Enphase System, which is the reliability piece, the safety piece, the simplicity piece, and the performance piece. So, I think the next-generation product is going to make a big difference in terms of how we are -- how competitive we are even in the backup scenario.
Raghu Belur: And there are a few third-party reports if you are interested that if you want to take a look at our share, I would refer to those. And there are multiple of them and each of them having their way of looking at it. So, you should take a look at that.
Dylan Nassano: Great. Thank you. I'll take the rest offline.
Badri Kothandaraman: Thank you.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Gordon Johnson from GLJ [ph] Research. Please go ahead with your question.
Gordon Johnson: Hey guys. Thanks for taking my question. A lot of them have been answered. But I'm just looking at some of the specific data for the California solar initiative. And it shows Tesla Powerwall gaining significant share in the storage space and then also taking share in the inverter space. And I just wanted to know if you guys are still seeing those trends continue or you're taking share back from them? And then I have another question.
Badri Kothandaraman: Yes. Like what I said, we don't comment on competition. We are focused on making best-in-class products. We had talked about our battery being very popular for grid tide applications in California. With the fourth generation product, we will not only be best-in-class for cryptite [ph], we will also be best-in-class for backup. And that has been one of our limitations until now. And we are going to unleash or unblock that limitation very, very soon. So, we are excited there. Our batteries are modular batteries, so you don't need to buy 13 or a 26-kilowatt hour, you hour, you can buy 15-kilowatt can buy 20. So, ours is a modular solution. And it will be very cost-effective. Now, coming on the micro side, I talked about it extensively in prior calls, the value proposition of our microinverters are superior power production, shading -- it all comps, meaning shading usually can cause a power production that is dramatically lesser microinverters optimize at the per panel level and therefore, able to really maximize the energy production and then single point of failure, a 25-year warranty versus warranty versus a 10-year warranty from competition. By the way, on batteries, we do 15-year a 10-year warranty from competition. Service ability is a big deal. When you have a monolithic structure in the battery and you have to replace your entire battery. It's tough to do that. It is -- it results in weeks and months of nonperformance for the homeowner. Ours comes with serviceability. I'm proud to say 95% of the issues in our battery systems can be solved in situ. In situ means our field service goes and he just replaces a $40 board instead of taking a $5,000 battery of the wall. And so we have numerous advantages in terms of modularity, simplicity, warranty, safety and serviceability. And then the other two things which I talked about, which are not to be discounted the ones we introduced in Q4, we produced something called as a Busbar PCS, Busbar Power Control Software. Busbar Power Control Software helps in eliminating main panel upgrades, 95% of the time. And so our installers are very happy with that. They are starting to use that for every design and it maximizes the ability or it maximizes the size of the solar plus storage system. Similarly, one more thing that we introduced another big deal is as users they have higher consumption, because they bought an EV or something. They want to expand their legacy systems. We basically provide them a very simple solution once again with power control software. Our Enphase power control software enables you to do expansion without losing the benefits of your legacy system. So we introduced that also in the fourth quarter. So lot of benefits working with Enphase, most important, we will take care of our installers. And if there is any shortage supply shortage, they can call us to take care of them.
Operator: Our next question comes from Austin Moeller from Canaccord. Please go ahead with your question.
Austin Moeller: Hi. Good afternoon. So just my first question here, in Europe, the data that we've collected on electricity rate shows the key markets like France and Germany are still relatively stable. Where do you see electricity rates in Europe needing to go to catalyze the demand recovery there?
Badri Kothandaraman: Yes. Maybe you check your data February 1st in France, electricity rates came down by 15% -- February 1st. So that is going to create a headwind for some time. However, that market is a very attractive market meaning, only very limited solar penetration so far. Lots of EV penetration beginning to happen, feed-in tariff in France is becoming lesser and lesser. So it's an opportunity for where we excel, which is which is solar, plus batteries, plus our EV charges, plus home energy management. In home energy management, hot water heaters are a big part of the equation. We are going to be introducing green heating option, when you have a small feed in tariff, you don't want to export any solar back to the grid you want to utilize every ounce of solar. And therefore, we divert, we steer the excess solar onto the hot water heater and increase the self-consumption. So, we are working on introducing comprehensive home energy management solutions to every country across Europe because that's how we see the market evolution, net metering while everybody has enjoyed net metering for a while, the practical reality is it will go away some time or the other. And we can come to the rescue, still save money for homeowners with solar, with battery, with EV chargers, with home energy management and that's how I predict market will evolve. It may not evolve the immediate future, but that's where the trends are going.
Austin Moeller: Great. And just a follow-up. In line with your discussion of a shortage of power in the near-term, do you think that there could be a demand for solar plus battery in states like Texas or Tennessee where they have an electricity cost of $0.15, $0.14 per kilowatt hour purely because there's a large number of data centers geo located there?
Raghu Belur: Of course, right, as we have talked about the demand environment has not changed for demand. So energy has not changed. There is both front of the meter demand due to data centers. But there is substantial demand behind the meter as well as people are electrifying with the combination of EV chargers and heat pumps. When you mention a state like Texas as well as for that matter, even in Europe, those are deregulated markets. One of the big advantages of a solar plus battery system or solar plus battery plus charger system is for these distributed energy resources to participate in markets. So, if you think about a day ahead market, for example, if you have a really smart AI-based energy management system like what we do, we can be very intelligent about when to discharge the battery, when to discharge the battery, when to charge your EV, when to buy it from the grid, when to sell to the grid and we can generate substantial amount of savings as well as in the case of revenue for the homeowner. So you're seeing that as a pretty significant play in a number of countries in Europe as well as in places like Texas.
Austin Moeller: Excellent. Thanks for all the detail.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jeffrey Osborne from TD Cowen. Please go ahead with your question.
Jeffrey Osborne: Thank you. Just two quick ones, Badri. I was wondering that I think in Q4, there was 1.7 million microinverters that received a 45x credit and then you guided to $1.2 billion, but the safe harbor is ramping in Q1. So did you get paid on production? And then not on sell-through. I'm just trying to understand what's going on with the manufacturing credit, in particular, and the seasonality between Q4 and Q1.
Badri Kothandaraman: Yes. I mean, look, our folks are a little – as usually a little conservative when we give you this. Also, the necessity to balance manufacturing across worldwide comes into play. When we say 1.2%, mean 1.2% is from the U.S. facility. That means the balance is covered by elsewhere, such as India. Of course, there is a desire to maximize profit dollars, but we have to be cautious because we need to be running balanced global manufacturing. That's why.
Jeffrey Osborne: Is there any downtime in Q1 or anything? Or I'd imagine that would ramp up through the year? No?
Badri Kothandaraman: No. I mean that number will fluctuate depending on how we are able to load and how we are able to provide best-in-class service to customers. For example, Sometimes, we find that for short lead time orders, making it in our India factory and shipping it to Europe provides best results. And we just cannot idle factories and expect them to start back up later. So, best practice is that you should view Q4 as little more upside, and then you should view Q1 as conservative.
Jeffrey Osborne: Got it. And the last question I had is, I think Mandy mentioned $110 million of prepayments in Q4, but the safe harboring was for $95 million. What are the other types of products that you receive prepayments for?
Badri Kothandaraman: Well, in general, we do have prepaid customer prepayments depending on their credit terms. But however, in this case, there were some customers who did want to place small amounts of orders so that they can secure secured their capacity. And those we view as the run rate business to be consumed in the next one to two quarters. So that makes up for the balance.
Jeffrey Osborne: Maybe the $15 million could be consumed in less than the eight quarters, but maybe some of your peers might categorize that as safe harboring or at least under the letter of the law, given the cash change stance and prior to the year, is that the right way to think about it?
Badri Kothandaraman: It's possible, and we expect not -- I mean, we expect less than two quarters.
Jeffrey Osborne: Got it. Thank you. That’s all I have.
Operator: And ladies and gentlemen, at this time, we'll be ending today's question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the floor back over to Badri Kothandaraman for any closing remarks.
Badri Kothandaraman: Thank you for joining us today and for your continued support of Enphase. We look forward to speaking with you again next quarter. Bye.
Operator: And with that, ladies and gentlemen, we'll conclude today's conference call. We do thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines.

===== 2024 Q3  (2024-10-22 16:30:00) =====
Operator: Good day, and welcome to the Enphase Energy’s Third Quarter 2024 Financial Results Conference Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Zach Freedman. Please go ahead.
Zach Freedman : Good afternoon and thank you for joining us on today's conference call to discuss Enphase Energy's third quarter 2024 results. On today's call are Badri Kothandaraman, our President and Chief Executive Officer; Mandy Yang, our Chief Financial Officer; and Raghu Belur, our Chief Products Officer. After the market closed today, Enphase issued a press release announcing the results for its third quarter ended September 30, 2024. During this conference call, Enphase management will make forward-looking statements including, but not limited to, statements related to our expected future financial performance, market trends, the capabilities of our technology and products, and the benefits to homeowners and installers, our operations including manufacturing, customer service, and supply and demand, anticipated growth in existing and new markets, the timing of new product introductions, and regulatory and tax matters. These forward-looking statements involve significant risks and uncertainties and our actual results in the timing of events could differ materially from these expectations. For a more complete discussion of the risks and uncertainties, please see our most recent Form 10-K and 10-Qs filed with the SEC. We caution you not to place any undue reliance on forward-looking statements and undertake no duty or obligation to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future events, or changes in expectations. Also, please note that financial measures used on this call are expressed on a non-GAAP basis unless otherwise noted and have been adjusted to exclude certain charges. We have provided a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures in our earnings release furnished with the SEC on Form 8-K, which can also be found in the Investor Relations section of our website. Now I'd like to introduce Badri Kothandaraman, our President and Chief Executive Officer. Badri?
Badri Kothandaraman : Good afternoon and thanks for joining us today to discuss our third quarter 2024 financial results. We reported a quarterly revenue of $380.9 million, shipped approximately 1.7 million microinverters and 172.9 megawatt hours of batteries. And generated free cash flow of $161.6 million. Our overall channel inventory remained normal as we exited Q3. For the third quarter, we delivered 48% gross margin, 21% operating expense, and 27% operating income, all as a percentage of revenue on a non-GAAP basis and including net IRA benefit. Mandy will go into our financials later in the call. Let's discuss customer service. Our worldwide Net Promoter Score was 78% in Q3, slightly down from 79% in Q2. Our average call wait times increased to 4.4 minutes from 2.5 minutes, partially due to higher call volumes from disruptions in the installer landscape. We are actively managing this while rolling out software fixes and automation to reduce weak times. Let's talk about operations. Our global capacity is around 7.25 million microinverters per quarter, with 5 million in the US. In Q3, we shipped approximately 1.2 million microinverters from our US Contract manufacturing facilities, booking 45X production tax credits. We anticipate shipping 1.3 million units from our US facilities in Q4. We also introduced a higher domestic content SKU for IQ8HC microinverters to help lease/PPA, and commercial asset owners to qualify for a 10% domestic content ITC adder. This translates to about $0.40 per watt in savings for them. We are seeing strong traction in the lease and PPA markets for this product. We expect to begin shipping, our commercial IQ8P-3P microinverters, as well as our residential IQ8X microinverters, also from our US contract manufacturing facilities, featuring higher domestic content, starting this quarter. Our cell pack suppliers in China have enough capacity to support our plans for batteries in 2024 and 2025. We are on track to producing the battery at our US contract manufacturing facility in this quarter using domestically made inverters, battery management systems, and packaging while continuing to source cell packs from China. Let's now cover the region. Our US and international revenue mix for Q3 was 75% and 25% respectively. For more visibility into our business, we will be providing regional breakdowns for Q3. In the US, our revenue increased 43% compared to Q2. The overall sell-through of our products in the US was up 6% across all channels in Q3 compared to Q2. This increase was despite a large US customer declaring bankruptcy in Q3. Our distributor sell through in the US was up 13% compared to Q2, which reflects improving market fundamentals in the US. In California, our distributor sell-through was also up 13% in Q3 compared to Q2. In Q3, we saw healthy growth for both microinverters and batteries in California. NEM 3.0 now represents approximately 65% of California installs, and the attach rate of our own batteries continues to be close to 50%. In non-California states, our distributor sell-through was up 14% in Q3 compared to Q2. Looking ahead, we see lower interest rates, ITC adders, and higher power prices as the key drivers for 2025 growth. In Europe, our revenue was down 15% compared to Q2. The overall sell-through of our products in Europe was a little more down, 34% down in Q3 compared to Q2. While every country in Europe has its nuances, the overall business environment in the region is challenging. Power prices have declined from the early 2023-highs. The economic growth is slow and the consumer confidence is limited. We are focused on what we can control. We are focused on building and strengthening relationships with installers. We are focused on launching many new products, expanding into a lot of new markets as we believe we are under-penetrated, as well as collaborating closely with our distribution partners. We believe this will position us well for significant growth when the cycle rebounds. I'll provide some additional color on our key markets in Europe, the Netherlands, France, and Germany. In the Netherlands, the solar market is transitioning away from solar-only systems due to regulatory uncertainty around NEM, which is about to expire in early 2027, and export penalties imposed by the energy providers. These issues have increased the adoption of batteries which avoids export penalties and allows participation of residential solar plus battery systems in energy markets. While this transition is still in its early stages, we are strongly -- we are encouraged by a strong engagement with the country's energy providers. We are well-positioned to lead the market recovery in Netherlands with our microinverters, along with batteries, along with our upcoming new EV chargers, as well as AI-powered IQ energy management software, which is crucial to maximize savings and improve homeowner ROI. In France, our Q3 was impacted by summer seasonality. We expect a cooling-off period for solar demand in the country, driven by expected utility rate cuts in early 2025. Overall, France remains a key growth market for us given our market leadership there, as well as the country's low solar penetration. We plan to introduce many new products for France, mainly the new EV charger, batteries with backup, and energy management for hot water heaters. In Germany, we are excited about a few upcoming product launches that are imminent. These will expand our reach in Europe's largest solar market. Our three-phase battery backup solution for Germany, Austria, and Switzerland, which was unveiled in Intersolar Munich in June, has received highly positive feedback. Our IQ Balcony Solar is nearing launch. We are targeting a 400 megawatt market with this product and believe that Enphase microinverters are ideally suited for these very small systems. Additionally, we plan to launch the new IQ EV charger into Germany in Q4. A bright spot in Europe has been UK, where the sell-through was up approximately 80% compared to Q2. However, we are still under-penetrated in this market and have a lot more room to grow. There are similar countries in Europe, including Italy, Spain, Belgium, Luxembourg, Austria, Switzerland, Sweden, Denmark, and more. While each country faces its own unique challenges and opportunities, homeowners are increasingly prioritizing safety, reliability, quality, savings, and a seamless all-in-one app experience for their home energy systems which perfectly aligns with our core strength. We plan to introduce our entire product portfolio, the IQ8 series of microinverters, both single and three-phase batteries with backup, the new IQ EV chargers which I talked about, AI-powered IQ energy management software which I'll elaborate later, as well as the Solargraf installer platform across many more European countries. We continue to make incremental progress in other regions in the world. Our IQ8P and IQ8HC microinverters are ramping well in India. We are now taking pre-orders for the battery in India, with shipments to installers to begin in December. In Brazil, we are ramping on the 480 watts IQ8P microinverters into this emerging residential market in order to support newer, higher power panels. In Australia, we recently started shipping IQ8X microinverters for higher DC input voltage panels and now offer 25 year limited warranty as default for all IQ8 microinverters and this is currently the longest standard residential warranty in the Australian market. Let's come to our Q4 guidance. We are guiding revenue in the range of $360 million to $400 million. We anticipate incremental improvement in our US business and a continued slowdown in Europe in Q4. We are approximately 85% booked to the midpoint of our overall revenue guidance very similar to last quarter. We expect to ship between 140 to 160 megawatt hours of IQ batteries in Q4. Our battery sell-through is doing well. It continues to increase and we expect Q4 to reflect a slight uptick in demand. The reduced battery shipments in Q4 compared to Q3 is primarily due to channel restocking in Q3 that will not repeat in Q4. Before we talk about new products, let's discuss the evolution in our industry away from single hardware components and towards total energy systems. In many countries around the world, solar-only is no longer enough. Our Enphase systems are now composed of IQ microinverters, IQ batteries, EV chargers, and increasingly sophisticated IQ energy management software to manage multiple use cases including rate arbitrage, grid resilience, VPP participation, wholesale market participation and more. All parts of the system must be best-in-class with software that ties it all seamlessly together in order to win. We believe our current and future products uniquely position us to win in this total system solution focused markets. Let's talk about IQ Batteries. Our third generation IQ Battery 5Ps, continuing to be very well received by the market. It offers an industry leading 15 year warranty, with differentiated quality, serviceability, modularity and power capability. We are on track to pilot our fourth-generation battery in the US, in the fourth quarter and begin production in early 2025. We believe this new battery will be a game changer for us. The battery takes up 60% lesser wall space, due to its integrated battery management and power conversion architecture. In addition, the fourth generation IQ Battery, will be paired with our new IQ meter collar, and enhanced IQ combiner. The battery system will reduce installed cost by approximately $300 per kilowatt hour, for a typical system with backup, making us highly competitive for all use cases. We have expanded the IQ microinverter family into 51 countries and plan for more by the end of the year. We are particularly excited about Japan where we expect to launch our IQ8HC microinverters in early 2025, targeting a 1.3 gigawatt market. The Tokyo Metropolitan Government has offered subsidies for MLPE products, making it very attractive for consumers. Japan solar market especially Tokyo, with its small system sizes of 2 kilowatts to 3 kilowatts, complex roofs and demand for quality, aligns well with our strengths. Let's talk about our commercial microinverter, IQ8P. The IQ8P with its new three-phase cabling system is perfect for small commercial solar installations between 20 kilowatts and 200 kilowatts. We have over 380 sites in the US, with an average size of 50 kilowatts and the feedback so far has been quite positive. These three-phase microinverters will soon ship from the US Factories with increased domestic content offering a 10% ITC adder, for commercial asset owners which should drive demand up even further. Let me provide an update on our IQ9 microinverters powered by Gallium Nitride Technology. The IQ9 family is designed to handle higher DC input currents up to 18 amperes and supports elevated AC grid voltages, including 480 volts for the small commercial market. IQ9 is expected to come in two power variants, 427 watts and 548 watts, offering flexibility and performance. We are on track for a launch in the second half of 2025, positioning us to meet growing market demands. Let's dive into EV charging. We are gearing up to launch our second-generation IQ EV charger across several European countries in Q4, tapping into a $1.4 billion annual market. With up to 22 kilowatts, three-phase charging. The charger integrates well with Enphase solar and battery systems, enabling homeowners to minimize electricity costs by using excess solar energy. Key features of this new IQ EV charger include dynamic phase switching and 1 ampere current control, which results in much more efficient green charging, ISO 15118 support for AC bidirectional charging in the future, and compatibility with MID meter in Germany, as well as compatibility with OCPP 2.0.1 software for third-party control, making it a very comprehensive and future ready solution. Let's cover software. Our IQ Energy Management Software supports grid services programs, VPPs, in regulated markets like the US, and energy market participation in deregulated markets like Europe and Australia. In the US, we are active in around 25 programs across key states in California, Massachusetts, Texas, and North Carolina, with more than 10,000 customers and 120 megawatt hours of battery capacity enrolled. These programs enable homeowners to discharge batteries during peak demand, supporting the utilities in times of need. In deregulated markets our software enables homeowners to earn up to $1,500 annually through energy providers. As electricity rates become more complex, our AI-powered software differentiates us, maximizing ROI and reducing payback period. Let's discuss Solargraf, our installer platform. We've added new features to Solargraf in Q3, including an updated battery design tool, as well as a do-it-yourself permit plan set for US customers. Solargraf is now available to both residential and commercial installers in the US, Canada, Brazil, Germany, Austria, and Netherlands with plans to expand to more countries in the coming quarters. Let me conclude. We have worked diligently to manage and [phase through] (ph) an industry slowdown. The midpoint of our revenue guidance for Q4 is flat with respect to Q3, and is a 44% increase from our revenue bottom of $263 million earlier in Q1 2024. We expect Q4 to also be impacted by the same large US customer due to its bankruptcy, but we believe a substantial portion of this revenue will return through our distribution channels in future periods. We generated approximately $321 million in free cash flow for the first nine months of 2024, and have maintained strong gross margins throughout the downturn. Over the last year, we have expanded our global footprint in microinverters and batteries, and are developing a strong pipeline of innovative products that are nearing launch. Our three-phase battery, IQ Balcony Solar, and the new IQ EV charger for Europe, are set to expand our served available market by $4 billion. Our upcoming fourth generation battery system featuring the IQ meter collar and enhanced combiner is expected to significantly reduce installation costs for backup. Our GaN-powered IQ9 microinverters will enable us to enter new three-phase commercial markets which are incremental for us while boosting power and lowering costs in the residential markets. We are also excited to advance our AI-powered energy management software in collaboration with retail energy providers in the Netherlands, as well as cater to complex energy markets around the world. Looking ahead to 2025, we see improving US market fundamentals driven by lower interest rates, ITC adders, and higher power prices in key markets that are expected to drive nice growth. Our best-in-class microinverters coupled with our next generation battery system should allow us to defend and grow our market share in the US. Internationally we believe we are well positioned for growth when the solar market stabilizes due to our broadened geographic reach and product portfolio. We remain committed to delivering best-in-class solutions and are energized by the road ahead. With that, I will turn the call over to Mandy for her review of our financial results. Mandy?
Mandy Yang : Thanks, Badri, and good afternoon, everyone. I will provide more details related to our third quarter of 2024 financial results, as well as our business outlook for the fourth quarter of 2024. We have provided reconciliations of this non-GAAP to GAAP financial measures in our earnings release posted today, which can also be found in the IR section of our website. Total Revenue for Q3 was $380.9 million. We shipped approximately 730 megawatts DC of microinverters and 172.9 megawatt hours of IQ Batteries in the quarter. Non-GAAP gross margin for Q3 was 48.1% compared to 47.1% in Q2. GAAP gross margin was 46.8% for Q3. Non-GAAP growth margin without net IRA benefit for Q3 was 38.9% compared to 41% in Q2. Our GAAP and non-GAAP gross margin was negatively impacted by a one-time 3.3 percentage point charge related to cost of goods sold on batteries. Non-GAAP gross margin for Q3 included $35.2 million of net IRA benefits. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $81.6 million for Q3, compared to $81.7 million for Q2. We continue to invest in new products, customer service, and geographic expansion. GAAP operating expenses were $128.4 million for Q3, compared to $135.4 million for Q2, GAAP operating expenses for Q3 included $43 million of stock-based compensation expenses, $3.1 million of amortization for acquired intangible assets and $677,000 of restructuring-related expenses. On a non-GAAP basis, income from operations for Q3 was $101.4 million, compared to $61.1 million for Q2. On a GAAP basis, income from operations was $49.8 million for Q3 compared to $1.8 million for Q2. On a non-GAAP basis, net income for Q3 was $88.4 million compared to $58.8 million for Q2. This resulted in non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.65 for Q3 compared to $0.43 for Q2. GAAP net income for Q3 was $45.8 million compared to $10.8 million for Q2. This resulted in GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.33 for Q3 compared to $0.08 for Q2. Both our non-GAAP and GAAP diluted earnings per share for Q3 were negatively impacted by $0.09 per share net of tax, related to impairment of an investment in a private company. We exited Q3 with a total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balance of $1.77 billion compared to $1.65 billion at the end of Q2. As part of our $1 billion share repurchase program authorized by our Board of Directors in July 2023, we repurchased 434,947 shares of our common stock in Q3 at an average price of $114.48 a share for a total of approximately $49.8 million. We had [$598.3 million] (ph) remaining for further share repurchases. In addition, we spent approximately $6.3 million by withholding shares to cover taxes for employee stock vesting and options in Q3, that reduced the diluted shares by 59,607 shares. We expect to continue this anti-dilution plan. In Q3, we generated $170.1 million in cash flow from operations and $161.6 million in free cash flow, due to our strong working capital management. Capital expenditure was $8.5 million for Q3 compared to $9.6 million for Q2. Now let's discuss our outlook for the fourth quarter of 2024. We expect our revenue for Q4 to be within a range of $360 million to $400 million, which includes shipments of 140-megawatt to 160-megawatt hours of IQ Batteries. We expect GAAP gross margin to be within the range of 47% to 50%. We expect non-GAAP gross margin to be within a range of 49% to 52% with net IRA benefit, and 39% to 42% before net IRA benefit. Non-GAAP gross margin excludes stock-based compensation expense and acquisition-related amortization. We expect the net IRA benefit to be between $38 million and $41 million of estimated shipments of 1.3 million units of our US microinverters in Q4. We expect our GAAP operating expenses to be within the range of $135 million to $139 million, including approximately $54 million estimated for stock-based compensation expense, acquisition related expenses and amortization. We expect our non-GAAP operating expenses to be within a range of $81 million to $85 million. We expect our GAAP and non-GAAP annualized effective tax rate, excluding discrete items for 2024 to be at 18%, plus or minus 1% with IRA benefit. With that, I will open the line for questions.
Operator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Christine Cho with Barclays. Please go ahead.
Christine Cho: Thank you. Good evening. I guess I just wanted to start on the batteries. You mentioned that you expect sell-through to be up slightly for batteries in the US quarter-over-quarter. But shipments are down because you restock during the quarter. Can you give us a sense of what sell-through was in 3Q? Is the 4Q guide more in-line with what sell-through levels actually are? And if we could get a rough split of the shipments, going to the US versus everywhere else?
Badri Kothandaraman: Yes. I mean -- so basically, we actually told you 90 days ago that the channel on batteries is light, and we are going to get the channel to a healthy level. We have fixed that problem now. So therefore, basically, our -- you should think of our shipments into the channel and the shipments out of the channel are at equilibrium, which is there the same. So that's why that number of 140-megawatt to 160-megawatt hours. And you should think of our US roughly in-line with a revenue split up, which is the [75-25] (ph), you should think about a similar split up for batteries.
Christine Cho: Okay. And just as a follow-up to that, revenue was up 43% quarter-over-quarter in the US, I think you said and sell-through is something in the single digits across all channels. So was the disconnect here all the batteries as we just kind of mentioned? Or is there any restocking here on the MI side? And then just as we think about Europe as well, it sounds like your sell-through was worse than what your sell-in was there. So maybe weeks of inventory went up there? And I guess, how should we assume what you are assuming for 4Q?
Badri Kothandaraman: Right. So maybe the reason why our revenue increased by 43% is quite simple. We stopped under shipping in Q3. So therefore, our revenue increased to normal level. So basically, we are now at a place where in the US, we are at equilibrium, sell-in and sell-through are matching. And that's how we can maintain a healthy weeks on hand. For us, a healthy weeks on hand always means between 8 weeks to 10 weeks and not crossing that number -- 10 weeks number, which we have instituted the discipline. So that's why you can see that the revenue increased 43%. That's the sell-in revenue. Now the good news in the US is our overall sell-through across all the channels, both distribution channel and direct channel was up 6% in Q3 compared to Q2. And I said, this increase was despite a very large US customer declaring bankruptcy in Q3. If you just look at our distribution channels, our sell-through for both -- for the US was up 13% and our sell-through in California, as well as outside California was up at similar levels at 13% and 14%, respectively. And in general, the sell-through is healthy across both microinverters and batteries. Coming to Europe. In Europe, it is a slightly different story. Our revenue was down because once again, we have learned the discipline when our overall sell-through products are down by 34%, we have to react. We have to react. We have shortened that cycle quite a bit compared to what happened last year. So we continue to under ship in Europe even with this reduced sell-through. And so our weeks on hand in Europe is a little bit high, but we are extremely disciplined and the moment when things turn around, our weeks on hand will come down very quickly. And we are not worried about that. We are cautious for Q4, this is why our guidance incorporates a slowdown in Europe in Q4, and we are not pushing more into the channel.
Operator: Okay. The next question comes from Colin Rusch with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.
Colin Rusch: Thanks so much guys. It sounds like you're getting a little bit of traction with these vehicle charges. Can you talk a little bit about your strategy around evolving the sales of those? And how we should think about the trajectory on attach rates as we get into 2025?
Badri Kothandaraman: Right. On the EV chargers, basically, there are two interesting markets. One of course, is the US market and the other is the Europe market. We bought a company called as ClipperCreek towards the end of 2021. They made high-quality chargers, excellent -- and also excellent service. They had a reasonable market share in the US. What we did was we took that, we essentially -- we moved manufacturing to our contract manufacturing facilities in Guad. We then did some surgery on the product. Those charges where what you call as unconnected charges. They did not have Wi-Fi in them. So we took our time to make that product. And last year, we introduced IQ Smart EV chargers in the US. In the meantime, we've been working furiously in Europe, where the adoption is also quite nice and high. Europe market is a very interesting market. There are about 14 countries that we will introduce our IQ EV chargers too. Our SAM, Served Available Market, is about $1.4 billion And these charges are a little bit different from the US. They are all smart charges. And as I mentioned, there are several features there in the EV chargers for Europe. For example, most of these EV chargers are three phase EV chargers. And when you do for example, green charging with the EV chargers, many of the competitive products, they need a particular minimum power in order to charge from solar. Our product has got an innovative feature where it can start with single phase, enabled green charging from solar, at a lower power and then switch to three phase when the solar energy ramps up. That's a big deal. And it integrates, of course very well with the Enphase solar and battery systems enabling homeowners to view everything from the app. The other big thing we are interested in is that there is two ways you can talk about bidirectional EV charging. That is AC bidirectional charging and there is DC bidirectional charging. AC bidirectional charging means there is no external inverter outside. DC bidirectional charging means you take care of the inversion outside. So our product, the latest IQ EV chargers is compatible to a standard called ISO 15118. That ISO 15118 is a standard, where the EV charger can talk to the car, and it can get things like the state of charge of the car, which is not possible today. So AC bidirectional -- we could see AC bidirectional standard evolving. This EV charger is capable of doing that. While we are planning, we are embarking on a AC bidirectional charger as well for the US and for Europe as needed. That AC bidirectional chargers, as I said before, in -- yes sorry, DC bidirectional charger, I mean it basically takes the DC input from the car and you have inverters outside, and then it connects to the grid. So that's -- that design is all [GaN design] (ph). Each inverter that we are building is about 3.8 kilowatts. It interfaces to 1,000 volt DC on one side, which is interfacing to the car and AC on the other side. So for example, in order to have 11-kilowatt bidirectional charger, you will have 3 of those 3.8 kilowatts inverter. And these 3.8 kilowatt inverters are built according to the same inverter -- microinverter architecture that we have. So zooming back down, right now the most important thing for us is to introduce the IQ EV charger second generation into 14 countries in Europe, take advantage of the big served available market of $1.4 billion. And then work on both AC bidirectional charging in Europe and DC bidirectional charging in the US.
Colin Rusch: Okay. Thanks. And then just very quickly, please. Can you give us an update on the initial traction in the commercial market and the size of systems that you're able to address, as you get into 2025? Are you able to get into the 100 to 200 kw systems? Or are you still generally in the smaller side on the commercial systems at this point?
Badri Kothandaraman: Yes. Our IQ8P is a commercial-specific microinverter. We benefit with the three-phase cabling system. It's perfect for small commercial solar installs between 20 and 200 kilowatts. As you know, the commercial projects, they have a slightly longer cycle time. So we start shipping this product about nine months ago, and the traction has been quite good. We reported, I think, a couple of hundred sites 90 days ago. Now things are starting to ramp. We are over 380 sites. In fact, in the Fremont building that I'm sitting right now, I have 396 panels on the roof. I can monitor it. I can monitor it nicely. I can immediately find out if an inverter is not working. That's what the installers value. The higher power production, the per panel monitoring, the immediate focus on quality. It's a 214-kilowatt system. It uses 550 watt panels. So this microinverter is perfect 480 watts. So we're very excited by this. We are doing a couple of things. One is we aren't yet addressing the 480 volt market, which we are going to address with IQ9. That product is coming out in the second half of 2025. That's going to be a gallium nitride design, suitable for high power with ultra-low cost. And the second important thing that you should note is that domestic contract. These IQ8P three-phase micro inverters are going to be shipping from the US, where they have an increased domestic content that enable the commercial asset owners to get the benefit of an additional 10% ITC. So we think that will also propeller demand. So we are quite excited about that.
Colin Rusch : Yeah. Thanks guys.
Operator: And the next question comes from Mark Strouse with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Mark Strouse: Yes. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking our questions. Going back to RE+, we were hearing quite a bit of optimism looking into 2025, just kind of based on a view that interest rates would be lower. Since then, there's been a pretty big spike in rates in the wrong direction. Just kind of curious, to the extent that you've had kind of very recent conversations with some of your customers, if that's creating any pause in the industry?
Badri Kothandaraman: Well, I mean, our data -- as I told you, our sell-through data for Q3 things are headed in the right direction in the US California, for example, we talked about NEM 3.0 being a drag that is no longer the case. Installers have gotten used to NEM 3.0 -- at least some of installers have gotten used to NEM 3.0, and they are finding both solar plus storage working out in terms of economics. Outside the U.S -- I mean, outside California also our sell-through data looks fine. We are up about 14%. I've been monitoring since the six weeks of RE+, our sell-through data is things are looking better, week on week. And we do have -- we think things will be incrementally better in 2025 in the U.S. market. The things that are going to contribute to it are, of course, further rate cuts, the 10% domestic ITC adders. That is a big deal because it saves the TPO provider or it helps them to make an additional $0.40 -- that $0.40 a watt can be reinvested back into the installers or into increasing demand on the consumer front. And of course, the utility prices are continuing to increase. And so we are seeing -- of course, I'm not disputing what you said, but the data still seems to be optimistic towards the growth in 2025 for the overall US market.
Mark Strouse: Okay. That's great to hear. Thanks Badri. And then real quick on Europe. You mentioned some of the cross currents with some of the kind of the industry headwinds, but maybe offset by new products and market expansion, that kind of thing. Adding all of that up, do you care to comment about kind of what 2025 Europe might look like for Enphase? Fully appreciating that you do not guide a year out. But just generally speaking, any color would be great. Thank you.
Badri Kothandaraman: Yes. I mean, look, we think Europe -- I mean, Q4 might be a little stressed, but we think we are at the bottom there. And the key about Europe is there are some really great markets, which are very nimble like Netherlands, which have been affected a lot due to NEM uncertainty. And that is slowly getting solved. We are confident as we go into 2025, what's going to happen is that Netherlands is going to shift slowly but surely from a solar-only play to a solar plus storage plus software play. We are already working with nearly, I would say, 10 energy providers just in Netherlands alone. Some of them, for example, will need PV curtailing, meaning solar curtailing for very small times during the year where otherwise, they incur a lot of penalties. So that market will need to be transformed a bit, but I think it is at its low point, and we have a tremendous opportunity there to reshape that market. Now France is the country where we have historically done very well. We have over 50% share. And France basically, what we are hearing, there could be some headwind due to utility rates in the early part of next year. But the fundamentals there are strong, and everybody expects things to come back up strongly, as we approach the end of 2025. Germany that have been -- there has been general weakness. There is a few installers who have gone bankrupt, very similar to what has happened in the US. And once again, what we are doing there is stick to the basics -- stick to the basics is we are introducing new products and adding a served-available market of $4 billion to our portfolio. And those new products are three-phase battery with backup. That's for the DAC regions. DAC is Germany, Austria and Switzerland regions. Then we are talking about IQ Balcony Solar, which is brand new for us. And we are ideal, Enphase is ideal to play in that very small system. So by the way, Balcony Solar is not restricted to only Germany, many other places like, for example, Austria, Belgium, France, they all have their own versions of Balcony Solar, and we will be following up, and introducing all of those products as well. But Balcony Solar in Germany is 400 megawatts. Then I already talked about our IQ EV charger. So we are not stopping. We are underpenetrated in Europe. We have a lot more countries to cover. We are focusing on the areas where we can control, which is releasing new products, managing the channel, getting into new regions, working closely with the -- with both the long tail installers plus a few top-tier installers. So we are doing all of the right things, and we expect the market to rebound sooner or later.
Operator: The next question comes from Brian Lee with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Brian Lee: Hi, everyone. Thanks for taking the questions. I had two, both related to guidance. I guess first -- at the midpoint of the revenue guidance, you're flat for 4Q. I think there's three drivers, right, Battery Storage, Europe and SunPower. You gave us the guidance for battery storage. That seems like it's a $15 million headwind. And then Europe was a $5 million to $10 million drag in 3Q. Is it similar in 4Q? Because you're saying it's going to be down. And then SunPower might have been doing less than 50 megawatts a quarter at the end of their existence, but that's still $10 million to $15 million of revenue for you. So really, the question is, can you help kind of quantify what seemed to be three meaningful buckets of headwinds for at least the sequential growth into 4Q? And then I had a follow-up.
Badri Kothandaraman: Yes. In Q4, our overall sell-through of microinverters is doing a little better -- is doing a little better compared to Q3. And we can see that, and that's what we are guiding towards. And as I told you on the battery side, it is -- we are talking about 140-megawatt to 160-megawatt hours versus the 170-megawatt hours. That's -- you're right in the range that you said. SunPower is a headwind of $10 million to $15 million. You are correct about that. And we don't expect that to immediately come in Q4, but we are working with all of the installers, and we should be able to get all or most of that in the coming quarters. So to answer your question, we expect upside from increased microinverter sell-through. The battery sell-through is also doing fine, except for that one-time channel destocking. And Europe has got a slightly continued weakness compared to Q3.
Brian Lee: Yes, that's super helpful, Badri. Second question on that same line of thought, you strip up the battery storage, microinverter sales, you're saying are going to be up about 5% or so in the 4Q guide at the midpoint. But I would have thought stripping out all these other factors like SunPower, Europe, et cetera, you have US seasonality, US domestic content. And also, it sounds like you had some price increases in the US. So can you talk us through some of the tailwinds that I don't know, if they're actually showing up in 4Q or if they are going to show up later. But I would have expected those to maybe help you a bit more into 4Q outside of all these other headwinds we just talked about. So domestic content, US price increases. Just any general thoughts around that? Thank you guys.
Badri Kothandaraman: Yes, we are not increasing any prices in the US. The domestic content product is a new product and that for increased domestic content, yes, there is an extra adder. And we do have -- we do expect, like what you said, we think those are the drivers. The increased domestic content is a driver. The sell-through on microinverters, is a driver. Batteries, it's going to be generally strong, and I think we expect to be even stronger from Q1 '25 when we have our fourth generation system. So that piece. Yes, but you're generally right. The way I would characterize it as -- if microinverter is a little bit healthy, it covers the other areas which are weak.
Operator: The next question comes from Phil Shen with ROTH Capital Partners. Please go ahead.
Philip Shen: Yeah. Thanks for taking my questions. First one is on -- in the past, you've talked about getting to a $450 million to $500 million sell-through demand run rate. And back in May, you thought it might be sometime in Q4. What's your thinking now in terms of when you can hit that on a quarterly basis? Is it sometime through '25, maybe Q2? Or could it be more in the back half? Thanks.
Badri Kothandaraman: Yes. I mean, look we talked about that, and we have had a few things there. We have had a few installer bankruptcies. I mentioned a big one. And we've had some headwinds. While the US is proceeding in the right direction, Europe is an entirely different story. So basically, a few months back, we didn't anticipate the installer bankruptcies, one in the US, we didn't anticipate the European business declining further. And that's reality right now. And that's reality. But the fact of the matter is the distribution market in the US, like what I told you, with the distributors -- with the distribution sell-through numbers for US, as well as meaning California is very encouraging. Non-California in the US is also very encouraging. Of course, customer -- a large customer who went bankrupt, we lost some revenue, we expect to get that revenue back. We don't guide our 2025, but those are our growth vectors. We are going to be introducing our fourth generation system in Q1. We expect that fourth generation system to basically reduced the installed cost by $300 per kilowatt hour, making us competitive not only for grid type which we are today, but for backup. So today, for example, on the batteries, our shipments from Q2 to Q3 increased by more than 40%. Our sell-through is climbing up continuously there. And we -- for grid tight systems with NEM 3.0, what installers need to do is to treat the installation like a solar installation. There is no complicated wiring to take care of. There is no loads to manage. So therefore, they hang two IQ battery 5Ps, two 5-kilowatt hour batteries on to the AC bus, they routed to the combiner along with solar, the same combiner and they're done. So that is still quite strong for us. Now with this fourth-generation system, where we have the meter collar, we have the battery, we have the enhanced combiner. We will be eliminating the system controller cost. We'll be eliminating both the component cost, as well as the labor, and we expect to save $300 in installed costs. So we think that will unleash a spurt of growth for us in terms of backup. So basically, the vectors in the US are continued improvement in the sell-through. It is the higher utility rates, lower interest rates and domestic content. In Europe, it's a little bit of a wildcard right now, but I outlined our plans very clearly. We think we are scraping the bottom in Q3 and Q4 for some of the markets. The fundamentals are there. We are working with the right players in Netherlands. We are working for Germany, we have served available market increases for Europe. We have a served available market increase of $4 billion with a lot of products, specifically for Germany, the three-phase backup is most relevant for Germany, Austria and Switzerland, and the Balcony Solar is also relevant for Germany. So we have all of those in-line. So I can only give you a qualitative color that we aren't waiting for the market to grow. We are introducing new products, we are working with our installers. We are not stuffing the channel most importantly. And we are doing all of that globally.
Philip Shen: Great. Okay. Thank you for all the color Badri. Shifting to Powerwall 3 and Tesla. Our work suggests that the Powerwall 3 demand is substantial and widespread. I know it is a string inverter, and I know and you just laid out how your technology is meaningfully better and more advanced. That said, I know many of your customers are ramping up substantial Powerwall 3 volumes. So when you talk to your customers about that, what are they telling you? And then are you surprised by the volume of business that is shifting to Powerwall 3? Some of your larger customers are sharing with me that you may be resigned to losing share to Powerwall 3, especially until your new battery and meter collar and combiner box comes out. How much do you think -- how much are you planning to lose? I know it's a tough question, but I think it's important. So thank you for taking.
Badri Kothandaraman: Yes. So thank you for the question. The key -- I can react to data in front of me, all of the data which we have continuously, we do have third-party reports. And we -- those all show basically that we are holding share. That's the data point number one. And the second point, which we highlighted is basically our sell-through in California, which is probably the area where you're talking about. Our sell-through in California is up 13% quarter-on-quarter. And our sell-through is up on both batteries and microinverters because they go hand-in-hand with each other. And on batteries, as I told you before, our installs, if you see our installations in California, and it makes sense, is 70% of our installs are grid-tied installs in California. The 70% are grid-tied installs like what I said, the cost that you are talking about is not -- is not higher. The cost, in fact, it is cheaper to install an Enphase battery there. We are talking about two 5P batteries. We are talking about hanging it off the AC bus. We have the same combiner box that is used, so it's not an extra box. So that is why probably our market is grid-tied market. And now we are in the process of fixing that problem. And we are going to release in the first quarter, the latest and greatest battery that we got. That's a 10-kilowatt hour battery. That 10 kilowatt-hour battery has got a wall space of 60% lesser compared to our own battery. And there is no system controller that used to be there before. Now there is the color. We expect -- the color is done development. It is in compliance. We expect to work with utilities in the next few months and get utility approval in Q1 '25. So with the color -- with our battery, which has got neutral farming, by the way, and our enhanced combiner, which has got a lot of bells and whistles that are installers love. The cost of the installation is substantially going down by $300 per kilowatt hour for a typical storage system with backup. So basically, we have solved that problem. We need to get that solution to the market in Q1 '25. And then what will happen is we will grow in both grid-tied markets, as well as markets with back up. And that will be a key focus for us in 2025 and will contribute to growth. The other things, which you already know, but I will tell for the benefit of the audience is Enphase, the advantages are numerous, power production. Power production -- between power production with the string inverter and power production with the microinverter, you can get anywhere from 4% to 15% advantage, especially where there is shading, which is there in many places. With Enphase that is reliability. There is no single point of failure. When a microinverter on the roof fails, we still have 95% of the system working, assuming the system has got 20 microinverters. When a microinverter inside the battery fails, we still have 83% of the system working. Every IQ battery has got six microinverters. So reliability and no single point of failure. Our warranty is -- warranty on batteries is 15 years. Warranty on microinverter is 25 years versus common warranty of 10 years on string inverters. Simplicity, plug-and-play, is just very easy to do on the roof. Low-voltage DC on batteries. And obviously AC in the roof loved by firefighters. I've had many firefighters telling me and FEMA by the way, which is basically the authority in the US. They do recommend microinverters because of that. So other things, 24x7 support. If there is a problem, Enphase will answer the phone. We never take batteries off the wall. We repair them, replace boards in situ. In situ means we do not -- customer is not down for more than a few days versus being down for weeks and having complex logistics between the supplier and install. All of that doesn't happen. Serviceability is very crucial. When you have a fleet of batteries and you have service problems, you keep spending your time on service. You know, you made a mistake in taking an architecture. And by the way, batteries are notorious for this. Inverters, solar inverters, the industry is getting matured, but batteries is still Wild Wild West. AC architecture. We believe in a distributed architecture, which as I already told you, no single point of failure, all AC. Everything is AC coupled. We have our solar, our storage, our EV chargers, our bidirectional chargers, anything is AC coupled. So basically, the power that a homeowner gets, for example, is both solar plus storage. So I outlined all of the things that those are our strengths, plus with the fourth generation system, we are going to be very competitive on backup. And we expect all of these to basically increase our market share on batteries going forward.
Philip Shen : Thank you for the color Badri. I will pass it on.
Badri Kothandaraman : Thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from Jordan Levy with Truist. Please go ahead.
Jordan Levy: Good afternoon. Appreciate you all squeezing me in here. I'll stick to one. Just on the pricing side, I think you gave a lot of commentary, but if I heard correctly, I think you mentioned some pricing concessions in Europe with all the weakness you've been pretty consistent in how you approach pricing in a price-to-value basis. But just wanted to see if there's -- how you're thinking about that as the 4Q for Europe, especially? And then any change in the pricing strategy overall, particularly around micros?
Badri Kothandaraman: Pricing, I did not mention we did anything for Europe. So I think you must have heard it or you must have misunderstood it. So we are not dropping pricing anywhere. But pricing is something that we manage on a daily basis. We instituted a pricing team in 2017, and there is a team of about six people. Their job is to make sure we always price on value. So therefore, they spend an ordinate amount of time in understanding the full system, bill of materials to make sure that there is -- we clearly understand the areas where we can save money for the consumer in terms of the overall system. So we do that very diligently. And I'm not saying that we never dropped price, but it is a non-event for us because sometimes if there is a loyal customer, he needs a little bit of help, we will help them. But that's not an event, it is a business process. And we expect that business process to continue.
Jordan Levy : Got it. Thanks so much for all the detail.
Operator: The next question comes from Pavel Molchanov with Raymond James. Please go ahead.
Pavel Molchanov: Thanks for taking the question. Can I ask kind of high level about Europe. Yes, power prices are R&D down by module pricing is down 30% versus a year ago as well as lithium-ion batteries. Why is that not acting as a counterbalance against cheaper electricity?
Raghu Belur: I think – hi this is Raghu. We believe we think that part of the reason, if you again look at it by country by country. In the case of the Netherlands, which was a solar-only market before, it was very clear that the NEM uncertainty, as well as homeowners being penalized for exporting solar into the grid was a big headwind. And so obviously, Netherlands, we really think we are doing all the right things there for that market to completely turn around by the addition of batteries. So solar plus batteries in a dynamic electricity market where energy can be traded into the market is a very good way for homeowners to improve their ROI. In general, I think the urgency that was there before during the crisis, during the Ukraine crisis and the steep increase in power was that urgency is gone. And then in general, we also know that the economy is also is not doing that well. So the combination of those things, we believe, are the reasons why Europe seems to be slow. But as Badri mentioned, it is possible that you could be -- that 3Q could be kind of the bottom there. And specifically for Enphase with the introduction of all the new products and expansion of our SAM by $4 billion can be a catalyzer for us to get Europe back where it needs to be.
Pavel Molchanov: I'll follow up with a quick question about India, which no one has asked about yet. You recently announced a new product launch in the Indian market, which I typically think of as a very price-sensitive market. Are you going to be cost competitive there?
Badri Kothandaraman: Yes. Let me tell you about India, there this battery will cater to the premium segment. There are many single-family homes, apartments, villas, where -- and in India, if you didn't know, you lose power five times a day. And the system today is a backup UPS, a lead acid battery, basically. And you all know how lead acid batteries are. That's why we shifted to lithium-ion. So we introduced this battery in India. It's a 5-kilowatt hour battery. And it is our mainstream battery that we are shipping, and it is perfect for India because Indian families, Indian homes, even high-end may not use more than 10-kilowatt hours a day. So basically, this battery comes with a backup switch. And that backup switch makes -- you won't even know you're running on backup. And so it's a beautiful solution for many of the luxury builders, where they can build it into the -- some of the homes which can cost anywhere from $200,000 to a couple of million dollars. They can build it into the home and raise the value of the home and provide complete energy independence. So we are working with these builders. And of course, granted the volumes we have to see, and it will ramp. But India is a beautiful market because there is a big problem, which is power shutdowns, and we have a solution for the high-end markets.
Raghu Belur: India also has a lot of [radiance] (ph) So it’s a very, very good solar market. Now there’s a new program for small systems in a very big incentive programs for small systems, 2, 3 and 4 kilowatts. And so those are all perfect market, a perfect market for India. We are very bullish about that market.
Operator: The next question comes from Dylan Nassano with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.
Dylan Nassano : Hi, good afternoon. I just wanted to comment the market share question from a slightly different angle and ask just specifically on the TPO market. I think you had kind of identified that as an opportunity to take incremental share specifically in 4Q. And I just want to check in on how that's kind of playing out. Thank you.
Badri Kothandaraman: Yes. We work with all of the TPO providers. We have a great relationship with everybody. And our market share, the way we have built market share to be even more than 50% in the U.S. is by working with everybody. So we work with Tier 1 installers, Tier 2 installers, long tail installers. And now all of those installers are being served by a handful of TPOs. And all of them are working with us on domestic content. And once again, it was not clear. We are already shipping domestic content microinverters with increased domestic content right now. And that is on our mainstream product called IQ8HC. Soon, we will start shipping batteries with domestic content in November. So basically, if they have a reliable supply of domestic content, [as] (ph) they are looking for that right now because there are very few people with clear plans for domestic content. And we are working with each and every one of those TPOs.
Dylan Nassano : Thank you. If I can squeeze in just one more. You covered kind of managing the battery channel earlier in the call. But just looking past 4Q, as you get ready to start shipping the fourth gen battery. I mean, how should we think about your kind of strategy to prep the channel ahead of that? Thanks.
Badri Kothandaraman: Yes. There is two, three things you need to note. One is as we introduce batteries into a lot more regions. For example, as I told you, we are underpenetrated in a few regions in Europe, including Germany even. So the three-phase battery is going to come into Germany, that's going to increase our battery volumes. It's going to introduce batteries into many more countries in Europe that's going to increase the volumes. And that, we are still talking about the third-generation battery. In the US, we are going to switch to the fourth-generation battery. And that is going to result in a drastic reduction and bill of materials and installation costs like what I said. So why did I tell that to you because, therefore, the inventory transition is a little bit easier for us because we have the third generation still shipping for rest of the world, and we will ramp on to the fourth generation. So we don't need to have any hard transition. And we expect that transition to be well managed and not leaving any problems in the channel.
Operator: Next question comes from Dimple Gosai with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Dimple Gosal: Thank you for the question Badri. So my understanding is that the increase in ASPs and IRA benefits helped to counter the domestic manufacturing costs and product mix impacts on gross margins. Was this a lever you pulled? Or how do you think about the sustainability of these higher ASPs going forward?
Raghu Belur: Yes. I mean it's quite simple, right? The cost manufacturing in the US. means our cost increases many times by 10% to 15%. So therefore, all we are doing is to make sure that we take care of that in terms of pricing. But if you look at the big picture, the few cents of what that we might be adding is creating value of $0.40 to $0.50 a watt for somebody. And that $0.40 to $0.50 of watt can be invested back, can be taken as products and be given to the installers. There are various ways that each TPO will choose to cut it. But that's the math. We are generating that value. We are generating the domestic content. We are taking a few dollars to do that because in the US manufacturing, is a little more expensive. We are covering for those costs. And there is still a lot of value being generated.
Dimple Gosal: Understood.
Operator: The next question comes from Kashy Harrison with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.
Kashy Harrison: Good afternoon and thank you for taking my questions. So my first one, and hopefully, this is in a dumb one. But -- you highlighted that distribution growth in 3Q was much higher than sales from more channels because of the SunPower bankruptcy. How do you know that the growth you're seeing in distribution isn't because the bankruptcy occurred and your distribution customers aren't actually just gaining share from SunPower?
Badri Kothandaraman: We don't. But what we know is this, that the time period is too short for installers to adjust their plans, and it typically takes some time for installers to bleed off their current inventory. So our projection is there will be some installers who will come through in Q4. Majority of the installers will come through from Q1, onwards through the channel. The good news is we are working with almost all of them. And the good news is they all know us very well. We are meeting with them, and they are all making plan for ramping with us.
Kashy Harrison: Thank you. And just a quick follow-up. A big part of the Enphase story, going back to your initial -- or the start of your tenure, was just taking out costs year-after-year and just passing on some of those to your customers. Lately, whether it's the duopoly, inflation, domestic content. It just seems like there haven't really been a lot of cost cuts on the inverter side. And I'm just wondering, with IQ9 being released later this year and potentially, driving your cost down meaningfully. How are you thinking about potentially returning to the old days of costs out and then passing on some of that to your customers? Thank you.
Badri Kothandaraman: Yes. Basically, if you look at IQ9, our aim, our desire is to deliver increased watts at the same cost installers. So the way we would price that product is appropriate like that, which is utilizing advanced technology like GaN, gallium nitride. We are able to achieve high power with improved form factor and cost. And how is that possible? Is -- for example, I'll just describe to you a simple change in the microinverter today, our bread and butter microinverter called IQ8HC. We have four silicon AC FETs, which are 600 volt transistors, 600 volt FETs. We also have a big transformer there, the round transformer that you've seen in our microinverters. Now going to GaN. 4 FETs will be replaced by 2 bidirectional FETs. That's called BDS, bidirectional GaN switches, 4 will become 2. And then -- if we run the GaN transistors at an increased frequency, by the way, we can -- we are getting ready to run them at a megahertz in IQ10. If we run them at a high frequency, then what happens is all of sudden, the transformer cost and form factor can come down drastically in addition to many passive components that can come down drastically. So that's how we are thinking. We are thinking in terms of overall component cost reduction. We'd like to give offer installers 10% higher value that is IQ8HC got a power of 384 watts. IQ9 product, which will release in second half of next year, will have 27 watts, approximately 10%, 12% higher. And we'd like to make sure that is given to installers for a similar price, they buy today, thereby the cost per watt for them is much more efficient. And that's our plan on the microinverters. Now I already told you about our plans on batteries. Battery costs are continuously going down. Cell pack costs are continuously going down. According to a market study, cell back cost will soon be well below $100 per kilowatt hour. And with designing the system properly, with neutral farming embedded in the batteries, we are able to drastically reduce the installation costs for batteries, which is you no longer need a complicated backup box. You only meet the collar. Collar is not a new concept. It's been there some time. We need the collar, we need the battery. Then we need a combiner box that works with both solar, storage, EV. It's got load control. And so we are trying to integrate. We are trying to make like 7 or 8 boxes go down to 3 -- 4 or 3 at the end of the day. So that's on the storage systems side. I talked about microinverters. I talked about storage. Then we are also constantly looking at balance of systems. Balance of system is how can we convert, for example, how can we eliminate our combined mark. What can we do? Maybe we can eliminate our combiner boxes one day by going to solid-state breakers in the main path. We are looking at that, and that will potentially take several thousands of dollars out because no longer there would need something to be at start. So in almost all of these cases, technology is the end, and that's what we are focused on, GaN technology. it's breaker technology, battery technology, and we will continue to innovate.
Raghu Belur: And also software, right? Software, the quality of the software, AI-powered software can really also improve the homeowner's ROI just by being very intelligent about when to charge the battery, went to discharge the battery, when to buy from the grid, when to sell to the grade. You're making real-time decisions in software to also improve the homeowners ROI. That's what we care about at the end. We also have power control system software built into our combiner boxes that can avoid main panel upgrades, again applying technology, hardware and software technology to improve the homeowners ROI. So we are looking at systems. We started with solar only, but now we have moved to comprehensive energy systems now. And so we have to look at all elements of the system and the system itself, and how to continue to driving the cost down. And there are numerous examples that give you on what we're doing to drive these costs down.
Operator: The next question comes from Maheep Mandloi with Mizuho. Please go ahead.
Maheep Mandloi: Hi, Mandloi . Thanks for taking the questions. Maybe just one quick one on the IQ9 timing. I think you said second half of next year. Is that for the commercial or the residential? and if just the commercial then, when do you expect the residential launch?
Badri Kothandaraman: We'll start with the commercial microinverters. Commercial microinverters will address 427 watts and 548 watts of AC power. They will take care of three-phase 208 volts and 480 volts. Note that 480 volts, we face is a brand-new market for us. And what we have heard in the small commercial market, which we talk about, which consists of schools as small businesses like restaurants, churches, apartments, any small-scale building that you can think of, we've heard that 75% of them are 480 volts, and 25% are 208. Today, we are only addressing the 208. And we need -- we are going to expand that fan in the second half of '25. Following that, we will introduce our residential microinverter. There are 2 flavors there. One is the 427-watt residential microinverter that we are talking about. And the other is 548 watts for emerging markets, very high power panels, for example in India, for example panels will be 650 to 700 watts. Similar in Brazil. Similar in Mexico. In many emerging markets -- residential markets, we need a high-power solution, while in the US and Europe, we need for 427-watt solution. And that will immediately follow. So we expect to introduce all of it in the second half of 2025.
Maheep Mandloi: Got it. And just on the cash, you have almost $1.8 billion now. And any thoughts on how to deploy that or buybacks or anything any other use going forward here?
Badri Kothandaraman: Yes. We look at -- as I said before, we look at three things. One is making sure we have enough capital for expansion whether it's a factory, whether it's a contract manufacturing line, whether it's some of the new line of business, first priority. Second priority is obviously looking at M&As. For example, we are quite interested in energy management software. We are also looking at basically interesting things on EV chargers as they become mainstream, which is bidirectional charging will make EV charger integral part of solar and batteries. So we are looking at that. We are also looking at commercial batteries, there is scope and opportunities for us. So we are casting a wide net. And of course, with this macro there are many companies who look at. But of our standards are very high. We will not buy companies that we think don't fit with us. So we are very selective, but we are looking at many of them. So that's the second one. And then the third is if there is enough cash left over, we do a systematic buyback. We've been doing a systematic buyback in the last few quarters, and we expect to do so in consultation with the Board, especially whenever we can be opportunistic and do when there is some pressure on the stock, we will do.
Maheep Mandloi: Got it. Thanks for taking the questions.
Operator: And the next question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Jefferies. Please go ahead.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Hi guys. [Technical Difficulty] I'll make it super quick here. Just what's the percent mix of domestic content SKU, 3Q, 4Q and what you expect in the 1Q for US product?
Badri Kothandaraman: 3Q has not ramped. So I should say, close to 0. And 4Q, our estimate is anywhere something around 10% is our estimate, 10% to 15% and doing a steady ramp from there on.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Okay. Linear offset baseline. Thank you very much. I appreciate it.
Operator: And the next question comes from Austin Moeller with Canaccord. Please go ahead.
Austin Moeller: Hi, good evening. Thanks for taking my questions. Have you -- do you have any concerns about -- the 30% residential tax credit in the IRA being changed by a new Congress or a new Presidency next year? And how would that affect your expectations for US growth in the out years?
Raghu Belur: So obviously, an ITC is very important for the US market. So I think if that gets disrupted at this stage, that would not be good for the overall market, I think -- but it would also be bad for the general -- we believe it will be bad for the general economy. If you look at the fact of the matter is demand is going up substantially. The electrification is taking place in the homes. People are buying EVs, heat pumps. That demand has to be met. We know all the data center demand is going up substantially as well. And all of this demand is being met by a vast majority of the demand is being met immediately by renewals. And so any hit to a 30% ITC is going to be bad for everybody. And what the IRA is created a lot of jobs here. All the manufacturing has come back here. So we expect the probability of ITC going away at being very, very low, maybe zero.
Austin Moeller: Great. Thank you for the time.
Operator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Badri Kothandaraman for any closing remarks.
Badri Kothandaraman: Yes. Thank you for joining us today and for your continued support of Enphase. We look forward to speaking with you again next quarter.
Operator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2024 Q2  (2024-07-23 16:30:00) =====
Operator: Good day, and welcome to the Enphase Energy's Second Quarter 2024 Financial Results Conference Call. All participants will be in a listen only-mode. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Zach Freedman. Please go ahead.
Zach Freedman: Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us on today's conference call to discuss Enphase Energy's second quarter 2024 results. On today's call are Badri Kothandaraman, our President and Chief Executive Officer; Mandy Yang, our Chief Financial Officer; and Raghu Belur, our Chief Products Officer. After the market closed today, Enphase issued a press release announcing the results for its second quarter ended June 3, 2024. During this conference call, Enphase management will make forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, statements related to our expected future financial performance, market trends, the capabilities of our technology and products and the benefits to homeowners and installers, our operations, including manufacturing, customer service and supply and demand, anticipated growth in existing and new markets, the timing of new product introductions, and regulatory and tax matters. These forward-looking statements involve significant risks and uncertainties and our actual results and the timing of events could differ materially from these expectations. For a more complete discussion of the risks and uncertainties, please see our most recent Form 10-K and 10-Qs filed with the SEC. We caution you not to place any undue reliance on forward-looking statements and undertake no duty or obligation to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future events or changes in expectations. Also, please note that financial measures used on this call are expressed on a non-GAAP basis unless otherwise noted and have been adjusted to exclude certain charges. We have provided a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures in our earnings release furnished with the SEC on Form 8-K, which can also be found in the Investor Relations section of our website. Now I would like to introduce Badri Kothandaraman, our President and Chief Executive Officer. Badri?
Badri Kothandaraman: Good afternoon, and thanks for joining us today to discuss our second quarter 2024 results. We reported quarterly revenue of $303.5 million, shipped approximately 1.4 million microinverters and 120 megawatt hours of batteries, and generated free cash flow of $117.4 million. The end market demand for our products was approximately $396 million in Q2, and we reduced our channel inventory by approximately $92 million. Our overall channel inventory returned to normal levels as we exited Q2. For the second quarter, we delivered 47% gross margin, 27% operating expenses, and 20% operating income, all as a percentage of revenue on a non-GAAP basis and including the net IRA benefit. Mandy will go into our financials later in the call. Let's discuss how we are servicing customers. Our worldwide NPS was 79% in Q2, up from 78% in Q1. Our average call wait time was 2.5 minutes in Q2, compared to 1.9 minutes in Q1. We have several AI and machine learning initiatives to drive automation and further reduce wait times. Let's talk about operations. Our global capacity is around 7.25 million microinverters per quarter. 5 million units of those are in the US. In Q2, we shipped approximately 574,000 microinverters from our US contract manufacturing facilities that we booked for 45X production tax credits. We expect to ship approximately 1.1 million microinverters from our US facilities in Q3. Our US-made IQ8 Microinverters can help lease PPA and commercial asset owners qualify for the 10% domestic content ITC error. I'll discuss more on this later in the call. For batteries, our cell pack suppliers in China have sufficient capacity to support our ramp-up in 2024. We also plan to manufacture batteries in the US starting in Q4 with power conversion, battery management, and enclosures made domestically while using cell packs from China. Let's cover the regions. Our US and international revenue mix for Q2 was 65% and 35% respectively. For more visibility into our business, we are providing regional breakdown and sell-through dollar metrics for Q2. With our channel normalized, we will not provide -- we will not be providing detailed sell-through statistics going forward. In the US, our revenue increased 32% compared to Q1. The overall sell-through of our products in the US was up 8% in Q2 compared to Q1. Let's discuss the market trends in the US split by non-California states and California. For non-California states, our overall sell-through was up 7% in Q2 compared to Q1. The sell through for micro inverters was up 6% and the sell-through for batteries was up 10%. In California, our overall sell-through was up 7% in Q2 compared to Q1, indicating that our California business has stabilized. The sell-through of our microinverters was flat and the sell-through of our batteries was up 14% in Q2 due to the high NEM 3.0 battery attach rates. I'll provide more statistics on NEM 3.0 later in the call. In Europe our revenue was flat in Q2 compared to Q1. The overall sell-through of our products in Europe was up 3% in Q2 compared to Q1. The sell-through of our micro inverters was flat and the sell through of our batteries was up 18% in Q2. I'll provide color on some key markets in Europe, the Netherlands, France, and Germany. In the Netherlands, our overall sell-through was down 15% in Q2 compared to Q1. The country's solar demand continues to be challenged by regulatory uncertainty. However, we are beginning to see battery demand pickup. This is a trend we expect to continue. Especially as dynamic electricity rates become more prevalent in Netherlands. We launched our IQ energy management software in Netherlands during Q2 that will allow our installer to offer an Enphase system that can deliver healthy payback even without NEM. The modularity of our batteries allows homeowners to start either with a 3.5 or a 5 kilowatt hour battery along with their solar systems, making the economics work well. In France, the overall sell through in Q2 was flat compared to Q1. We recently launched our third generation battery in France and expect that solar plus storage system will become increasingly important for this market as the spread between retail electricity rates and feed-in and tariff rise. We expect to introduce IQ EV chargers and IQ energy management software in France later in the year. In Germany, our overall sell through in Q2 was up 7% compared to Q1, building on the growth we reported in the previous earnings call. In June at Intersolar Munich, we unveiled some exciting products. Our three phase battery backup solution for Germany, Austria and Switzerland that will increase our served available market. In addition, we showcased our IQ balcony solar kit, which will also increase our served available market in Germany by approximately 400 megawatts a year. We believe Enphase microinverters was -- are ideal for these small systems and we plan to roll out the balcony solutions throughout Europe in the coming quarters. A general comment about Europe. We are still underpenetrated in markets like the UK, Italy, Spain, Belgium, Luxembourg, Switzerland, Austria, Sweden and more. Each country has its own challenges and opportunities. But homeowners increasingly seek safety, high quality savings, and an all in one app experience from their home energy system, which aligns well with our strengths. We plan to introduce our entire product portfolio IQ Microinverters, Batteries, IQ EV chargers, IQ energy management software, and the Solargraf installer platform across more European countries and scale our sales and support accordingly. Let's come to Asia. We are making incremental progress in Asia. Our revenue in India, although small, has doubled from a year ago with introduction of IQ8 family of microinverters. We are gaining solid traction in Thailand and Philippines, where quality and safety are highly valued. In Brazil we have a good team in place. We work with approximately 600 long tail installers through the help of some good distribution partners. We are currently shipping our 480 watt IQ8P microinverters into these emerging residential markets to support newer high power panels. In Australia there is interest in our Enphase Energy System powered by IQ micro inverters and the third generation battery. We introduced this product approximately a year ago. Later this year, we will be introducing more products into Australia, including the IQ8X microinverters for higher DC input voltage panels and grid type batteries. Let me come to NEM 3 and provide some statistics there. As I said before, the end customer demand in California for us has stabilized in the second quarter. As of last week, 60% of our California installations were NEM 3.0. These systems have a high battery attach rate over 90% compared to NEM 2.0 systems, which have an attached rate of 15%. Our data also shows that half of our NEM 3 systems are using Enphase batteries, consistent with what I have reported in the last few earnings calls. Taking this data into account, our average revenue per NEM 3.0 system is approximately 1.5 times the average NEM 2.0 system. We believe this will contribute to stabilizing our California revenue in the back half of the year. Let me say a few words about market share. In the US, our microinverters and batteries have stable market share, according to both internal and third party data. As batteries become more common in California, there is some interest in centralized inverter solution. Our success continues to be driven by our unique AC coupled architecture, which offers significant advantages over legacy string inverter systems in terms of performance, reliability, and safety. We strongly believe in this value proposition. Our system will become even easier and faster to install for backup applications with further improvements we are making to our balancer system. They include our IQ meter collar, our fourth generation 10 kilowatt hour battery and the enhanced IQ combiner, which are all expected to be available in early 2025. Additionally, we believe our AI-based software is essential for helping homeowners maximize savings with a complex tariff structure like NEM 3. Let's come to our Q3 guidance. We are guiding revenue in the range of $370 million to $410 million. We expect to ship between 160 and 180 megawatt hours of IQ batteries. We anticipate incremental improvement in our US business and a seasonal slowdown in Europe. We are over 85% booked to the midpoint of our overall revenue guidance. This is the healthiest backlog position we have had in the last year. Let's talk about new products, starting with IQ batteries. Our third generation IQ batteries has been well received and we have almost converted to the third generation battery right now. It offers an industrial -- industry leading 15 year warranty with differentiated quality, serviceability, modularity, and power capability. We have expanded the IQ Battery 5P, our third generation battery, into more countries in North America and Europe. We recently started shipping to customers in Canada, Mexico, France, Netherlands and Luxembourg. We plan to pilot our fourth generation battery in the US later in the year and begin production in early 2025. This new battery will feature -- will feature a better cost structure and a smaller form factor thanks to its integrated battery management and power conversion architecture. Additionally, the meter collar and the enhanced IQ combiner will be introduced along with the fourth generation battery to reduce our balance of system cost. As previously mentioned, we have expanded into many new markets with the IQ8 family of micro inverters and are now present in 43 countries. We plan to enter many more new countries by the end of the year. We aim to further increase our served available market by simplifying installations of small solar systems and social housing and ruling out balcony solar solutions to more European countries, starting with Germany. The other variant of IQ8P microinverter with the new three-phase cabling system is well-suited for small commercial solar installation, ranging from 20 to 200 kilowatts. We launched this product in North America in December last year and have installed over 200 sites with an average of 45 kilowatts of solar per site. The feedback of this product has been quite positive, and we expect the growth to accelerate in the coming quarters. We recently began shipping IQ8P commercial microinverters from our contract manufacturing facility in Texas. We are now producing both residential and commercial microinverters from our US manufacturing facility. Some of our US-made microinverter skews, which, when paired with select US-made solar racking equipment, can allow lease PPA and commercial asset owners to qualify for the domestic content bonus credit. This credit is valuable for customers at 10% of the overall project cost. We think this will be a good opportunity for us on both microinverters and batteries. Let me provide an update on IQ9 microinverters with gallium nitride. The IQ9 family will support higher DC input currents up to 18 amperes and higher AC grid voltages, including 480 volts for the small commercial market, which is a brand new market for us. Using gallium nitride high-voltage transistors, these microinverters will deliver higher output power at lower cost. We are on track to launch this product in 2025. Let's discuss EV charging. We showcased our upcoming EV charger for Europe at Intersolar, Munich in June. The charger offers a 22-kilowatt three-phase option and 11-kilowatt single-phase option. It integrates seamlessly with Enphase solar and batteries, allowing homeowners to optimize cost by using excess solar energy. Green charging or charging from solar is what it's called. Other key features include dynamic phase switch-in from single-phase to three-phase and vice versa, and a MID meter for a few countries, ISO 15118 support to talk to the car, OCPP cloud software support, and 1-ampere fine-grained current control to maximize green charging. We plan to introduce this charger in many European countries later in the year. Additionally, we recently launched our most powerful CS-100 EV charger for commercial fleet electric vehicles in the US. Our team is developing a bi-directional EV charger that will enable V2H and V2G capabilities as part of the Enphase system. The charger will feature modular GaN-based bi-directional inverters, providing up to 11 kilowatts for single-phase applications and 22 kilowatts for three-phase applications. The charger will be compatible with both 400 volts and 800-volt electric vehicles. We are targeting to release this product in late 2025. Let's now cover our IQ Energy Management software. Our software is rapidly evolving to handle the growing complexity of energy markets by using AI and ML for forecasting and optimization. We train our AI models with data from over 4 million systems. In Q2, we launched our latest software in Netherlands and Belgium to manage dynamic electricity rates, helping homeowners maximize ROI and reduce payback periods as electricity prices fluctuate hourly. We see AI as a crucial technology to scale and enhance our products and services. Let's discuss our installer platform. We recently introduced Solargraf, our design, proposal, and permitting software platform to the Netherlands. With built-in support for dynamic electricity rates, Solargraf software delivers the financial calculations that address the complexities of energy markets in the Netherlands. Solargraf is also available to residential and commercial installers in the US, Canada, Brazil, Germany, and Austria, and we expect to release it to many countries in the coming quarters. Let me conclude. We remain dedicated to delivering best-in-class home energy systems with a strong focus on innovation, quality, and customer experience. Over the last year, we have significantly expanded our global reach and have an exciting pipeline of new products set to launch worldwide in the coming year. We have successfully normalized our channel inventory by the end of Q2. Our customer demand has increased by 5% in Q2 as compared to Q1. Our battery business is also doing very well with growth from quarter to quarter. Our bookings in Q3 are the healthiest that they have been in a year. Our early commitment to US manufacturing is positioning us well with leased PPA and commercial asset owners. We also expect the Fed to lower interest rates later in the year, improving solar economics for the US consumers. Our efforts to capture market share in Europe and other international regions are also promising. Despite continued macroeconomic challenges, we are confident in our revenue recovery and remain bullish about our long-term growth prospects. With that, I will turn the call over to Mandy for her review of our finance. Mandy?
Mandy Yang: Thanks, Badri, and good afternoon, everyone. I will provide more details related to our second quarter of 2024 financial results, as well as our business outlook for the third quarter of 2024. We have provided reconciliations of these non-GAAP to GAAP financial measures in our earnings release posted today, which can also be found in the IR section of our website. Total revenue for Q2 was $303.5 million. We shipped approximately 608.3 megawatts DC microinverters and 120.2 megawatt hours of IQ batteries in the quarter. Non-GAAP growth margin for Q2 was 47.1%, compared to 46.2% in Q1. GAAP gross margin was 45.2% for Q2. Non-GAAP gross margin without net IRA benefit for Q2 was 41%, flat from Q1. We had a non-GAAP gross margin for Q2 included $18.4 million of net IRA benefits. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $81.7 million for Q2, compared to $82.6 million for Q1. We continue to invest in new products, customer service, and sales. GAAP operating expenses were $135.4 million for Q2, compared to $144.6 million for Q1. GAAP operating expenses for Q2 included $49 million of staff-based compensation expenses, $3.5 million of amortization for acquiring intangible assets, and $1.2 million of restructuring and asset impairment charges. On a non-GAAP basis, income from operations for Q2 was $61.1 million compared to $39 million for Q1. On a GAAP basis, income from operations was $1.8 million for Q2, compared to a loss of $29.1 million for Q1. On a non-GAAP basis, net income for Q2 was $58.8 million compared to $48 million for Q1. This resulted in non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.43 for Q2 compared to $0.35 for Q1. GAAP net income for Q2 was $10.8 million compared to GAAP net loss of $16.1 million for Q1. This resulted in GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.08 for Q2, compared to GAAP diluted loss per share of $0.12 for Q1. We exited Q2 with a total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balance of $1.65 billion compared to $1.63 billion at the end of Q1. As part of our $1 billion share repurchase program authorized by our Board of Directors in July 2023, we repurchased 891,896 shares of our common stock in Q2, at an average price of $112.02 per share for a total of approximately $100 million. We have $648.1 million remaining for further share repurchases. In addition, we spent approximately $7.5 million by withholding shares to cover taxes for employee stock vesting and options in Q2. That reduced the diluted shares by 66,126 shares. We expect to continue this anti-dilution plan. In Q2, we generated $127 million in cash flow from operations, and $117.4 million in free cash flow due to our strong working capital management. Capital expenditure was $9.6 million for Q2, compared to $7.4 million for Q1. Capital expenditure increased due to an increase in our US manufacturing spending. Now let's discuss our outlook for the third quarter of 2024. We expect our revenue for Q3 to be within a range of $370 million to $410 million, which includes shipments of 160 to 180 megawatt hours of active battery. We expect GAAP gross margin to be within a range of 45% to 48%. We expect non-GAAP gross margin to be within a range of 47% to 50% with net IRA benefit and 39% to 42% before net IRA benefit. Non GAAP gross margin improved stock based compensation expense and acquisition related amortization. We expect the net IRA benefit to be between $30 million and $33 million, an estimated shipment of 1.1 million units of US microinverters in Q3. We expect our GAAP operating expenses to be within a range of $138 million to $142 million, including approximately $59 million estimated for stock compensation expense, acquisition related amortization, and restructuring. We expect our non GAAP operating expenses to be within the range of $79 million to $83 million. We expect our GAAP and non-GAAP annualized effective tax rate, excluding discrete item for 2024, to be at 18% plus or minus 1% with net IRA benefits. With that, I'll open the line for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question today will come from Philip Shen with ROTH Capital Partners. Please go ahead.
Philip Shen: Hi, everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. First one here on sell-through. Q2 was $396 million, the midpoint of your Q3 guide is $390 million. But batteries are up meaningfully. So I was wondering if you could share what you expect the sell-through to be in Q3. Can you confirm there's no destocking in Q3? And then when do you expect to return to the $450 million to $500 million of normalized revenue? Is it still on the table for the back half, or is it potentially more in '25? Thanks.
Badri Kothandaraman: Yeah, there is no destocking for Q3. And then on the -- you should always now think about us as achieving balance between sell-in and sell-through. In other words, we only need to report under-shipment or over-shipment if we do not have a balance. So now, going forward, the channel is balanced, and we are in good shape. So, answering your question on the $450 million, we are very optimistic. As you can see, our sell-in revenue in Q2 was $303.5 million. Our sell-in revenue at the midpoint of guidance for Q3 is $390 million. That's a good growth rate, and we are extremely optimistic. So, like what I talked about, we have successfully normalized our channel inventory. Our battery business is very healthy. We went from 75.5 million -- or 75.5 megawatt hours in Q1 to 120 megawatt hours in Q2. Now we are guiding 160 megawatt hours to 180 megawatt hours in Q3 and California is contributing to it in addition to the other regions. Like what I said, our customer demand in Q2 increased by 5% as compared to Q1. So we are building in a little bit of conservatism there and building in some potential risks into our guidance. That's why we gave you $370 million to $410 million. Our Q3 bookings are the healthiest they have been in a year. I told you about over 85% bookings and that too after removing a bunch of risks that we evaluate continuously on a worldwide basis. Our early commitment to US manufacturing is positioning us well with the lease, PPA and commercial asset owners. This is the definite bluebird for Q4. We expect the Fed to lower interest rates later in the year, so that will also be a tailwind improving solar economics for US consumers. Our efforts to capture market share in Europe, like what I said, Europe Q3, there is seasonality but like what I said, we are under penetrated in Europe. There are so many countries where we are making good progress. So we feel very optimistic about growth in Europe.
Operator: And our next question will come from Mark Strouse with JPMorgan. Go ahead.
Mark Strouse: Yes, good afternoon. Thank you very much for taking our questions. So your gross margins continued to be very resilient. I remember leading up to the micro manufacturing getting ready to scale, you gave guidance as far as kind of the split of the 45X tax credit that you thought you could keep. I'm curious on two things. On the battery side, as that gets ready for ramp in the US, if you can give us a split of what that credit might look like for you. And then also -- excuse me, with the domestic content ITC adder language being out there, if a customer is going to get an incremental $0.30 to $0.40 per watt how much of that do you think that Enphase could potentially keep versus passing on to the customer to stimulate demand? Just any pricing strategy comments would be helpful. Thank you.
Badri Kothandaraman: Right, so basically the first question we work on gross margins a lot. We have a cost reduction program that is going on continuously for microinverters and batteries. We are making a lot of progress in it. I expect our non GAAP gross margins without IRA to continuously improve. I'll tell you, the dynamics in the battery business are the cell pack prices are going down. We are making our microinverters -- starting to make our microinverters for batteries in the US, and we are also making some fundamental changes in the architecture in going from the third generation to the fourth generation. Additionally, even in the third generation, the serviceability of the batteries and the system controllers for backup is approximately 90%. 90% serviceability means that you do not need to take batteries off the wall. You basically service them in situ, which means very often a problem becomes simply replacing a board that may be worth only $50 and not taking out a $5,000 battery. That's the advantage of our architecture. It is easily serviceable and we have made it modular. So gross margins -- actually, we are very bullish on gross margins both with and without IRA. As far as your question on IRA, most of the IRA benefit for us comes from microinverters. We are only now starting to ramp on our batteries. The microinverters inside the batteries are increasingly made in the US. Last question is the benefits. It is too early to talk about it. The good news is we are -- we have our act together on the domestic content. We are talking to everybody that matter, and we are working out the details with them. Our intention is that, you know, this entire incentive may be a good thing ultimately for the end consumer and I'm not sure what the plans of several lease and PPA providers are, whether are they going to keep it for themselves or are they going to pass it down. I'm sure it is a mix as far as we are concerned I mean, we will be for us, it involves setting up even more factories. For example, previously we weren't manufacturing the enclosure for the microinverters in the US. Now we are going to be manufacturing that enclosure in the US. We are setting up factories, and we basically will be looking to charge for value. But this is a good thing for the end consumer, especially with incentives we are talking about in the range of $0.40 per watt which is 10% of project cost.
Operator: The next question will come from Brian Lee with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Brian Lee: Hey, guys, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the questions. Maybe this is for either Badri or Raghu. Can you talk about the competitive landscape at all? Just thoughts around some reports Tesla Powerwall 3 gaining traction and then maybe on the flip side, your most direct MLPE peer having some struggles. Just kind of what's the market share landscape looking like for you? Are you gaining some traction? And then secondarily, as we think about 4Q, just some of the moving pieces, is it fair to assume battery shipments continue to grow sequentially into 4Q. Badri, you mentioned Europe is seasonal in 3Q. But do we take that to mean that it bounces back in 4Q? And then can you talk at all about kind of the domestic content demand you are seeing if you can quantify at all what uplift you might see in 4Q. Thanks guys.
Badri Kothandaraman: Got it. I'm going to give some detailed color on competitive situation and then Raghu will add more. For the people who did not listen to my prepared remarks, our installers are steadily ramping on NEM 3 and we are talking primarily about California here. The battery attached in California is increasing. Our numbers, like what I said, overall worldwide shipments were 75.5 megawatt hours in Q1, growing to 120 megawatt hours in Q2 and guiding 160 megawatt hours to 180 megawatt hours in Q3. So battery attach and a lot of it is coming from California indeed. California as of last week, 60% of our installations happening. So this is brand new data, fresh data, and we do a lot of installations per week. So this is important. 60% is NEM 3, 40% is NEM 2. Battery attach we are noticing is obviously very high for NEM 3, greater than 90% compared to NEM 2. Good news is half of our NEM 3 solar is still attached to Enphase batteries. This data has been consistent for the last two or three quarters. One more point for you to note is we provide a strong value proposition for grid type batteries and this data I did not say in the prepared remarks, but our NEM 3 batteries, over 70% are grid type and our grid type batteries are very easy to install. Many customers just prefer two five kilowatt hour batteries. No extra balance of system, no complexity. The existing combiner box can be used. We have something called Enphase power control software that will make sure that we can do a lot of things in software and do not need to add any more hardware than what is necessary. And no main panel upgrades are required because of Enphase power control software. And I talked to you about 24x7 support, easy serviceability, highest warranty in the industry, 15 year warranty. We are able to do that because of our architecture. We don't use fans, we have air cooling. No single point of failure. For backup. Backup is a little more complex. There is going to be more dollars the user has to shell out because the useful backup probably is about 20 kilowatt hours battery and for backup we are streamlining our balance of systems. We are going to have a new ten kilowatt hour battery and we are basically embedding the neutral. So we are eliminating the system controller and we are enhancing our combiner there. We are reducing the number of things they have to buy and basically we'll have a best in class solution there. On the PV side, I didn't explicitly say the advantages over a string inverter are numerous. First of all, obviously, high power production, enhanced power production could range anywhere from a couple of percent to 15% more. Safe AC architecture. No high voltage DC on your roof. That's the single most important factor, for example, that some people in Europe select our product. It's simply because no high voltage DC on the roof. Per panel monitoring. I was in Austria and Switzerland recently, per panel monitoring was they say, we want to see everything that is happening. For panel monitoring is very important for them. 25 year warranty versus inverters we may be talking about our ten year warranty. I mean 25 year warranty matters, and obviously the domestic content readiness. So domestic content readiness, of course, our competition will also be ready and we believe that we have a good solution there and we are going to make it even better for both microinverters and batteries. So we will be able to capture some value there. So those are all of the puts and takes on the competitive situation. I'll have Raghu qualify the competitive situation more, but I'll answer the other question. Battery, do we expect Q4 growth. At this point it's early for me to guide anything, but we do expect Q4 growth and domestic content. How much of the Q3 number includes domestic content? Little to zero. Domestic content is a conversation that we are having and we expect it to pan out in the fourth quarter. Raghu, talk about anything more?
Raghu Belur: Yeah, I think as Badri mentioned, we have a very strong value proposition, and really this has been the value proposition from the very onset of the company, is that compared to centralized big box solutions, just have much better performance, better reliability, as reflected in the 25 year warranty, and no high voltage DC anywhere. So much greater safety. The value proposition becomes even more important when you think about the new tariff structures like NEM 3, which is all about arbitrage and required batteries. And this is where, as we said, for a homeowner, if they can get just a 10 kilowatt hour battery, grid tied, which means you connected into the existing combiner box, your value proposition for NEM 3 significantly improves. So our battery, the modularity of a battery, the high power, and the fact that it can be done in 10 kilowatt hours with two of the IQ Battery 5P makes it a very, very good fit. But we also mentioned that for backup, there's a lot of work that we're doing to make it as easy to install as the grid tied solution as well. So we've always said decentralization is the key. Distributed architecture is just always win in the long run for cost, performance and reliability.
Operator: Our next question will come from Andrew Percoco of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Andrew Percoco: Great. Thanks so much for taking the question. I did just want to come back to the $450 million to $500 million run rate that you guys were talking about earlier this year. You guys have obviously done a good job at clearing out the channel inventory, but it just feels like over that time period, demand has stayed relatively stable at about $400 million or so on a per quarter basis. So I'm just kind of curious where you think the growth is going to come from, from here if you look at the 4Q and then into 2025? I know you guys don't officially guide that far out, but what markets are you expecting the growth to come from in Europe or in the US? And I guess how much of that will be battery driven versus micro driven? Thank you.
Badri Kothandaraman: Right. So I think maybe you were not there in the prior -- when I answered a question a couple of questions ago. So let me go through those points. As you rightly said, we did not guide Q4, but we are very optimistic based upon what we are seeing. We have successfully normalized our channel inventory by the end of Q2. Our customer demand increased by 5% in Q2 as compared to Q1. Our battery business is doing phenomenally well, 75.5 megawatt hours in Q1, 120 megawatt hours in Q2, midpoint of guidance 170 megawatt hours in Q3. And we naturally expect it to do well. Our Q3 bookings are the healthiest that they have been in a year. These are the leading indicators for you. Our early commitment to US manufacturing is positioning us well with respect to the commercial asset owner, leads PPA and commercial asset owners. So that one is a huge opportunity for the commercial asset owners, and we expect to offer solutions to them there. And we expect them to be highly value-added solutions, which can drive demand. Additionally, we are hearing that the Fed will lower interest rates this year at least once, improving solar economics for US consumers. On the international side, I talked at length about Netherlands. I talked at length about France. I talked about Germany. And there I think in Netherlands we are going to -- we just introduced Solargraf software platform that enables the installers to sell effectively at the kitchen table, incorporating things like the dynamic tariffs in absence of NEM 3 -- I mean, absence of NEM. So we just introduced our 5 kilowatt hour battery, the latest and greatest battery, into Netherlands. We plan to introduce our EV chargers there towards the end of Q3 and early Q4. Coming to France, I mean, France is doing phenomenally well for us. Despite all of this, France has stayed very, very healthy. We just introduced our third generation battery in France. We are going to introduce solutions for IQ energy management, meaning software is what we said, for effectively managing, steering a hot water heater in France. We also expect to introduce the same IQ EV chargers there as well. In Germany, we are doing well. Our overall sell-through in Q2 was up compared to Q1. At the June Intersolar, Munich, we unveiled our three-phase battery backup. This is a three-phase solution with backup, and it's a highly differentiated solution. It's the smallest size battery with three-phase capability. In addition, that battery is going to have phenomenal round-trip efficiency because we are innovating on turning off the unused microinverters when the consumption of the user is pretty low that enhances the efficiency and avoids waste. So round-trip efficiency is going to be better than competition. So that battery is going to open up a nice tank in Germany, Austria, and Switzerland, where there are large homes and three-phase backup. Backup by the way is simply an emotional requirement. They really do not have outages, but it is a requirement because people are worried because of incidents like Ukraine. So additionally, we are launching balcony solar into Germany in Q3. And the IQ balcony solar product that we introduced at Intersolar in June, that was the hit of our show. That's what we consider the hit of our show because that one is a beautiful product. It produces -- there are two panels and this balcony gateway basically connects to those two panels and then you're allowed to export up to 800 watts into the wall socket in Germany. And people can even add, they can go from two to four panels, still only exporting 800 watts, but there is an auxiliary socket on the balcony gateway where you can plug in additional loads and make use of the extra solar. Furthermore, if there is a backup, meaning if there is a power outage, there is a relay in the gateway that will automatically open and disconnect the connection to the wall socket, but still maintains powering the appliance connected into the auxiliary socket. So sunlight backup is available for ultra-low cost there. So we expect balcony solar, that's a TAM of 400 megawatts. We're expecting 400 megawatts just in Germany. We expect to replicate that solution everywhere into Europe. So that's what we introduced at Intersolar. Of course, our EV charger, I talked about it. We are going to introduce our EV charger in all the countries there. And then I made a statement in my prepared remarks that we are strong in France, we are strong in Netherlands, we are strong in Germany, we are still under-penetrated in UK, Italy, Spain, Belgium, Luxembourg, Switzerland, Austria, Sweden and more. And we plan to introduce our entire product portfolio, the same things I talked about, microinverters, batteries, EV chargers, energy management software, balcony solar and Solargraf. And what do homeowners want? They want the same thing. They want safety, no high voltage DC. They want high quality system to work. They want savings because they have these dynamic rates. And they want an all-in-one experience, all-in-one app. They don't want one thing from one supplier, one thing from another supplier, and it doesn't work for them. They don't want to go to two apps, three apps, no. They want to do an all-in-one app. So, a lot of new products are coming. Many of them or some of them will be available in Q3. Some of them will be available in Q4. But like what I said, they are all going to propel us in the right direction.
Operator: And our next question will come from Colin Rusch with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.
Colin Rusch: Thanks so much. Guys, can you talk about the guidance for the batteries? How much of that is for the growth from new geographies and channel fill and how much is coming from existing markets? And then, as you think about introducing the IQ9 and the evolution of module sizes and efficiency, can you speak to the product market fit and any potential headwinds you have for bringing that product to market?
Badri Kothandaraman: Yeah. I mean, we usually don't break out the regions, but I will tell you, we expect Europe is a little bit seasonal, so I think maybe a little down to flat in Europe. But the growth -- a lot of the growth is coming from US and a lot of growth in California on batteries. And Colin, your second question?
Colin Rusch: The product market fit, given the evolution of module efficiency, form factor, etc, any headwinds you're expecting as you bring that to market?
Badri Kothandaraman: Right. IQ9, actually I can talk about IQ9. Yeah, IQ9, we are working very hard on IQ9. IQ9 is going to be GaN based. And GaN is a very interesting technology. It allows us to offer higher power for the same cost structure. So what will we offer? What will Enphase offer for IQ9? We are going to -- our first product will be focused on the commercial market where today we do not play, which is the 480 volt small commercial market. So we will introduce a 427 watt product for the small commercial market three phase. It will have an outstanding cost structure. We are -- the key innovation in GaN is instead of four silicon FETs that we have, we will have two bi-directional GaN switches. So that is how you save cost. Another way you save cost is if you run those switches at high frequency, even double the frequency 100 khz becomes 200 khz or 300 khz. There is opportunity to drop the main transformer size big, and therefore the cost structure big. So our internal goals are to make the cost on an absolute basis for this product the same as IQ8, which means cost per watt would be automatically much lower. And on the heels of the 427 watts, we will also offer a 548 watts that will be for emerging markets as well as for some places in Europe and that will be available for both the residential as well as commercial, you know. Yeah, commercial customers. So, lot of plans. We expect to have the first IQ9 into market in 2025.
Raghu Belur: Great product, market fit, right? I mean, you asked that question. You're seeing that the module power is continuing to go up and so our plans in fact, we have the platform already developed that can address for the foreseeable future any increase in power and uniquely benefits Enphase, because as the power continues to go up, you can build that same system with fewer number of modules you don't need. If you were doing it with 20 modules before, now you can do it with 18 modules as opposed to a big box inverter. It doesn't matter, a seven kilowatt inverter is a seven kilowatt inverter. So we have some unique benefits when it comes to the direction in which the modules are going and we have the platform now, both, in fact, with IQ8 and getting better with IQ9 to address any increase in module power.
Operator: And our next question will come from James West with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.
James West: Hey, good afternoon, Badri. A quick question about the countries that you've highlighted where you're under penetrating in Europe. What is the strategy to increase penetration? Is that the new products? Is it adding more sales and dollars? That's the first question. The second question is around the commercial products business and kind of what you see is the outlook there?
Badri Kothandaraman: Yeah. It's quite simple. It is to introduce new products systematically into all of those regions, which we are. We are following it up, like, for example, every region -- almost every region has IQ8 microinverters today. Some of the regions will need three phase batteries and even single-phase batteries with backup that will be available by the end of the year. And then IQ EV chargers, what I told you similarly will be available again in Q4. We are steadily releasing the Solargraf platform in all of the -- to make sure we have a lot of revenue coverage there in those countries. And Solargraf platform helps us to enhance the value proposition that the installer can provide the homeowner at the kitchen table. The last bit is the IQ energy management software. So places where there are dynamic electricity rates, there aren't that many now, Germany, Sweden, Norway, Netherlands, those are the four, but I'm sure that, that's a phenomenon that will come. And every region will have its own thing there, time of use or an NEM 3 type tariff or a dynamic tariff and even imbalance in some countries, how we can help an imbalance, which are much more instead of a day -- instead us getting day ahead tariff, we may be getting information a few minutes ahead. So we are getting ready for all of that. But the short answer is more sales, more FAE coverage, great customer service 24/7 and making sure all our products are available there and handholding the installers, training them well is something that we do. We need to continue to do that for all of these regions. So I don't expect a step function, but I expect steady growth as we introduce products over the years.
Operator: And our next question will come from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Jefferies. Please go ahead.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Hey, guys. Thank you very much. Appreciate the time. Yeah, can you guys hear me? Hopefully. Thank you very much. Just wanted to kick off your first, just expectations on SunPower in third quarter here. Just wanted to make sure and confirm that it's been adjusted for kind of expectations on whatever happens there. And then maybe just more holistically as you think about that fourth quarter. I know you're providing third quarter guide here, but how do you think about the domestic contents? You talk about the value proposition being flipped. How do you think about that impacting sort of more of a step function recovery in the resi market here? I mean, clearly we've seen a little bit of a drag out in backlog ads in California, for instance. How do you think about that adding to overall volumetric health as we close out the year with that additional 10%?
Badri Kothandaraman: Yeah, thank you. So, first one, with respect to SunPower, we're not going to comment on customer specifics here, but as usual, what we do is when we give you guidance, we always take risks everywhere in the world, globally. And we have exactly done that in the guidance that we gave you. That's one. On the domestic content again, it is early to tell, but we like what we are seeing. We believe it's a, we'll start to see some output of the domestic content in Q4 that will be positive, hopefully for the industry because it is a large incentive, and that incentive can be used to propel demand to improve economics for the PPA providers, improve economics for the industry, making sure installers also their situation get robust. So I think it will benefit everybody in some way or the other. And we are happy to provide those solutions and we are, our product right now, we basically said certain select products that we have today, combined with racking, qualify even today for domestic content. We are making that better by increasing our domestic content, which is manufacturing enclosures for microinverters and getting that ready in the fourth quarter. So once that is in play, then we will be able to increase the percentage of domestic content available there and we will be able to service customers better. But I'm very excited by it. I think this, along with potentially the Fed rates, has got the potential to propel the market significantly in Q4.
Operator: And our next question will come from Eric Stine with Craig-Hallum. Please go ahead.
Eric Stine: Hey, thanks for sneaking me in here at the end. Just curious, you mentioned that 60% of your installs were or NEM 3. I mean, just curious how long you think it takes I know it's dragged on for some time. How long until you think you're through NEM 2. And then just thinking about the high attach rates, what do you think -- any way to ballpark where your energy storage volumes may be when that time comes?
Badri Kothandaraman: Yes. I mean, just if history were to tell you something, I think last time I told you approximately 50% three months ago. So right now it is 50% -- right now it is 60%. So I don't know the answer. Maybe another two, three quarters is when NEM 2 will eventually go. And yes, I mean, I think Raghu talked about grid type batteries. They provide the right economics, the bill offset, if you have one five kilowatt hour battery improves from something like 55 to 70. If you have two five kilowatt hour batteries, it can go from, can go to 85% to 90%. So the sweet spot is two five kilowatt hour batteries and that's for people who choose grid type. Now there are people who choose backup too. That's what we talked about earlier. So we do expect full conversion to NEM 3 to drive the battery attached. There is still, mathematically, if you see, only 60% is converted. Now, of course, many things plays into this, like the health of the installers, et cetera. So I cannot guide a number, but I think we are quite positive because, first of all, our revenue -- cell-through revenue in California has stabilized compared to Q1. In fact, it was up by 7% from Q1 to Q2. And I gave you a split up, which means microinverters were flat and battery was up by, I think I said 14%. So it is generally good news, but it is one quarter. We have to be cautious. We remain optimistic that this is going to drive our battery growth -- battery business significantly.
Operator: And our next question will come from Jordan Levy with Truist Securities. Please go ahead.
Jordan Levy: Good afternoon. Appreciate you all squeezing me in here. Maybe just a quick one for me. I appreciate all the details you all have continued to provide on US manufacturing and your outlook there. Just wanted to get your thoughts. Obviously a lot going on the geopolitical front, upcoming election both here in the US and in Europe. I just wanted to see how you're thinking about the risks there from maybe an IRA perspective, and then over in Europe.
Badri Kothandaraman: We think that -- of course, we don't control what happens there, right? So -- but we feel like we have a very sound business. Our value proposition of our product is excellent. And the business stands alone, independent of these incentives. So what -- now specifically talking about the IRA, obviously we have brought high technology manufacturing back to the US, and we are doing more of that now. We're creating jobs, we are making investments. And this, we believe, is something that is expected to be supported regardless of who is in the government. So we think we are doing all the right things. We share with you things like gross margin with and without the IRA. So it's giving you a lot of details about our business, regardless of incentives. So I think what happens? The outcome remains to be seen. It's not in our control. But I think we have done all the right things.
Jordan Levy: Yeah, absolutely. And then just a quick follow-up. I noticed you get the number of certified battery installers and saw some really nice growth there this quarter. I'm just wondering what initiatives are kind of driving those installer certification. Where would you expect that number to kind of trend?
Badri Kothandaraman: Yeah, I mean, those are reflective of the number of countries we are entering and the training that we are providing. We have a very active training department in worldwide, and we have an Enphase University. Of course, battery installations aren't simple, although the grid tide installations are getting there. So it does need some training, and we have a lot of installers getting trained both in the Europe -- in the US. The IQ battery 5P is a good product. It solved some of the earlier deficiencies that we had in terms of low power and wireless connectivity, etc. All of those are fixed. So it's being well received globally, not just the US. And now we are following it up with a three-phase battery to address the market. So that's what you're seeing. You're seeing that sort of strength training, not just big installers, focusing on all the installers. Like for example, when I was in Austria and Switzerland about a month ago, in Switzerland, I met about seven installers in a couple of days. And these are anywhere from 1 megawatt to 5 megawatts. Those are our installers. We celebrate them. We make sure that we provide them the correct guidance. We're not perfect many times. There are problems, but once we know, we solve the problems quickly. I think what you're seeing is this transformation from solar to energy, and I think you should expect this trend to continue. We have talked about it, but now it's really turning into a reality, where if you look at, number of markets have made this transition from solar to solar, plus battery, plus EV charger, plus heat pump. And so you can see how our products are aligning with that transformation. We are doing everything from continuing on an inverter side, going IQ8 to IQ9 to match module power increases. You're looking what we are doing on our battery with 5T battery and then the next generation 10 kilowatt hour battery, introducing the three phase battery for backup, introducing EV chargers, introducing all of the software. So you're seeing that the training that we now need to do to get people more comfortable with selling systems is also on the increase. And all of this is good for us because this is what our DNA is, building hardware software systems, building software systems that are software defined. And this is a unique advantage for us.
Operator: And our next question will come from Christine Cho with Barclays. Please go ahead.
Christine Cho: Thank you for taking -- for squeezing me in. In California, I think you said your customers who are getting your inverters are attaching your battery 50% of the time. Is this that different in California versus the rest of the US? I think you said 70% of your batteries are grid-tied and is great for NEM 3.0, the rate arbitrage. But outside California, I would think batteries are primarily used for backup and not for rate arbitrage. So I'm curious if you find that your market share for batteries is higher in California versus the rest of the US.
Badri Kothandaraman: You're correct that outside the US, batteries are used for backup. But there are some places in the US where there are a lot of grid services where you do have a lot of incentives simply for using the battery and helping the grid out, especially during summer. And Massachusetts is an example, the Duke PowerPair program is an example. So you're generally right, though. In the NEM world, a battery -- the grid is the battery. Therefore, when people add a battery, they really need it for some kind of security, emotional security. That's why it is with backup for most places in the US. In California, it is a function of rates, it's not NEM any longer, it's NEM 3. And therefore, there it makes sense. It's a pure economics game there in California. So grid-tied batteries make a lot of sense there. Market share -- coming to the market share, I don't know the answer to that, but I would say the market share between outside California as well as in California is probably equivalent.
Christine Cho: Okay. And then, I know you gave your sell-through numbers quarter-over-quarter, but would we be able to get your sell-through for storage in megawatt hours for 2Q? And I know that you said the channel is clear in general, but would you say that the weeks of inventory for batteries is also currently your standard eight to 10 weeks?
Badri Kothandaraman: Well, the batteries have an opposite problem. I'm very tight on batteries. And I can tell you that the weeks on hand in the US is less than eight weeks. And that's a good problem for us to have. We do need to make sure the installers have enough inventory. We're always going to stay in the guardrail of eight to 10 weeks in general. That's where we'd like to get to. But the batteries are very tight right now in the channel, meaning the channel is, I would say, short of batteries.
Operator: And our next question will come from Praneeth Satish with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Praneeth Satish: Thanks. Just two quick questions on domestic content here. First, you mentioned that the domestic content uplift with leased PPA providers will mostly come in Q4. There's no benefit included in the Q3 guidance, but your inverters qualify today, assuming you use domestic racking. So I guess the first question is, could we see any benefit in Q3 or maybe the tail end of Q3? And then secondly, Solar edge's inverter is also on track to be qualifying in Q4. So to the extent you do pick up any market share gains in Q3 or Q4 tied to domestic content with some of the larger leased PPA providers, do you think those gains will sustain into 2025?
Badri Kothandaraman: Yeah. Number one question -- first question is, right now, our guidance doesn't comprehend any domestic content for Q3, but you're right, it could be that, some of them may use what is already available. I don't know, but our guidance doesn't comprehend that yet. For Q4 all of our competitors will probably come with their own domestic content. So we need to continue to offer right value to our customers. And for us, the way we see it is MLPE we have the opportunity to climb up in domestic content quite a bit by making sure our enclosures are also made in the US. And so that can take us to a good number where you only need less percentage from racking or elsewhere. So we're focused on getting that out by the end of Q3 and early Q4, and then we expect the demand to go up there.
Operator: And our next question will come from Kashy Harrison with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.
Kashy Harrison: Good evening, everybody, and thanks for taking the questions. Badri, just maybe following up on your commentary that the global channel is normal exiting 2Q. You flagged in a prior question that batteries are less than eight weeks. And so I was just wondering if you could help us think through are there any other notable geographic differences between US and micros for -- sorry, US and Europe for micros and storage that we should be thinking through? Just trying to understand the health of the channel by product, by geography?
Badri Kothandaraman: Yeah. I mean, look, I gave you a global number. A global number is healthy is what I gave you. Of course, if I start giving you country by country, there will be some variability. I also mentioned that the batteries is a good problem that we are trying to fix, which means, I mean, it's not a good problem for customers. It is we got to fix it to make sure that the channel has enough inventory. But we are focused on that eight to ten weeks. Some regions might have close to eight weeks, some regions might have close to ten weeks. We are focused on that range. We will never allow that to exceed that range. We have statistical process controls in place where we talk about it, and we actually will not ship more into the channel. So, like what I said, we've normalized the channel on a global basis and we plan to keep it that way. That is why going forward, we will not be talking about cell.
Operator: And our next question will come from Dylan Nassano with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.
Dylan Nassano: Hey, good afternoon. Just on the Q2 bookings being the healthiest they've been in over a year. Can you say how much higher that 85% is compared to last quarter or last year? And do you feel like your visibility into forward demand has improved at all as the channels cleared?
Badri Kothandaraman: We don't really give numbers there, but we are talking about Q3 bookings, not Q2. Q3 bookings are over 85% and that's a healthy number. And that too after considering some puts and takes and considering the risk number is a good number, we do not have the visibility for Q4 right now because our lead time is of the order of eight weeks. So by definition, distributors will only book within that lead time.
Operator: And our next question will come from Ameet Thakkar with BMO Capital Markets. Go ahead.
Ameet Thakkar: Hi. Good afternoon. I just had one quick question on thinking about the balance sheet longer term. You guys have, like, I think, $730 million of convertible debt that will come to you, kind of call it over the next 20 months. You obviously have a very advantageous liquidity position. Can you just talk to us a little bit about how you think about the balance sheet longer term? You're buying back shares now? I mean, in terms of kind of, would you just plan on kind of delevering the business, or are you thinking about maybe accessing the traditional corporate bond market or some bank debt? Things?
Badri Kothandaraman: Yes. I mean, look, obviously, our first priority is to take into account the needs of the business, invest in the right things. If we need anything like the domestic content factory investment, we will do that. Second one, which we are actively looking, is, are there any new verticals and M and A areas that we can get inorganically in software, in power conversion, even in batteries. We're always looking at that. So, and the third is, if we find one and two, we don't have many opportunities or we have done what we can and then we repurchase shares as long as the share price is below a conservatively estimated intensity and we have done that exactly, in the last few quarters. We have done systematically. We've taken out, we have bought back our shares, $100 million per quarter. And like what Mandy said, she -- her team is excellent at free cash flow, even in a tight macroeconomic situation. Our free cash flow is $117 million, and we manage cash well. It's important for us, we'll continue to look at these three things like I said, and we'll make decisions along with our board on a quarterly basis. Mandy, do you want to add something?
Mandy Yang: Yeah. In terms of debt maturities, right. We only have about $102 million of principal amount due March next year, and that we could easily pay off out of our own cash, right. The 2026 convert, that is $632 million, still 20 months away. So we have a lot of optionalities there a year from now, right. Whether we pay off or partially refinance the current rate environment, we are not going to do anything earlier than that.
Operator: And our next question will come from Jonathan Kees with Daiwa Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Jonathan Kees: Oh, great. Thanks for working me in. Great to [indiscernible] I wanted to ask two things. One is the high level and second is the more housekeeping. Badri, if you can help me understand you're bullish in terms of your prospects. You're quite encouraged in terms of your markets that you talked about, France, Germany, Netherlands, and under penetrated countries, and that they're very promising I guess I'm trying to tie that in with. You have a peer in Europe who brought down the numbers for the year and cited a reduction in demand, specifically residential and for commercial and industrial utility was fine. And this is back in June. And then your MLPE peer a couple of months back, it said things are still looking kind of gloomy, in Europe, and yeah, since announced another forced reduction that's important for their staff, their employees there. So I know these are peers, but I guess I'm trying to tie in your outlook there. Your bullish outlook with what's happening with these data points is that the market just take off and in terms of last couple months? Did it really improve? Was this like a hockey thing? Did it just take off there? Or are you just doing something different from everybody else?
Badri Kothandaraman: No, I think, the key is, you need to understand in Europe every country, the dynamic. And for us, like what I said, I probably said it five times already in the call. We are underpenetrated in Europe. We are very strong in Netherlands, strong in France. We are strong in Germany. I gave detailed color on those markets. We are managing inventory well with our distributors and installers. We have a lot of opportunities in other countries where we are not -- where we are under-penetrated. And we are introducing new products there. So for us, we are still into learning about Europe and penetrating into Europe. So we have a lot more market left. Like, for example, we just introduced our balcony solar for Germany. And installers love that because they don't have access to a high-quality solution like that. Now they have access, and we can take that to every country. The three-phase battery, for example, same deal. The IQ EV charger. You see, I was, like what I said, when I went to Switzerland and Austria -- actually Switzerland, very interesting. They are willing to pay a very high price for their EV charger. And they just want deep integration, smart EV charger, integrate that with solar plus storage plus EV charger with software and manage heat pumps. We need to get better at all of that, but that's the opportunity for us, and every market is unique. We have to be -- our strength is to work with a long-tail installer. We are not in the utility scale. And like some of the news that you heard, we are not yet in large scale commercial. We are scratching the surface on small commercial, but we are firmly implanted on the residential side. On the residential side, our strengths are supporting all of the installers, managing inventory tightly, helping our distribution partners and growing cities. That's why our sell-through in Europe we talked about -- sell-through was up 3% from Q1 to Q2. Netherlands was down 15%. But France was flat, Germany was up 7%, and you had a bunch of growing countries which weren't present before. So long answer, but we are very optimistic there about all of these countries and our plans to introduce robust solutions to each other.
Operator: And our next question will come from Maheep Mandloi with Mizuho. Please go ahead.
David Benjamin: Hi. This is David Benjamin for Maheep. I've got a quick question. Thanks for squeezing me in. I was wondering, if you could clarify the timing on IQ9. Is that a first half or second half launch? And then, on Europe, we were hearing about 5% to 10% decline in pricing in Europe. I was wondering, you had any comments on the pricing competition there in Europe?
Badri Kothandaraman: Yeah. I mean, on IQ9, we think it will be in the second half of the year and not too much beyond Q2 though. That's what we think. And then, on the other one, pricing comment, no, we are not planning to do. We don't have any plans today to change our pricing.
Operator: And our next question will come from Dimple Gosal with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Dimple Gosal: Thank you. Appreciate you taking the time. Can you just elaborate on that, please? I think on the last call, Badri, I think you guys spoke about being open to price concessions, if needed. And I think the market from what we're hearing from our peers is becoming increasingly promotional. So just how your strategy might differ between the two markets, US and Europe on ASP strategy?
Badri Kothandaraman: Yeah. I mean, look, we have done the same thing for six years or seven years, our strategy is no different. We have something called -- we do have special pricing adjustments based upon installers, their volume -- value that we provide. So there isn't anything extraordinary we are planning to do. At the end of the day, Enphase products need to add value compared to the next best alternative, and we are focused on that. The moment we feel we don't add value, we will take the appropriate action. But at this point in time, there is nothing very different going on between the US and Europe. The pricing situation is relatively stable in my opinion.
Operator: And our next question will come from Austin Moeller with Canaccord Genuity. Please go ahead.
Andrew Steinhardt: Hi. It's Andrew Steinhardt on for Austin. Thanks for squeezing me in. Two-part question. I'm sorry if I missed this on the first part. Is the US battery facility on target to be up and running in Q3, in line with previous guidance? And then second, is the Q3 net IRA benefit guide of $30 million to $33 million includes the forecasted sales for the IQ8P commercial inverters in the US and the new US battery manufacturing facilities operations. Thank you.
Badri Kothandaraman: Yeah. To answer, we are a little late on the battery manufacturing. We only expect it to begin in Q4, and that is because we are doing -- we are changing our approach on -- due to the domestic content guidance from the treasury, there are a few more things we have to manufacture in the US. They're already going to do power conversion, battery management in the US. We need to pull in the enclosure and the chassis also, which we are working on. So that's going to take us to the fourth quarter. And regarding your question on the $30 million to $33 million, yes, it includes IQ8P, true, and it does not include -- I mean it does include the microinverters for the batteries as well.
Operator: And our next question will come from Graham Price with Raymond James. Please go ahead.
Graham Price: Hi, good afternoon. Just one quick one for me on the Netherlands. Sell-through was down 15% quarter-over-quarter. You mentioned Europe overall was up 3%. So just wondering what impact does the slowdown in the Netherlands have on your normalized overall EU revenue?
Badri Kothandaraman: I mean, you're seeing it already. This is the impact it is having. Our Europe numbers were flat from Q1 to Q2 and the sell-through was only up by 3%, but there is an opportunity here. While Q3 will still be seasonally weak, there is an opportunity to turn Netherlands into having a very high battery attach. And that is what we are working on. We do have several hundred thousand homes in Netherlands as an installed base. And we just introduced Solargraf software platform. We're going to be working with installers to help them sell this to consumers better at the kitchen table because right now, consumers are little stooped on the exact regulatory uncertainty. They don't know when NEM is going to go. They're worried about penalties from the energy providers. We can take care of penalties by doing intelligent things like with the IQ software -- IQ energy management. For example, you'll find this in our investor deck now. But when you -- let's say, for example, when there is excess energy that the grid has and it doesn't mean any more solar, it can provide an intelligent signal or a day ahead tariff, that's called as negative tariff. Negative tariff means that you don't produce PV, you actually are paid to consume and charge your battery. You're paid to consume power. You don't export PV, you curtail PV. And business models like that are going to come. Many of the utilities would want some of that capability because many times, they are losing several millions of dollars dealing with this imbalance. We do have a unique opportunity to assist there because we have a nice installed base. We can add a 5-kilowatt hour battery and we can assist there. So I think Netherlands will -- it might remain weak for some time, but I clearly see good potential, actually enormous potential batteries in that market. And I talked about other regions as well, and we have several new products for the region, the IQ EV charger, Balcony Solar, three-phase battery, Solargraf everywhere. So we're going to be introducing a lot of products into Europe.
Operator: And our next question will come from Tom Curran with Seaport Partners. Please go ahead.
Tom Curran: Thank you. Badri or Raghu, are you still expecting to hit the battery gross margin target of 35% at some point in the second half year, so let's say, before calendar 2024? And then, my second question, sticking with batteries in California under NEM 3.0. When it comes to the 50% of your NEM 3.0 systems that are attaching a rival's battery, I think we've been assuming that's mainly been Tesla Powerwall 3 with maybe a smattering of SolarEdge's home battery and then Franklin's Franklin Home Power Systems in there. But has there been any interesting changes in that 50%? And how is your strategy evolving for trying to capture a higher portion of that?
Badri Kothandaraman: Yeah. I think we talked about it, but let me clarify. Gross margin on batteries is, we don't really break the gross margin between batteries and inverters. But our battery margins are doing healthy. Cell pack pricing is coming down rapidly. Our serviceability is increasing, that means service costs, warranty costs are going down. Then we will we have some benefit from the IRA where we make microinverters for the batteries in the U.S. So those three contribute towards very good GM, improving GM on the battery sequentially quarter-over-quarter. And then, we do have architecturally fourth generation battery, where we are cutting down the form factor by doing some deep integration of battery management and power conversion, and we are cutting the number of goods on that from the third generation to the fourth generation significantly. And so that one also helps us architecturally. So that will continuously improve our gross margin. And then, to answer the other question, we cannot name who is the other 50%. But that 50% attach for Enphase to NEM 3.0 solar systems has remained steady, like what I reported in the last two or three quarters. It's been steady, and I cannot confirm the rival names. I can say one thing. Our plan is to -- we talked about our plans. Today, we are 70% -- over 70% of those installations are grid tied, and we are going to be introducing a brand-new battery, meter collar and an enhanced system controller. The battery will be 10-kilowatt hours. So that means the modularity will be 10-kilowatt hours and not 5. Also the battery will have a neutral in it, which means that we are eliminating the system controller in fewer boxes. And we are enhancing the combiner to have a lot of bells and whistles. So the installer feedback is taken and they can connect even EV chargers, it's just enhanced functionality there. So I think we are well on our way there. We expect to introduce our fourth generation system, which is the battery, the collar, enhanced combiner in the first quarter of 2025, and we expect that to do well.
Operator: And this will conclude our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Badri Kothandaraman for any closing remarks.
Badri Kothandaraman: Thank you for joining us today and for your continued support of Enphase. We look forward to speaking with you again next quarter.
Operator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines at this time.

===== 2024 Q1  (2024-04-23 16:30:00) =====
Operator: Good day, and welcome to the Enphase Energy First Quarter 2024 Financial Results Conference Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] Please also note, today's event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Zach Freedman. Please go ahead.
Zach Freedman: Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us on today's conference call to discuss Enphase Energy's first quarter 2024 results. On today's call are Badri Kothandaraman, our President and Chief Executive Officer; Mandy Yang, our Chief Financial Officer; and Raghu Belur, our Chief Products Officer. After the market closed today, Enphase issued a press release announcing the results for its first quarter ended March 31, 2024. During this conference call, Enphase management will make forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, statements related to our expected future financial performance, market trends, the capabilities of our technology and products and the benefits to homeowners and installers, our operations, including manufacturing, customer service and supply and demand, anticipated growth in existing and new markets, the timing of new product introductions and regulatory and tax matters.

Now, I'd like to introduce Badri Kothandaraman, our President and Chief Executive Officer. Badri?
Badri Kothandaraman: Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today to discuss our first quarter 2024 financial results. We reported quarterly revenue of $263.3 million, shipped approximately 1.4 million microinverters and 75.5 megawatt hours of batteries, and generated free cash flow of $41.8 million. We reduced our channel inventory by approximately $113 million in Q1, slightly less than anticipated because of softer demand. For the first quarter, we delivered 46% gross margin, 31% operating expenses, and 15% operating income, all as a percentage of revenue on non-GAAP basis, including the IRA benefit. Mandy will go into our financials later in the call. Let's now discuss how we are servicing customers. Our worldwide NPS was 78% in Q1 compared to 77% in Q4. Our average call wait time was 1.9 minutes in Q1 compared to 1 minute in Q4. We are adding data scientists, enhancing our analytics to identify problems proactively, and fixing them automatically through software. Our field engineers and technicians are assisting installers on complex installations, while bringing back learning to our development teams, enabling continuous improvement. Let's cover operations. We shipped approximately 506,000 microinverters in Q1 from our US contract manufacturing facilities that qualified for 45X production tax credits. Once fully ramped, we expect to have a global capacity of approximately 7.25 million microinverters per quarter, of which 5 million capacity will be in the US. We expect to ship approximately 0.5 million microinverters to customers from our US manufacturing facilities in Q2. The number is a little less than what we would like, but our top priority is to reduce our factory inventory. We anticipate resuming a higher level of shipments in the second half of the year. For IQ Batteries, we have two cell pack suppliers, both in China, which have sufficient manufacturing capacity to support our ramp in 2024. As previously discussed, we expect to add battery manufacturing capability in the US during the third quarter of 2024. Let's now cover the regions. Our US and international revenue mix for Q1 was 57% and 43%, respectively. For more visibility into our business, we are providing regional breakdowns and sell-through dollar metrics by region. In the US, our revenue decreased 34% sequentially as we under-shipped to end customer demand. The overall sell-through of our microinverters and batteries in the US was down 23% in Q1 compared to Q4. Let's discuss the market trends we are seeing in the US, split by non-California states and California. For non-California states, our overall sell-through was 21% down in Q1 compared to Q4. The sell-through was similarly down for both microinverters and batteries due to seasonality. In California, our overall sell-through was down 30% -- down by 30% in Q1 compared to Q4. Sell-through of our microinverters was down 37% and sell-through of our batteries was down 18% in Q1 due to seasonality and the NEM 3 transition. I'll provide more statistics and color on NEM 3 later in the call. In Europe, our revenue increased 70% sequentially as channel inventory improved and we introduced new products. The overall sell-through of our microinverters and batteries was up 7% in Q1 compared to Q4. The sell-through of our microinverters was up 3%, while the sell-through of our batteries was up 28% in Q1. I'll provide some color on key markets in Europe, particularly Netherlands, France and Germany. In the Netherlands, our overall sell-through in Q1 was down 4% compared to Q4. The market stabilized during Q1 and we are encouraged by the demand signals we see after seeing the government's decision to support NEM for the foreseeable future. We expect to see the sell-through of microinverters pick up in Q2 as a result of this decision. We continue to believe solar plus batteries are going to become the norm as dynamic tariffs and grid services become more prevalent. In France, our overall sell-through in Q1 was up 13% compared to Q4. We have been encouraged by the continued strength in this market, supported by higher utility rates. Solar penetration in France is still small and we see potential for the country to grow and evolve into a significant solar plus battery market for Enphase. In Germany, our overall sell-through in Q1 was up 28% compared to Q4. We are going from strength to strength in this market. We plan to launch our three-phase battery solution in the country later this year, along with additional software. We are leveraging AI and ML to enhance our home energy management software and expand grid services participation. We are continuing to launch our IQ8 Microinverters and IQ Batteries into many new countries across Europe. Notably, we started shipping IQ Batteries into Italy in the first quarter. Our sell-through in the new countries is beginning to ramp and we anticipate steady growth throughout 2024. In Australia, our Enphase Energy systems are powered by IQ8 Microinverters and IQ Battery 5P, our third generation battery, which we introduced in June last year. We expect higher battery attachment rates in Australia during the second half of this year. In Brazil, we are making good progress in building our installer base. In Mexico and India, we are shipping our highest-powered microinverters, IQ8P, to support high-power panels. We just started shipping the same microinverters into Thailand and Philippines in Q1. As a reminder, IQ8P is the high-powered microinverter at 480 watts AC for both residential and commercial applications. Let me say a few words about our market share. In the US, we see stable share for our microinverters and batteries based on both internal and third-party data. There have been several changes in the market over the last year, including a shift away from loans and towards lease and PPAs. Our continued strong market share is a testament towards our installer relationships and the differentiated value proposition we provide them with our products. We are fully focused on enhancing our product portfolio, solving installer pain points, and deepening our relationships. In Europe, we are using the same strategy to grow market share. Let me provide some color on NEM 3.0. In the last three to four weeks, I've been on the road. We have visited over 25 installers in California to really understand how their businesses are doing. Many reported that their businesses are down by 50% or more from last year's high, and they have all adjusted by becoming much leaner. They are getting better at selling NEM 3.0. They can clearly articulate what works and what doesn't. They are hungry for high-quality leads. They are also becoming adept at selling batteries, either a grid-tied battery or a backup battery with every install. They are becoming flexible in the financing options they offer to the homeowners. If the loans don't work, they aren't afraid to switch over to leases or PPAs, which are becoming increasingly available to the [indiscernible]. Most of them reported stronger sales in March of this year compared to January and February. I came away feeling that we are beginning to climb out of the bottom and we should get back to growth shortly. Let's cover some NEM 3.0 statistics, which haven't changed that much from our last call. In Q1, 50% of our California installs were NEM 3.0 systems. These systems have a very high battery attach rate, over 90%, compared to NEM 2 systems which have an attach rate of 15%. Our data also shows that half of our NEM 3 systems are using Enphase batteries. Taking this data into account, our average revenue per NEM 3.0 system is approximately 1.5 times our average NEM 2.0 system. We believe this will contribute to stabilizing and increasing our California revenue in the second half. Let's come to our Q2 guidance. We are guiding revenue in the range of $290 million to $330 million. We expect to ship 100 megawatt hours to 120 megawatt hours of IQ Batteries. We expect sell-through demand of our products to be approximately $400 million in Q2, up from $376 million in Q1, due to seasonal strength in Europe and non-California states, offset by some decline in California. We plan to under-ship to the end market demand for our products by approximately $90 million in Q2. We expect the channel to normalize by the end of Q2 on microinverters as we previously forecasted. Our channel is almost normal on batteries already. Let's talk about products, starting with IQ Battery. Our third-generation battery called IQ Battery 5P has been very well received. It delivers the best power specs and commissioning times of any Enphase battery till date at an industry-leading 15-year warranty. Battery adoption rates are on the rise globally and we are well-positioned to grow our sales in 2024. As we discussed last quarter, we expect our gross margins on batteries to continuously improve throughout the year. There are three factors: cell pack costs, which are coming down rapidly; battery microinverter costs, which are coming down due to IRA benefit from manufacturing in the US; and costs coming down due to improved architecture on our fourth-generation battery. We are already seeing the benefits of the first two factors, and we will benefit from the third factor early next year. We are working on entering more countries in Europe and Asia with our third-generation battery. We expect to also introduce our new three-phase battery with backup for Germany during this year. We expect to launch several balance-of-system improvement initiatives for the US that will improve the cost of installing batteries for backup. We plan to pilot our fourth-generation battery later in the year. This battery will have a great cost structure and an elegant form factor due to the integrated battery management and power conversion architecture. As previously discussed, we have entered many new markets with the IQ8 family of microinverters and we are now in 24 countries. We plan to enter more new countries in Europe and Asia throughout 2024 with our microinverters. And we plan to increase our served available market further by introducing social housing and balcony solar solutions to European countries during the year. We recently launched the IQ Combiner Lite in Netherlands to simplify the installation of small solar systems on social housing units. The other variant of the IQ8P microinverter with the new three-phase cabling system is well suited for small commercial solar installs ranging from 20 kilowatts to 200 kilowatts. We launched this product in North America in December and we are seeing good early adoption. We are excited about the product and look forward to manufacturing IQ8P microinverters at our US facilities starting this quarter, further reducing costs. Let's cover EV charging. We launched our IQ Smart EV chargers in the US and Canada in Q4. We are developing smart EV chargers for European countries and we expect to introduce them this year. The team is also working on bidirectional EV charger, which will unlock use cases like V2G and V2H as part of the Enphase system. This charger will have a GaN-based bidirectional inverter. We expect to release the product in 2025. Let's cover the latest upgrades to our energy management software. We recently did a press release where we launched Enphase Power Control or PCS software that can integrate with our systems in North America. PCS dynamically controls the power produced by the Enphase system, giving installers a lot of flexibility in system design to build larger systems and avoid costly main panel upgrades while meeting utility and national electric code requirements. Our software is evolving to manage the increased complexity in energy markets by leveraging AI and ML for forecasting and optimization. Our next software offering will manage dynamic tariffs in countries like Netherlands and Germany. This new software is intended to help maximize ROI and reduce the payback period for solar homeowners throughout Europe, where electricity prices can change by the hour. Let me provide you with an update on IQ9 Microinverters with gallium nitride, also called GaN. We expect IQ9 Microinverters to deliver higher power at lower costs. Multiple vendors have been providing us with GaN parts and we are increasingly confident in the reliability of our design. We expect to launch the product in the first half of 2025 to address the two markets; one is residential and the other is three-phase small commercial markets, both the 208 volts as well as the 480 volts. Let's now discuss our Installer Platform. We announced some key features and improvements to Solargraf in Q1, including advanced 3D design with smart design capability, California NEM 3.0 support and enhancements, NREL and NYSERDA verification of shading, and support for small commercial projects. Solargraf is currently available to installers in the US, Canada, Brazil, Germany, and Austria, and we expect to release it to more countries in the coming quarters. Let me conclude. We have been managing through a period of slowdown in demand. We believe Q1 was the bottom quarter. Europe has already begun to recover, and we expect the non-California states to bounce back in Q2. California is becoming less of a wild card, and we expect demand to stabilize and increase in the back half of 2024. We are bullish about NEM 3 in the long term. The payback is attractive for solar plus batteries. The utility rates are going up steeply and the sales teams are learning rapidly. I am pleased that we have executed well through the market downturn over the last year. We have maintained profitability and free cash flow throughout this period while correcting the channel. We have not sacrificed any new product development or geographic expansion plans and are now entering growth cycle with a good product portfolio and a growing TAM, and there is still a lot more to come. We expect to begin field testing our microinverters, IQ9 microinverters, and fourth-generation batteries later in the year. We are making balance-of-system improvements to enable faster and easier battery installation. We plan to roll out significant software upgrades like PCS and dynamic tariffs in both the US and Europe. We remain laser-focused on operational excellence, concentrating on sell-through and installer count, reducing operating expenses and product costs, and maintaining healthy gross margin as our company returns to strong growth. With that, I will turn the call over to Mandy for a review of our financial results. Mandy?
Mandy Yang: Thanks, Badri, and good afternoon, everyone. I will provide more details related to our first quarter of 2024 financial results, as well as our business outlook for the second quarter of 2024. We have provided reconciliations of these non-GAAP to GAAP financial measures in our earnings release posted today, which can also be found in the IR section of our website. Total revenue for Q1 was $263.3 million. We shipped approximately 603.6 megawatts DC of microinverters and 75.5 megawatt hours of IQ Batteries in the quarter. Non-GAAP gross margin for Q1 was 46.2% compared to 50.3% in Q4. The decrease was primarily driven by lower net IRA benefit. GAAP gross margin was 43.9% for Q1. Non-GAAP gross margin without net IRA benefit for Q1 was 41% compared to 41.8% in Q4, mainly driven by lower volume. GAAP and non-GAAP gross margin for Q1 included $13.7 million of net IRA benefit. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $82.6 million for Q1 compared to $86.6 million for Q4. The decrease was the result of the restructuring plan we implemented in December 2023. GAAP operating expenses were $144.6 million for Q1 compared to $156.9 million for Q4. GAAP operating expenses for Q1 included $56.7 million of stock-based compensation expenses, $3.5 million of amortization for acquired intangible assets, and $1.9 million of restructuring and asset impairment charges. On a non-GAAP basis, income from operations for Q1 was $39 million compared to $65.6 million for Q4. On a GAAP basis, loss from operations was $29.1 million for Q1 compared to a loss of $10.2 million for Q4. On a non-GAAP basis, net income for Q1 was $48 million compared to $73.5 million for Q4. This resulted in non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.35 for Q4 -- Q1 compared to $0.54 for Q4. GAAP net loss for Q1 was $16.1 million compared to GAAP net income of $20.9 million for Q4. This resulted in GAAP diluted loss per share of $0.12 for Q1 compared to GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.15 for Q4. We exited Q1 with a total cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balance of $1.63 billion compared to $1.7 billion at the end of Q4. As part of our $1 billion share repurchase program authorized by our Board of Directors in July 2023, we repurchased 332,735 shares of our common stock at an average price of $126.21 per share for a total of approximately $42 million in Q1. In addition, we spent approximately $60 million by withholding shares to cover taxes for employee stock vesting and options in Q1 that result -- that reduced the diluted shares by 480,735 shares. We expect to continue this anti-dilution plan. In Q1, we generated $49.2 million in cash flow from operations and $41.8 million in free cash flow. Despite the macroeconomic challenges, we continued to generate free cash flow. Capital expenditure was $7.4 million for Q1 compared to $20.1 million for Q4. Capital expenditure requirements decreased due to a reduction in our US manufacturing spending. Now let's discuss our outlook for the second quarter of 2024. We expect our revenue for Q2 to be within a range of $290 million to $330 million, which includes shipments of 100 megawatt hours to 120 megawatt hours of IQ Batteries. We expect GAAP gross margin to be within a range of 42% to 45%. We expect non-GAAP gross margin to be within a range of 44% to 47% with net IRA benefit, and 39% to 42% before net IRA benefit. Non-GAAP gross margin excludes stock-based compensation expense and acquisition-related amortization. We expect the net IRA benefit to be between $14 million and $17 million on estimated shipments of 500,000 units of US-made microinverters in Q2. We expect to increase the US-made microinverter shipments to two-thirds of our overall microinverter shipments in the second half of this year. We expect our GAAP operating expenses to be within the range of $134 million to $138 million, including approximately $56 million estimated for stock-based compensation expense, acquisition-related amortization, and restructuring and asset impairment charges. We expect our non-GAAP operating expenses to be within a range of $78 million to $82 million. We expect our GAAP and non-GAAP annualized effective tax rate, excluding discrete items, for 2024 to be at 18%, plus or minus 1% with IRA benefit. With that, I will open the line for questions.
Operator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And today's first question comes from Colin Rusch with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.
Colin Rusch: Thanks so much, guys. As you start entering some of these newer markets with energy storage, can you talk about how much of the volume you're guiding to in 2Q could be considered sell-in into to build a little bit of inventory to support those customers?
Badri Kothandaraman: Yeah. Could you please repeat that question, Colin? I didn't follow that properly.
Colin Rusch: Sure. So, as you start selling energy storage into new markets, and looking at the 2Q guide, how much of that energy storage sales dynamic is actually selling into the channel and channel [fill] (ph), just to get prepared in this one?
Badri Kothandaraman: Not much really, because the new markets are just ramping for us. For example, we introduced storage into Italy in Q1. So, really that's the only one where we introduced into a new market. Prior to that, if you see, we introduced into a few European countries. Prior to that, we introduced in UK. In fact, our storage is -- the channel is very healthy. We are actually normalized as we speak on storage. That's what I said. We are there on storage. In fact, I'll give you a data that I didn't talk about in the call. Sell-through, our sell-through of batteries in Q4 overall worldwide was 140 megawatt hours. While the sell-through of batteries in Q1 was 128 megawatt hours, only 8% down. It's a much better than the seasonality of 20% that we are seeing on the other products. And so, batteries are doing well in general, yet despite the 128 megawatt hours of sell-through, we had the discipline to only ship 75.5 megawatt hours. That means we took 43 megawatt hours out of the channel. The channel is quite lean for storage. That's why you see we are increasing the guidance. When I guided for Q1, I guided 70 megawatt hours to 90 megawatt hours. Now, I'm guiding for Q2, I'm guiding 100 megawatt hours to 120 megawatt hours on storage. So, storage is a good story. We expect it to continue. We expect over the long term, every market to transition to solar plus storage. We talked about the color on some of our markets. Netherlands, we talked about. France, we talked about. Germany is already there. California will get there soon. So, in general, storage is a good story for us.
Colin Rusch: Thanks so much. And then, on the pricing dynamic, it looks like microinverter pricing was down maybe 4%-ish, 5% quarter-over-quarter on average. Can you talk a little bit about the dynamic around pricing and discounts as you get through the inventory flush? And what we can expect as you get into the mid of the year here?
Badri Kothandaraman: Right. And we measure something called ASP variance and we measure something called customer variance. A customer variance means how much pricing did you drop at a particular customer quarter-to-quarter. And ASP variance is simply a function of how your mix did. For example, if you have a lower pricing for a particular customer and his volume went up, it will show up as an overall reduction in ASP. Really the measure of effectiveness in pricing comes from customer ASP variance. Are you dropping pricing at a particular customer? And the answer is we are very disciplined there. So, what you are seeing is a result of mix, but we are extremely disciplined when it comes to -- you talked about, in order to move inventory, do you need to lower pricing? No, we don't do -- we don't play games like that. So, we are disciplined. We will be disciplined. We sell on value and what you're seeing is purely a product mix issue.
Colin Rusch: Excellent. Super helpful. Thanks, guys.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question today comes from Brian Lee at Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Brian Lee: Hey, guys, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the questions. Hey, Badri, can you talk a little bit about, you said at the onset of the call that you under-shipped demand in Q1 a little bit less than or destocked a little bit less than you would have expected just because demand was softer. So, the $90 million of destock, that should kind of clear the inventory for micros in 2Q. In your guide, you're saying normalized, you're seeing $400 million. So, are you inferring that normalized demand when you strip out the $90 million of destock is running at like $490 million? Because I know last call you were talking about $450 million to $500 million. So, maybe just high-level kind of walk us through your thought process of what demand you're seeing out there? What the normalized level looks like once you get through all this inventory reset? And then maybe what timeframe do you think you kind of get back to those normalized run rates as well?
Badri Kothandaraman: Got it. So, Brian, in Q1, our sell-through demand, which is end customer demand was $376 million, in Q1, and we reported revenue of $263.3 million. Therefore, you can do the math, $376 minus $263 million is $113 million of under-shipment. Now in Q2, I guided $290 million to $330 million, midpoint of guidance is $310 million. And now, I said my estimated sell-through in Q2, which is reflective of end customer demand is $400 million. So, the difference between the two, $310 million minus $400 million or the other way, $400 million minus $310 million is the $90 million of under-shipment. Now, what could that $400 million be in the second half of the year? That's where we are talking about the markets. We expect Europe, for example, to continuously improve. Netherlands government has approved net metering for the foreseeable future. We are starting to see the lead generation much higher in the Netherlands. That should start to result in -- resulting in increased sell-through and increased activations in Netherlands, which is a big deal. Next one is France. France, the utility rates are helping us. So, you can see despite this environment, we expect France to be strong. Third one is Germany. We reported sell-through of 28% higher in Q1 from Q4. And once again, there the cost of electricity is high and we expect solar and storage or solar and batteries to continuously grow. On top of it, I talked about our product introductions. In the last year, we have set ourselves up nice by introducing IQ8 and batteries everywhere. We are now in 24 countries. Even in Q1, we introduced batteries into Italy. Prior to that, we introduced into UK, then we introduced Sweden, Denmark, et cetera prior to that. I'm not going to list everything. So, we are attacking new markets in both Asia as well as Europe. And now let's come back to the US. In the US, the dynamics are non-California states and California states. I mean, yeah, in California. So, non-California states, there are multiple data points for us to tell you that things are improving. In the last few weeks, enough -- in the last few weeks, let's say, last four weeks, we are seeing better sell-through numbers compared to what we saw prior to that. That's the first data point. The second one is we have our internal Solargraf software, which is now being used by over 1,000-plus installers, and therefore we can look at sales, proposals, contracts we can see those numbers are continuously going up in March. The numbers are up in March versus February. Numbers are up in April versus March. So that's a good sign. Then, of course, it is anecdotal. My interactions with customers in California in the last four weeks, all of them universally said March is a much better sales month than February. The last one is you do see third-party analytics reports like that talk about permitting and you can see the -- in general, the permits for non-California as well as California are up in the month of March versus February. By the way, the trends that I told you are valid for both non-California as well as California in the last few weeks. So, we are cautiously optimistic that things are turning and that's why I said Q1 is the bottom quarter. That's why we are raising our guidance to $290 million to $330 million for Q2. That's why we said the sell-through is going up from $376 million to $400 million. And we expect with these growth trends, we expect a sell-through to continuously go up. And the last one, the point which I wanted to talk about was interest rates. We now hear that there are going to be likely two interest rates, two cuts instead of maybe three or four planned before. So anytime that there is a cut that is going to expand the non-California states even further, meaning the demand further. So, those all could come into play.
Brian Lee: Understood. Okay. No, that's super helpful. I guess, if we think about just again kind of trying to dissect the normalized demand outlook you have here. If it's -- the channel is clean exiting 2Q and you're looking at barring any meaningful mix changes, or pricing changes and demand staying basically where you think it is today, like $400 million. Is there any reason you would not be shipping that level in 3Q? I mean, is there any structural shifts to what the channel is willing to take or kind of lead times and things of that nature? I guess I'm just trying to understand how that $400 million -- what are the puts and takes for that $400 million to stay $400 million versus, again, I think there was a view earlier in the year that it would be higher than $400 million, but right now it is at $400 million. So, what moves that higher? And then, what potentially moves that lower if it were to go in the opposite direction?
Badri Kothandaraman: Yeah, I think what you said is correct. Meaning, once the channel is normalized, sell-in and sell-out should be balanced. So, that's right. So, for example, we do expect the sell-through in Q3 to be higher, but if you were to say it is -- sell-through remains around, let's say, $400 million level, our sell-in would remain similar because now we have taken all the inventory out. We don't need to do any under-shipment any longer. So, our sell-in and sell-out are balanced at that time. But like what I said, there are several vectors for that sell-through to improve in Q3, which I highlighted, all of the things in Europe, all of the new products we are introducing, non-California states, which are improving, California installers learning to do NEM 3.0, more financing options being available to the installers in general than before in the US, and us starting to ramp on small commercial products. So, all of that you know make me optimistic that sell-through would start to become higher in Q3 and beyond.
Brian Lee: All right. Appreciate it. Thanks, guys. I'll pass it on.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Kashy Harrison with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.
Kashy Harrison: Excuse me. Good evening, and thanks for taking the question. So, Badri, first one, you indicated last quarter sell-through expectation for Q1 of $390 million to $430 million, and sell-through to your point, came in at $376 million. And in the spirit of continuous improvement, I was wondering if you could just walk us through the specific input or approach to your forecasting methodology that was faulty, and then how you've adjusted for those errors heading into the second quarter? Essentially, what I'm just trying to get at is, are your forecasting approaches improving? And how -- and I'm trying to get to a point where the Street can have confidence that sell-through will land about where you expect to in the second quarter.
Badri Kothandaraman: Right. In general, we are not perfect. We forecast based on the seasonality. We were right in most places. And as I reported, the California numbers were a little bit worse and you can see that. The sell-through in California was about 30% lower, 37% on microinverters, and about, I think, 18% or 19% on batteries. So, I think California was the wildcard, which I did mention in the prior quarter. And I think we are getting though increasing confidence on California. I outlined everything which we discussed with the California installers. So, we are confident in our forecast right now and the first few weeks of the quarter seem to be trending in that direction.
Kashy Harrison: Okay. Fair enough. I appreciate it. And my follow-up question is on IQ9. You indicated the first half 2025 commercial release date, and I think you said pilot is later this year. How long would it take for IQ9 to ramp to 100%? And then, just strategically, can you talk about how you're thinking about using a lower-cost product both in the US and in international markets from a share perspective?
Badri Kothandaraman: Yeah. IQ9, first of all, we were going to -- we are working on two flavors. One is a 427 watt microinverter and the other is a 548 watt microinverter. The 427 watt microinverter would be what I would consider the bread and butter for the US in probably a year from today, which is right in the timeframe that we are introducing. And I would say that typically an introduction in the ramp for a new product like that would be four to six quarters based upon our experience with IQ8. So, two flavors, 427 watts and 548 watts. In the 548 watts, things get a lot more interesting. We are now going to have the 548 watts for three-phase, 208 volts as well as 480 volts small commercial installs. So, that'll be good. The principal thing about IQ9 is it uses gallium nitride. Gallium Nitride enables a high -- much higher power with similar form factor. It's got a good efficiency and it doesn't dissipate as much heat. So, when we are using it in our -- both the AC as well as DC FETs, we are able to get -- we don't need to blow up the microinverter form factor. And the other advantage with gallium nitride is it allows us to operate at a higher frequency. Earlier, we used to operate at -- or today in IQ8, we are operating at 100 kilohertz. With gallium nitride, we can go up to a megahertz and we need to -- we are working on our ASIC in order to get to that capability of a megahertz. But once you get to a megahertz, then what happens is you can basically get rid of your big transformers. And the transformer sizes can all go down. And anyone who knows about inverters know that there is a lot of dollars going in there. So, in terms of form factor, things will get a lot more tighter, so that now since they get tighter, you're not talking about blowing up the area due to higher power because one of the concerns always is efficiency. When you have higher power, if you operate at your same efficiency, you're dissipating a lot of heat. Like for example, at 548 watts, you have let's say, 97% efficiency, that means 548 watts times 3% that's 16 watts of power and 16 watts of heat. But with the gallium nitride FETs, we are able to operate them with good efficiency. And so, we don't need to blow up the inverter and we can keep it with an elegant form factor. For installers, we can look at bringing the dollars per watt continuously down. Because for us, the more compact we make the microinverter, the more integration we achieve, the better it is. And just as FYI, where there are four silicon FETs before on the AC side, we will only need two silicon FETs or transistors because we got something called as a bidirectional switch for GaN. It can operate both ways. So, just zooming back to a higher level, GaN will allow us to operate at higher power, lower efficiency with the same form factor thereby dropping the dollar per watt because you're increasing your power a lot.
Kashy Harrison: Helpful color. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question today comes from Mark Strouse at JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Mark Strouse: [Technical Difficulty] questions. Just got two questions on gross margins. For the 2Q guide, the 39% to 42%, that's down a bit from what you've been guiding the last couple of quarters. In response to Colin's question earlier, you mentioned mix as a part of that. I just want to confirm, are you kind of talking about kind of mix of just kind of random installers that you're selling to in a given period, or is there anything to signal as far as kind of international mix or storage mix? Any other color there would help.
Badri Kothandaraman: Yeah, there what I was talking on the question from Colin, which was microinverters was installer mix. That's correct. But this question that you are asking, the 39% meaning, we guided 39% to 42% for non-GAAP gross margin without IRA in Q2. Your question is why? And yes, we increased our battery guidance by 30 megawatt hours. As you can see, Q1 guidance was 70 megawatt hours to 90 megawatt hours. We increased 100 megawatt hours to 120 megawatt hours. That means we are -- the battery to microinverter ratio is increasing from before. We are getting a -- we are getting better and better and better on the gross margin of batteries, and you'll see those numbers continuously improve. On batteries specifically, I called out three factors. I said the cell pack costs are continuing to come down rapidly. We are beginning to manufacture now our microinverters, which are used in the battery. We are beginning to manufacture them in the US. Those will provide us with the production tax credit, which is exactly the intention that we need to produce that product in the US, the inverter is made in the battery. And then, the last one, which is exciting one is where we are moving to a more integrated architecture for power conversion and battery management. And basically, what's going to happen is our third-generation battery, the Y direction is going to almost get cut by 40%, and instead of six microinverters that we have in the third-generation battery, we will now have two microinverters, one on each side of the fourth-generation battery significantly cutting down the form factor. So, we expect that to bring in another big level of improvement in gross margin. So, those are the gross margin puts and takes on our batteries.
Mark Strouse: Okay. Very helpful. And then my quick follow-up question on the 45X within gross margin. Last quarter you talked about 500,000 units being about a $12 million to $14 million benefit. For 2Q, you're talking about a similar number of units, but with a $14 million to $17 million benefit. I'm not sure if I'm just splitting hairs there, but just wanted to see if you're kind of signaling that you're maybe keeping more of that 45X credit.
Badri Kothandaraman: No. What happens is, there is a few things that happen there. It depends upon the power of the microinverters that we are building. Sometimes we may build a 384 watt microinverter, you do the $0.11 per watt math there or we may build a 640 watt microinverter that is used inside the battery. So, it's a function of that and purely a function of that. So, it just falls out. The higher power we make, the more advantage we have, which is why we are beginning to -- I told you that we are beginning to make our small commercial IQ8P microinverters starting in Q2 as well from the US. So those are 480 watts, so $0.11 a watt is $53 gross benefit, gross production tax credit there.
Mark Strouse: Yeah. Okay. That makes sense. Thank you very much.
Badri Kothandaraman: Thank you.
Operator: And our next question comes from Praneeth Satish with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Praneeth Satish: Thanks. Maybe just staying on the battery, so looking out to the fourth-gen battery, it seems like there's a very large cost reduction coming. I guess, how do you think about keeping these cost savings versus passing it on to customers? I guess, specifically, I'm thinking about this in the context of Tesla Powerwall 3. Today, you can buy a Tesla Powerwall 3 with its integrated inverter and that's going to be cheaper than an Enphase battery, an inverter solution. And I know it's apples-to-oranges because they're using a string inverter. But I guess with the fourth-generation battery, you have the ability to close that gap while still earning more margin. So, I guess, I'm just trying to see how you think about that opportunity next year with that new battery.
Badri Kothandaraman: Yeah, I mean -- yeah before that, let me give you a color on -- you talked about many things there. You talked about battery, you talked about competition, you talked about string inverter integrated into the battery. I just want to remind you of our benefits and why we offer tremendous value. So, in my trip in the last four weeks, many of our customers are -- they are very experienced. They have used string inverters and you have no idea of all of the troubles they have gone through. And they -- for them some of the customers mentioned safe AC on the roof is religion for us. So, safe AC on the roof. You don't want high-voltage DC above you. That's the first point on Enphase. Production: we have microinverters for every panel, MPPT at a panel level. Production can be enhanced almost by 5% to 15% when you compare to normal string inverters. Per panel monitoring: many of our installers love that, per panel monitoring and their homeowners love it because they are able to say, okay this particular thing isn't working and they are able to get service from Enphase ultrafast. We are open 24/7. Reliability: you can count on. That's why we provide 25-year warranty. Most of competition may be 10 or 12 years. No single point of failure: unlike string inverters that causes much higher uptime for your system, and that you're all familiar with. Simple plug-and-play install -- our installers love the simplicity. No additional RSD, Rapid Shutdown Devices, needed. Any orientation: if you have roofs in any -- roofs in different orientations, it's got to be Enphase, nothing else. Grid farming IQ8 Microinverters enabling sunlight jump start for depleted batteries. Everybody knows this, but if I were to emphasize, you are running off grid, you have a power shutdown, you're running off grid, your battery -- let's say, you've turned on the AC on by accident, your battery runs down, your battery runs down all the way to a particular percentage, then the battery has got a capability to do what is called Black Start. It opens, it wakes up every few minutes the next day and it says, I am ready and it asks solar, are you ready, and that can happen for one or two days. But after one or two days, that -- even that energy in the battery goes away and the battery is dead. That is the state of charge drops to percent or below. Now with Enphase IQ microinverters, you could do sunlight jumpstart. You have even without the grid, sunlight comes, you form the grid, you jump start the battery at that time and the battery state of charge comes up. So that's an example sunlight jumpstart that we do. And of course, our microinverters are now being made in America. That's a big deal. Many of our installers love that. When it comes to storage, safe chemistry, lithium-ion phosphate, big deal, UL9540A Fire certification, very big deal. And we have worked with the fire departments and make sure that we have optimized the placement of batteries there. So, we have done it for a lot of [AHJs] (ph) in California. Best warranty in the industry: you see competition at 10 years approximately, our warranty is 15 years, no moving parts or fans. Low-voltage DC operation of the batteries. If you see a concept of a hybrid inverter where one inverter takes care of solar and storage, obviously, there is a lot more stress on that. But we have a distributed architecture, which means you've got inverters on the roof that take care of solar. You got inverters in the battery that take care of storage and even if one inverter in the battery goes down, the other inverters are there to help. The system is never down. Field serviceable: in situ without taking the battery of the wall minimizing downtime. I talked about gross margin. This time I didn't say this, but it is a big deal. Our overhead costs in running a battery business are dropping quite a bit because we have figured out how to not do expensive RMAs. And expensive RMA is what you have a big system hanging off your wall. The worst thing you do is it doesn't work, you take it off the wall, the homeowner is off commission for many days in a row, then you have to take it back to the installer's warehouse. The OEM or the component manufacturer, battery manufacturer has to ship product to him and the installer have to spend his valuable time on the field once again installing the new battery. The homeowner is down, he is losing solar and storage. He is losing the self-consumption dollars, and especially in a place like California, that can add up a lot. It can be a major source of annoyance. With our field serviceability in situ, instead of taking a $5,000 battery, we can take a $50 board, PCB board off, take that out, put the new board in, in a matter of an hour, you're up and running, and so enhanced serviceability. The next one LRA, 48 ampere LRA for every 5 kilowatt hour battery, 144 amperes for a 15 kilowatt hours, enough to start a four ton in a two batteries, two of our 5 kilowatt hour batteries are enough to start a three ton air conditioner. And our power is double both the peak and continuous power are double that of the previous generation and our installers love that. Simple to install and commission: for example, the NEM 3 scenario, much like Germany, our installs -- many of our installs, most of our installs are what called as a grid-tied install. A grid-tied install or a rate saver install or a time of use install or a savings battery, they are all identical. That is the battery is simply provides economic advantage and installing such a battery is trivial. You finish your solar, you're done with AC on the roof, you then all you need to do is to take two of our 5 kilowatt hour batteries, you hang it off the AC bus, there is nothing to size, there is no main panel upgrade. You don't need to worry about where to place it. You simply hang it off the AC bus. And the installation can be done in less than two hours, you connect it to the same Combiner box that you use for solar, no extra component and you're up and running. So, that's becoming very popular rate saver battery or grid-tied battery becoming extremely popular. So, that's that. So I told you the benefits of Enphase Solar and Enphase Storage System. If you look at all-in-one mobile app, the problem with having multiple solar and storage manufacturers is that the homeowner has got a mess of apps. And it's possible, but it's difficult to keep track of all of that. So, all information and control at your fingertips. The ability to take the home off the grid through an Enphase app, we provide that as well. We provide 24 hour -- 24/7 customer service with 100 field service technicians who will take care of the batteries. The installer doesn't need to spend its valuable time. He can focus on a new install. And as you know, the big advantage is with an AC coupled system is, you have both the power from your solar system as well as from your batteries. So, the combination means even more power. You don't have one inverter constraining your output. And of course, the last one is our PCS software, Power Control System software. That one is invaluable, going to be invaluable to installers to not do main panel upgrades. And by the way, PCS, we can do PCS simply even for NEM 2 expansion systems. That is, if you want to expand your NEM 2 system, as long as you do not export anything beyond your old system, you can still do your NEM 2 system to support your current consumption while exporting energy -- maximum energy from the old system. So, NEM 2 expansion is now a lot easier. So, hopefully, I gave you some color on the value that we had. And we are not stopping. We are going to be focused on cost. The batteries are -- our customers are cost sensitive. And with every opportunity, we are going to be removing boxes off the wall. Raghu talked about -- Raghu was with me, with all of the installers, and we have clear plans on what we are going to do to eliminate more boxes on the wall. So, we are ultra-sensitive in response to your question. And if we need to drop pricing because we aren't providing as much value compared to competition, we will do so.
Praneeth Satish: Got it. No, thank you for that very expansive answer. Maybe just one more quick one, again on batteries. So, you said that the channel is normal for batteries. You are at battery sell-through of 128 megawatt hours in Q1 for seasonally weak quarter. The guidance for Q2 has battery shipments at 100 megawatt hours to 120 megawatt hours, and I'm assuming there that sell-in equals sell-through in Q2. So, maybe if you could just talk about what's driving that slight decrease from 128 megawatt hours to the guidance of 110 megawatt hours? Is that conservatism or are there other factors? Because it seems like there's a lot of tailwinds in the battery business.
Badri Kothandaraman: That is conservatism. And yes, I knew that you guys would ask me the questions because you're intelligent. I said, carefully worded, that it is almost there. That's what I said. But you're right in general. The battery, we expect to run quite lean on batteries. And so, yes, we are conservative. It does seem that there is some opportunity for upside there.
Praneeth Satish: Got it. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question today comes from Philip Shen with ROTH MKM. Please go ahead.
Philip Shen: Hi, everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. Back to Brian's question earlier on the timing of normalized revenue, Badri, I think you said on the last call, the $475 million would come in the back half of this year. Are we still on track for that? So, the $475 million could be in either Q3 or Q4? And can you walk us through -- is it more likely Q4 or Q3, or if there's a chance that that gets pushed out to Q1? Thanks.
Badri Kothandaraman: Well, Phil, you know that we don't give guidance for Q3 nor Q4, but I described all of the tailwinds. And we are growing by -- from a sell-through demand of $376 million to $400 million. And we described the growth vectors. We are optimistic about all of the growth vectors. And we talked about the puts and takes in Europe. We talked about Netherlands. We talked about France. We talked about Germany. We are extremely bullish there. We are introducing a lot of new products in those regions. We expect -- we have done that in the last year. We expect them to take off. Then, we talked about the non-California states where we are seeing them seasonally bounce back up. So -- and California -- I would say California installers are, like what I said, I was extremely optimistic after my trip. The last three to four weeks of data also shows good trends. So, while we are talking about a sell-through demand, end customer demand of $400 million in Q2, I expect the numbers to go continuously up in Q3 and Q4.
Philip Shen: Great. Okay. So, very much still on path, but there might be a little bit of risk, but you definitely see a path, it sounds like.
Badri Kothandaraman: Yes, I do.
Philip Shen: Great. Okay. Thank you. Shifting gears to maybe data that might be even ahead of sell-through, our channel work suggests in this challenging US resi time, you guys are gaining a healthy amount of share, whether it's 5% from one source versus a recent poll that we did, you might be gaining 11% share with 5% of the market, that's pretty healthy and potentially can make a big difference. And so, wanted to see if you can help us understand what is the activation implied revenue that you might be seeing versus sell-through and obviously compared to the sell-in. So, do you track that in a way that you can articulate what was the activation implied revenue for maybe Q1, maybe what you see for Q2 and beyond? Thanks.
Badri Kothandaraman: Yeah, I mean, we do see reports. We do see sell-side reports. We do see third-party reports. We are focused on highlighting our value and working with installers in these times. These are difficult times, so we're trying to help them with all the services we have, whether it's proposal, whether it is permitting, whether it is proper modeling, whether it is leads, or whether it's simply to understand their RMAs, how can we help them understand their service, understand their labor, understand how to improve their efficiency doing Kaizen with the installer. So, we believe that our relationships with the installers in these times is the single most reason on any market share gain that you're highlighting. Normally, from sell-through to activations, for us, it will take us about four to eight weeks. And -- but any market share gains, we will start potentially seeing going forward. Because as you know, when installers switched to us, no one switches 100% like that. There is a ramp associated with ramping down what they are using and ramping up the new product. And I would say that will show up definitely as sell-through increases, and we will report that in Q2. I mean, we will report our Q2 results in the Q3 call, that's what I mean.
Philip Shen: Okay. Thanks very much, Badri. I'll pass it on.
Badri Kothandaraman: Yeah.
Operator: And the next question comes from Christine Cho with Barclays. Please go ahead.
Christine Cho: Good evening. Thank you for taking my question. So, I'm going to ask the sell-through question a different way. It's $400 million in 2Q and expect it to get to somewhere between $450 million to $500 million by year-end. So, let's just take the midpoint, $75 million. Can you just give us an idea combining all of the comments that you gave us individually, but that $75 million, how much of it is driven by Europe versus US? Is it like half-half? Is it more Europe? Is it more US? And then, how much of it is driven by microinverters versus batteries? And then, when you guys say that de-stocking will be done by end of 2Q, are you assuming back to the eight to 10 weeks, is that what you're considering normalized levels of inventory?
Badri Kothandaraman: Yeah, so let me answer all of them. We expect -- I mean, Europe as well as the US have healthy growth vectors for us. We do expect 50-50 from North America and Europe. Your other question was...
Christine Cho: MIs versus batteries.
Badri Kothandaraman: Tell me again. Micro versus...
Raghu Belur: Battery.
Badri Kothandaraman: Battery. Yeah, micro versus battery. I would say considering that non-California states, the battery attach isn't high. So, micro versus battery, I would still say 60-40 on micros, micros versus battery is what I would say. And the last one you asked is that eight to 10 weeks. The way we measure our weeks on hand is typically backward looking is what we say is over the quarter, this was the sell-through rate, this is the inventory you have on hand today, divide the inventory by the sell-through rate, you get the weeks on hand. One of the interesting ways that I would expect distributors will measure it will be forward-looking weeks of inventory, which is, if the demand, for example, in the last two or three weeks shows a significant uptick, that weeks on hand would be existing amount they have in front of them divided by that increased rate in the last two to four weeks. And so, those numbers, in good times, the forward-looking inventory weeks on hand will be lower than the backward looking weeks on hand. And so, for us, we are consistent in the way we measure it. We always look at -- whenever I tell you weeks on hand, I will tell you that, okay, this is the sell-through for the quarter that what happened in, for example, Q1, this is what happened in Q1. This was the inventory at the end of Q1. That inventory, channel inventory, divided by the sell-through gives the weeks on hand. And our number rule of thumb or our general number has been always eight to 10 weeks. If you're on the upswing, forward-looking weeks on hand could be smaller than that.
Christine Cho: Right. Okay. That's an interesting nuance I did not realize that you were looking backwards. My second question, you said in your prepared remarks that 50% of your NEM 3.0 systems are attaching your battery. You also mentioned you are meeting with a whole bunch of installers -- you met with a whole bunch of installers in California. Do you have a sense of whether the installers using your product are leaning more towards load shifting or backup? And I'm not sure if you answered this with Praneeth's question and I just missed it, but can you also give us a sense of where you are in the development of your meter collar and when we should expect you to roll one out?
Badri Kothandaraman: That's right, load shifting is a significant fraction of our installs. That's right. And then, the second is, when is the meter collar coming out? So, just for the benefit of the audience, basically California has something called meter main combos. These meter main combos have both the meter and the main panel integrate into one structure. And when you have to insert backup, everybody knows you have to do ugly things like ripping your loads apart. You have to put a backup switch in between. Therefore, there's a lot of labor that is actually spent in doing that. Typically, a day or two is spent in relocating all of those loads and then putting a system controller in between the meter and the main load center. With the meter collar, it's a very elegant way where you have that switch at the meter. It's a device that comes around the meter. It's got the MID, which is the microgrid interconnect switch relay, right there at the meter, at the collar, and that basically means you don't spend any labor relocating those loads. Our version of the meter collar is coming out shortly. It will be piloting by the end of the year.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question today comes from James West at Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.
James West: Hey, Badri. Real quick one for me. Based on your conversations in California over the last three or four weeks as you met with the installer base and you talked about how they -- you talked earlier about how they cut costs pretty significantly, is there any concern at all about if growth does come back as you see it, that their ability to respond to that growth?
Badri Kothandaraman: No, I think they're all much more savvy than what we think, especially the long tail. The people I met are representative of the segments we service. They -- typically they do between 1 megawatt and 5 megawatts a year. That means you can probably see they generate revenues between $5 million and $15 million -- or $5 million and $20 million a year, annual revenue. They have teams usually two to three crews or even one to two crews, very lean team. Company is less than 50 people. And core employees are relatively less. They use contractors if they have to, and they have become very smart in managing money as well. They know that they shouldn't be -- they should be lean in these times. They don't waste money. They have less inventory. One other big thing that has changed is now they have a lot more financing options available to them. So, they have a lot of options available to them. They have, if loans do not work well, they have leases or PPAs. Many of them -- I did meet at least a third, maybe 30% of the installers were still selling cash to the customers in Southern California as well as Northern California. Those are no problem. But the other folks were moving to lease in PPA rapidly now that there are multiple suppliers. So, all in all, I think what I'm trying to say is that they are nimble. They understand exactly what is happening. They are very savvy on the product. They gave us a number of ideas to improve and do even better than what we are doing. And we are going to take their feedback. And I'm not worried whether they will be able to grow. They'll be able to grow exactly like us in these times, in good times.
James West: Got it. That's very helpful. Thanks, Badri.
Badri Kothandaraman: Thank you. We're waiting for the next question.
Operator: And our next question today comes from Moses Sutton at BNP Paribas. Please go ahead.
Unidentified Analyst: Hi, this is Heidi on for Moses. Thanks for fitting me in. I just have a quick question. Coming back to the $113 million in under-shipments in 1Q, can you provide the rough breakout of what was US versus non-US? And then, same for the $90 million of expected under-shipment in 2Q, how much was US versus non-US? Thank you.
Badri Kothandaraman: I would basically expect that it is roughly in the ratio that we shipped, which is I would say two-thirds US and a third Europe.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay. Great. Thank you.
Operator: And our next question today comes from Jordan Levy with Truist Securities. Please go ahead.
Jordan Levy: Just wanted to see if there's any -- if you had any updates on the exclusivity arrangement with SunPower? I know that that was scheduled to come to an end I think back in March. So, I'm just curious if there's anything to touch on there.
Badri Kothandaraman: The question is, is there any update on SunPower? SunPower has new management, as everybody knows, and we know Tom Werner well. I've been talking to Tom. Right now, it's a business as usual for us. We have a very strong relationship. We are supporting SunPower well and vice versa. And when we sign such a contract, we will let you know.
Jordan Levy: Thanks so much for that. Maybe just a follow-up. I know with Dave getting ready to step down, I think at the end of June [indiscernible], I'm just curious if you could talk to any updates or if you have someone in mind for that role or any other details as you proceed in that process?
Badri Kothandaraman: Yeah, we're having a hard time hearing you, but I think I got the question. This is, replacement for your Chief Commercial Officer I guess the question. Yes, we've already finalized that.
Jordan Levy: Yeah.
Badri Kothandaraman: Yeah, we've already finalized that. We have two very experienced executives that I have put in charge, because Europe is so important for us. I wanted a very experienced executive to live in Europe, somebody who understands the headquarters properly. And so, one of our executive staff, meaning the one that report to me, his name is Sabbas Daniel, he is going to be running all of Europe and South Africa sales. So, basically, he is actually relocating to Europe in order to manage that team. And then, the team in the rest of the world, I call it, Americas, Australia, India, Asia, both Americas, North as well as South, that's -- especially North American team is a very seasoned team. We have Ken Fong runs our North American team, while Mehran is the Senior Vice President who is going to manage Rest of the World sales, and Ken Fong will report to him. And Mehran has got a lot of experience in batteries. He's the one who actually created the battery business unit at Enphase and ramped it to high revenue. So, both the executive Sabbas as well as Mehran have lots of experience, and they'll be able to pay a lot more attention to these regions, and we expect it to be incrementally positive for us.
Jordan Levy: That's really great detail. Appreciate all the answers. Thanks so much.
Operator: And our next question today comes from Andrew Percoco with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Andrew Percoco: Yeah. Thanks so much for taking the question. Most of my questions at this point have been answered. It's been a very comprehensive call. But if I can just maybe zoom out for a second, I'm just curious, how are you guys improving your visibility into the channel so this inventory issue doesn't happen again. I'm assuming this isn't going to be the last cycle that we all see. So, I guess, how are you investing in the platform, whether that be software or otherwise, to make sure you have more visibility the next go around, the next time there's demand side shock and to avoid these channel inventory issues next time? Thank you.
Badri Kothandaraman: Right. So, I mean, the answer is somewhat simple. It is to basically get a hold on the metrics of the front end, which is, leads get converted into proposals, converted into contracts, converted into permits, and then the installs happen, then you have activations. So, we have to get into the front end. And getting into the front end, we have Solargraf. Solargraf is a platform for us which helps us because we provide the design and proposal software. And therefore, that gives us the entire visibility on -- it doesn't need to give us the customer -- what every customer is doing, but the broad trends and broad strokes are what we are interested saying, this month what happened in this particular region? What is the statistics of leads versus contracts signed? And then, we do have third-party reports for permits. And of course, we do have our own Enlighten software for activations. And of course, in between we have sell-through, which is when the distributors sell our products to installers from the channel. So, what we are doing is to essentially tighten up that entire chain by putting in metrics at every point there. And by having more and more and more revenue coverage for Solargraf design and proposal tools so that as many installers possible are on that particular tool. So, then we have a lot more statistics. We'll continue to get aggregate reports from third parties as much as they are available. And putting all of these together to create a regression model, maybe even with the help of some sophisticated machine learning. And then, the key is for us to then make decisions on sell-in into how much do we sell into the channel? What are the guard bands of selling into the channel at the end of the day? Like don't get -- don't succumb to irrational exuberance. That is, you think everything is going to be great, therefore you ship a lot more into the channel than the sell-through, do not ever succumb to that. Go always by -- my ex-boss used to call it as mass balance. Mass balance means, whatever you ship out of the channel, you ship into the channel. So, we are putting in all of those statistical process control in place. And we are already better for it. Our weekly ship review every Wednesday, we have exactly the graph, how much is our sell-through? How much is our sell-in? Should we really do so much of sell-in? Are we going to stay within the guardrails, which is eight to 10 weeks? Anytime somebody goes above 10 weeks, we question saying, "Why do it?" And it helps us -- it's starting to help us in many ways. Because then we focus on the real growth, which is, you then start focusing on training installers to increase sell-through. You start understanding which of the installers aren't doing enough volume with you. Sales guys are focused on the right things versus pushing in stuff into the channel. So, I think companies have gotten a lot better in this front during the last year.
Andrew Percoco: Understood. Thank you so much.
Badri Kothandaraman: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question today comes from Maheep Mandloi with Mizuho. Please go ahead.
Q – David Benjamin: Hi, this is David Benjamin in from Maheep. I've got a question and then a follow-up. Can you please give us some insights on your thoughts on the Solargraf market share or penetration with installers within the US? Just trying to get some visibility with sales leads in the market.
Badri Kothandaraman: Yeah. We have over a thousand installers on Solargraf using our design and proposal tool. And we have over a few hundred using our permitting tool.
David Benjamin: Okay. Great. Thanks very much. And then a follow-up. Just on the gallium nitride, can you talk a little bit about, like, where you plan to source the materials? Is that going to be concentrated mostly from China or other markets? And lastly, any thoughts on impact from [indiscernible] AD/CVD on the US solar demand or thoughts on the NEM 3 challenge in the California courts?
Badri Kothandaraman: Gallium nitride, we do have a lot of sources for gallium nitride transistors. Some of the sources are people we already do business with for the silicon FETs. So, we aren't worried. We have lots of opportunities. There is many people with good quality gallium nitride FETs. Raghu will take the question on NEM 3.
Raghu Belur: Yeah. NEM 3, we are aware of the challenge, where it was -- there was an -- it had gone into appeals court because they actually lost the case in the lower court. It remains to be seen. The fact is that I think it's going to be difficult to overturn, but if they do, obviously, the market will react differently. But for now, for us, business as usual, we are going out there. We recognize that in the long term solar plus batteries is the way to go. And we are really working towards making sure that our battery solution -- solar plus battery solution is best in class, and that's what we are doing right now. But the courts will take their time, they'll do their thing, but it's not something that we are really focused on.
David Benjamin: Great. Thanks very much.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Austin Moeller with Canaccord. Please go ahead.
Austin Moeller: Hi, good afternoon. Just my first question here, what does the market or growth opportunity look like for home battery sales on new installations versus upgrades of existing solar arrays that are already installed on homes?
Badri Kothandaraman: Yeah, Raghu will take it.
Raghu Belur: Sure. I think both opportunities are equally valuable. Again, it depends on the geography. So, if you're in California, for example, all new homes must have solar, and you are going to be part of NEM 3 install, so you obviously need to have batteries, because if you did a solar-only install in NEM 3, your bill offset is going to be at about 55%. You add 10 kilowatt hours of NEM 3 grid-tied battery, your bill offset could be as high as 80%-85%. So, I think it makes complete sense to go ahead and add a battery in that case. In the retrofit case in California, if you're in a NEM 2 environment, not a lot of incentive to go ahead and add battery, at least for bill offset, because you already get that with NEM 2 where in that case basically the grid acts like your battery. The only other use case for battery in that case would be if you want to do it for resiliency or backup purposes. In other geographies, outside of California, the case for batteries would be -- again, you're seeing more and more of these what are called VPP programs or grid services programs, and so people may come in and retrofit a battery on their system and avail themselves of whatever the utility provides in terms of incentives, whether that is an upfront dollar per kilowatt hour incentive for adding a battery or an ongoing incentive for participation in the VPP program. Very similar situation in Europe as well. If you, for example, look at the Netherlands, obviously, that's a net metering market, but there is a push for retrofitting batteries there because just given the penetration level of solar there, which is about 28%, you do get penalized for uncontrolled export of solar. So, it makes sense to move towards what's called self-consumption. And the way you do that is by adding a battery and then managing that solar plus battery system through software, especially by participating in what's called a dynamic tariff program. You also have obviously VPP that same thing applies to Germany and other countries in Europe as well.
Austin Moeller: Great. And just to follow-up, what do you see as that key growth driver in demand for Europe and Germany in particular? Is it primarily current utility rates? And do you see changes to tax credits in countries like Italy as a potential impediment to that?
Raghu Belur: Yeah. So usually, you're seeing more and more, particularly in Europe, I refer to it as feed-in tariff inversion, wherein the buy rate is significantly higher than sell rate. So, the amount of what you get paid for feeding energy into the grid is significantly lower than retail cost of energy. So, it makes no economic sense to export even a single electron into the grid. So that's the driver. It is self-consumption. Layered on top of that is if you participate in supporting the grid through a VPP program, you get paid additional monies. So, it's all a driver towards better ROI. But it goes beyond that. It goes beyond solar plus batteries, because now you're seeing in Europe you're adding EV chargers and heat pumps, and those are additional steerable assets that are sitting behind the meter. And if you have a very sophisticated home energy management system, which like we do with all the AI and ML work that we are doing, you can really do some very, very fine optimization and deliver the best economics for the homeowner, a combination of solar, battery, EV charger, and heat pump. For that matter, any combination thereof. So, you're going to see, Italy included, all of these markets in Europe moving towards a whole energy management system with all of these assets. Now imagine what happens a year or two from now when EVs become fully bidirectional, you get yet another powerful asset that's sitting behind the meter that you can use to optimize your consumption and optimize your bill.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question today comes from Dylan Nassano with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.
Dylan Nassano: Yeah, hi. Thanks for running a little long to fit me in here. Just a quick one from me on buyback. So, it looks like share repurchases in the quarter more or less matched up with your free cash flow generation, whereas in 4Q I think you bought back a little more than you actually generated. So, just curious, how are you thinking about the attractiveness of repurchases at these levels? And how should we think about your cash allocation as demand hopefully ramps back up from here? Thanks.
Badri Kothandaraman: Yeah, I'll add some color and then Mandy can add more. We did approximately a similar amount in both quarters, but I'll explain the nuance. In Q4, we did -- we bought back shares for $100 million. While in Q1 what we did was we did a combination, which is we bought back shares for about $40 million-odd, and we -- some of our stock options, which basically were actually vesting, those stock options, essentially, Mandy didn't allow them to dilute the market. So, we basically spent about $60 million as anti-dilution there. So, in a sense, we spent the same money, $100 million; $40 million for buying back shares out of the market, $60 million for preventing shares into the market. We did that and we continue to -- I mean, you should expect us to continue to do a similar amount as long as the stock is attractive, which it is right now.
Dylan Nassano: Okay. Fair enough. Thank you for clarifying.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Dushyant Ailani with Jefferies. Please go ahead.
Dushyant Ailani: Hi, thank you for taking my question. Just one on, how much NEM 2.0 backlog is remaining with the installers? I think you talked about 50% being NEM 3.0. So, going into 2Q, how can we expect the backlog cadence to dwindle down for NEM 2.0?
Badri Kothandaraman: Yeah, I mean that's an interesting question. All our conversations with installers -- there was one installer who had a backlog of nine months, and there are installers with a backlog of three months. So, we don't really know what the answer is. Like you, we were surprised that the number is still 50%, NEM 2. But installers are learning on NEM 3 rapidly. They are depleting through their NEM 2 backlog. I'm not sure. I can't forecast the number. But I'm sure that within six months, it will dwindle down.
Dushyant Ailani: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Badri Kothandaraman for any closing remarks.
Badri Kothandaraman: Yeah, thank you for joining us today and for your continued support of Enphase. We look forward to speaking with you again next quarter. Bye.
Operator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. We thank you all for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines and have a wonderful day.

===== 2023 Q4  (2024-02-07 16:30:00) =====
Operator: Good afternoon, and welcome to the Enphase Energy Fourth Quarter 2023 Financial Results Conference Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions]. Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Zach Freedman. Please go ahead.
Zachary Freedman: Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us on today's conference call to discuss Enphase Energy's fourth quarter 2023 results. On today's call are Badri Kothandaraman, our President and Chief Executive Officer; Mandy Yang, our Chief Financial Officer; and Raghu Belur, our Chief Products Officer. After the market closed today, Enphase issued a press release announcing the results for its fourth quarter ended December 31, 2023. During this conference call, Enphase management will make forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, statements related to our expected future financial performance, market trends, the capabilities of our technology and products and the benefits to homeowners and installers, our operations, including manufacturing, customer service and supply and demand. Anticipated growth in existing and new markets, the timing of new product introductions and regulatory and tax matters. These forward-looking statements involve significant risks and uncertainties and our actual results and the timing of events could differ materially from these expectations. For a more complete discussion of the risks and uncertainties, please see our most recent Form 10-K and 10-Qs filed with the SEC. We caution you not to place any undue reliance on forward-looking statements and undertake no duty or obligation to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future events or changes in expectations. Also, please note that financial measures used on this call are expressed on a non-GAAP basis unless otherwise noted and have been adjusted to exclude certain charges. We have provided a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures in our earnings release furnished with the SEC on Form 8-K which can also be found in the Investor Relations section of our website. Now I'd like to introduce Badri Kothandaraman, our President and Chief Executive Officer. Badri?
Badri Kothandaraman: Good afternoon, and thanks for joining us today to discuss our fourth quarter 2023 financial results. We reported quarterly revenue of $302.6 million, shipped approximately 1.6 million microinverters and 80.7 megawatt hours of battery and generated free cash flow of $15.4 million. On our last earnings call, we said we would reduce channel inventory by approximately $150 million. We achieved a reduction of $147 million in Q4. For the fourth quarter, we delivered 50% gross margin, 29% operating expenses and 22% operating income, all as a percentage of revenue on a non-GAAP basis and including the IRA benefit. Mandy will go into our financials later in the call. Let's now discuss how we are servicing customers. Our worldwide NPS was 77% in Q4, the same as Q3. Our average call wait time was one minute compared to 1.3 minutes in Q3. We have made good progress on solving customer issues by focusing on both automation as well as expanding our field service teams globally. Let's talk about operations. The overall supply environment for microinverters and batteries is quite stable. Let's come to microinverters. We shipped approximately 913,000 microinverters to customers in Q4 from our contract manufacturing facilities in the U.S. We announced in December that we are seizing operations at our contract manufacturing locations in Romania and Wisconsin. We will manufacture microinverters in the U.S. with our two existing partners in South Carolina and Texas. The equipment currently located in Romania and Wisconsin will be redeployed for use at other facilities. Once our restructuring actions are complete in the first half of the year, we expect to have a global capacity of approximately 7.25 million microinverters per quarter of which 5 million will be in the U.S. We expect to ship approximately 500,000 microinverters to customers from our U.S. manufacturing facilities in Q1. We expect that our shipments from U.S. facilities will be lower in the first half of the year as we reduce both factory as well as channel inventory. We anticipate a higher level of shipments in the second half of the year. For IQ batteries, we have two cell pack suppliers, both in China which have sufficient manufacturing capacity to support our ramp in 2024. In addition, we will have the capability to manufacture IQ batteries in the U.S. in the third quarter of 2024. Let's now cover the regions. Our U.S. and international revenue mix for Q4 was 75% and 25%, respectively. For more visibility into our business, we are providing you regional breakdowns and sell-through dollar metrics by region until the channel is healthy. In the U.S., our revenue decreased 35% sequentially as we undershipped to the end customer demand. The overall sell-through of our micro inverters and batteries in the U.S. was down 9% in Q4 compared to Q3. Let's discuss market trends we are seeing in the U.S. split by non-California states and California. For non-California states, our overall sell-through was only down 1% in Q4 compared to Q3. The sell-through of our microinverters was flat and the sell-through of our batteries was down 8% in Q4. In California, our overall sell-through was down by 7% in Q4 compared to Q3. The sell-through of our microinverters was down 27% in Q4 primarily due to the NEM 3.0 transition. However, the sell-through of our batteries increased by 58% in Q4 due to the high attach rate of NEM 3.0 systems as expected. As we discussed on our last earnings call, it will take a few quarters for our installers to fully transition the NEM 3.0 and normalized sales. I'll provide more statistics on NEM 3.0 later in the call. In Europe, our revenue decreased 70% sequentially as we under ship to the end customer demand. The overall sell-through of our microinverters and batteries in Europe was down 20% in Q4 compared to Q3. The sell-through of our microinverters was down 23%, and sell-through of batteries was down 2% in Q4 compared to Q3. I'll provide some color on our key markets in Europe, Netherlands, France and Germany. In Netherlands, our overall sell-through in Q4 was down 37% compared to Q3. Customers are fearing an export penalty for solar, and there is confusion about the ending of net metering. We kicked off the New Year with the Solar Next event in Netherlands, where we hosted 800-plus installers across the country, promoting a comprehensive solution with Solar Plus batteries and energy management software that will unlock the full potential of the Dutch energy market. We believe Solar Plus batteries are going to become the norm as dynamic tariffs and grid services become more prevalent. We are already seeing a steady ramp in batteries in the region and expect the trend to accelerate in 2024. In France, our overall sell-through in Q4 was only down 1% compared to Q3. We see a lot of potential for this market to grow and evolve into a Solar Plus battery market as utility rates have moved higher and are expected to increase even more in 2024. In Germany, our overall sell-through in Q4 was down 32% compared to Q3. However, we saw sequential growth in activations for both solar and batteries as we continue to gain traction in the region. We are introducing our products into more countries in Europe. In the last few months, we have entered U.K., Sweden, Denmark, Greece, Switzerland, Austria, Italy and Belgium markets with our IQ8 microinverters and IQ batteries. In Australia, we are seeing growth for our Enphase Energy systems powered by IQ8, microinverters and IQ Battery 5P, latest third-generation battery, which we introduced in June of 2023. In Brazil, our sell-through is stabilizing nicely as we focus on building the installer base. In India, we are starting to ship our IQ8HC and IQ8P microinverters to support high-power panels. In Mexico, we just recently started shipping IQ8P microinverters for residential applications. As a reminder, IQ8P is our highest power microinverter at 480 watts AC for both residential and commercial applications. Let me say a few words about our U.S. market share. We see stable share for our microinverters and batteries based on both internal as well as third-party data. We have a large and diverse customer base. Our value proposition is to provide installers the easiest installation process with high quality and best-in-class service. We also have tools like Solargraf, design, proposal and permitting software and lead generation through solar lead factory at our disposal to help our installers. As a result, our partnerships go even deeper during the downturn. Let's cover some NEM 3.0 statistics in California. Third-party data shows that the battery attach rate for NEM 3.0 systems is over 80%. Based on our system activations in January last month, approximately half of our solar installations in California were NEM 3.0. Of our NEM 3.0 solar installations, about half of them use Enphase batteries. Our revenue per NEM 3.0 system is approximately 1.5x our average NEM 2.0 system. The transition to NEM 3.0 has been a little slower than what we anticipated. Installers are still installing NEM 2.0 systems, and this has caused a delay for some of them to sell NEM 3.0 systems. The ones who started are finding the sales process a little more difficult given the complexity of the tariff structure, the added cost of batteries upfront and high interest rates. One particular challenge we hear is their lack of confidence in the payback of the systems they are selling. This is where Solargraf software, our design and proposal software with NEM 3.0 support is critical because of its advanced modeling capability. In addition, installers are still coming up the learning curve on installing batteries. We are addressing this by making a lot of products improvement for ease of installation commissioning, serviceability and continue to offer in-person training and webinars on Solargraf software. Let's now come to our Q1 guidance. We are guiding revenue in the range of $260 million to $300 million. We expect the sell-through of our products to be seasonally down in Q1. We plan to undership to the end market demand for our products by approximately $130 million in Q1. We are forecasting to undership in Q2 as well, although at a much reduced level, and expect the channel to be normalized by the end of Q2. Let's talk about new products, starting with IQ batteries. Our sell-through for batteries has been increasing steadily over the last few quarters. Our third-generation battery delivers the best power specs and commissioning times of any Enphase battery today at a 15-year industry-leading warranty. The battery adoption rates are on the rise globally and we are well positioned to grow our battery sales in 2024. Also, we expect our margins on batteries to get better throughout 2024. There are three factors in play here. Cell pack costs, which are coming down, microinverter costs, which are coming down for us due to U.S. manufacturing and other cost -- product costs coming down due to improved architecture on our fourth-generation batteries causing the lower bill of material. We are working on entering more countries in Europe and Asia with our third generation battery. We expect to introduce our new three-phase battery with backup for Germany during the year. We plan to pilot our fourth-generation battery later in the year. This battery will have a great cost structure and elegant form factor due to the integrated battery management and power conversion architectures. As previously discussed, we have entered many new markets with IQ8 family of microinverters and are now in 21 countries. We plan to enter many more new countries in Europe and Asia throughout 2024 with our microinverters. And we plan to increase our served available market by introducing social housing and balcony solar solutions to European countries during the year. Let's also talk about our latest microinverter for the Residential segment. I already mentioned IQ8P, which delivers 480 watts of AC power, supporting panels up to 650-watt DC. We are currently shipping that product into Brazil, India, South Africa, Mexico and Vietnam. We are on track to ship into France and Spain followed by emerging markets in 2024. The other variant of the IQ8P microinverter with the new three-phase cabling system is well suited for small commercial solar installations, ranging from 20 to 200 kilowatts. We launched this product in North America in December and are seeing strong early adoption. We are very excited about this product and look forward to manufacturing all the flavors of IQ8P microinverters at our U.S. facilities shortly, further reducing our cost structure. Let's discuss EV charging. We shipped over 3,700 chargers in Q4 compared to over 3,500 chargers in Q3. We launched our IQ smart EV chargers in U.S. and Canada in Q4. The Wi-Fi enabled charger is now integrated to the Enphase Energy system. This enables use cases such as self-consumption and green charging and allows homeowners complete visibility into the operation of their system through the app. We are developing IQ smart EV chargers for many countries in Europe as well and expect to introduce them during the year. The team is also working on bidirectional EV charger, which will unlock use cases such as V2G and V2H as part of the Enphase Energy System. The charger will have GaN-based bidirectional inverters, which will interface with EVs, which have high voltage, high DC voltages. I've so far discussed our hardware products. Let's cover our energy management software. The importance of this software to deliver a superior customer experience cannot be overstated. The Enphase Energy System is becoming more sophisticated with the addition of solar, batteries, EV chargers, heat pumps, et cetera. In addition, the utility tariffs, which were once fixed rates are now becoming increasingly complex with time of use rates, NEM 3.0, demand charges, dynamic tariffs and our software is evolving to manage this complexity by leveraging artificial intelligence and machine learning for forecasting and optimization. We see this as an area of differentiation for us and are developing core IP towards that objective. We expect to release this software beginning in Q2, adding several features throughout the year. Let's now discuss our installer platform. We released new features in Solargraf during Q4. We introduced electrical design and single-line diagram features while continuing to offer NEM 3.0 functionality for solar and battery systems in California. The software platform is now current -- is now available to installers in U.S., Brazil, Germany and Austria, and we expect to release it to more countries in the coming quarters. Let me conclude, we have been managing through a period of slowdown in demand. We think Q1 could be the bottom quarter. Europe is already showing early signs of recovery, and we expect the non-California states to bounce back quickly. California is the exception as NEM 3.0 is having some hiccups in the near-term. However, we remain very bullish about NEM 3.0 in the long-term. The payback is very attractive for solar plus storage. The utility rates are going up steeply on an annual basis, and the sales teams are learning fast. We see that the demand is going to eventually bounce back up in California as well. I'll wrap up outlining our approach during these times. We are laser focused on ease of doing business on both high quality and great customer service. We are doubling down on operational excellence, correcting the channel and factory inventory concentrating on sell-through and installer count reducing our expenses and product costs and maintaining healthy gross margins. We are getting many new products out and diversifying our portfolio rapidly. We are expanding worldwide with full systems comprising of IQ8 microinverters, IQ batteries, EV chargers and energy management software. We are introducing products with the small commercial solar markets worldwide and making continuous enhancements to our installer platform. In addition, we are innovating on GaN-based IQ9 and 10 microinverters, along with bidirectional EV chargers, our fourth and fifth generation IQ battery and AI-based energy management software to position us well for the long-term. With that, I will turn the call over to Mandy for her review of our financial results. Mandy?
Mandy Yang: Thanks, Badri, and good afternoon, everyone. I will provide more details related to our fourth quarter of 2023 financial results as well as our business outlook for the first quarter of 2024. We have provided reconciliations of these non-GAAP to GAAP financial measures in our earnings release posted today, which can also be found in the IR section of our website. Total revenue for Q4 was $302.6 million. We shipped approximately 660.1-megawatts DC of microinverters and 80.7 megawatt hours of IQ batteries in the quarter. Non-GAAP gross margin for Q4 was 50.3%, compared to 48.4% in Q3. The increase was driven by increased net IRA benefit. Gross margin was 48.5% for Q4. Non-GAAP gross margin without IRA benefit for Q4 was 41.8% compared to 45.8% in Q3, a decrease of 400 basis points due to microinverter and storage mix while our average selling prices remained stable. Given non-GAAP gross margin for Q4 included $25.8 million of net IRA benefit for our microinverters made in the U.S. and shipped to customers in the quarter. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $86.6 million for Q4 compared to $99 million for Q3. We implemented a restructuring plan in December 2023 to reduce our operating costs and align our workforce and cost structure with current market conditions. As part of the plan, we are reducing our global workforce by approximately 10% and expect to reduce our non-GAAP operating expenses to be in the range of $75 million to $80 million a quarter in 2024 when these restructuring actions are substantially complete within the first half of this year. GAAP operating expenses were $156.9 million for Q4 compared to $144 million for Q3. GAAP operating expenses were -- for Q4 included $51.6 million of stock-based compensation expenses, $14.8 million of restructuring and asset impairment charges and $3.9 million of amortization for acquired intangible assets. On a non-GAAP basis, income from operations for Q4 was $65.6 million compared to $167.6 million for Q3. On a GAAP basis, income from operations was a loss of $10.2 million for Q4 compared to income from operations of $118 million for Q3. On a non-GAAP basis, net income for Q4 was $73.5 million compared to $141.8 million for Q3. This resulted in non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.54 for Q4, compared to $1.02 for Q3. GAAP net income for Q4 was $20.9 million compared to net income of $114 million for Q3. This resulted in GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.15 for Q4 compared to $0.80 for Q3. We exited Q4 with a total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities earning of $1.7 billion compared to $1.78 billion at the end of Q3. As part of our $1 billion share repurchase program authorized by our Board of Directors in July 2023, we repurchased approximately 1,183,000 shares of Enphase common stock in Q4 at an average share price of $84.51 for approximately $100 million. In addition, we spent approximately $27.5 million by reporting shares to cover withholding taxes for employees start vesting and options in Q4, now reduced the diluted shares by approximately 260.7000 [ph] shares. We expect to continue this anti-dilution plan. In Q4, we generated $35.5 million in cash flow from operations and $15.4 million in free cash flow, which included approximately $46 million of income tax payments, an increase of $38 million compared to Q3. Despite the macroeconomic challenges, we continued, we generate free cash flow. Capital expenditures were $20.1 million for Q4 compared to $23.8 million for Q3. Capital expenditure requirements decreased due to a reduction in our U.S. manufacturing spending. Now let's discuss our outlook for the first quarter of 2024. We expect our revenue for Q1 to be within the range of $260 million to $300 million which includes shipments of 70 to 90-megawatt hours of IQ battery. We expect GAAP gross margin to be within a range of 42% to 45%. We expect non-GAAP gross margin to be within a range of 44% to 47% with net IRA benefits and 40% to 43% before net IRA benefit. Non-GAAP gross margin excludes stock-based compensation expense and acquisition-related amortization. We expect the net IRA benefit to be between $12 million and $14 million on estimated shipments of 500,000 units of U.S. microinverters in Q1. We expect lower microinverter shipments to customers from U.S. manufacturing in the first half of 2024 as we continue to reduce inventory in the factory and the channel. We expect to increase the U.S. microinverter shipments to two-thirds of our overall microinverter shipments in the second half of 2024. We expect our GAAP operating expenses to be within a range of $144 million to $148 million, including approximately $64 million estimated for stock-based compensation expense, acquisition-related expenses, amortization and restructuring and asset impairment charges. We expect our non-GAAP operating expenses to be within a range of $80 million to $84 million. We are reducing our non-GAAP operating expenses by 5% in Q1 as compared to Q4, we will not compromise on investing in customer service, product innovation and sales. Moving to tax. Since we have utilized most of our net operating loss and research tax credit carryforwards, we are now a U.S. cash taxpayer. We expect GAAP and non-GAAP annualized effective tax rate, excluding discrete items for 2024 to be a 20% plus or minus 1% with IRA benefit.  In closing, we managed well with our financial discipline through a difficult global environment in 2023. While our total revenue decreased year-over-year by 1.7%. Our non-GAAP gross margin expanded to 45.3%, excluding the IRA benefit as compared to 42.6% in 2022. And our non-GAAP gross margin further increased to 47.1% with a net IRA benefit by manufacturing our microinverters in the U.S. In addition, we generated approximately $586 million of free cash flow in 2023 and exited the year with $1.7 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities up over $18 million year-over-year, while repurchasing 3.3 million shares of our common stock for approximately $410 million. With that, I will open the line for questions.
Operator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. And our first question will come from Brian Lee of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Brian Lee: Hello everyone. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the questions. Badri, thank you. I appreciate all the additional color or granularity that you're providing in this uncertain environment. I know you -- it sounds like you're pretty confident that Q1 could be the bottom here, you're under shipping by less in Q1 than Q4. And then significantly of magnitude in Q2 based on the early read. So want to ask like given seasonality, the early read on revenue for 2Q, your view that 1Q is kind of the bottom here, like directionally, can you give us a sense of -- are we back into the low mid-$300 million revenue range? Or is it even something higher than that? Just any directional feel you can provide as to kind of what the magnitude of that pickup will be off the 1Q bottom. And then I had a follow-up.
Badri Kothandaraman: Right. So just to tell the big picture. Basically, I told you that we have two problems. One is channel being full problem, channel inventory problem and the other is the native demand problem. And so with the demand reduction of about, let's say, 30% to 35% from our overall highs, what we expect is an end customer demand roughly in the range of $450 million to $500 million. That's what I told you the last time. And we were close our Q3 end customer demand, Q3 '23 end customer demand was approximately $500 million. Our Q4 '23 end customer demand was approximately $450 million. As you know, we -- our numbers are much lower compared to those numbers. So we said we plan to ship $150 million, undership $150 million compared to the end customer demand. So our end customer demand was $450 million in Q4. We undershipped approximately $147 million. We reported a number of $303 million, which is $450 million minus $147 million. We expect the sell-through demand is going to be seasonally down approximately by 10% in Q1. And that's typical. And we expect an undershipment of $130 million. So with these two under shipments, we would have taken $277 million out of the channel. And we expect, going forward, Q2, we expect it to be, if nothing happens, it is seasonally better. And for us, since we have taken out a lot of inventory in the channel, we then start to approach a negative demand of $450 million, depending on how much residue undershipment that we have in Q2. So while I cannot tell you the exact numbers, you should generally expect our sell-in numbers to improve as we go into Q2. You should expect the sell-through numbers to be seasonally better as you approach Q2. Now other things that are in our favor, we are seeing Europe -- I mean, Europe drop to quite a low level. We are seeing Europe starting to pick back up. We have seen France is back to the level it was before. We are seeing Netherlands, although Netherlands is not back to the original level, far from the original levels, but we see incremental progress on a weekly basis. In addition, we have introduced in the last six months, several new products in Italy, U.K. Sweden, Denmark, and a bunch of other countries. We start to see all of those also kicking in. As far as California states are concerned, we already said Q4, was stable for non-California compared to Q3. So we think the non-California states will also bounce in Q2. So while I'm not telling you any numbers, I gave you the directional indication that we expect selling numbers to go not. And my assumptions are that sell-through behaves according to the typical seasonality pattern that we have seen. California is, of course, the wild card, but we think that the -- even taking that into account, we expect to do -- we expect excellent numbers or our revenue numbers to go higher sequentially in June.
Brian Lee: Appreciate that. That's all super helpful. The second question I had, and I'll pass it on is on the battery storage segment, if I look, the mix is a bit more heavy on battery in 1Q versus 4Q, but your overall ex IRA margin still holding steady based on the guidance. So it almost seems like you're already seeing better margins on the batteries here in near term. I know you alluded to expansion during the year. Can you kind of give us a sense of quantification? Another numbers question, I guess, is to kind of where you're at today and what the cadence could look like battery seems like it's going to move the needle a lot more. Just trying to get a sense for what that margin expansion opportunity could be as we move through the next several quarters? Thank you.
Badri Kothandaraman: The one thing that I did not say in the script, which I will say now is the sell-through our batteries in Q4 was the highest it has ever been. It was a 140-megawatt hours 140 sell-through in Q4. Our sell-in was only 80, you might ask why is your sell-in lagging behind. We'd like to get the channel as low as we possibly can. So therefore, we are getting more conservative. We only guided 70 to 90, but because we want the channel to get cleaned up. So what is driving that sell-through, if you ask? The answer should obvious to you based on what I said, California, I told you, the sell-through increased by 58%. Just in California due to the NEM 3.0 attached, California numbers, Q4 to Q3 -- Q3 to Q4. Also, we are seeing a good momentum in Europe. We have introduced batteries now to multiple regions. We introduced in June, we introduced to Australia, in September, we introduced to the U.K., then we introduced it to a bunch of other countries, too, along with it. I'm not breaking all of those out. In December, we launched individually and we'll start shipping there very soon. So on battery demand, I'm happy to say, is very robust. And what we plan to do is to basically, of course, we plan to improve our gross margins. Gross margins, there are three things in gross margins that are obvious. The first two are applicable for our third-generation batteries, and the last one is applicable for the fourth-generation batteries. The cell pack costs are coming down rapidly. Our suppliers are offering as very competitive pricing on cell packs, which is definitely moving the needle. That's one. Number two, for us, specifically, we are transforming our supply chain so that we can make our microinverters for the batteries in the U.S., while we can have the assembly of the batteries in China. That gives us a best-in-class supply chain. And that, we get IRA benefit of $0.11 a watt, multiplied by 640-watt multiplied by 6. So for a 5-kilowatt hour battery, that's approximately $75 per kilowatt hour benefit that we get just for making the microinverters in the U.S., and we plan to do that. The third one is an architectural benefit. When we go from the third-generation to the fourth-generation battery, we are -- in the third-generation battery, we have six microinverters. We have a battery management board. We have a couple of other boards, the communication board and an interface board. So we have nine boards. So those nine boards will go down to three boards because we are integrating battery management, and we are making the power conversion with a lot more power. So we are going to have a total of three boards. So nine is becoming three. Our power electronics, therefore, the cost bill of materials are dropping down significantly. And basically form factor-wise, we drop in the power electronics, the two inverters by the site on two sides of the cell pack, Therefore, the form factor certainly becomes very elegant. So not only the form factor becomes elegant and the fourth-generation, the cost also is lower along with taking advantage of the cell pack costs plus the PC -- plus the microinverter assembly, I mean microinverter manufacturing in the U.S. So we are very encouraged that gross margins on batteries will continuously gone up for us. And I think that will reflect positively on overall gross margins.
Operator: The next question comes from Colin Rusch of Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.
Colin Rusch: Thanks so much guys. Can you talk a little bit about the OpEx and the compensation plan going forward here? Obviously, with the lower non-GAAP numbers that you've talked about and the higher charge here. Is that something we should be thinking about on a go-forward basis? Or is there something else going on here that we should be attending to?
Badri Kothandaraman: Yes, let me give some color and then Mandy can add more there. In December, we basically announced the restructuring, where we -- which affected about 10% of our workforce there. And at that time, we were running at an OpEx run rate approximately in the $95 million to $100 million per quarter. Our desire is to drop that non-GAAP OpEx from that level to a $75 million to $80 million number in the second half of 2024. So we did a few changes. We did a lot of -- we eliminated a bunch of other spending before we came to people, but then we were forced to take the action on the people front as well. So all of that is largely behind us. And we have taken -- Mandy will talk about the charges that we are taking on GAAP, et cetera. But all of those are largely behind us, and we issued a 8-K in December of 2023. In addition, what we did at that time was we announced that we are shutting down Romania as well as Wisconsin, it didn't makes sense for us to have 10 million microinverters per quarter and it remaining capacity. And therefore, we work with the manufacturers and we had to be fair to them. And therefore, we essentially reduced our capacity from 10 to approximately seven. And so that's what we did, and we announced that change as well. So Mandy, why don't you elaborate on the...
Mandy Yang: Sure. Yes. So our OpEx we reduced from -- non-GAAP OpEx reduced from $99 million in Q3, right, to $86 million in Q4, right? And that was before the restructuring effect that that will come into effect in Q1 and Q2, right? But throughout 2023, we have been reducing discretionary spend, right, and also hiring freeze, right. And even attrition, we don't backfill. We only backfill critical ones, right? And that's why we got our OpEx to reduce from $99 million to $86 million, right? But in December, we implemented a restructuring plan, right? We further reduced our worldwide headcount full-time employees and contractors, right, by 10%. So with that, once those restructuring actions are completed by Q2, we would be at $75 million to $80 million run rate a quarter.
Colin Rusch: Okay. That's super helpful. And then just from a pricing perspective, you talked about kind of select discounts for folks in the past. Can you give us a sense of how that's trending here even if the list prices are stable, what sort of discounts you're having to offer up to folks? And if there's any sort of dynamics around evolution of the product driving some incremental price benefit for the company?
Badri Kothandaraman: No, there is -- I said the same last quarter, I say the same now. This has been ever since I took over this, we have always had the special pricing adjustment business process. And we do manage that very tightly across the company. And so there has been notably not much change in general in the pricing environment, and that should be kind of obvious to see based on our gross margins as well.
Operator: The next question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith of Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Hey, good afternoon. Thanks team and nice inflection. So just in terms of the 0.5 million shipments here in 1Q here, can you talk a little bit about how you plan to scale up to the $5 billion capacity, have you issued the 8-K here, kind of bringing down overall manufacturing. But can you talk about how you anticipate that ramping here, if you will. And then maybe in tandem with that implicit, how do you see underlying demand trending vis-à-vis kind of returning to that $500 million and then back up to say $700 million or what have you?
Badri Kothandaraman: Right. So just to set context, we shipped approximately 900,000 units from our U.S. factories in Q4. So why are we going back to 500,000 in Q1. That's the first question to answer. To answer that one. It's basically we are focused our inventory in terms of dollars, gross value of our inventory is about $200 million, $210 million roughly. And we think that inventory is high. That corresponds to 110 days of inventory, I think, and we think that the number of days of inventory is high, so we are going on a war path to reduce that to a best-in-class level. I consider the best-in-class level at 30 days. So we -- that's [indiscernible]. We are going back to 30 days. That means we are going to be ensuring that we don't do any unnecessary manufacturing. So that's -- based on that, our first priority is to get that -- set that boat right. And so that's why we said, okay, in the first half of the year, we would essentially do whatever it takes to clear the factory inventory and clear the channel. So you should expect lower shipments in the first half. In the second half, which is where if the demand approaches to, let's say, for example, what you talked about, the $500 million level, that corresponds to approximately $3 million in -- 3 point something million microinverters. You should expect two-thirds of those microinverters to be made in the U.S. And for example, if we get back to that $700 million run rate whenever it is, maybe in 2025, the -- we are talking about $4.5 million to $5 million microinverters. And you should again expect the same thing, two-thirds of that will be in the United States. So it is a strong function of demand. We have to balance both the factories inside and outside, and our balancing is two-thirds, one-thirds right.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Right. And maybe just a corresponding follow-up there briefly. Just the $130 million undershipped when you think about that being split again between U.S. and Europe, you talked about those two-thirds, one-thirds. How do you think about where that undership and the dynamic of that inventory being today and maybe perspective?
Badri Kothandaraman: Yes. For Q4, that was I would say, roughly it was, I would say 50-50 for Q4 between the U.S. and Europe. I think for Q1, it will be more tilted towards 60-40 U.S., Europe.
Operator: The next question comes from Philip Shen of Roth MKM. Please go ahead.
Philip Shen: Hi, everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. You highlighted that you think the destocking ends in Q2 now. But prior, you had talked about destocking ending at the end of Q1 and then before that, also by the end of '23. What's the probability and confidence in your call now that the destocking truly ends by the end of Q2? I don't know if the answer is different to the U.S. market versus Europe. And then how does the impact of some of these meaningful shutdowns and bankruptcies impact you guys, and your confidence in your ability to say it's Q2. You've been talking about this $450 million to $500 million run rate, but then ADT solar shutdown, Enphase Infinity vision, so how does that -- are those dynamics? Because that number, $450 million, $500 million back in Q4 of last year when you had the Q3 call, these companies weren't talking about going away or shutting down. So does that -- how has that impacted you, guys? Do you assume that others will just pick up the volume. And then we're also watching closely what happens with the SunPower situation. So if that goes negative, what are your thoughts on how that can impact you to? Thanks.
Badri Kothandaraman: Yes. As far as the channel is concerned, in the October call, I was quite clear. I said we do expect to undership in both Q4 as well as Q1, and that's right. And we did not -- at that time, you are correct. I did say we could normalize in Q2. Now we executed on what we said for Q4. The $150 million, what I said, we did $147 million. We expect to do $130 million. We expect to do a much reduced level of undershipment in Q2. We don't expect to do $130 million in Q2. We expect to be much reduced level. So we think the problem will go away for us in Q2, but I was conservative. I didn't tell you by the end of Q2, and we are sticking with that. The next one, bankruptcies, how do bankruptcies effect? Bankruptcies are definitely causing some friction in the short term. But I think what will happen in the industry is resilient. What happens is the -- end customer demand doesn't change. So therefore, it is a matter of time and it is unfortunate that these happened. However, these can be readily picked up. It might take a quarter as long as the end customer demand stays the same. We think other installers will pick it up. We have a diverse group of installers. We have -- we worked with almost 1,500 installers in the U.S. And so there's a lot of redundancy there. And so while you are correct, it is -- it will cause some short-term friction. But I think that will soon disappear.
Philip Shen: Got it. Thanks. And then as you think about the difference between the U.S. and European markets, do you think -- can you talk about the destocking situation there? When do you think that is done on a blended basis across the countries? And which region feels do you feel like it's better for a faster recovery in U.S. or Europe? Thanks, Badri.
Badri Kothandaraman: I think at least our data, our forecasting calculation today show that Europe will be -- will recover a little bit earlier by the end of Q1. I think we should see Europe doing a little better than the U.S. But I think both of them should be normalized in Q2.
Operator: The next question will come from Mark Strouse of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Mark Strouse: Yes, good afternoon. Thanks for taking our questions. Kind of a follow-up to Phil's question there. Just wondering if you can dig a bit more into the Netherlands. You mentioned that, I think, you said it's still weak, but it's getting a little bit better every week. When you're talking to your customers in the field, what are their expectations as far as timing of certainty with the policy over there? And then I have a follow-up. Thanks.
Badri Kothandaraman: Yes. So basically, Netherlands, I have to tell you a story in Netherlands. Essentially what happened is about three to four -- actually six months ago is what I would say, six months ago, the end consumer demand started to go down. And it was kicked off by one of the energy companies charging an export penalty for solar. The company's name is Vandebron. So that caused a lot of fear in customers. The customers are facing -- they are certainly worried about an export penalty for solar. And also in Netherlands, there is -- the situation about net metering hasn't been very clear. When is it going to end, is it going to continue? And that is -- meetings and net metering are actually underway as we speak right now with the new government. So we'll -- all of us will hear about that soon. So what we did, we kicked off the new year. January second week, we had a solar mixed event in Netherlands where we hosted 800 installers. They all came from across the country. We also hosted a bunch of energy providers. And we also hosted even the transmission, transmission line operators. And we then basically had all of them talk and we all agree that Netherlands needs a comprehensive solution that consists of solar plus batteries with energy management software. And that will help unlock the full potential of the market. Netherlands has got roughly about 8 million homes. Today, 2.4 million homes have solar. And the worry is those solar reducing homes will cause excessive export and that will be unmanaged. But with intelligent energy management, with the addition of batteries and this can turn into a very quickly, it can turn into a very positive because every home will have solar plus a 10-kilowatt hour battery with energy management software and the payback is still fund between six and eight years. So we painted that picture and we had general alignment with all of the stakeholders. Now we are following through on all of those with webinars with actual execution with our solar graph tool, for example. So that homeowners can basically understand the value proposition a lot better. In addition, the situation on net metering is starting to get -- will start to get clear in the next few weeks. So what I'd say in Netherlands is that once again, I think we saw the bottom. The bottom I think that in that was the bottom. And then now with the -- with what we talked about, solar plus batteries, we are also seeing more attach rate of batteries in Netherlands now. So we predict a pickup in both solar and batteries. Of course, we don't have a crystal ball. We could be wrong. We do think the net metering decision will come and that will be a big deal. We do have general alignment with the energy providers that as long as there is dynamic tariff, there would be no export penalty. And -- but we don't need batteries to manage dynamic tariffs. So I gave you a long answer. But in short, I think the -- once again, the bottom I think is behind us. Not you should see a steady uptick there.
Mark Strouse: Okay. That's very helpful, Badri. Thank you. And then just a real quick follow-up. I know you don't break out exactly the country-by-country. Given the puts and takes between France and Netherlands and Germany, all of these new countries that you're entering into, any generic guidelines that you can provide, the street as far as kind of your major countries, let's just say, Netherlands, France, Germany, what they might represent of your business today?
Badri Kothandaraman: We don't usually break that out. But in the order of significance, at least for 2023, overall revenue, it has been Netherlands followed by France followed by Germany. That's how it has been. You obviously heard the situation on Netherlands. I think like what I said, it will soon bounce back. We -- as far as France is concerned, we see steady demand in France. Utility rates are increasing in France. So therefore, I mean, already increased last year expected to increase again this year. So we think that's a general positive. France is actually growing. France is flat right now with all of this, and we expect it to grow given the normal seasonality. The Germany is tricky. Germany, for us, has been hit by a lot of the inventory problems, destocking there. We do have some strong partners. We do have a lot of other distributors buying in various regions in Europe and shipping product into Germany. But one trend we are seeing is that our activations, which is every week, we monitor how many systems got connected to the cloud and whether they have Solar Plus storage, et cetera. So we are doing quite well that our activations are increasing quarter-on-quarter. So our theory there, installers are a little more conservative, they are holding on to very less inventory, but they are doing -- they are basically installing more Enphase. And so we'll see how that play out, how that plays out. The next two markets that we care about a lot are Italy and U.K. Italy is basically, it's got about roughly a gigawatt of solar and with about 70%, 80% attach of batteries. Grid tied batteries, single-phase market and we just introduced our IQ8 microinverter there and we launched our batteries as well in December, we expect to start shipping batteries into Italy immediately this quarter. In U.K., one more big market, 800 megawatts of solar, attach rate of 80% for storage. And once again there, we just entered the market in September, and we expect to continuously grow there. So those are the five big markets for us in Europe. And then the little ones are, of course, Spain, Austria, Switzerland, we are working on improving both microinverters and batteries, there, Greece, Poland, and we'll enter into all of the other countries in Europe. These countries, we already have batteries. In Sweden and Denmark, regard them. Sweden and Denmark, the battery attached in Sweden and Denmark is particularly nice in the last few weeks and months. So we're optimistic that Sweden and Denmark represents a nice opportunity as well. Do you want to add anything, Raghu?
Raghu Belur: Yes. I think the trend, if you look at as Badri mentioned, the addition, all of these markets transitioning from some have already transitioned solar to solar plus battery means the energy management software becomes a very critical element of it to deliver whatever the use case homeowner desires. But dynamic tariffs, as Badri mentioned in Netherlands, really can prove -- requires sophisticated software to manage a day-ahead tariff and hourly day-ahead tariff but it can bring tremendous amount of value to the homeowners. For example, in a dynamic tariff environment, you could have negative pricing. I mean you have negative pricing, you get paid to charge your battery and charge your EV and turn on your heat book. In addition, in a lot of these markets, you're seeing grid services programs also come into effect that pay you a lot of money. For example, again, in the Netherlands market because of all the solar that's there, it's a 19-gigawatt grid and there's 19-gigawatts of solar and then there's another eight, nine gigawatts of wind. There are imbalance issues but there is an imbalanced market that you can participate in and get paid for either charging your battery or discharging your battery. Similarly, in some of the other markets, there is frequency regulation markets that you can participate in and provide good value to the homeowner because their battery is now basically generating money for you. Same thing, capacity markets in U.K. are also good markets to participate in our grid services. So you're seeing this move from solar plus battery plus energy management plus grid services is a very compelling movement for value creation for the homeowner. And this trend here, we are going to see happening more and more and happening worldwide.
Operator: The next question comes from Praneeth Satish of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Praneeth Satish: Thanks. Good evening. So the metric gave for battery sell-through 140-megawatt hours, it's quite high. I guess as we look to the second half of this year, when you got NEM 3.0 fully under swing and the Netherlands bounces back, do you expect battery shipments to increase sequentially each quarter and do you think it's possible we get to 200-megawatt hours of battery shipments by the end of this year?
Badri Kothandaraman: I don't have a crystal ball, but generally, yes.
Praneeth Satish: Okay. Fair enough. And then, I guess, second question here on the C&I market. Just wondering if you could give us an update on the IQ8P introduction, how that's progressing. And whether we would see meaningful revenue this year or whether that's a 2025 event?
Badri Kothandaraman: You'll see meaningful revenue this year. However, let me step back and tell you about our product and then Raghu can talk a little more. So we introduced the product in the fourth quarter in December. And this is a 480-watt three-phase 208 volt market, primarily addressing the U.S. We estimate the market size approximately a gigawatt. And basically, this helps us to service 20 to 200 kilowatts of installation. And we are talking about examples could be schools, could be hospitals, could be gas stations, could be motels, basically small businesses. So that's the 20 to 200 kilowatts we are talking about. Our product called IQ8P that generates 480 watts of AC. It can service up to 650-watts DC panels. It has got rapid shutdown. We have per panel monitoring, and of course, highest quality levels, 25 years of warranty. And there's now, our long-tail installers have been asking us for this product because they expect the same quality as the residential product. So therefore, they've been asking us. Now we are able to service. In addition, we also have the Solargraf software, which is the design and proposal software for those commercial installations. So we did ship a nontrivial amount of units already in Q4 '23. However, you should understand this is the business where it's got a little bit longer time, and it's a project-based business. So therefore, you have multiple parties here in play, which is the building owner, and then he assigns it to program manager, basically employees and installer. So the sale is a little bit longer compared to residential sales. So it will take us more time to establish a pipeline. But what I know is our product will be good. Our product is very high quality like what I said. So we expect to get our fair share of the market. And we also expect our shipments into the channel to be continuously up quarter-on-quarter through the year.
Operator: The next question comes from Eric Stine of Craig-Hallum. Please go ahead.
Eric Stine: Hi, everyone. So pretty clear from your commentary in the second half, you're expecting to get somewhat back to normal when the sell-in or the under shipments starting to go away. I'm just curious, as you think longer term, I mean, do you see a scenario where you can get back to, I think you mentioned $700 million, those types of levels potentially in '25. I mean is this a market even if the inventory in the channel is cleared. Do you think that growth is possible in a higher interest rate environment. How do you think about things? And I know you don't guide, but how do you think about things as we get into '25 first and second half?
Badri Kothandaraman: I mean that's the whole point where we are starting to diversify our product portfolio rapidly. We are planning to introduce -- we already introduced IQ8 microinverters in 21 countries last year. All of us haven't seen those results yet because of the inventory. But once the channel is lean, we should start to see results from all of those countries. So that's one. We plan to introduce even more number of countries in 2024, which is there are still a lot of markets in Europe, Nordics that are untapped. We are going to introduce microinverters there. In addition, there are also countries in Asia that we are going to introduce. So you'll see that. Next, batteries, you come to batteries. Batteries, I already topped out the sell-through continuously increasing. Already talked about our product introduction into places like Australia, U.K., Italy, these places, we are not that big. And we're going to be introducing batteries into other places as well. India is a big untapped market, for example. So many more places in Asia as well as even, I would say, Latin America, for example. We got a lot of countries there which need both solar and storage. So we are focused on multiple countries for both solar plus storage. In addition, we talked about for Europe, we talked about social housing and balcony solar. These two social housing for example is apartment complexes as well as row houses in Netherlands. In the picture each house, having a small system, about three kilowatts, six panel system and our microinverters shine when it comes to small systems. Balcony Solar is another exact countries like Germany, Italy, Austria allow you to export energy into the grid and 800, basically 800-watts of export into the grid. And we plan to basically leverage those markets as well. And each of those is a 250-megawatt market. So that will help us address 500-megawatts. In addition, the other thing we talked about is EV chargers. We are planning to introduce EV chargers in a lot of countries in Europe. And as you know, Europe is at the forefront of electric vehicles. So EV charging, for example, U.K., Netherlands, Germany and France. We will have products in the third quarter that are shipping. Additionally, bidirectional EV chargers. Bidirectional EV chargers, yes, you can argue that the price on an EV charger is under $1,000. But when you have a bidirectional EV charger, all of a sudden, value is a lot higher. We are already working on a GaN-based bidirectional chargers, which will interface to the car's battery around 800 volt D.C and that will convert DC to AC there. And it will plug right into our Ensemble Energy Management System that consists of solar and a home battery. So I talked about microinverters. I talked about batteries, usual markets going into many countries, talked about social housing, Balcony Solar, talked about EV chargers, which is into Europe as well as bidirectional chargers overall. And then the last one is software. We are going to have energy management software. This is AI-based software, which will do production, consumption forecasting and make the right decisions, particularly when it comes to serving markets with the dynamic tariffs and imbalance. And that is going to be worth quite a bit for customers. So we do expect to have our fair share affair. So of course, we are always looking at how to increase our revenue per home, and that's our focus. But we have a lot more revenues in front of us that we need to execute on.
Operator: Okay. Thanks for all the detail.
Operator: The next question comes from Christine Cho of Barclays. Please go ahead.
Christine Cho: Good evening. Thank you for taking my question. I just wanted to get some more color on the Netherlands and these dynamic rates. And I was curious, with the way they're structuring these rates, is there any sort of risk that homeowners might elect to just take a battery and no solar system to play the arbitrage in rate. And could you give us an idea of how much better the payback is for Solar Plus storage versus just storage under the dynamic rate structure? And then just with how things are progressing there, is there any real reason why anyone would buy a solar system without a battery at this point?
Raghu Belur: Yes. So you have to look at the intent, the Dutch market is really very, very focused on converting to renewables. So if we see the solar plus battery to be the predominant market. Of course, there may be some corner cases where we may see people purely doing it for arbitrage purposes, but we primarily see the market to be that battery gets associated with solar. It could be battery plus solar -- sorry storage plus battery plus EV charger plus heat pump and all of that managed by as Badri mentioned in artificial intelligence and machine learning-based energy management software. So we don't see in the future that there'll be any system that would be solar only, it would be storage only or solar only as well. We expect that it will always be an energy system, and that's the transition that the Netherlands market would also undergo very quickly. And by managing dynamic tariffs, which you need very sophisticated software to do because it's a day-ahead market and the rate is going to change on an hourly basis, you need very good forecasting of both production as well as consumption. You need to be able to manage all of that. You need to be able to steer, when am I going to charge my battery? When am I going to discharge my battery? When I'm going to charge my EV soon? When am I going to be able to discharge my EV? Manage your heat pump, buy and sell energy from the grid. All of that is done by that sophisticated software that we have. And layer on top of that, grid services to participation in an imbalanced market. This is a direction in which the entire Dutch market will move towards, but always solar will be a key element of it because that's the intake.
Badri Kothandaraman: Right and to add a little bit more is solar plus battery self-consumption, the payback, let's say in a world without net metering. That payback will be around eight to nine years. And then you add on the savings due to dynamic tariffs where the batteries can help, batteries as well as solar can help manage the situation. That will reduce the payback by a year or so. Then your imbalance also has the capability and balance management also has the capability to reduce that payback further down by a year or two. So you get to have a very nice payback, which is six years -- six to seven years with solar plus batteries and software gives you good payback. And the good thing is if you have net metering, those numbers will get even better.
Christine Cho: Okay. And then part of the issue of the slowdown in the California recovery is because California installers don't know how to install the batteries. And California homes are bigger, and I suppose there are more rules here around the batteries and placement, which also has complexity. The Netherlands homes are much smaller. And from what I understand, the rules there are so relaxed around the permitting for solar. So I can't imagine that they're going to be that different for storage. But should we think that the actual installation for batteries is easier there and less of an off as it has been in California. And given I don't think they really have outages, should we think that the batteries and installations will be primarily for load shifting?
Badri Kothandaraman: And it's exactly that, meaning there isn't too many outages in Netherlands at all. So right now, if you look at many countries in Europe, they will all talk about only grid-type batteries. These batteries do not need back up. Of course, we offer backup as well. It is what the customer wants, but the customers have been asking for grid tied batteries. Grid tied batteries have simpler in a sense, you don't need to worry about backup panel and all that. It is like installing solar. Grid tied batteries are not in the path of power, like solar. If you want to do backup, you have to insert a switch in between the utility and your home. And so all of that is not required. It is simply an economical place here. And essentially, it stores energy and you can discharge it for use later. So yes, I mean -- and also, the homes are small. As you rightly pointed out, the battery sizes may be between five kilowatt and 10 kilowatt. The sweet spot could be something like a five-kilowatt hour battery for all the installations and the attach rates in Netherlands could be very high, 80% to 90% at five-kilowatt per hour, which is not a big dent in in the pocket, but enough to basically have the energy companies feel happy that okay, the customers have a way to manage and not export solar all the time in an unmanaged fashion.
Operator: The next question comes from Jordan Levy of Truist. Please go ahead.
Jordan Levy: Good afternoon all and thanks for all the detail. Maybe just to start quickly on the U.S. battery manufacturing side. And you may have touched on this, but just to get a sense of how we should think about the trending for margins on the battery side versus micros once you start to bring on that U.S. manufacturing capacity later this year?
Badri Kothandaraman: Yes. Today, our -- I mean, today, our supply chain is predominantly in China, and we assemble our batteries there. Going forward, our supply chain will have two parts. One will still have one with the best-in-class cost structure will have basically the assembly of the battery in China with microinverters made in the United States. So that will help us because the microinverters are made here. The other is the entire battery is assembled in the U.S., including the microinverters, obviously. And the latter one, we plan to have it in the third quarter of 2024. And of course, some customers, especially the EPO customers will have the benefit of getting an additional 10% in ITC as long as we meet the domestic content requirement which we plan to meet. So -- and we expect to get -- we expect to have a slight premium there to compensate for the cost of assembly in the U.S. So I think either way both parts will have similar gross margins in my mind, but they will all continuously improve as our cell packs get lower cost and our microinverters are manufactured in the U.S.
Jordan Levy: Appreciate that. And just a quick follow-up. Along those same lines, you've been a big pioneer in increasing U.S. manufacturing capacity. This is a question that will come up probably a lot over the next 12 months or less. But out of the election in November, I just wanted to get your thoughts as it relates to an existential threats to the IRA or any of the components of the IRA as we approach the election?
Raghu Belur: Yes. Obviously, we don't have a crystal ball to predict who is going to win the elections. But to some extent, we don't think it will matter because at the end of the day, this is about creating jobs. And investments and both of which we have done, given our factories both here in -- the two factories here in the U.S., both in South Carolina as well as in Texas.
Operator: The next question comes from Kashy Harrison of Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.
Kashy Harrison: Good afternoon. And thank you for taking the questions. So the first one, just a quick follow-up on the comment, Badri you made earlier. I think you said half of your activations in January were for NEM 2.0, the balance is NEM 3.0. Can you just give us a sense of what the NEM 2.0 mix of sell-through was in 4Q? And then when do you expect that NEM 2.0 backlog to run out completely?
Badri Kothandaraman: Yes. I mean, I leaned in a little bit and gave you the numbers in January. Those correspond those. When I say system activation, this one is even further. It is not -- it is sell-through happens when distributors sell to installers. Activations means those installers finish installation, and it goes up on roofs. What I gave you was we see homes coming up on our software platform. And we are able to clearly say how many of them are NEM 2.0, how many of them are NEM 3.0. So in January, 50% of them were NEM 3.0, 50% of them, therefore were NEM 2.0. If you ask me what is that ratio in the prior quarter, I don't know, but my guess is it was approximately 70-30, 70% NEM 2.0 and 30% NEM 3.0 in the prior quarter Q4. And in Q1, I expect it to be more like 50-50.
Kashy Harrison: Got it. Helpful. And then just a quick follow-up question. In your discussions with your distributors, has there been any indication whatsoever that they may want to hold less inventory on hand moving forward versus the eight to 10 weeks they used to previously. And really, the root of the question just stems from the fact that a lot before you were shipping a bunch of stuff to the U.S. from India. So you have longer lead times, given you're going across the ocean. That changes once Texas and South Carolina ramp and become two-thirds of your shipments. And so I'm wondering if simplistically, shorter lead times means less inventory from a distributor perspective?
Badri Kothandaraman: That's correct. It does mean -- and at the end of the day, look, I mean we need end customer demand at the end of the day. Distributors are definitely a critical part of the equation, but we need the end customer demand. So anything that shortens the cycle time is actually good for us. Anything that compresses the overall cycle time, which U.S. manufacturing will do is good for us because then there is -- inventory doesn't have a lot of money on it. And so we think that's what you pointed out will be a net positive for us once we come out of this.
Operator: The next question will come from Andrew Percoco of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Andrew Percoco: Great, thanks so much for taking the question. Maybe just if you can maybe elaborate or give us an update on your SunPower contracted exclusivity there. I think it was set to end of -- the end of March here. So if you could just provide an update in terms of how those negotiations are going and maybe what's baked into your guidance in terms of run rate revenue for 2024 as it relates to that contract?
Badri Kothandaraman: Yes. I mean we have enjoyed our contract with SunPower over the last five years almost. It is going to come to a close in Q1. And of course, we are in discussion with them. And I'll just leave it at that. I don't want to comment on any revenue. We don't comment on revenue associated with one customer like that. All of those decisions are confidential. But if there is something that gets finalized, you will know.
Andrew Percoco: Fair enough. And then maybe just one housekeeping item. Badri, I think in your prepared remarks, you mentioned 50% of your customers under NEM 3.0 are using your battery. But I think you also said the industry data is showing battery or attach rates of close to 80%. So can you maybe just comment on what's driving that delta and maybe how you can get a higher attach rate for your battery specifically on those NEM 3.0 customers?
Badri Kothandaraman: Right. So basically, that's right. The -- in general, the attach rate of an NEM 3.0 solar system is 80% according to the industry data. So attachment to our solar system. In the past, for a NEM 2.0, for example, for NEM 2.0 was about 10%. And that has increased now to 50% with -- because it just makes sense to add a battery. That's why we set our sell-through numbers became higher by -- improved by 58% compared to the prior quarter. Now your question is why is Enphase market share not a 100%. Why aren't all Enphase solar installations having Enphase batteries, because customers have a choice. Ours is an AC coupled system. And therefore, we have batteries that can tie into that AC coupled system. However, the situation is still a net positive for us, because the 10% battery attach is now a 50% attached. And we are constantly working on having this data and getting not the 50%.
Raghu Belur: I think we are doing a lot of work in improving the product. If you look at, both in terms of ease of installation, commissioning, serviceability, et cetera, and with our three gets better, our four gets even better, including it's a very simple product to install. As Badri mentioned, the form factor is such that, it just makes it much easier to install. So we win the rest of the business as we go, as we've continue to make not only hardware product improvements, but also all of the software improvements that we are making. Both of those mean that we will win more of our business.
Operator: The next question comes from Joseph Osha of Guggenheim Partners. Please go ahead.
Joseph Osha: Hi, thanks everyone. Two quick questions. First, talking about storage, you used to talk a lot about commissioning challenges in the time that was involved. Here it seems like that's gotten better. But -- and I'm just wondering, if we look at -- look at developers and we think about cost installation difficulties, exploiting things to the consumer. What do you think the real biggest challenges are right now in terms of selling storage, especially in California?
Badri Kothandaraman: Yes. I mean batteries are hard to sell. First of all, they add cost to your system. I mean a high interest rate environment, people think twice about adding them. Then second is batteries are messing. It is like, for example, if you have to do a full back up, you do have to plan for it properly and you cannot short change design. It should be a very high-quality product. It should -- because when power goes, the batteries, the battery company is the utility company. So batteries are tough to do probably, also when there is a problem with the battery servicing is tough you have to get it off the wall. You have to ship it to the installer. Installer has to contact the supplier. Supplier has to ship a replacement, installer has to come back. So for installers, it's very difficult. And they have truck rolls, many truck rules on batteries, more than inverters, more than solar. So what we have tried to do in our third-generation battery and that is why our battery sales are picking up is, we have tried to take that in account. First of all, the commissioning experience is a lot simpler. So under an hour, you can commission it. Second, if you want to, you can use the battery in a grid tied environment even simpler, but it can be used for backup to. The third one, which is a very important one is 90% of the time, the batteries can be serviced in situ, in situ means on the wall, while the battery is still on the wall, which means the common problems that we see, very rarely, you see a problem with this cell pack. Problems commonly that we see are with battery management and power electronics. For us, all of them are serviceable boards, which means a $40 board gets out and a new $40 board comes in. And our field service people, Enphase field service peoples are there, and we have 100 of them. And basically, they are there and they take that off the installers, especially in a critical time like this you don't want the installer to do the service. You want the company responsible, which is Enphase here. Any issues, we take care of. It's that installer can sell. So serviceability is becoming a big differentiator. So with our third-generation battery which is the one that we are shipping today in volume. All of those are best-in-class, commissioning, the quality of the batteries, the serviceability of the batteries, the modularity, we have 5 kilowatt hours. It's an LFP battery, lithium ion phosphate with UL 9540A is just a better battery on all fronts.
Joseph Osha: I'm sorry, go ahead.
Raghu Belur: We also have our design proposal tool solar graph that upfront allows the installer to do a very, very good design for the -- whatever the homeowners expectations are in terms of payback period and upfront cost, et cetera. You can really fine tune the design of the solar plus battery system and generates a proposal. It takes it a step further. We can do single -- we do single-line diagrams, permit plant generation, everything out of this tool. So it's an end-to-end solution that we are providing the homeowner, everything from design to installation, the ease of installation, serviceability and really good customer service, and that's what it's going to take for broad white scale adoption of battery, and you're seeing that happening. I think it's being reflected in the numbers that we shared.
Joseph Osha: Okay. And then just as a follow-on to that, I guess my question is stipulating that you all have fix the product issues, which clearly you have. Does there need to be some kind of augmented effort to educate dealers and maybe bring them back into the fold if they've gotten their fingers burned trying to sell batteries in the past or is just saying, hey, we've got a good product, now trust us? Is that enough?
Badri Kothandaraman: So yes, absolutely. It's not enough. We have to do a lot more. We have to do the events such as what we did in Netherlands. It's got to be done at a higher frequency because the NEM 3.0 experience is telling us that we don't need to help in whatever way we can. And we are going to do exactly that. We have our sales, I mean our team actually listening to our installers and their salespeople, we are we can do a lot more there in terms of simplifying our software so that we can really make sure that the selling at the kitchen table becomes a lot easier. And that's what we are going to do in the next few months.
Operator: The next question comes from Gus Richard of Northland. Please go ahead.
Auguste Richard: Yes, thanks for taking the question. I just had, first of all, on gross margin, you guided down about 500 basis points sequentially. And I was just wondering, is that a function of mix? Or is it a function of underutilization? Or is it something else?
Badri Kothandaraman: It's a function of mix and some underutilization reflected.
Auguste Richard: Okay. Can you sort of allocate to those two or?
Badri Kothandaraman: No, we are not breaking down numbers. You can see our microinverters is basically down compared to the prior quarter. So basically primarily attributed to that.
Auguste Richard: That's fair enough. And then moving forward, you've got a number of cost downs coming in, Gen 4 [ph] battery and moving to GaN, IQ9, et cetera. I was wondering if you could just talk about how those new products and cost down sort of roll into the model over the next couple of quarters? And what, if any, impact we'll have on gross margin? And that's for me.
Badri Kothandaraman: Yes, I talked about the three things on batteries. Once again, just to refresh, cell packs costs are coming down. Microinverters are going to be made in America and then go into batteries. So that supply chain is going to become best in class. The third is, the first two are for all our batteries. The third is specifically for the fourth-generation, which has improved architecture integrating power conversion, and battery management. These three initiatives should take the battery gross margins up not in a very nice fashion. Then the other one, you talked about GaN-based product. For us, GaN we are essentially looking to release in our next generation inverter that's called IQ9. IQ9, at this point, we are thinking of two power flavors and approximately 427-watts of AC and 540-watts of AC. And the challenge for us, and that's a challenge to the team is to basically get the cost structure of the 427-watt product to actually be smaller than the product we are shipping today, which is IQ8 product. And we think it is possible because of one particular innovation there is along with GaN, we have something called as BDS, bidirectional GaN. So today, we use four silicon transistors at the output stage. And that can go into two GaN facts, because they are bidirectional. So therefore, GaN can actually -- even if the GaN transistors themselves, the overall cost of those GaN transistors may be the same as silicon. Even if that is the case, GaN comes with a lot of other advantages. Like for example, your transformers can now become a lot smaller. If you run your fetz [ph] at a higher frequency. So in general, the inverter can get smaller. And the challenge for us is how do you pack that power 427 watt power into the same form factor as IQ8 with the reduced cost structure compared to IQ8, that will allow us to make a lot of money, plus make those inverters in the U.S.
Operator: The next question comes from Moses Sutton of BNP Paribas. Please go ahead.
Moses Sutton: Hi, thanks for fitting me in. So Badri, I missed the sell-through and how correction points as well as your answer to sale. What are your thoughts on the still shifting demand? So it looks like -- if you look at the front-end data, there are still states where demand is still dropping in real time, like even into January and pricing for loans and leases haven't inflected or haven't at least changed to inflect organic market growth. How do you pull that together when you're thinking through your comments specifically for 2H?
Badri Kothandaraman: Yes. I mean, look, we all know that there is seasonality factor from non-California states. But the fact of the matter is at least our data non-California states have, if you look at Q4 versus Q3, they're flat in terms of microinverters. And we think they will bounce back coming off the seasonality. That's what we think. And then I already talked about the puts and takes on Europe and why we think Europe will also move continuously not because they are at the bottom right now. California is, of course, a wildcard. But there, you see -- I think our downside will be limited because, as I told you, the revenue of a NEM 3.0 system, is roughly 1.5x that of an NEM 2.0 system for us, considering the attach we are seeing. So I think in general, of course, if I could be wrong, if Q2 doesn't recover seasonally, but that's not what we have seen in the past.
Moses Sutton: Got it. Very helpful. And I guess just squeezing one more. In the unlikely event that I already risk is on the table, at least some modification to 45x credit. Would you still be comfortable with 70% of manufacturing capacity in the U.S.? Or would you shift back to some other balance?
Badri Kothandaraman: I mean, look, we -- at that time, we will analyze the data in front of us. But look, that's the way we break out for you, gross margin without IRA and gross margin with IRA because we never want to -- we want to be straight with the gross margin. The native gross margin of the business. That's why we break it out. So if it doesn't make sense economically to manufacture here that we have the same two contract manufacturers worldwide. And our lines can be shipped anywhere in the world. Of course, it is tough and we will work with the contract manufacturer in terms of the labor, et cetera, and it is tough and we'll do the right things there. But if the economics are there, we will not be here.
Operator: The next question comes from Maheep Mandloi of Mizuho. Please go ahead.
Maheep Mandloi: Hey, thanks for squeezing me in as well. Just on the gross margin. So it looks like the gross margins, excluding 45x is more or less in line quarter-over-quarter. But I guess the biggest delta is coming from the 45x tax credits in the quarter. Is that just a reflection of lower U.S. shipments? Or anything specific to kind of read into that on Q1 guidance?
Mandy Yang: Yes. Based on the Q1 guidance, our non-GAAP gross margin before IRA benefit is more or less in line with Q4 actual. But with IRA benefit non-GAAP gross margin dropped by five points, 100% attributable to the IRA units. We plan to ship only 500,000 units in Q1 and that translates into about $13 million be our benefit reduction in Q1 versus Q4, and that $13 million is about five points.
Maheep Mandloi: Got it. And on the IRA benefits, I'm not sure if this was asked, but is it -- can you talk about like if you can get the benefit on the micro inverters added in the IQ batteries going forward?
Raghu Belur: Yes, that's our expectation that the microinverters as long as they are manufactured here in the U.S. will also get this same benefits.
Operator: The next question comes from Tristan Richardson of Scotia Bank. Please go ahead.
Tristan Richardson: Hi, good evening guys. Just one for me. We'll keep it brief. Badri, I know quarter in and quarter out, you make it clear that there's always competition. And I know earlier in your prepared comments, you said market share has been -- have been stable. Can you just talk about this concept of component integration. If a competing battery that has an integrated central soul of inverter, do you see any sort of threat in some of these high attached geographies where you could see a shift in preference over power architecture?
Badri Kothandaraman: Yes. I'm going to have Raghu.
Raghu Belur: Yes. So we have said this before as well, competition is not new for us. We've been in a very competitive environment since the inception of the company. Specifically, we've been in a very tough competitive environment when it comes to fighting against string inverters or centralized topology. So these are the kind of competitions we actually like. We have a very strong value proposition, vis-à-vis centralized our strong inverter topologies. The better performance, much higher reliability, much simpler to design, install and maintain as well as safety around not having any high voltage DC in our system. Now they added sophistication of our system with solar, integration of solar, batteries, EV chargers, heat pumps, and all the energy management software that we layer on top of that creates a better month. So this is not just about widget sale or a piece of hardware. This is now a complete solution sale. Furthermore, the solution means you need to have upfront design tools, which can help the installer design the appropriate system for the homeowner. Of course, make it very simple plug-and-play to install. And then on the other hand, provide great customer service for serviceability so that the homeowner is taking care of. So competition is not new, particularly competition against centralized topologies is absolutely not new. We have been -- we have honed our skills on that. But we are also very aware and paranoid about competition. So we make sure that we are continually improving our product.
Tristan Richardson: Great. Appreciate it, Raghu.
Operator: The next question comes from Vick Bagri of Citigroup. Please go ahead.
Vikram Bagri: Good evening guys. Really two quick questions. I wanted to ask about pricing slightly differently. You say a market share opportunity that you guys see with you holding stronger margin than your peers and room to sacrifice some of that margin to more permanent discounts than SBAs, especially, Badri, you talked about new markets, Italy and launching batteries in India. Do you see that as an opportunity to gain more market share rapidly? And then both broadly, is there anything else on your radar that may make you rethink pricing, is that -- is it just competition and more sort of like cost cuts or component cost cuts that will drive pricing? Or if there's anything else on your radar that could change your view on debt pricing?
Badri Kothandaraman: Yes. It's a question I keep getting asked, we price products, we've done value. Value means our pricing is the next best alternative plus the value we generate on top of it. We don't generate value, then yes, I mean we are a commodity product. So that's not what our intention is. We have a differentiating value proposition. Microinverters its quality, its service, its reliability. It is superior for power production performance. And in batteries, we are getting there. So high quality for me is high price, right, we have the capability to demand the premium. And in microinverters, as you can see, even with those high prices, we -- our market share is very healthy. So I don't believe that we need to drop pricing in order to gain market share. You need to have the product that solves the customer problems at the end of the day. You need to take care of customers well and then reward you by paying you the premium that you deserve. So that's our philosophy, and we intend to take a risk to that.
Vikram Bagri: And the next question maybe for Mandy. I was wondering how you're thinking about use of cash and intrinsic value here, $100 million of buybacks if price is significantly below $100 million given where the stock is trading, should we expect buybacks to meaningfully slow down? Or could you still look to offset these share based compensation dilution through buybacks in forthcoming quarters? Thank you.
Mandy Yang: Sure. So Q4, we said we already buyback $100 million, right and $85 per share. A quarter before, we bought $110 million, right at $130 per share, right. Q1, we plan to do similar magnitude of share buyback. As soon as we believe our share price is below the intrinsic value, right? We are very disciplined in doing share buyback. Every quarter, we look at the current share price and then we propose for the Board to approve and we execute.
Operator: The next question comes from Pavel Molchanov of Raymond James. Please go ahead.
Pavel Molchanov: Thanks for taking the question. Just one for me as well. It's been about a year since you last made an acquisition, as I recall, it was one of the software developers. Can you talk about how you're thinking about M&A? And specifically, are there some quasi distressed opportunities in the current environment that perhaps are more interesting than before?
Badri Kothandaraman: Yes. We have -- you are correct. We have made some reasonable acquisitions. Solar graph is an example of one. The permitting services is one. EV charging is one. And we are working on all of them. So we're careful about choosing what we want. And then we try to make them an integral part of the system. So what are the opportunities like that. And we constantly keep looking for those is the key places where we would look for is, I mean, okay. First of all, what we are not going to be looking for is we are not an installer. So therefore, we don't buy installation company. We are a technology player. So and for example, on microinverters, we have all the necessary IP. We aren't going to do -- going to look for anything outside in places such as home energy management software, there's always opportunity for us especially leveraging AI and ML talent to make -- to accelerate our progress there, because I think energy management software will become the next frontier. That's one that we are always looking for opportunities. The other is on batteries, of course, innovative technologies on batteries, batteries getting better, more reliable, more energy density becoming a lot higher. That's of course an area that we continuously look at. Those are the ones that are on our radar right now. But we look at a lot of companies and when we make some decisions on those you'll know. But we are very disciplined. We don't do -- we don't just buy companies because we have cash. Those companies need to fit into our company well. They need to be bolt-on acquisitions, what we like. And we care about integration a lot. That's important for us. If there is an opportunity in the March we'll move, and you'll know.
Pavel Molchanov: Thanks very much.
Operator: The next question comes from Austin Moeller of Canaccord. Please go ahead.
Austin Moeller: Hi, good evening. Just a question for me here. If you say in the U.S. market, if interest rates fall by 50 to 100 basis points this year, do you expect to see more demand of combined orders from microinverters with batteries? Or do you expect the initial demand will primarily be for microinverters? Thank you.
Badri Kothandaraman: I think in the non-California states, it will obviously be for microinverters because the battery attach is small. But in California, it will move the needle for both microinverters and batteries.
Austin Moeller: Great. Thanks for the color.
Badri Kothandaraman: Thank you.
Operator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Badri Kothandaraman for any closing remarks.
Badri Kothandaraman: Yes. Thank you for joining us today and for your continued support of Enphase. We look forward to speaking with you again next quarter. Bye.
Operator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation, and you may now disconnect.

We have provided a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures in our earnings release furnished with the SEC on Form 8-K which can also be found in the Investor Relations section of our website. Now, I'd like to introduce Badri Kothandaraman, our President and Chief Executive Officer. Badri?
Badri Kothandaraman: Good afternoon and thanks for joining us today to discuss our third quarter 2023 financial results. We reported quarterly revenue of $551.1 million, shipped approximately 3.9 million microinverters and 86 megawatt hours of batteries and generated free cash flow of $122 million. Approximately 86% of our Q3 microinverter shipments were IQ8. We exited the third quarter at 48% gross margin, 18% operating expense and 30% operating income, all as a percentage of revenue on a non-GAAP basis and including the IRA benefit. Mandy will go into our financials later in the call. Let's now discuss how we are servicing customers. Our worldwide NPS was 77% in Q3, compared to 74% in Q2. Our NPS in North America was 78%, compared to 77% in Q2. Our average call wait time was 1.3 minutes, compared to 1.1 minutes in Q2. We made significant progress on root cause fixes of some customer issues and expanded our field service teams globally. Let's talk about operations. In general, the overall supply environment for microinverters and batteries is quite stable right now. Let's cover microinverters specifically U.S. manufacturing. We began manufacturing at Salcomp's facility in Arlington, Texas during third quarter. We shipped approximately 531,000 microinverters to customers in Q3 from our three contract manufacturers in the U.S. Flex in South Carolina, Foxconn in Wisconsin, and Salcomp in Texas. We expect to ship approximately 1 million microinverters to customers from our U.S. manufacturing facilities in Q4. Let's talk about batteries. For IQ batteries, we have two cell pack suppliers, both of which are in China. We have a manufacturing capacity of 300 megawatt hours per quarter, positioning us well to ramp up in 2024. We are looking at bringing manufacturing of IQ batteries into the U.S. by the middle of 2024. Let's now cover the regions. Our U.S. and international revenue mix for Q3 was 64% and 36% respectively. In the U.S., our revenue decreased 16% sequentially and 22% year-on-year. The overall sell-through of our microinverters was down 12% in Q3 compared to Q2. On the other hand, the sell-through of our IQ batteries in the U.S. was up by 34% in Q3 compared to Q2. In Europe, our revenue decreased 34% sequentially and increased 26% year-on-year at healthy gross margin. The sell-through of our microinverters in Europe was also down 35% in Q3 compared to Q2. The sell-through of our IQ batteries in Europe was down by 14% in Q3 compared to Q2. We are now shipping IQ microinverters and batteries into many countries in Europe. We recently entered U.K., Sweden, Denmark, and Greece markets with both IQ8 microinverters and IQ batteries. Combined, these new markets represent more than 1.5 gigawatts of residential solar opportunity with countries like the U.K. having a healthy battery attach rate of 30%. I'll provide some brief commentary on Australia. Our revenue in Australia more than doubled year-on-year. We are quite pleased with the launch of our Enphase Energy System. It is state-of-the-art, powered by IQ8 microinverters plus a third-generation battery. Let me comment on the rest of the world. In Brazil, we launched our IQ8P microinverters, 480 watts AC, the highest power microinverters that we have. We also launched the Solargraf software platform and have good feedback from installers there. In addition, we started shipping both the 384 watts IQ8 HC and the 480 watts IQ8 P microinverters into India to support high-powered solar panels. Let's now talk about Q4 guidance. We are guiding revenue for Q4 in the range of $300 to $350 million. This reflects approximately $150 million of channel inventory correction in the U.S. and Europe. In other words, we are under shipping to the end market demand for our products by approximately $150 million. We anticipate under shipment will continue in Q1 and expect our channel inventory to normalize in Q2. Of course, we are conservative and are assuming the demand picture is unchanged from the current level. So what has changed since 90 days ago when we told you that the inventory levels would normalize by the end of Q3? We have seen a substantial demand reduction in Europe. We've also seen the U.S. market continue to fall, driven by California. When the demand falls, we think more decisive inventory correction becomes necessary. We are being conservative in our assumptions of no demand recovery until Q2 in this framework. So that explains the guidance. Despite the large reduction in Q4 guidance, we are maintaining our non-GAAP gross margin above 40% in our guidance without the IRA benefit. We aren't making any broad-based pricing changes at this time on microinverters, and we have already made the necessary changes on batteries before. Our pricing and operations team are doing an excellent job of managing pricing and reducing costs. Let's discuss some market trends. I'll give you a little more than usual color on markets. Let's split the U.S. market by non-California states and California. For non-California states, the sell-through of our microinverters was 4% lesser in Q3 compared to Q2. We see this business starting to stabilize given the weekly sell-through trends. In California, the sell-through of our microinverters was 25% lesser in Q3 compared to Q2 due to the NEM 3.0 transition. It will take a few more quarters for our installers to fully transition to NEM 3.0 and normalize sales to NEM 2.0 levels. Utility rates are continuing to move higher in California with one California utility recently requesting a 22% rate hike, assuming that even half of that rate hike is approved by the CPUC. The payback period for an NEM 3.0 solar plus a battery system will become close to an NEM 2.0 solar only system. So that's good. Let me say a few words about U.S. market share before I give more color on Europe. We see stable share today for our microinverters based on both internal as well as third-party data. Competition is not new for us. We have always relied on our differentiated technology with our distributed AC architecture, product quality, and customer service to win share. And we expect this to continue. We have many tools at our disposal, such as the installer services that we have bought. We made several acquisitions over time in the last couple of years, such as the software tool for design and proposal, the permitting tools, lead management, etcetera. We have a lot of tools at our disposal to help our installers and our partnerships go a lot deeper in the downtown. Let's talk about Europe demand a little bit. We are facing two challenges in Europe. And the situation has dramatically changed from the last quarter, from 90 days ago. We saw a much weaker demand recovery from summer. We also see a lot of distributors facing oversupply of solar equipment, particularly panels, leading to much more aggressive destocking. Despite this temporary weakness, we think that the pullback in Europe will be temporary as the fundamentals remain strong. And we are relatively underpenetrated in the U.S. We are entering lots of new geographies with our IQ8 microinverters and batteries. So we remain very bullish about Europe. Let me spend a few minutes discussing our three largest markets in Europe, the Netherlands, France, and Germany in detail. In Netherlands, our largest European market, our Q3 sell-through was down 40% compared to Q2. This was our first sequentially down quarter in the last two years. Installers tell us that the customers' fear of an export penalty and confusion around ending of the net metering has caused the market pullback. I was in Netherlands two weeks ago. I visited with our leading installers. I came away confident that this pullback will be short-lived. We think that the plan for net metering will be clarified after the country's elections in November. The payback period are continuing to be attractive in Netherlands. In addition, total system solutions which includes batteries, solar and EV chargers are going to become the norm as dynamic tariffs become more prevalent in Netherlands. We are well positioned to take advantage of these changes. In France, our Q3 sell-through was down 34% compared to Q2, driven by seasonality. We see potential for this market to rebound very quickly. We are already seeing that as utility rates recently moved higher and are expected to increase even more in early 2024. In Germany, our Q3 sell-through was down 32% compared to Q2. We saw strong sequential growth in installer count and activations and we are continuing to gain traction there. Let's talk about our new products, IQ batteries. Our sell-through for batteries has been steadily increasing over the last couple of quarters. We are at an inflection point for our battery business. With our IQ battery 5P, we can deliver the best power specs and the best commissioning times of any Enphase battery till date at an industry-leading 15-year warranty and at the right price point. The battery adoption rates are on the rise globally. We are well positioned to grow battery sales throughout 2024. And we are working on entering even more countries in Europe and Asia in the next few months with our IQ battery 5P. In addition, we expect to introduce our fourth-generation battery in the middle of 2024. That will have a much reduced form factor and a reduced cost structure. As previously discussed, we have entered many new markets with the IQ8 family of microinverters. We plan to enter many more new markets in Europe and Asia in the next several months. Let's talk about our latest microinverter for the residential segment in emerging markets. I did mention this before. This is the IQ8P microinverter, our highest power microinverter till date, 480 watts of AC power. That can support solar panels up to 650 watts DC for Brazil, India, South Africa, Mexico, Spain, and other emerging markets. We have started shipping the product into Brazil, South Africa, and India in Q3 and are on track to start shipping in Mexico and Spain in Q4. The other variant of the IQ8P microinverter with a new three-phase cabling system is well suited for small commercial solar installations ranging from 20 to 200 kilowatts. We are doing beta installations as we speak there and we expect to release the product this quarter into the U.S. market. We are very bullish about the small commercial solar business where we believe we can add value to our business owners and installers with our quality and good customer experience. Let's cover EV charging. We shipped over 3,500 chargers in Q3 compared to over 6,600 chargers in Q2. We launched our IQ smart EV chargers in the U.S. just a few days ago, both U.S. and Canada, actually. The IQ EV charger is Wi-Fi enabled. It includes smart control and smart monitoring capabilities. It seamlessly integrates into our solar and battery systems to help homeowners maximize savings, for example, by directly charging from solar energy only. That's called green charging. We are also working on developing IQ EV chargers for many countries in Europe and we expect to introduce them in the middle of 2024. Let's now discuss our installer platform briefly. Solargraf, our cloud-based design proposal software platform, now provides M3.0 functionality for solar and battery systems in California. We are now offering 3D and shading features and continue to make progress on our new features and functions. The software platform is now available to installers in U.S., Germany, Austria, and Brazil. We expect to make this software release as part of our standard offering to any country that we enter. Let me conclude. We are managing through a slowdown in our overall demand. In the U.S., it is due to high interest rates and M3.0. In Europe, it is due to broad macroeconomic conditions. Despite this, we are very bullish about our business long-term. We see several positive drivers that will accelerate adoption such as the 30% ITC tax credit in the U.S., rising utility rates globally, increased grid instability also globally, climate change, and of course, increasing EV adoption worldwide. We have no doubt that these will drive meaningful solar plus battery growth. Our strategy is very clear. We manage for the long-term. We are doubling down on our relationships with our customers during these times. We are driving down installation times and investing in our customer service teams. We are also strongly investing in innovation. We are working on IQ9 and IQ10, our next two generations of microinverters, as well as the next two generations of batteries. We are also rapidly expanding worldwide with systems comprising of IQ8 microinverters, IQ batteries, IQ EV chargers, and home energy management software. We are introducing products for the small commercial and emerging residential solar markets. And we are making continuous enhancements to our installer platform in addition to driving towards world-class costs on our products. We remain very positive about our future growth and profitability and will continue to make best-in-class home energy systems with a laser focus on innovation, quality, and customer experience. With that, I will turn the call over to Mandy for her review of her financial results. Mandy?
Mandy Yang: Thanks, Badri, and good afternoon, everyone. I will provide more details related to our third quarter of 2023 financial results, as well as our business outlook for the fourth quarter of 2023. We have provided reconciliations of this non-GAAP-to-GAAP financial measures in our earnings release posted today, which can also be found in the IR section of our website. Total revenue for Q3 was $551.1 million. We shipped approximately 1585.6 megawatts DC of microinverters and 86.2 megawatt hours of IQ batteries in the quarter. Non-GAAP growth margin for Q3 was 48.4%, compared to 46.2% in Q2. The increase was driven by increased net IRA benefit. GAAP growth margin was 47.5% for Q3. GAAP and non-GAAP growth margin for Q3 included $14.5 million of net IRA benefit for our microinverters made in the U.S. and shipped to customers in the quarter. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $99 million for Q3, compared to $98.2 million for Q2. We are diligently managing operating expenses and will continue to do so in the coming quarters. GAAP operating expenses were $144 million for Q3, compared to $153 million for Q2. GAAP operating expenses for Q3 included $41.1 million of stock-based compensation expenses and $3.9 million of amortization for acquired intangible assets. On a non-GAAP basis, income from operations for Q3 was $167.6 million, compared to $230.5 million for Q2. On a GAAP basis, income from operations was $118 million for Q3, compared to $170.3 million for Q2. On a non-GAAP basis, net income for Q3 was $141.8 million, compared to $205.6 million for Q2. This resulted in non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.02 for Q3, compared to $1.47 for Q2. GAAP net income for Q3 was $114 million, compared to a GAAP net income of $157.2 million for Q2. This resulted in GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.80 for Q3, compared to $1.09 for Q2. We exited Q3 with a total cash, cash equivalent and marketable securities balance of $1.78 billion, compared to $1.8 billion at the end of Q2. As part of our $1 billion share repurchase program authorized by our Board of Directors in July, 2023. We repurchased approximately 847,000 shares of Enphase common stock in Q3 at an average share price of $129.92 for $110 million. In addition, we spent approximately $8.5 million by withholding shares to cover withholding taxes for employees stock vesting in Q3. That reduced the diluted shares by approximately 59.8000 shares. We expect to continue this anti-dilution plan. In Q3, we generated $145.9 million in cash flow from operations and $122 million in free cash flow. Despite the macroeconomic challenges, we continue to generate healthy free cash flow as a result of our strong financial discipline. Capital expenditure was $23.8 million for Q3 compared to $44 million for Q2. Capital expenditure requirements decreased as we largely completed building out our U.S. manufacturing lines. Now let's discuss our outlook for the fourth quarter of 2023. We expected our revenue for Q4 to be within a range of $300 million to $350 million, which includes shipments of 80 to 100 megawatt hours of actual batteries. We expect GAAP gross margin to be within a range of 46% to 49% with net IRA benefit and 38% to 41% before net IRA benefit. We expect non-GAAP gross margin to be within a range of 48% to 41% with net IRA benefit and 40% to 43% before net IRA benefit. Non-GAAP gross margin excludes stock-based compensation expenses and acquisition related amortization. We expect the net IRA benefit to be between $26 million and $28 million, an estimated shipment of 1 million units of U.S. manufactured microinverters. We expect our GAAP operating expenses to be within a range of $142 million to $146 million, including approximately $57 million estimated for stock-based compensation expenses and acquisition related expenses and amortization. We expect our non-GAAP operating expenses to be within a range of $85 million to $89 million. We are reducing our non-GAAP operating expenses by 12% in Q4 as compared to Q3, but will not compromise on investing in customer service, innovation and sales. Moving to tax. Since we have utilized most of our net operating loss and research tax credit carry forward, we are now a significant U.S. cash taxpayer. We expect GAAP and non-GAAP annualized effective tax rate for 2023 to be at 22%, plus or minus 1% with IRA benefit. We expect the production credit net of any incremental cost for domestic manufacturing to be in the range of $26 to $28 per microinverters sold to customers in Q4. We expect to ship 1 million microinverters to customers this quarter. We now have all three of our U.S. manufacturing facilities operational. With that, I will open the line for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] At this time, we will take our first question, which will come from Brian Lee with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Brian Lee: Hey, guys. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the questions. I know the environment's pretty uncertain, so appreciate the additional sort of out-quarter visibility and some of the market by market color Badri. So can I just want to ask, as you think about the framework, you said you'd under-ship in Q1 the way that you're under-shipping Q3 and Q4? Can you give us, one, a sense of how much you expect to under-ship in Q1, and then so you made the comment that this is all contingent upon sort of demand trends staying about where they're at. Can you give us a sense of what your internal expectations for demand trends are? It sounds like you don't expect them to get worse but sort of can you quantify that a bit? And then I have a follow up.
Badri Kothandaraman: Yes, I think there are a few puts and takes. First to answer your question is, is the under shipment going to be close to $150 million in Q1? We expect it to be a little bit less than $150 million, but not too much less. That's our expectation. And second is I will talk about markets, and then it'll become clear to you. First of all, we see the non-California state stabilizing. We see that. So therefore, we aren't that much worried there. Of course, things could go a lot south during the winter, but we are already at pretty low levels, so we don't think so. California is definitely a wild card. But even if that goes down 10% more, I think we'll be fine. Because we expect Europe to recover a little more. Europe right now, for all the reasons I said, we basically are undershipping quite a bit in order to normalize inventory. And that will be the fastest to normalize. So we expect Europe revenue to come back a little bit up in Q1. Therefore, what we expect, at least, what we expect internally is that our revenues, sell-in revenues, we think will be close to what we are looking at in Q4. Of course, I don't have a crystal ball. I'm not giving you Q1 guidance. This is our expectation right now. And Q2 onwards, we think the channel inventory is going to approach normalized levels. And therefore, that normalized level, assuming the demand picture is unchanged, that normal level is what we said, roughly around $450 million to $500 million is the normal level. That assumes no change in demand from the current situation. So we expect our revenue to approach that number in the second quarter. But of course, that doesn't tell you too much, because I'm assuming that the demand is the same at the current depressed level. One thing which I forgot to say is, in France, which is another very big market for us, we already see the sell-through rates, for example, in the first three weeks of this quarter, are already back up high, which is good. Basically, there was a utility rate hike in August. There is one more expected in February. So we think France will recover fast. Netherlands, we have some education to do. Like what I told you, there is some political uncertainty there. We think that will get cleared after Q4. So I think Q1 will be definitely better. And that's a great market, where that market is now, in addition to solar, I think with the dynamic tariff starting to become prevalent in Netherlands, there is opportunity for battery storage in 7 million homes. Today, just so that everybody understands, Netherlands, there is 7 to 8 million homes. Solar is there in 2.2 million homes today. And now, with this opportunity, where net metering is going to evolve into something similar to California, not exactly the same, but very similar, what's going to happen is it opens up opportunity for solar plus storage in all 7 million homes. So I think long-term is going to be great for us. But I told you what's going to happen in the short term.
Brian Lee: Yes, that's great context. I appreciate it. Just a second one here, and I'll pass it on. On the margins, gross margins, non-GAAP, it seems like you're guiding the low 40s, ex-IRA benefit. How much of that, it's down a couple hundred bips from what you've been tracking at recently. How much of that is due to pricing? How much due to mix? Maybe can you give us a sense of the margin puts and takes into year end? And then do you see anything that would put incremental pressure on the margins into next year? Thank you.
Badri Kothandaraman: It's pretty simple. And Brian, you will understand it quickly. You can see our storage business is actually going a little bit up. Our micro inverter business is the one that is going a lot down now because of our under-shipment. And therefore, if you see the product mix issue, and microinverters have a little bit more gross margin than storage. And therefore, with this product mix, that's why we have the guidance of non-GAAP gross margin 40% to 43% for the company without IRA. With IRA, non-GAAP gross margin of 48 to 51. So in terms of pricing, I mean, we are not planning to make any broad-based pricing changes. Of course, the pricing, there is a lot of competition, but we have seen competition for the last few years since I've been here. We have a very disciplined business process. It's a pricing business process. It's called SPA, Phil Shen likes to talk about it. It's a special pricing adjustment. We have been doing that forever, and it is not new. That's one. And also in these times, of course, underloading, we have to work with our contract manufacturers to take care of underloading. But in these times, especially when you have multiple suppliers for a particular component, multi-sourcing for a component, this is the opportunity where we can drop costs a lot. So our target, I mean, any good company in these times, we should be able to drop our cost by 10% per year. And we'll be targeting that. And so we have to talk both equations, pricing and cost. And so we are quite confident in our gross margins. This is what we do. It is not new. This is what we established when I joined the company. We have a pricing team that prices based on value. We have a world-class cost team that works on costs. And it's business as usual for us in these environments.
Brian Lee: All right, thank you, I'll pass it on.
Operator: Our next question will come from James West with Evercore ISI.
James West: Hey, good afternoon, Badri.
Badri Kothandaraman: Hi.
James West: Badri, as we're going through this period of destocking and some weakness in certain markets, understanding that you've always faced competition and you have a very value-based pricing strategy, are you seeing any behavior that's by your competitors that is somewhat irrational? Or is the market overall behaving rationally, understanding that this will get out of this in a few quarters?
Badri Kothandaraman: Well, I'll be lying if I tell you I'm not seeing something irrational. Of course, installers are very stressed, right? They do want to take advantage of the lowest cost available at a given point in time. So therefore, sometimes without understanding, they may want to switch to somebody who's offering low cost. But we usually, most of our installers are, they have a lot of experience. They're very well trained now. And they understand the importance of distributed architecture. They understand the importance of single point, no single point of failure. They understand quality. They understand customer service. And therefore, you might save a few dollars up front, but if you have a quality problem, a service call by the installer is a truck roll. You spend a lot of money in one truck roll. And if you just do one more, I mean, that's it, you have no more room there despite the low cost. So it's a penny wise pound foolish strategy to do that. And they've all realized it. And, if you actually put things in context, let us say the pricing is $3 or $3.50 for what? You look at the inverter bill of materials, probably of the order of 10%. Should you play around there? Should you take a lot of risks there? And it's their call at the end of the day. And many of them are wise to say, we're not going to make that call. So, I mean, we have a lot of robust discussions. This is the time where we are talking to customers more than ever. We have a lot of other tools at our disposal. For example, Solargraf. We do design and proposal. We can generate leads for installers at very economical rates. We can help them on permitting services, for example, sometimes even free of charge. We have a lot of tools at our disposal to reduce their soft costs. And that's critical because we have to look at everything. We cannot look at component level. We have to look at the full system level in these times. And once you start looking at that and have these discussions, usually it comes back to, we get more market share, not less. And more installers want to move to us, not less. You can see some evidence of that in the third party reports.
James West: Okay, okay, got it. That's very helpful, Badri. Thank you. And just one quick follow up for me. You mentioned producing IQ batteries in the U.S. by middle 2024. Did you give a capacity number along with that?
Badri Kothandaraman: No, we have not given. We will provide more details as we come close to that date.
James West: Okay, got it. Thanks.
Badri Kothandaraman: Yes, thank you.
Operator: Our next question will come from Eric Stein with Craig-Hallum. Please go ahead.
Eric Stein: Hi, everyone. So just talking about California, I can appreciate talking or thinking about that as a wild card given what's going on in the market. But if I think about the expectation that that market stays flat, but then the hangover from NEM, which you said has a few quarters here left to work out, I don't want to put words in your mouth, but I mean, is it fair to say that there is some cautious optimism about California as we get into the back half of next year?
Badri Kothandaraman: Absolutely, yes. As we get into the back half, absolutely. Meaning one is the utility rates are continuing to go up. The second is, let's assume the utility rates go up even by half the amount they are advertised, the payback, like what I said, is going to become, I mean, for a solar plus storage system is going to become the same as, almost the same as a solar only NEM 2.0 system. And, the economics are there actually today. The battery can not only provide resilience, it can help the grid during times of stress in August and September when the grid needs it the most. So it's a combination of you get resilience for yourself, you make money by providing grid services, which is incorporated into the utility rates right now. And we are well positioned to doing that. Why? Because we got great microinverters, number one. We got batteries now that can discharge at very high power, double the power of our earlier batteries. Why is that important? Because during certain hours, you have the utility paying you a lot for exporting power to the grid. And what we can do because of a high discharge rate, during those times we can maximize the power. So we can do that. So we have solar plus storage. And of course we have complete energy management software. And we couple that with our Solargraf design and proposal tool. We have everything, all the optimization at the fingertips of the homeowner. And many times he needs to do nothing. He just needs to turn on our optimization engine. It'll do the right thing for him. So we're absolutely very bullish about California towards the second half of 2024.
Eric Stein: Got it. And maybe just sticking with California for my follow-up, with NEM, is that whole, that transition takes place being the biggest factor? I mean, what are some of the other factors that could do, that cause California to be a wildcard? What are the things that are maybe top of mind for you that could cause that market to take another leg down?
Raghu Belur: Yes, this is Raghu. And as Badri mentioned, all of the potential tailwinds that are there, remember in an environment where the demand per home is continuing to go up, people are continuing to electrify. People are buying more and more EVs, heat pumps, etcetera. And couple that with utility rates where they are and going further up, this is the right solution. Solar plus battery is the right solution. The energy management software is absolutely the right solution in order to drive your ROI and as well as reduce your payback. And to that end, what we have done as well is a lot of education into the marketplace in terms of explaining to people, what the benefits of, solar plus battery system with energy management and etcetera. And going out there and educating the market as well as providing them with a lot of tools. So in this environment where demand is going up, you have the education, you have the tools, the financials are there, the payback is very good. That's the reason why we are extremely bullish about California coming back strongly.
Badri Kothandaraman: So to answer the question in another way, the headwinds are, headwinds that we see are if installers, aren't educated by us properly. If we don't do a good job of educating the installers, things can stall out a little bit. So it is important for us and other companies to, in this space, to make sure the installers, whatever we provide installers, the tools are very easy to use so that they can sit at the kitchen table and look at the homeowner and say, your payback is six years. And here is why your payback is six years. And explain to them very confidently. And it's not just Enphase, it is Enphase plus our competition, plus all of the energy companies. All of us have to do our job in training the, installers. And I think that is, of course, that's a piece that is not very easy to do. And you cannot have enough of it. So that's the biggest headwind that I see.
Eric Stein: Okay, thank you.
Operator: Our next question will come from Colin Rusch with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.
Colin Rusch: Thanks so much, guys. Can you talk a little bit about how much modulation you can do with the OpEx? As you look at investing in these incremental programs and bringing these products to market, is there some incremental cutting that you can do? Or there's going to be a regular spend increase on the R&D side?
Badri Kothandaraman: No, I mean, we are cutting OpEx by 12% from Q3 to Q4. How are we doing that? We are on a hiring freeze, except for critical positions, for example, in sales and customer service, and to a little bit on the innovation side there. So basically, that has got a big effect on, bringing down costs. The other ones are there are a few professional expenses, like, for example, this is the time where we look at a lot of fat, cutting out a lot of fat in the company. For example, when the companies are doing well, we do hire a lot of contractors. And, we are looking at all of those, and we have taken all the necessary actions to cut that level as well. And of course, as we continue to grow, I cannot deny that there is some fat that we found we can easily cut in other areas. We're able to cut about 12%. We are always looking for further room to cut because we'd like to get back to our baseline of OpEx pretty quickly, which is 15% of sales. So, we'll give the guidance accordingly. And of course, this is a dislocation in revenue, and that is temporary, but we're very cognizant of that, and we are always going to be trying to operate close to our model, which is 15% of sales.
Colin Rusch: Excellent. And then on the component side, given the change in volumes that you guys are working through on the microinverter side, obviously you're guiding to reasonably stable gross margins here, but I'm assuming that there's going to be, some breakpoints on the components that you may run into with a negative impact. Can you just talk a little bit about how your suppliers are scaling down with you here over the next quarter or two or three, and what that might do to your COGS line?
Badri Kothandaraman: Yes, I mean, it is a tough situation for our contract manufacturers, no question. And but we have great partners here. We have Flex, an amazing partner who helped us when we were, especially 2017, 2018, when we had some tough times, they were there right with us. Salcomp, also a great partner. So we work well together. We do have this is the time where both of us can recognize saying okay is this a short-term problem? Is this a long-term problem? Can we do things structurally? We recognize that both of us need to be profitable not just one versus the other. And we do take some necessary actions and all of those are confidential in terms of our relationships. I mean we cannot disclose the actions we are taking but our P&L always incorporates all of these. And so the message is over the next few quarters we will continue to work with them. We will give you the P&L transparently in the guidance for gross margin but we are very confident that you know we are finding the right solutions working together.
Colin Rusch: Okay thanks so much guys.
Badri Kothandaraman: Thank you.
Operator: And our next question will come from Philip Shen with ROTH Capital. Please go ahead.
Philip Shen: Hey guys thanks for taking my question. Badri you brought up SPA so I figured I'd jump in with a question on that. As you know our checks have come up with lower micro pricing under a bunch of SPA agreements on the order of 10%. Does that resonate with you at all or is that off base? I know you often will get something in return for some kind of price when you negotiate the SPA maybe a exclusivity or higher volume. Can you just talk through that a little bit? And then Mandy can you talk through how SPA accounting might work on your financial statements? For example do you net the SPA like the refunds against your sales? Do you have net sales or do you accrue a liability on your balance sheet? Thanks.
Badri Kothandaraman: So SPA first of all for the others in the call, SPA stands for special pricing adjustment. It is a business process that has been forever at Enphase and it is always happening. It's business as usual. A large fraction of our business usually happens at what we call it ADLP which is the distributor list price. And you know if business happens at ADLP there is no SPA. But for a small fraction of our customers depending upon how their volumes may go up within the quarter, next quarter, depending on their forecast we do SPA. SPAs are you have a volume price curve and when the volume goes up the price comes down. And that's how it is. And that process is very active. It's always been active. It's the one I instituted six years ago when I came and the accounting for that is unchanged. Whatever it is exactly what we have done in the last six years. So you know you talk about a $10 reduction. All of those are anecdotal. They don't matter. One customer doesn't matter. It's not a trend. It is a large fraction of our customers buy at the list price. So you know I'd like you to you know if there is a broad-based pricing adjustment we will tell you. And we are telling you right now that there is no broad-based pricing adjustment from us. Yes we will continue to do SPAs. That's the way of life for us. And sometimes it is a way for us to lock market share for the next you know X amount of quarters. And we'll do that. It's business as usual. Nothing new.
Mandy Yang: So Phil to answer your accounting question. Yes we accrue for SPA rebates as our liability right. When we recognize revenue the associated future potential rebates for the current quarter should be we accrue a reduction in revenue and is the liability on our balance sheet. Same accounting process. No change.
Philip Shen: Great. Thanks guys. Okay and then shifting gears. Appreciate that color. Thank you. I know you don't have any official guidance for 2024 but was wondering if you could talk through how you expect margin to trend by quarter in 2024. So you gave some perspective on Q1. There's under shipment there. Close to Q4. So due to product mix. So should we expect Q1 margin to be similar to Q4 because that product mix is maybe more heavily skewed to batteries again. And then due to product mix returning back in this base case to micros more micros potentially in Q2, after the undershipment in Q4 and 1, would you expect margins to return back to the pre-undershipment levels in Q2 of 2024 and back out next year? Thanks.
Badri Kothandaraman: Yes, I mean, that's logical. It is logical. If at Q1 what you said is right, we expect similar levels. Of course, I'm not giving guidance, but I'm just giving trends. And then Q2, we expect it to, because the mix is going to change. The microinverter mix is going to be a little bit higher than the prior quarter. So we expect that logically. That's correct.
Philip Shen: Great, okay, thanks guys. I'll pass it on.
Operator: Our next question will come from Mark Strouse with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Mark Strouse: Yes, thanks for taking our questions. I believe I asked this on the Q2 call as well, but just kind of given the precipitous decline in valuations across the space, I thought it's worth revisiting. So you're obviously sitting on a pile of cash. You continue to generate cash. Just curious, your latest thoughts on M&A, if that's something that you're planning on leaning into until the macro improves here?
Badri Kothandaraman: Yes, we do take a look at a number of companies all the time, every week. I have an M&A meeting. There are a lot of companies that come. We are very careful, especially in these times, to not buy something in a hurry. We're also careful of making sure that that company is aligned, of course, in terms of strategic fit and cultural fit. The former is extremely important. The latter is practically even more important. So the areas that we usually look for are more in the energy management software, sometimes in home automation, for example, small commercial solar, any innovation in batteries. We look for these. Usually we like smaller companies, bolt-on acquisitions. That's what we have done till now. But I mean, we are looking at all kinds of companies. Please stay tuned. If we are going to move on something, it won't be without you knowing.
Mark Strouse: Okay, thanks, Badri. And then just a real quick follow-up. I apologize if I missed this, but was there an update on the small commercial product, the timing or any color there?
Badri Kothandaraman: Yes, yes, there was. We are right now doing beta installations as we speak. The product is working great. We expect to introduce this product in this quarter, current quarter, and we expect to make some reasonable revenue out of this product in Q4.
Mark Strouse: Okay, thanks, Badri.
Operator: Our next question will come from Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.
Steve Fleishman: Yes, hi, thank you. The 150 million of undershipped [Ph] that you're talking about, could you break that out between the U.S. and Europe?
Badri Kothandaraman: I would say approximately equal between the two.
Steve Fleishman: Thank you. And then in Europe, the impact of, you mentioned two things, the weaker demand, and then also the issues with the distributors, de-stocking and the like. Could you just give some flavor of what, when you look at the weakness, you started to see what, are they about equal drivers? Is one kind of dominating the other?
Badri Kothandaraman: Yes, actually, to tell you the truth, every country is a little bit different. Clubbing them together under macroeconomics will not do justice, but there are a few factors, let me tell you, overall thing that can be generalized. It's basically, if you rewind to last year, all distributors, installers, consumers, were a lot more aggressive due to the Ukraine crisis. The Ukraine crisis, the shortage of natural gas, caused many countries to be very aggressive, to pull in their plans for renewables. And we saw a huge spike in virtually every country in Europe. Solar plus storage, everybody started stocking up a lot. And we also profited from that. Our revenue also peaked. But then that enthusiasm is a little bit tempered right now. And because of that, what's happening is the distributors are suddenly realizing that they got more on their hands. And also, earlier, maybe a year and a half back, the product availability wasn't that high because of that increase in demand. But now, all of the suppliers have geared up, especially panels. Product availability of panels is very high. So a lot of over-inventory, particularly on the panels, has happened. That is putting pressure on the distributors because they've purchased inventory at high prices before. And now the prices have collapsed on panels. So there is some financial weakness there. But again, they are conservative now. And they want to hold as less inventory as possible. So that's kind of a macroeconomic. Now let's come to Netherlands, our biggest market. Netherlands has got a very interesting dynamic that when I went there two weeks ago, because I went there, when I heard that our demand was dropping, I got concerned. I went there. And when I looked at it, the Netherlands situation is actually not so bad. If you see, their payback is about six years. But they had a scare recently, maybe two or three months ago, where an energy company called Vandebron basically said that to the consumer, saying, we are going to charge you a penalty to export solar back into the grid. And Vandebron is a very small fraction. There are about 35 energy companies I think in Netherlands. It's a deregulated market. Vandebron is one of them. They serve about 3% of customers. They basically said that, oh, we're going to charge you an export penalty. All they were trying to do is to put some pressure on the government, saying, you need to help us with net metering. Because the simple fact of the matter is Netherlands has got wind. It's got solar. There's 2.2 million homes with solar out of 7 million homes. These, if they start to export solar energy in a random manner, the energy companies are finding they cannot handle that easily. So they are putting pressure on the government to say, okay net metering needs to evolve into something where the customers have self-consumption, which is solar plus storage. And so it's actually extremely good for us there. But the way they are doing it is, of course, a little bit disruptive. So the government is going to respond once it is in place. Now there is an election happening. Net metering clarity is going to come probably after that. But the way it's going to evolve is this market. Net metering will still last until 2025. So we are covered for the next two years with good payback. And then the payback will be maintained after that with the combination of solar plus storage plus dynamic tariffs, which is getting popular there. So that's the big picture in Netherlands. Many of the European countries are evolving in a similar way. Many of them have gotten dynamic tariffs. Germany is a little bit ahead. They don't have dynamic tariffs, but they introduced feed-in tariffs early, which is very similar to net metering. Export is not paid as much as import. In fact, it's only a fraction. That is why Germany, you find 80% attach rate on batteries. So long answer to your question, but that's the color of Europe.
Steve Fleishman: I guess just to wrap the topic up overall, just let's say we continue to move away from the kind of Ukraine energy crisis conditions, but we do have these markets each put in these changes. Just does your kind of expectation of Europe and kind of improving, can it be driven just by these market by market changes or do you need you need to see some kind of move up in energy prices again.
Badri Kothandaraman: I didn't talk about energy prices, energy prices have also increased. In places like France the energy prices are also going up. So I mean energy prices are going to help us. The utility rates are increasing. And so that is definitely going to be a tailwind. But make no mistake. Despite all of this in a place like Netherlands, two gigawatts of solar in a place like France the payback is extremely good still five to six years where can you get that, even just for solar. It's going to evolve into solar plus storage with the payback up maybe seven to eight years but still very good for a 25-year product. So there is a small dislocation right now due to inventory issues due to these, but that's why we expect the ramp-up normalized -- I wouldn't say normalization, revenue recovery, a quick revenue recovery at least to some level in Europe.
Steve Fleishman: Okay, thank you.
Operator: Our next question will come from Jeff Osborne with Cowen. Please go ahead.
Jeffrey Osborne: Badri, I was just curious on your expectation for a 2Q recovery. What is your working assumption on normalized inventory in the channel? I think in the past you talked about 8 weeks to 10 weeks and assuming that is still the case, I guess, is there an argument that now that manufacturing is localized and continent by both yourself as well as competitors that -- why wouldn't that number be 5 or 6 weeks and maybe pressure would continue into Q2.
Badri Kothandaraman: Yes. I mean, what you're saying is possible, but we don't think so. So I'll give you a quick primer on the weeks on hand. So you follow it. And I think generally, I'd like to say that everybody follows it. For example, if you have -- let's say, you start off with 100 units at the beginning of a quarter in the channel, and let us say you drain inventory at 10 weeks -- I mean 10 units a week. And you also ship into the channel at 10 units a week, okay? So you ship into the channel at 10 units a week. You drain from the channel at 10 units a week. Therefore, at the end of the quarter, you find yourself at the same 100 because 100 plus 130, which is 13 weeks, minus 130, you have 100 units at the end of the quarter. You ask yourself what is the weeks on hand. You say that is 100 divided by 10. That's 10 weeks. So remember that number, 10 weeks. Now I say, oh, my demand is suddenly dropped by, let us say, 40%. That means I have 4 units a week that is accumulating. So that means -- and assume I ship the same number of units into the channel, because I am slow in recognizing that the situation has changed. So let us say I still ship the same 130 as before. But now my dream is only 78 instead of 130. So I therefore end up with 4 units’ excess per week which is 52 units more than the last case. So now I have at the end of the quarter 152. 152, but my end customer demand is only 6 units a week. So I tell you that my weeks on hand now is 152 over 6, which is 25 weeks. So I suddenly go, my weeks on hand increases by 150% due to a 40% drop in demand. If I am -- I continue to be oblivious of -- continue to be oblivious and ship the same material into the channel. So we can blow up disproportionately right? And of course, the further the demand drops, the further your weeks on hand will go up and the converts true. So if the demand improves a little bit, the weeks on hand is going to come down fast. So we think that the distributors -- I mean, we'll look at logical things here because even a 10 to 12-week inventory will be the similar dollar number that they have had in the past. And in fact, the lesser dollar number that they've held in the past. So we think logic will prevail and -- of course, end market demand could change all of that pretty quickly. So weeks on hand is not something that you -- that is obvious. It can really change drastically by small changes in demand, which I gave you the example there.
Jeffrey Osborne: I appreciate that. My follow-up -- and correct me if I'm wrong, but I think you're allowed to, under the IRA export U.S. manufactured goods, to international jurisdictions. Is that something you're already doing or do you intend to do in 2024?
Badri Kothandaraman: Not doing today, but of course, will consider.
Jeffrey Osborne: Got it. Thank you.
Operator: And our next question will come from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Hey good afternoon, team. Thank you guys very much for the time. Appreciate it. I just wanted to pivot to a slightly different direction here, right? So you have a few of these exclusive deals across a number of different customers, but some larger ones, if you will. I'm curious, how do you think about how locked in those are going into the next year? And how are you think about working together realistically as partners, optimizing your value proposition while dealing and addressing with their respective needs, which are clearly and likely dynamic, especially given the backdrop in California. If you can speak to that, those dynamics? I know I'm not trying to get into the contract specifics here, but really working with them, if you will, and how you think about how locked in that portion of volumes are.
Badri Kothandaraman: Yes. I mean, I presume you're talking about one large customer here, that's the only one we have, which is official. The -- we love our partners, right? We work very closely with them. We value their relationship a lot. And we are there -- I mean, we are at their service all the time, whether it's quality, whether it's customer experience, we value their relationship a lot. So yes, of course, we will be looking to renew all of those.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Right. Yes. Fair enough. It's difficult to [indiscernible] too much. And then just coming back to all these different contract manufacturing relationships, I know they might not be identical here, but how do you think about underutilization costs here? I mean what are the commitments like how flexible are the terms as you look at both flexing down and up the volumes through the course of the year here under these new arrangements?
Badri Kothandaraman: Right. I did talk about it answering a prior question, and I will say the same thing here. We have great contract manufacturing partners. Flex has been great for us. They particularly helped us when we were in trouble in 2017. We are grateful there. Our relationship has been very healthy. Even during these times. And we are working together. Sometimes, we look at a problem and say, is this a short-term problem or a long-term problem. If it is going to cost them pain, we are willing to restructure. And all of those accounting are in our P&L. We report it as part of our non-GAAP and GAAP gross margin. So you should read the P&L and know that everything is there. And we view this particular situation is temporary. But we are very cognizant of the fact that under loading is a pain for our contract manufacturing. So -- and we think the right approach is to make sure both of us are profitable and share the pain. And we will be doing that.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it. Alright. Best of guys. We’ll speak to you soon.
Badri Kothandaraman: Thank you.
Operator: And our next question will come from Andrew Percoco with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Andrew Percoco: Hi, thanks so much for squeezing me in. So I just wanted to come back to a prior question. So it's clear that the demand backdrop is going to be a tough demand backdrop potentially for the next few quarters. Can you maybe just discuss the health of the average installer that is a recurring user of your equipment and their ability to manage through this period and transition to the TPO model? I think there's been some challenges around working capital and tax equity. So just curious what you're seeing and what you're hearing from some of those maybe repeat buyers on the smaller scale side of the installer community. Thank you.
Badri Kothandaraman: Yes. I mean we only hear color from other industry news, but we do see some transition to the leasing model. We do see that clearly. For us, how does it affect us is we have some great partners. We have Sunnova, great partner. John Berger is a close friend of mine. Sunpower, Sunrun and other leasing partners. We do business with all of them. They're all great partners. So for us, it is -- if loan moves to lease our business, I would say there could be some product mix issues, but business is nominally not affected. We have heard anecdotes from a few industry sources that installers in California that are many long-tail installers who aren't in business any longer, but we don't have any direct data there. So I can only tell you what I know. The -- of course, I mean, it is a stressful time for them, and we are trying to help them with whatever we can, whether it leads or whether we can provide them some of the services like our Solargraf, etcetera, whether we can help them with NEM 3.0, their business. We are doing that. And that's the color that we have in general. We do business -- majority of the business we do is through distribution. And the distribution, one of the ways we would see it is in our payment, right? If we were to do direct business with all the installers, which we don't. We do business with distribution partners. So therefore, we have one level a little bit away from direct relationship with the long tail installers.
Andrew Percoco: Yes, that makes sense. And the other questions -- my other questions have been answered.
Badri Kothandaraman: Could you repeat the question -- okay?
Operator: Our next question will come from Tristan Richardson with Scotiabank. Please go ahead.
Tristan Richardson: Hey good evening guys. Thank you so much. I appreciate all the commentary on 2024 and really just thinking about the commentary you made around stabilization next year. Should we think that could there be a swing factor with some of the new markets you've entered, whether that's U.K., Greece, Denmark, even India, could that be a meaningful factor that could affect sort of the timing of that stabilization or present a growth wedge above kind of that 2Q time frame you're talking about?
Badri Kothandaraman: Absolutely. We have a lot of vectors of growth and that's a great place for us to start. But we are -- in the color I gave you, we didn't assume all of that. But we have absolutely so many countries that we are -- we were not present even a couple of quarters ago like we have introduced in batteries and microinverters, actually, batteries, for example, in Austria, in Spain, U.K., as you correctly pointed out, Sweden, Denmark, Greece. We have plans to introduce to about 15 countries in the fourth quarter. Microinverters alone, they are all new countries. So that's one vector. New geographies, very important for us. But on the flip side, there, it does take some time to establish infrastructure there. You do need to build up your installer base. You do need to train them very well because our bread and butter is our installers. Therefore, we need to train them excellently. And we need to win them one by one. And that is a process in itself. It can be as early as 3 to 6 months, but it can be over a longer time frame as well. We got several new markets in Asia that are also interesting for us, like, for example, Taiwan, Korea. Indonesia, we are there today, but we are rapidly moving into IQ8, there are a few other smaller countries in Eastern Europe that we are going after. Small commercial. That's a very big one. The small commercial in the U.S. is about 1 gigawatt. We are going to add that product this quarter. The small commercial opportunity in Europe is much bigger. It's about 10-plus gigawatts and we are figuring out that one systematically because we can service that market less than 100 kilowatts with the products we have. So there, of course, pricing is something that we are looking there on how to be competitive in that segment, but we do have a lot of levers there on small commercial. So that is one more. The other one is EV charging. EV charger. We just introduced our connected EV charger. That is a big deal. Now with everybody wanting to electrify, meaning their home, which is buying electric vehicles, electrified vehicles, for example. The -- our product will work with solar plus batteries and it will help the homeowner optimize it's built. He can do green charging now. He doesn't need to spend money charging the vehicle from the grid, all he needs to do is to add about one type of investment, of course, he's got to do that, 6 to 8 panels or 6 to 10 panels. He needs to add it if he buys an EV. And that is a huge opportunity. We are now following up and introducing these EV chargers in Europe, which is what I talked about. So early next year, we will have IQ EV chargers in Europe. Then the other -- the other one is home energy management, software, right? We're now beginning with Germany. We now have the ability to also connect to third-party EV chargers and heat pumps. So now we can optimize the entire system, our solar, our storage, hopefully, our EV chargers soon, but in the meantime, third-party EV chargers, third-party EV -- I mean, third-party heat pumps and giving the homeowner one app, all in one app, optimizing his energy from his fingertips. So that energy management software plus we have some hardware there, which we will eventually integrate into our gateway. So we'll roll that out to all the countries, including the U.S. So we got a lot of vectors there, which is introduced, solar plus batteries into many, many new countries worldwide. Introduce products for the small commercial markets worldwide, introduce IQ smart EV chargers, both in the U.S., which we have done and worldwide. Energy management software plus whatever hardware is required to manage heat pumps and third-party EVs worldwide. So we have a lot of vectors. Of course, I did not include that in the color, which I gave, which is conservative from our perspective.
Tristan Richardson: That’s great Badri. Appreciate all the extra comments tonight.
Badri Kothandaraman: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question will come from Moses Sutton [Ph] with BNP Paribas. Please go ahead.
Unidentified Analyst: Hi Badri. Thank you for squeezing me in. I just wanted to tag on to Andrew's comment about the [indiscernible] installer. Are you seeing stress outside of the California market? Are you seeing any sellers selling distributors asking for price concessions, maybe distributors asking for concessions on terms and receivables, just curious if you could give a little more color on the health of the Tier 4?
Badri Kothandaraman: Yes, the -- I'm just clarifying the question. You want to know the health of the business outside California. Is that correct?
Unidentified Analyst: Specifically for the -- for the small stores.
Badri Kothandaraman: Specifically for the long tail, I mean -- yes, the color that I can give you is the non-California business as a poly is stabilizing right now. That's what we see. We see Q3 was 4% down from Q2. And the first 3 weeks of Q4, which is the last 3 weeks of this quarter, but also not too bad. In fact, it's a little bit up. So we think the non-California business is is pretty decent. But of course, it is still down from the high levels that we had by nearly 35%, meaning from Q4 of last year, Q4 2022, it's still down by nearly 30% to 35%. And your question is how is the health of the long tail -- it's a similar answer for us. We work with our business, if you see 80-plus percent probably, maybe 75% is the long tail there. So we see all of them down, whether there are installers going out of business. We don't get that information, but I think we don't have that data. We don't see the same trend, which is loans moving to leases. All our partners are pretty great. Sunnova, Sunpower, Sunrun, for us, it is moving from one hand to another hand like what I said. That's the color I can give you.
Unidentified Analyst: That's very helpful. And then just any sense on Texas and Florida, in particular. I know outside California is averaging a little better, but maybe specifically those markets?
Badri Kothandaraman: Yes. I mean they were disproportionately down because of -- because the utility rates aren't as high compared to the increase in the interest rates. So they were worst affected, but we see many of them in Texas and California. I mean, Texas and Florida particularly moving to the lease model. We do see that like what you said. And we do see that business starting to recover.
Unidentified Analyst: Thank you.
Operator: And our next question will come from Joseph Osha with Guggenheim Partners. Please go ahead.
Joseph Osha: Hey thanks for fitting me in. Badri, appreciate it. Two questions. First, following on from the previous one, look, we all see Sunrun, Sunnova, Sunpower accessing ADS or whatever markets for third-party ownership. I'm curious, do you know if your long tail has found any other solutions for third-party ownership? Or when you talk about that avenue, is it basically those third companies that you're seeing? And I do have one other question.
Badri Kothandaraman: Majority is those companies, and there are a few smaller leasing companies that are coming up, too. But 90% is those three companies.
Joseph Osha: Okay. Great. And then this is really more of a philosophical question. I know all of us on Wall Street just love to hear you talk about defending your gross margin. But given how the market is evolving, have you done some analysis and are you sure that your business couldn't perhaps generate higher bottom line earnings if you simply grew it more quickly and allow, say, a 35% gross margin. I'm just curious as to your philosophy as to why the gross margin has to stay where it is.
Badri Kothandaraman: It is the eternal question. Can I grow faster if I drop prices, right? I mean for us, it is pricing based on value. The moment we've stopped generating value, it is over. So that's why I never look at those in conjunction pricing. I don't base it on cost. The moment you base it on cost, it's the problem. Then you forget about the value drivers. And therefore, the -- what that means is if we need to add value in both microinverters and battery and software. And that's hard to do, but that's what we do thoroughly. Innovation is -- someone said it right in Silicon Valley, innovate or die. We are that company. That's our philosophy. So we believe high quality is high volume and high price or the right prices or value.
Joseph Osha: Okay, thank you. Appreciate that.
Operator: And our next question will come from Vikram Bagri with Citigroup. Please go ahead.
Vikram Bagri: Good evening everyone. Very helpful color on demand and supply dynamic in countries in Europe. Badri, you mentioned you expect to recover a bit in your calculation of $300 million of inventory reductions over the next two quarters? Is that rebound? Is that a function of Enphase entering a number of new countries in EU this year, as you mentioned, and gaining market share in existing markets, such as Germany, or the outlook for inventory reductions assumes that the base demand rebounds in first quarter. And on top of that, you gained market share in new as well as sort of like existing markets. And then if you can talk about the U.S. market also, it seems like you're looking to defend market share. You haven't seen any declines in market share so far. But if there were some, you will look to defend that.
Badri Kothandaraman: Yes. I mean we already told you that we aren't assuming the demand picture changing from the current levels in our assumptions. And basically, I'm not here to give guidance for Q1, but I'm just giving you a general color for Q1. So all our resumptions are based on demand picture not changing in the next -- demand picture not changing from where it is today. So that's what we said in our assumptions. Then your question is on U.S. U.S. for us is -- we work with a lot of customers. We -- this is the time where our partnerships like what I said, are a lot deeper. Every one of our executives is always on the road visiting customers. Every opportunity to gain market share, we are all over it. And like what I said, we have a number of tools. Yes, of course, it's defending against competition. All competition is very important for us. We take everybody seriously. We work on our problems. We fix our problems, our customer service, you see many people in place stick to us for our quality and customer experience. Our Net Promoter Score is 78 in the U.S. We are opened 24/7, our call center. We have field service technicians who will show up in your home tomorrow if you have a problem today, right? So we have a -- if you put the total picture together, its innovation, quality and customer experience. Now we have one more fact that we have. We can give people a made-in-America products. Now we do have that many of our installers love it because they -- for example, we just had -- in Flex, we in South Carolina, President Biden and came and inaugurated that plant, and we have a lot of installers there, including not just installer partners, distribution partners. So it is very important for them. Made in America product right there in South Carolina, right there in Arlington, right? They're in Wisconsin. It is there. So we think that will help too. And we are going to -- in a similar vein, we're going to bring in our batteries as well in the U.S., and we will take advantage of the domestic content there. And so that will provide extra help to some of our leasing partners. So yes, we are always working on market share. We always take competition seriously, not just right now. This is how we do business.
Vikram Bagri: Thanks Badri. And as a follow-up, I wanted to quickly follow up on the capital allocation question earlier in the call. I was wondering if your priorities have changed given where the stock price is today. I see you repurchased about $110 million in shares versus $122 million of free cash flow this quarter. Should we expect similar trend going forward, share buybacks closely following free cash flow generation in quarters?
Badri Kothandaraman: Yes. Well, I mean we have a lot of cash like what you pointed out, $1.8 billion. We have shown that we are willing to buy back stock in a disciplined fashion. We have bought back stock in the last couple of quarters. I think we have bought back $310 million in total, $110 million in Q3 and $200 million in the prior quarter. I think this is an opportunistic time for us where we can take advantage of the stock price. So we will be opportunistic about it.
Vikram Bagri: Thank you very much.
Badri Kothandaraman: Thank you.
Operator: And our next question will come from Praneeth Satish with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Praneeth Satish: Thanks for squeezing me in here. Long call. I guess I wanted to ask about Tesla's new Powerwall [Ph] 3 offering and maybe what are kind of the puts and takes there comparing that against your IQ8 and 5P battery. And I guess, do you anticipate any market share changes when this product is launched next year?
Raghu Belur: This is Raghu. And Badri mentioned earlier on, look, competition is not new to us. And any company out there that's doing string inverters, we have been competing against those since the inception of the company, and we have a very, very strong value proposition against that technology, a technology that we've been fighting against since 2008. So if you think about it, if you break it down, we just produce more energy. We do maximum power point tracking on a per module basis, right, because we have -- we do power conversion right at the module itself. We are much more reliable. We don't have a single point of failure, that's a true value of the distributed architecture. So even if one of our micros or the module or to -- were to fail or get impinged on energy, the rest of the system continues to operate. String inverters on the other hand, are a very significant single point of failure of that string inverter would fail, our entire system is dead. Again, if you look at also design, installation and maintenance, we don't have string designs anymore. Like those string designs are a thing of the past, those things went away in 2012. And with us, you don't have to do any stringing, no string design, no limitation, steady, can put as much new modules or just like, installations, all plug-and-play. And maintenance, we provide you with per module information, right? And with the traditional string inverters, you're completely blind to how your modules are performing. So I think that's going backwards. And finally, and arguably one of the most important elements of it, is safety, right? You want to do -- you don't want any high-voltage DC anywhere in the system. And so with Enphase, we are all low voltage DC, we are traditional AC. And the combination of high-voltage DC and high-energy chemistry is probably not very optimal. And on the reliability front, we mentioned, one is system-level reliability, which is not having a single point of failure. But look, a unit itself is extremely reliable. We offer a 25-year warranty compared to other types of technologies that offer 10 year, 12 year warranties. And on the battery, if you break the battery down as well, modularity is extremely important. You don't need to have very large batteries and you have the -- where we are building block is fast over ours. So you can right size the system to exactly what homeowner needs. But we mentioned the higher power of our third-generation battery or IQ battery 5P, the high sea [Ph] rate of the battery is really is an economic benefit to the homeowner because you can export significant amounts of power during those times of the day or those times of the hour where you get compensated by the utility for exporting energy. And finally, on safety, we use lithium iron phosphate, LFP chemistry, right? LFP chemistry is arguably much safer than any other chemistry that's out there. Put all that together, look at it in the totality of the system, right, all the software that we provide, the design tools that we provide, those are the competitive moats against any other technology that is out there. Now couple that with our customer service, right? We are open 24/7. Our customer service department is open 24/7. We -- the installer can call us at any time. The homeowner can call it. They have beautiful app where they see their solar, their batteries. Now even there with the connected EV charger, they're seeing how the EV is doing. If you have a VPP program right from the app itself, we can sign up for the VPP program. We really bring a comprehensive solution that is completely differentiated, distributed architecture on inverters, the battery arguably one of the safest batteries, connected EV chargers and a complete system solution for the homeowner and of course, a great customer experience. So take any -- we have a very competitive solution. And like I said, competition is not new for us at all.
Praneeth Satish: That's very helpful. I guess, just quickly switching gears to California. I just wanted to -- you mentioned that you're educating installers about NEM 3.0, the payback is 6 years, maybe down to 5 years with some of these rate increases. You've got the Solargraf software where you're kind of automating a lot of the calculations for installers. But despite all this, and it all sounds good on paper. But despite all this, that the permits are just -- they're moving down week on week, right, in the wrong direction. So I'm just trying to understand if there's anything else you can do to simplify the process and help convert some of the leads to signed contracts? Or is it just -- is it rates? Or is it just waiting for time, waiting for just macro to improve a bit?
Raghu Belur: It start waiting, right? It's our -- we have to go out there. And we and the rest of our industry needs to get out there and continue educating our installer partners, helping our install partners, educate the homeowner, that's what it's going to take. And I think all the tools are there, everything is ready. But most importantly, the economics are there, right? It's simply getting in front of the homeowner, getting and convincing them, showing them the numbers, showing them using a tool like Solargraf and showing them what a solar install of the house would look like, the size of the battery that they would require and then showing them the payback period that it's anywhere from 5 to 7 years and getting better at utility rate continues to improve. So I think we are all doing the right things. We are getting out there and key same phase, we are getting out there and I'm sure our competition is also getting out there and educating both installers and customers and so we expect -- yes, we expect it's simply a matter of time. I think you'll see -- you'll see the California market turnaround as well.
Praneeth Satish: Thank you.
Operator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the conference back over to Badri Kothandaraman for any closing remarks.
Badri Kothandaraman: Yes. Thank you for joining us today and for your continued support of Enphase. We look forward to speaking with you again next quarter.
Operator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you very much for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines.

===== 2023 Q2  (2023-07-27 16:30:00) =====
Operator: Good day, and welcome to Enphase Energy's Second Quarter 2023 Financial Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. I'd now like to turn the conference over to Zach Freedman. Please go ahead.
Zach Freedman: Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us on today's conference call to discuss Enphase Energy's second quarter 2023 results. On today's call are Badri Kothandaraman, our President and Chief Executive Officer; Mandy Yang, our Chief Financial Officer; and Raghu Belur, our Chief Products Officer. After the market closed today, Enphase issued a press release announcing the results for its second quarter ended June 3, 2023. During this conference call, Enphase management will make forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, statements related to our expected future financial performance, the capabilities of our technology and products and the benefits to homeowners and installers; our operations, including manufacturing, customer service and supply and demand; anticipated growth in existing and new markets; the timing of new product introductions and regulatory and tax matters. These forward-looking statements involve significant risks and uncertainties, and our actual results and the timing of events could differ materially from these expectations. For a more complete discussion of the risks and uncertainties, please see our most recent Form 10-K and 10-Qs filed with the SEC. We caution you not to place any undue reliance on forward-looking statements and undertake no duty or obligation to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future events or changes in expectations. Also, please note that financial measures used on this call are expressed on a non-GAAP basis unless otherwise noted and have been adjusted to exclude certain charges. We have provided a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures in our earnings release furnished with the SEC on Form 8-K which can also be found in the Investor Relations section of our website. Now, I'd like to introduce Badri Kothandaraman, our President and Chief Executive Officer. Badri?
Badri Kothandaraman: Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today to discuss our second quarter 2023 financial results. We reported quarterly revenue of $711.1 million, shipped approximately 5.2 million microinverters and 82.3-megawatt hours of batteries and generated free cash of $225.5 million. Approximately 78% of our Q2 microinverter shipments were IQ8. We exited the second quarter at 46% gross margin, 14% operating expense, and 32% operating income, all as a percentage of revenue on a non-GAAP basis. Mandy will go into the financials later in the call. Let's now discuss how we are servicing customers. Our worldwide NPS was 74% in Q2, compared to 75% in Q1. Our North American NPS was 77%, the same as Q1. Our average call wait time was 1.1 minutes compared to 1.2 minutes in Q1. We continued to focus on root cause fixes of customer issues and expanded our customer service and field service teams globally. Let's talk about microinverter manufacturing. Our overall supply environment remains quite stable and there are no major shortages right now. Let's come to our IRA. We expect the IRA to increase the overall solar demand in the U.S. and accelerate domestic production. We are pleased to be part of creating new jobs in the U.S. and advancing the country's clean energy economy. We shipped 50,000 microinverters to customers in Q2 from two of our contract manufacturers, Flex in South Carolina and Foxconn in Wisconsin. We are on track to begin with the third contract manufacturer in Q3. We expect to ship approximately 600,000 microinverters to customers in Q3 from our U.S. manufacturing facilities. Let's now cover the regions. Our U.S. and international revenue mix for Q2 was 59% and 41%, respectively. Q2 was a record quarter for our international revenue primarily due to the growth in Europe and Australia. In the U.S., our revenue decreased 12% sequentially and decreased 1% year-on-year. The overall sell-through of our microinverters in the U.S. was up 2% in Q2 compared to Q1. In Europe, our revenue increased 25% sequentially and more than tripled year-on-year year at healthy gross margin. Our sell-through of microinverters in Europe was 13% higher in Q2 compared to Q1. We are now shipping IQ8 microinverters into Germany, France, Netherlands, Spain, Portugal and Poland. In addition, we are shipping IQ batteries into Germany, Belgium, France, Netherlands, Spain, Portugal, Austria and Switzerland. I'll now provide some brief commentary on Australia, Latin America and Brazil. Our revenue in Australia more than doubled year-on-year. We started shipping our IQ Battery P5 to Australia during the second quarter. In Latin America, we introduced the new battery in Q2 while in Brazil, we introduced our solar graph software platform which will help installers with design and proposal for their residential customers. Let me provide some additional color on the U.S. followed by Europe. We recognize revenue when we ship product to distributors and large installers. It is therefore relevant to talk about the sell-through trends of our products from our distributors to installers. Since we have a healthy share in the U.S., our statistics are a meaningful representation of business strengths. The overall U.S. market is experiencing a broad-based slowdown due to high interest rates. As I said earlier, our Q2 sell-through of microinverters in the U.S. was only up 2% compared to Q1 and only up 2% year-on-year. The second quarter is typically stronger than the first quarter that did not happen this year due to the market environment. Let's now discuss the market trends we are seeing in the U.S. split by California and rest of the U. S. For non-California states, the Q2 sell-through of microinverters was 6% lesser as compared to Q1 and 11% lesser year-on-year. The sell-through was disproportionately worse in Texas, Florida and Arizona. In these states, the economics of loan financing has worsened due to the combination of rising interest rates and lower utility rates. In California, the Q2 sell-through of microinverters was 20% higher compared to Q1 and 34% higher year-on-year. The higher sell-through was driven by high backlog of NEM 2 installation which is expected to last through this summer. We expect NIM 3.0 will have a greater impact on results beyond Q3 and I will speak more on what we are seeing there later. I'd like to provide some more context about our revenue guidance for Q3. Our microinverter sell-through in the U.S. peaked in the fourth quarter of 2022. The sell-through in the first half of 2023 in both Q1 and Q2 was approximately 20% below the fourth quarter due to the high interest rate environment in the U.S. Our sell-in to the channel was only 10% down in the first half of 2023 relative to the fourth quarter. We were expecting a seasonally up Q2 '23 but that didn't materialize. This has increased the inventory in the channel. Plus we are assuming the same level of uncertainty continues going forward. Therefore, we are taking aggressive and prudent actions in the U.S. to manage down the channel inventory, and this is reflected in our light third quarter guidance. Let me say a few words about market share. We see stable high market share today for microinverters based on both internal and third party data. Competition is not new for us, and we have always relied on our differentiated technology with distributed architecture, product quality and customer service to win share and we expect to continue doing so. We have many tools that are disposal for installers, and our partnerships go even deeper during the downturn. For storage, we have shipped approximately 1-gigawatt hour of battery systems cumulatively by the end of the second quarter. We continued to manage our storage channel inventory in Q2 and expect further improvement in Q3. As we introduced our third generation IQ Battery 5P to the U.S. market in Q2, we reduced pricing for our second generation battery. We also expanded the warranty for both batteries to 15 years. We see the new price point and warranty for both batteries, as well as strong early customer adoption of the new battery driving increased sell-in and sell-through during Q3. We believe there will be a bigger inflection for Q4 and beyond as California battery attach rates increased with NEM 3.0. Before moving to Europe, I'd like to speak a little bit about NEM 3.0. Early anecdotes on NEM 3.0 activity from our installers are encouraging. Since the crossover date in April, we have seen an increasing rate of NEM 3.0 California proposal activity with healthy storage attach rates. We offer a comprehensive NEM 3 solution, which includes a smart battery, power control system to avoid main panel upgrades and energy management system that maximizes ROI for homeowners. The smart battery can do both backup, as well as utility rate arbitrage. Grid tied batteries require less labor and fewer balance of system components making them significantly easier and faster to install. Our solar graph design and proposal tool can model the complex interactions between solar, batteries, consumption and tariff and provide a simple proposal. Our financial analysis show that for a cash system, homeowners can expect a bill offset between 70% and 90% and payback between 5 and 7 years. We think installers can effectively sell these economics to consumers. Let's now cover Europe. Our European business remains strong. Q3 is typically down due to summer vacation, but our year-on-year growth trend is very robust. We plan to introduce IQ8 microinverters and batteries into more countries in Europe such as Sweden, Denmark, Greece, U.K. and Italy later this year. We saw strong broad based growth across Europe in Q2. Netherlands and France continued to be very strong for us. We are starting to gain real attraction in Germany, in both residential solar and batteries. The residential solar market in Germany, the biggest in Europe is roughly 3-gigawatts and the attach rates for batteries is approximately 80%. We saw strong quarterly sequential growth in installer count, sell through and activations of both solar and batteries in Germany during Q2. During Q2, we also launched our IQ router family of devices, which is part of our home energy management system in Germany and Austria to enable the integration of select third party EV chargers and heat pumps into Enphase solar and battery systems. There is a great push towards whole home electrification in Europe and countries like Germany are leading the way in adopting renewable technologies to support heat pumps, EVs and other home loads. Self-consumption is the norm as consumers want energy independence. As we think about our competitive positioning in Europe, we see increasingly complex power markets and home energy management needs playing right into our strengths. Our complete home energy management system solution delivers use cases like self-consumption and green charging along with newer software features which we plan to release this year are key differentiators in addition to our quality and service that will help strengthen our market position. Let's cover more new products. We launched our third generation IQ Battery 5P, in Australia, U.S. and Puerto Rico in Q2 with plans to launch in Europe by the end of the year. As I previously discussed, the battery has a modularity of 5-kilowatt hour and delivers double the continuous power and triple the peak power for the same kilowatt hour compared to our prior generation of batteries. The higher charging and discharge rate of our third generation battery will be uniquely beneficial for NEM 3.0 systems in California through its ability to generate revenue by exporting into the grid at appropriate time. In addition, our third generation battery is easy to install and commission with the targeted sub-30 minutes commissioning times. We are excited about the positive feedback we have received from our Australian and U. S. customers. We have now certified over 3500 installers worldwide to install our IQ batteries. Let's now talk about our latest new product for the residential segment in emerging markets. This product, the IQ8P microinverter will deliver 480 watts of AC power, supporting panels up to 650 watt DC for Brazil, Mexico, India, Spain and other emerging markets. We are on track to release this IQ8P microinverter variant to production later this year. The other variant of the IQ8P microinverter with the new 3-phase cabling system is well-suited for small commercial solar installation ranging from 20 kilowatts to 200 kilowatts. These microinverter systems offer the same grid compatibility, high-quality, rapid shutdown capability as our standard residential products. We expect to release this product into the U.S. small commercial solar market later this year. In general, we see the global commercial opportunity as greater than 11 gigawatts. We are extremely bullish about this small commercial solar market, where we believe we can add tremendous value to business owners and installers in Europe and U.S. with our high-quality rapid shutdown capability and micro-grid forming capability of our microinverter systems. Let's discuss our U.S. EV chargers. We shipped over 6,600 EV chargers in Q2 compared to 8,600 in Q1. We expect to introduce IQ smart EV chargers in Q3. These smart chargers will have Wi-Fi connectivity, enabling use cases like green charging and allowing homeowners full visibility into operation of the Enphase solar, plus battery, plus EV charger system through the app. Let's now discuss the installer platform. We released updates to our Solargraf design and proposal software platform in Q2, including NEM 3.0 functionality. The updated Solargraf platform offers a simplified experience for designing a NEM 3.0 systems by optimizing panel placements for both grid-tied as well as grid-agnostic systems, configuring battery sizing by leveraging modularity and enhancing system operations for time-of-use management and energy export to deliver the best possible electricity bill offset and payback. Let me conclude. We are managing through a correction in the U.S. solar market after three years of phenomenal growth, a period in which the residential solar market doubled and Enphase sales tripled. Even so, residential solar has only achieved 4% to 5% penetration in the U.S. We believe there are several positive long-term drivers which will accelerate adoption, such as the 30% ITC tax credit, the rising utility rates, increased grid instability, climate change and increasing EV adoption. There is no doubt that these will drive meaningful solar plus battery growth over the long term. Our strategy is clear and unchanged. We manage for the long term. We will make best-in-class home energy systems with a laser focus on innovation, quality and customer experience. We are doubling down on our relationships with customers. We are driving down installation times and investing in our service teams. We are investing even more on new product innovation. We are expanding our IQ8 microinverters and battery reach globally, accelerating our business in Europe, introducing IQ8P microinverters for the small commercial solar and emerging residential markets worldwide and making continuous enhancements to our installer platform. Before I turn the call over to Mandy, I'm happy to announce that our Board of Directors has authorized a new share repurchase program. Given our confidence in Enphase's future growth, free cash flow generation and the value we see in our stock, our Board has authorized an additional $1 billion for share repurchases. With that, I will turn the call over to Mandy for her review of our finances. Mandy?
Mandy Yang: Thanks, Badri, and good afternoon, everyone. I will provide more details related to our second quarter of 2023 financial results, as well as our business outlook for the third quarter of 2023. We have provided reconciliations of these non-GAAP to GAAP financial measures in our earnings release posted today, which can also be found in the IR section of our website. Total revenue for Q2 was $711.1 million. We shipped approximately 2,121.3 megawatts DC of microinverters and 82.3 megawatt hours of IQ batteries in the quarter. Non-GAAP gross margin for Q2 was 46.2% compared to 45.7% in Q1. The increase was driven by increased IQ8 product mix and improved logistics. GAAP gross margin was 45.5% for Q2. GAAP and non-GAAP gross margin for Q2 included $1.6 million of a net IRA benefit for our microinverters made in the U.S. and shipped to customers in the quarter. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $98.2 million for Q2 compared to $98.4 million for Q1. GAAP operating expenses were $153 million for Q2 compared to $158.7 million for Q1. GAAP operating expenses for Q2 included $51 million of stock-based compensation expenses and $3.9 million of acquisition-related expenses and amortization for acquired intangible assets and $208,000 of restructuring and asset impairment charges. On a non-GAAP basis, income from operations for Q2 was $230.5 million compared to $233.6 million for Q1. On a GAAP basis, income from operations was $170.3 million for Q2 compared to $167.7 million for Q1. On a non-GAAP basis, net income for Q2 was $205.6 million compared to $192.3 million for Q1. This resulted in non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.47 for Q2 compared to $1.37 for Q1. GAAP net income for Q2 was $157.2 million compared to GAAP net income of $146.9 million for Q1. This resulted in GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.09 for Q2 compared to $1.02 for Q1. We exited Q2 with a total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balance of $1.8 billion compared to $1.78 billion at the end of Q1. We repurchased approximately 1.25 million shares of Enphase common stock in Q2 at an average price of $159.43 for a total of approximately $200 million. This completed our $500 million share repurchase authorization from our Board of Directors. As Badri mentioned, our Board of Directors has authorized a new $1 billion share repurchase program. In addition, we spent approximately $12.7 million by withholding shares to cover withholding taxes for employees divesting in Q2. That reduced the diluted shares by approximately 72,000 shares. We expect to continue this anti-dilution point throughout the year. In Q2, we generated $269.2 million in cash flow from operations and $225.2 million in free cash flow. Capital expenditure was $44 million for Q2 compared to $22.5 million for Q1. The increase was primarily due to investment in U.S. manufacturing and R&D equipment. Now let's discuss our outlook for the third quarter of 2023. We expect our revenue for the third quarter of 2023 to be within a range of $550 million to $600 million, which includes shipment of 80 to 100 megawatt hours of IQ batteries. We expect GAAP gross margin to be within a range of 41% to 44% and non-GAAP gross margin to be within a range of 42% to 45%, which excludes stock-based compensation expenses and acquisition-related amortization. Our gross margin guidance numbers do not include any IRA benefit. We expect net IRA benefit to be between $14.5 million and $16.5 million on estimated shipments of 600,000 units of U.S.-manufactured microinverters. We expect our GAAP operating expenses to be within a range of $159 million to $163 million, including approximately $58 million estimated for stock-based compensation expenses and acquisition-related expenses and amortization. We expect our non-GAAP operating expenses to be within the range of $101 million to $105 million as we will continue to invest in product innovation, customer service and international growth. Moving to tax. Since we have utilized most of our net operating loss and research tax credit carryforward, we are now a significant U.S. cash taxpayer. We expect GAAP and non-GAAP annualized effective tax rate for 2023 to be at 21%, plus or minus 1% with IRA benefit. Now I'd like to discuss how the advanced manufacturing production credit from the IRA is reported in our earnings. We had originally thought that the production credit will be reflected in income tax expenses. But based on the latest guidelines from the U.S. Treasury, we expect to claim the production credit by direct pay, and therefore, account for the production credit as a reduction in cost of goods sold. We expect the production credit, net of any incremental costs for domestic manufacturing, to be in the range of $24 to $28 per microinverter sold to customers in Q3. We expect to ship 600,000 microinverters to customers this quarter. We plan to have our U.S. contract manufacturing facilities fully operational by the end of 2023. We estimate shipments to reach our U.S. capacity of 4.5 million microinverters per quarter by the end of 2024, assuming robust demand. With that, I will open the line for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] The first question today comes from Brian Lee with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Brian Lee, your line is open. You may ask your question. The next question comes from Phil Shen with ROTH MKM. Please go ahead. Sir, perhaps your line is muted?
Philip Shen: Hi everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. Sorry, I'm bouncing between calls. So I wanted to check in on what you're doing with pricing on micros in the U.S. Our checks this week suggest your recent spot discounts may be "aggressive" with big customers in exchange for semi-exclusivity. Our contacts suggest that maybe in response to some of the volume that may be going to Tesla. Can you quantify what the magnitude of the discounts might be, if anything? Or what it might mean, if anything, on a blended ASP-basis ahead? I know historically, you always have some kind of spot discount, but incrementally, is it greater now to try to maintain that business? Thanks.
Badri Kothandaraman: Right. We are not planning any microinverter pricing reductions in general, overall. As regarding pricing pressure, it is normal for us. Since inception, we are always used to pricing pressure. We are always used to competing with string inverters from Day 1. This company was founded based on distributed architecture wins. Distributed architecture basically means no single point of failure. So distributed architecture means that it's a semiconductor-based architecture, which basically has got less number of components and very high quality, which means 0.05% failure rates. It also means 25 years of warranty versus other string inverters that may be half that many number of years. In addition, we service customers very well. 24/7 customer service, 74% NPS. Also, we strongly believe in AC coupled architecture, which means that the combination of - it's an Enphase system for solar. It's an Enphase system for storage. It is a full home energy management system with an Enphase EV charger as well. And that is starting to become more and more important as NEM 3.0-type tariffs come. And those tariffs are already there in Europe, for example. So SPAs, standing for special pricing adjustments, are a fact of life. We do that always. They are - we are very disciplined. We have a pricing team. And it always depends upon the volumes. And of course, we do - we form deeper partnership with customers in times like this. And we have a lot of tools at our disposal. We have done our recent M&As and digital transformation that we did. Solargraf software platform is invaluable for us at this time, because we are able to give customers the option of designing - for example, showing an M3 design and making sure they can sell that effectively to homeowners. So Solargraf even leads lead generation company we got. That is coming of use in times like this. So basically, to answer your question, pricing is normal. We aren't planning on any pricing reduction on microinverters. On batteries, it's a different story. On batteries, I was very clear a month back in the public call, saying that, yes, we introduced our third-generation battery. And we cut the price of our second generation battery. And both of them coexist. We believe that the second-generation battery will be very good for grid-tied NEM 3.0 as well as grid-tied batteries in Europe. The third-generation battery that comes with a 30-minute commissioning time, which we are very happy about, that is priced appropriately for backup. So - and these pricing decisions aren't done on the fly. They are done with extensive planning. And we do have upper pricing protection to our channel partners. And so we believe in doing things in a structured way. This is no exception.
Philip Shen: Great. Thanks, Badri. You just talked about price protection. And that was for storage, and we had read about that as well for the channel inventory. From an accounting standpoint, which quarter does that price protection hit? Did we already see it in Q2 results? Or should we expect in Q3? What was the magnitude? And then hypothetically, if you pursue a price cut for micros, would you provide price protection for the existing micro channel inventory as well since the channel is a little bit full? Thanks.
Mandy Yang: Phil, so the price protection for storage has been accounted for in our earnings. There will be no other impact in Q3 or going forward. And price protection, we offer to distributors as a policy. So in that case, if we lower our ADLP for micros, we will provide price protection. By this point, we are not planning to do things like that.
Philip Shen: Okay. Thanks Mandy. Okay. I'll pass it on.
Badri Kothandaraman: Thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from Colin Rusch with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.
Colin Rusch: Thanks so much guys. Can you talk a little bit about your opportunities for driving cost out of the supply chain? It sounds like there's plenty of supply available and your ability to continue to walk that cadence down here over the next several quarters.
Badri Kothandaraman: Yes. I mean, we work on world-class cost initiatives for microinverters and batteries. So on microinverters, there is a lot of tactical negotiations that we do. Let me put that on the side. That's - but that's not insignificant. That's a nice number, especially in times like this, a procurement organization is extremely active. The other one, which is - will take over three to six months is opportunities where we design in multisource. For example, when we have three sources of transformers, having a fourth and fifth source, especially in times like this. And when you have, for example, three versions of integrated circuits for our AC gate drivers, having a fourth one. Those are also extremely active with our microinverter group running extensive qualification, because we are very careful on that 500 DPPM quality. The last thing we need is a quality excursion. So that's the first and foremost priority for us, making sure that quality is preserved through all of that. And the third one is a little bit more long term, which is over nine to 12 months. We look at packing material. We look at ASIC. Is there an opportunity for us to redesign the ASIC in another platform to save cost? Is there an opportunity for us to integrate and open for a comparator into the ASIC so that we can save $0.20? So for example, a $1 savings in our microinverter, assuming we shipped 20 million units worldwide a year, that's $20 million. So you're looking at $0.01 is $200,000. It's a big amount. And so we have a massive program called World-Class Cost. That's where you see, even in Q2, our gross margin continues to increase in - on batteries. It is like - many people keep asking the same question, can you make money on batteries? And my answer is always the same. We never enter a business until and unless we are convinced that the business will make at least my baseline gross margin. And so on batteries, we are getting better. Generation 1 was higher cost. Generation 2 is a little bit lower. Now we are in Generation 3, where we have figured out a lot of ways to take cost out. And then on top of it, in terms of warranty, we are getting a lot better on batteries. We are introducing serviceability on batteries, where instead of you having to replace the entire battery, which is so cumbersome for the installer and homeowner, you replace a board inside, because we have figured out that the cell pack, the battery pack never fails. It is the power electronics, which consists of power conversion, battery management and even mechanical components, those are the ones that fail, and we are making them bulletproof. But coming back to that, we don't need to replace a $3,000 battery. We can replace a $40 board. We don't need to take the battery of the wall. We can replace it in situ. Therefore, the customer downtime is very low. Our standard, as we want the customer downtime to be no more than 24 hours, and we are driving our teams to achieve that. And when we achieve that, you will find your warranty and your replacement costs are minimized a lot. So that's on the third generation. Now what's happening on the fourth generation? Fourth generation of batteries is scheduled to come approximately within a year, maybe within 9 months, if I'm a little bit more aggressive. And that has got a fundamentally transformative cost structure. What we are doing there is we are combining power conversion and the battery management into one board. So 7 boards in the third generation will now become two boards in the fourth generation. This is accompanied by significant component count reduction, significant cost reduction, and that will get us even better on the gross margin curve. So, I gave you a bunch of puts and takes on micro inverters, batteries. And then we are also serious on our accessories. We ship combine our boxes. We have cellular modems. We have the gateways. For example, in Europe, in Q3, we are going to be introducing a combiner box. That is going to be very cost-effective for installers. And it is going to help them both on dollars as well as time savings. So a lot of actions in the company. And we started this six years ago, we have not stopped since then.
Colin Rusch: Excellent. Thanks so much guys. Just a simple follow-up here. You've historically talked about wanting to have 8 to 10 weeks of channel inventory. Will the guidance that you're indicating here for 3Q get you to those levels in the U.S. from what you're seeing at this point?
Badri Kothandaraman: Right. So let me provide some more context in general because it may not have been clear to everybody and they may not have been present, too. So our sell-through of microinverters in the U.S. peaked in the fourth quarter of 2022. The sell-through in Q1 '23 was about 20% below that. And the sell-through in Q2 '23 was at the same level, which is 20% below Q4. Now what we did was our sell-in, we only reduced it 10% in Q1, thinking that Q2 will be a seasonally good quarter. That's what we thought. But that was not the case. Q2 sell-through was same as Q1, with respect to Q4. So we find ourselves with excess inventory in the channel. And the responsible thing to do, for - from my point, is to take - is to correct that. To do a onetime correction of that to reduce inventory in the channel. The only way we reduce inventory in the channel is by not shipping as much and taking a correction there. So we are doing that. We are aggressively reducing the inventory in the channel. And we expect the channel inventory, the weeks on hand, to come back more to normalized levels at the end of Q3.
Colin Rusch: Okay. Thanks so much guys.
Operator: The next question comes from Mark Strouse with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Mark Strouse: Great. Thank you very much for taking our questions. Just thinking about with valuations coming down across the space, how you're weighing potential M&A versus prioritizing this new $1 billion buyback.
Badri Kothandaraman: Right. I mean, first of all, the way we think about capital allocation is, first, do we have enough capital to work on the things we need to internally? How about domestic manufacturing? How about building a new R&D lab? How about investing in domestic battery supply chain? We take care of the needs of the business first. That's number one. Number two, we look at opportunities in M&A. We look at to see whether we can increase the value of the company significantly, maybe in the small commercial space. Maybe in the software space, in the home energy management space. Those are the areas we normally look for, as well as in the battery space, which is always exciting. So -- but we are not going to be making hasty decisions. We usually like bolt-on acquisitions, which are easy to integrate because we are aware that integration - most integration fail of big companies. So we are always very cautious. And we have clarity. For example, we will not buy a company to do anything specifically on inverters because we think we have enough homegrown talent that we can organically grow. So that's the second piece. We look for active M&A opportunities, and we have cash, and we will look for those. The third one is after we have taken care of the needs of the business, after we have looked at M&As, is can we buy back stock at a conservatively estimated -- at a value below the intrinsic value of the stock, which is conservatively estimated? So we look at that. And Mandy talked about some of the actions we did. We bought $200 million of stock last quarter, 1.25 million shares at approximately $159. And - but we are disciplined about it. The Board has authorized another $1 billion for share buyback, considering we generate close to $200 million of free cash flow every quarter. But you can expect us to be disciplined, do things when it makes sense and not be overly aggressive.
Mark Strouse: Okay. Thanks, Badri. And then just a follow-up. I think you touched on this a bit on California, but maybe just repeat what you said about the - what 3Q guidance assumes, as far as NEM 2.0 systems and when you expect that backlog to be removed and start selling 3.0?
Badri Kothandaraman: We think NEM 2.0 will continue through Q3. That's what we are hearing from our installers. It will continue through the summer until September. We believe Q4, NEM 3.0 will start. And the anecdotes we are hearing from some of our installers, some of our big installers who say that their battery attach rates are pretty nice, higher than 50%. I mean most installers, they need to get educated on NEM 3.0, but the fact of the matter is, even for pure solar, NEM 3.0 payback is between 7 and 8 years, even for pure solar. When you add a battery, - and let us say, when you add a 10-kilowatt hour battery, which seems to be kind of standardizing in that direction, you then achieve even better payback. So payback comes down from the 7 to 8 years to 5 to 6 years with a high enough battery system. So once the installer has realized that economics, then they are a lot more confident of selling them NEM 3.0. Our Solargraf tool tells them these things exactly. Also, another phenomenon is California is - my view on it is California is going to move to a majority of grid-tied systems. That's how Germany evolved. And in Germany right now, it is very, very similar. It is - most of the solar plus storage are grid-tied today. And California may evolve in that direction, that's my view. And a grid-tied system suddenly is easier to install. You don't need to worry about main panel upgrades. You don't need to worry about partial home backup and full home backup and all of that. And yes, the battery provides a lot of savings. And in fact, the battery is a money maker for a couple of months in summer, where the grid needs help and the battery can export energy back to the grid. So - but having said that, NEM 3.0 is new. Therefore, installers will take - will have their ramp. But I think eventually, it will be very easy to sell. And I think we will start seeing solar and storage normalize in 2024.
Mark Strouse: Okay. Thank you very much.
Operator: The next question comes from Andrew Percoco with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Andrew Percoco: Great. Thanks so much for the question. I just had a follow-up question to Phil's question earlier on - so pricing appears to be relatively stable. So in that context, it appears like the 3Q guide is really volume-driven. So can you maybe just discuss between regions, what your expectation is on volume in the third quarter, specifically? And if you could just start to provide more context around how you expect that to rebound or change in the fourth quarter, that would also be helpful. Thank you.
Badri Kothandaraman: Yes. I mean, the - just for context, in Q2, we grew about 25% in Europe compared to Q1. And in Q3, we expect Europe to be slightly down compared to Q2 due to summer - typical summer seasonality. And Europe for us is underpenetrated. In general, we are very strong in Netherlands and France. We are upcoming in Germany. But for us, the other -- other countries are almost a blue ocean. Like Italy, U.K., Sweden, Denmark, Greece, Austria, Switzerland, Poland. We are entering all of those regions. And so we are extremely bullish on Europe. In the U.S., as I said, we said that the revenue decreased 12% sequentially in Q2 compared to Q1. But we are taking a heavier hit because of - in Q3 because of the following phenomenon, which I elaborated just now. It is our sell-throughs, which is indicative of real customer demand, is 20% down in overall U.S. compared to Q4, which was our peak. And the 20% down is for both Q1 as well as Q2. We sold into the channel. We only dropped the shipments into the channel by 10%. And the rationale of dropping 10% only was we expected Q2 to be a strong seasonal recovery quarter. That didn't happen. And so now we have to correct for these two quarters. And on top of it, we are assuming the depressed sell-through going forward. So that's why we are taking a onetime correction in the U.S. But I think in general, the revenue for us will exactly mimic the percentage demand drop on a quarterly basis.
Andrew Percoco: Got it. That's super helpful. And can I just ask one more on what you're seeing on Europe channel inventory levels? I understand that 3Q is maybe historically and seasonally a light quarter. But can you just maybe elaborate on what you're seeing across Europe on inventory levels?
Badri Kothandaraman: Right. Channel inventory is a little bit high on the 10-week side in Europe. It is. And that's why we are cautious now. But for us, I mean, we're really not worried about it, because we are introducing products in newer countries. So we think we can maintain it in the 8 to 10 week range.
Andrew Percoco: Got it. Thanks so much.
Operator: The next question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Excellent. Thank you. Good afternoon, team. I appreciate it. Can you talk a little bit more about the inventory levels and any write-down risk here? Can you talk a little bit about just the backdrop on that front? And more importantly, just the normalizing functions as you think about these different inventory levels across geographies, especially thinking to continued European growth, what might be implied by inventory levels, et cetera?
Badri Kothandaraman: Yes. I just now answered the question for Europe. The inventory level in Europe is a little bit normal, although it's on the higher side at about approximately 10 weeks. And that is why we said Q3 is a seasonally down quarter in Europe, and we expect to be slightly down in revenue as compared to Q2. But then I talked about we are introducing several new products. All our growth in Europe is coming from new products. And we are going to be introducing several new products, for example, in Italy, in U.K., in Sweden, in Denmark, in Greece, in Poland, where we are nonexistent today. So all of those are going to be incremental and not worried about revenue - I mean, not worried about inventory there. U.S., on the other hand, U.S. is - we were in great shape in - at the end of Q4 '22, which was our highest sell-through quarter. Sell-through means we are selling - meaning the installer buying from the distributor is called sell-through. Our sell-through rate was the highest, and our channel inventory was very healthy at the end of Q4. What happened is the sell-through rates declined overall in the U.S., 20%, with respect to Q4, for Q1 and for Q2. And therefore - and in response to that, we did throttle our shipments into the channel, but we didn't throttle it enough because we assumed Q2 will be a seasonally good quarter, which turned out to not be the case. So therefore, we are now left with two quarters of inventory that is added on. And meaning two quarters of extra inventory. And we are also assuming, going forward, we are not making any aggressive assumptions. We are saying the demand will be at the same level as it is today. And therefore, we are taking a onetime correction for shipments into the channel. And that is why our guide is light for Q3.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Right. Effectively equal to that excess inventory here. Great. And then just related here, if you can comment on gross margins. I mean, obviously, you guys provide - been providing consistently improving gross margin guidance over time. And implicit within that is the confidence to sustain that for at least some time, several quarters as far as I read it. You still feel confident in supporting these higher gross margin levels here despite this backdrop through this period of time for several quarters?
Badri Kothandaraman: I mean, look, we are careful on the gross margin guidance. We have non-GAAP guidance that we gave is 42% to 45%. And like what I said, we - like, for example, I didn't even say this to the gentlemen who asked me the question before. For example, in logistics, last quarter, we saved $8 million. Last quarter. Like we have a lot of initiatives from a world-class cost on saving the cost of a capacitor, resister, parting, semiconductors, ASIC, not only by second source qualification or multisource qualification, but simply, purely by negotiation. So we do that, and we do that on microinverters. We do that on batteries. We do that on combiner buses and accessories. So our world-class cost effort is invaluable and has saved us a lot of dollars. And we are now moving to a higher and higher mix of IQ8, which has got a little bit more gross margin than IQ7. Now on the batteries, we are also getting better in terms of gross margin. I gave a big commentary on batteries on how we have improved the learning from one generation to the other in terms of warranty, for example. Instead of taking a $3,000 hit on return, we don't do that. We basically service boards within that product. And the board replacements, which are $40, are done much faster than full unit replacement. So innovative ways in order to reduce our overhead costs on batteries are also helping. And like what I said, our fourth generation batteries are coming. The fourth generation batteries provide a huge reduction in terms of power electronics, which is - the battery management is now integrated into power conversion. And so 7 boards in a Gen 3 system will now be two boards. And in that process, we take significant cost out. So in general, we are quite confident of our trajectory on gross margin on both microinverters and batteries.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Right. Sounds it's for several quarters to come. Thank you very much. A - Badri Kothandaraman Thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from Kashy Harrison with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.
Kashy Harrison: So based on the feedback that you're receiving from your distribution network, are you getting the impression that sell-through in non-California will have bottomed by 3Q? Or do you still believe non-California is in the process of recalibrating? And then you said that the early NEM 3.0 data is encouraging from your larger installers. Can you maybe just speak to - wait, attachment is down to 50%. Can you just maybe speak to where we are on year-over-year trends, just based on the leading-edge data?
Badri Kothandaraman: Yes. I think to answer your question on sell-through for non-California, I mean it has not changed much in Q1 and Q2. In fact, I said Q2 was a little bit worse compared to Q1, about 6% worse and I think it is expected to probably be at this level until the interest rates take a meaningful turn for the better. That in non-California. On NEM 3.0, I mean, we only have anecdotal evidence right now. The channel is still NEM 2.0. And NEM 2.0 installations are happening. Many - some of our distribution partners said that a few installers may even do NEM 2.0 until October or November. We are hearing that for most of Q3, it will be NEM 2.0. And we will start getting data on NEM 3.0 sell-through data only in Q4. But we see a lot of design and proposal activity from - one of the benefits of us buying the Solargraf software platform is we are able to see the early signs of NEM 3.0. And there are a lot of designs on NEM 3.0. I can't quantify it yet, because we don't have a meaningful market share in the Solargraf software space. But I like the trends I see. I like the battery attach rate very nice. I see it over 70% in most cases. And like what I said, we have clear facts that the payback is awesome for grid-tied batteries and solar. The payback is fine even for pure solar. So we think it is a matter of training a lot of installers. And actually, Raghu, who is sitting with me, he has visited himself 1,000 installers came to his sessions throughout last quarter. And our only job there was to evangelize NEM 3.0. We showed them with Solargraf software platform on how to design for NEM 3.0, what is the payback, how to sell to the homeowners. And so that installers have very high confidence to sell to the end consumer. But still, having said that, we don't have statistics yet. We will start getting statistics in the fourth quarter.
Kashy Harrison: Thank you for that color. And then maybe just for my follow-up question. Also, clearly, demand is tracking beneath expectations as you're adding a significant amount of capacity to the U.S. Do you have the ability to ramp U.S. to peak capacity by throttling back in Mexico, India and Romania? Or are there minimum activity levels that you would need to maintain per your agreements with your contract manufacturers?
Badri Kothandaraman: Good question. We have a total of 3 contract manufacturers right now. Two of them have been with us forever. And - that is one of the reasons we even chose those 2, because we have deep relationships with them. And we want to be highly sensitive on how we load their factories outside the U.S. versus factories inside the U.S. There is one new partner, Foxconn that is manufacturing our microinverters in Wisconsin. Now, our assumption is we are going to be ramping steadily from Q2 of 50,000 units to a Q4 number of 4.5 - Q4 '24 number, of 4.5 million units, pending robust demand. And of course, I mean, this is a long-term decision that we take. And we do expect us to have - come with healthy demand by then. If not, we will work with our contract manufacturing partners, and we will make the right decision on how to appropriately load the factories. And we will provide that guidance to you on a quarterly basis.
Kashy Harrison: Thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from Jordan Levy with Truist. Please go ahead.
Jordan Levy: Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. Just a quick one for me. Just curious if you could give us a little more detail on the EV charging side of things, what it takes to break into - grow that business to a bigger segment and then the eventual progression toward bidirectional charging and how you're viewing that?
Badri Kothandaraman: Right. So EV chargers, we bought a company called ClipperCreek, and that was towards the end of 2021. And basically, now what we have done is we have basically moved the manufacturing of those EV chargers so that we can start to scale a lot to Flextronics in Mexico. We have done that. That's Phase 1. Now what we are doing, and we will release in Q3, is an IQ smart TV chargers. The original ClipperCreek chargers, which were very popular by the way, simply because of their very high quality and very high durability and great service. So we are taking that taking that architecture, and we are adding connectivity to the ClipperCreek EV charger. And we are rebranding it as an IQ smart EV charger. And once you have the connectivity and then the integration into Enphase solar plus storage, you can do a lot of interesting things. Like, for example, you can configure in your app, saying never charge my EV from the grid. Only charge EV from solar. Green charging only. We can do interesting things like that. So that's what I call Phase 2. That will happen in Q3 in the current quarter we are in. Now the next phase will be to introduce these EV chargers into all countries in Europe, and that will happen in Q1 and Q2 of '24. We are already working on that. And the same thing there. Our existing partner, channel partners are all selling Enphase solar plus storage. It would be a natural extension for them to be selling Enphase solar plus storage plus EV chargers with a full home energy management system capable of managing heat pumps as well. So that's Phase 3. We have already demonstrated bidirectional EV charging. It is on our website, and it is very closely aligned with our Ensemble architecture. So essentially, we tap into the DC port of the car, and that interface there is called digital interface. There is a digital interface. There's a power interface. The digital interface is 15118, that basically you can exchange things like the SOC of the car, the state of charge of the car and other control signals. And then we will have power conversion, which is our inverters, the same inverters that we use. The higher-wattage inverters basically will take that DC and plug it into our home energy management system, which is an AC coupled system. So once we do that, we can easily do V2H as well as V2X, which is V2H and V2G. So we expect that product to come into the market by Q4 of next year. That is - we are still in early days there, and we are working on our bidirectional inverter right now. So that's - those are the four phases, and then Raghu can add here.
Raghu Belur: Yes. So in terms of the importance of the connected EV charger that we are going to release in this quarter, again, plays an important role, as Badri mentioned in your home energy management system. Specifically, when you think about it in the context of NEM 3.0 as well, right? You want to avoid charging your car at certain times of the day, which is part of the time-of-use construct as well as allow your battery or preserve your battery to discharge power into the grid at certain times of the -- at certain times of the day, particularly in the summer. So getting a significant load like an EV under control of your home energy management system becomes extremely vital so we can deliver great savings for the homeowner, both in terms of bill offset as well as payback period as you think about NEM 3.0 here in the U.S. as well as, as you think about home energy management broadly in Europe as well.
Jordan Levy: Thanks so much for that.
Raghu Belur: Thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from Brian Lee with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Brian Lee: Hi guys. Thanks for taking the questions. Apologies about earlier. I had a question about the - I guess the, destock and how you're reading the channel. I appreciate, Badri, all the kind of detailed disclosure about the quarterly cadences you've experienced. So if I do the math, you kind of shipped 10% more than sell-through 2 quarters in a row based on your commentary in the U.S. So roughly, let's call it, $100 million, if my math is correct. And your guidance is effectively down that much sequentially, if not a little bit more. So does this imply you're entirely resetting kind of the channel all in once in 3Q? And then as you get into 4Q, we're going to start to be looking at a normalized environment, you're starting to fill the channel again. Like what -- what's sort of the implication here, if that math is correct to begin with?
Badri Kothandaraman: Right. So in addition to that math, Brian, the other way - one more way to look at it is the - you always look at your ending on-hand inventory, assuming a projected demand going forward. So we are not assuming any optimistic demand for Q3. We assume the same level of uncertainty continues for Q3. And so that's another portion of the math that needs to be done to calculate how much we should really shift into the channel in Q3. And we took that into account. As I also said, in Europe, we expect to be slightly down as compared to last quarter due to typical seasonality. So that -- and to answer your question, that's the idea. We'd like to bring the channel back to a healthy place at the end of Q3.
Brian Lee: Okay. Fair enough. But embedded in your guide for 3Q, the sell-through sounds like you're assuming continued weakness. Do you anticipate that to just kind of be a flat line assumption all the way through the rest of this year, end of the year, and that's how you're approaching the channel reset even beyond 3Q rates?
Badri Kothandaraman: That's right. We are assuming also a little bit on the NEM 3.0. But - I mean, look, we are confident that this is - this is a onetime correction. The reason is we have a lot more new products that are coming up for us. And so we all feel good that this onetime correction will clearly normalize the channel. And on top of it, we have so many initiatives to diversify our revenue, including the new countries in Europe and the small commercial in the U.S. that we talked about. So, we are cautiously optimistic we are correct.
Brian Lee: Okay. Great. And then I guess that's a good segue into my second question, and then I'll pass it on. You're sort of the newer player in Europe, you're coming out with new products, new markets. And obviously, you have the highest margins out there in the industry, and I know you want to protect those. But as you enter new markets in this environment, is there a kind of different mindset around pricing strategy? Can you maybe speak at a high level about kind of what you're thinking in regards to pricing when you're out in Europe and you're trying to gain share there? And maybe you have some margin wherewithal to work with? Thanks guys.
Badri Kothandaraman: Yes. I think that's also a good question. In Europe, microinverter is - I mean, the folks in Netherlands and France understand us perfectly. For small systems like in Netherlands and France, they love our quality, they love our service, and we are extremely close to these partners. We provide them an outstanding service. The - your question on new areas, I mean, that's something we are always thinking as we enter the emerging markets, for example, like Brazil. For example, like even the small commercial market. We are able to manufacture those microinverters, which are high-power microinverters, 480-watt AC. Those, we are able to manufacture in the U.S. And we get incentives, production tax credit to the tune of $0.11 a watt for those inverters. So I think there is some opportunity there for us to become a little more aggressive in terms of market share. And we'll be pursuing those.
Brian Lee: Okay. Appreciate that. Thank you.
Badri Kothandaraman: Thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from Eric Stein with Craig-Hallum. Please go ahead.
Eric Stine: Hi everyone. Thanks for sneaking me in here at the end. So, if I understand correctly, it sounds like you feel pretty good about battery inventory in the channel. And again, I do appreciate everything you gave on the microinverter side. But just curious, with that in mind, with Gen 3, the launch and getting into the market. And then NEM 3.0 expected to start in 4Q, I mean, are you willing to call a bottom - I think last quarter, you said that you thought Q2 might be the bottom for battery volumes. Is that - I mean, is that still a fair expectation?
Badri Kothandaraman: Yes. I mean, that's right. That is still a fair expectation. We are exactly on track for that. We feel really good on batteries. We have started shipping our third-generation battery. The third-generation batteries solve some unique problems with the second generation. Although on the second generation, we have kind of cleaned it up. The third generation has got outstanding commissioning times. The beautiful thing in Australia is that we have the one product that combines the gateway plus the isolator. And so, it is nice and compact and it's very easy to install, the entire commissioning time. And I was told yesterday, somebody did it in under 10 minutes. So we feel really good there. In terms of power, I mean, this battery, 5-kilowatt hour battery has got 3.84 kilowatts of continuous power and 7.68 kilowatts of peak power, just a 5-kilowatt hour battery, which is double compared to our prior generation. And in fact, it is double on continuous and triple on peak power. And that peak power is very critical, because that is what helps you start air conditioners. So - and we can do a lot of great things in software. If somebody thinks it is too much power, we have the ability to throttle continuous power, but still maintain peak power. So - I mean we are very happy with our third generation. Of course, we can -- no product is perfect at the time of introduction, but this is a step function compared to Gen 2 in terms of power. We think our battery business - I mean, we called Q2 as the bottom. I believe it is the bottom. We are guiding Q3 to be the same range, 80 to 100. And we think with the NEM 3.0 starting to come up in Q4, you should start seeing a lot more activity there, along with our introduction into U.K., Italy, Poland, Greece, all of those should start to account for more megawatt orders as well.
Raghu Belur: And also in Europe, Germany, as Badri mentioned earlier on, it's an 80% battery attach, and our business in Germany is definitely starting to pick up. It gives me a lot of confidence as well. Germany is one of the more mature and a tough market to go as a new entrant to go in and win, and we are definitely doing well in Germany as well, both - not just for solar, but solar and battery. So definitely feel optimistic, bullish on the battery.
Eric Stine: Okay. Thanks for the color.
Operator: The next question comes from Jeff Osborne with Cowen. Please go ahead.
Jeff Osborne: Hi Badri and Raghu. Two quick ones. I was wondering if you could provide us, maybe dumb it down a bit. People ask us multiple ways. But the walk of guidance, you're down about $135 million sequentially at the midpoint. Is it safe to say that sort of two-thirds of that might be from the U.S., just due to the channel inventory and the third seasonality in Europe? Is there a way of bucketizing...
Badri Kothandaraman: I would say more like 85 and 15.
Jeff Osborne: Got it. That's helpful. And then it seems the strategy is to expand into as many geographies as humanly possible quickly. In your experience with past geography expansion, how quickly does it take a country to be productive in terms of training, working with the distributor, marketing? Is that a six month lag? Or you're talking about Greece, U.K., et cetera. Like, what's your expectation internally? Is that more mid next year, when those would start kicking in or spring? Any thoughts would be helpful.
Badri Kothandaraman: Yes. That's a good question. The I'll just answer it because this is what I tell my sales guys. It is to say we need a complete cross-functional team when we enter a new geography. What does a cross-functional team mean? You need a sales leader in the country. You need a couple of account managers in that country, assuming the sales is meaningful in terms of the total available market. Then you need field application engineers, because the moment there are sales, the first thing they're going to be asking is help on how do you design in the product. So the field application engineers need to be hired at the same time. Then you need training. We need to conduct - we have beautiful courses. We need to conduct training workshops every day of the week in every city. So training folks are required. And then customer service is vital. We will never enter a region without customer service staffed in the local language. Then for batteries, field service technicians are critical, where - because these field service technicians are the ones who will take any battery issue off the installers' plate. They're experts. One or two per region. So across a good cross-functional team for entering a region is about five to six folks, the people that I mentioned. And we are in the process of staffing that up. I've got Dave Ranhoff back, my Chief Commercial Officer. He thought he retired three months ago, but I've gotten him back. He's going to be with us for a couple of more years. And so he basically is championing all of our go-to-market activity in Europe as well as new segments in the U.S.
Jeff Osborne: Appreciate it. Thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.
Steve Fleishman: Yes, thanks. Just wanted to clarify - sorry to ask a similar question to some others. But the impact of the inventory reset from the first half of the year that you're going to do in Q3, can you just identify what that catch-up is as opposed to kind of ongoing inventory changes? Just the impact of - 
Badri Kothandaraman: Maybe you missed my detailed answers on this, let me try to say once again. Basically - 
Steve Fleishman: I guess I heard actually, just like in hundreds of millions, like on that, on revenue, do you have a number for that? Help me up. Tens of millions?
Badri Kothandaraman: Yes. I mean what we said is we are taking our guidance from - or we are taking our revenue numbers from an actual - Q2 actual of $711 million to a guidance for Q3, $550 million to $600 million. Midpoint is $575 million. And a portion of it, most of it, 85%, is what I said is because we are doing a onetime correction. And the rest of it is Europe is seasonally down in Q3.
Steve Fleishman: Okay. Great. And then on the Europe aspect, could you just clarify how you know it's the seasonal issue, as opposed to the beginning of some of the same issues we've seen in the U.S. in terms of gas prices down, higher rates? How do you know it's the seasonality?
Badri Kothandaraman: Well, that's what we are hearing. We are very close to our customers. This is what we are hearing from all of them. The fundamental drivers aren't changing. And for us, really, like what I said, we aren't that much worried about talks of inventory because we have -- we are underpenetrated in Europe. We are strong in France and Netherlands. But every year, the region in Europe is a blue ocean for us. Like, for example, in Italy, solar plus storage. In U.K., the same thing. In Poland, similar. In Sweden and Denmark, similar. In Greece, similar. So we are underpenetrated in most of the regions, except France and Netherlands, which have been fantastic for us. And so I think we are extremely bullish about Europe. Our growth rate, like what we said, is more than tripled growth in Q2, more than tripled year-on-year. We are very bullish there.
Steve Fleishman: Understood. Thank you very much.
Operator: The next question comes from Corinne Blanchard with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Corinne Blanchard: Hi. Good evening, team. Most of my questions have been answered at this point. But maybe if you can help me understand the impact of the IRA benefit into next year. I believe you know related to get like a tax credit. So does that fully erase what you'll be paying? Or just if you can give some color here.
Badri Kothandaraman: Yes. So the net benefit from IRA, we are breaking it out so you can see it properly. So in the second quarter that ended just now, the net benefit was $1.6 million. And that came because of 50,000 units shipped at - you can do the math, roughly $30-odd. So that's about $1.6 million. Now for Q3, we have given you a guidance of 600,000 units and an estimated IRA benefit of $14.5 million to $16.5 million. So you can calculate how much is on a per-unit basis. In the past, I have told you that the net benefit is between $20 and $30 per unit, and we will continue to give that number every quarter because the mix is changing every quarter. Sometimes we make high-power products depending on customer demand. And sometimes, it is a slightly lower-power product. So the mix changes. We also gave you a number, which is, pending robust demand, we will do 4.5 million units per quarter. We will reach up to that number in Q4 of '24. So that number, if you do the math, it is 4.5 million units times, let us say, an average benefit of $25. That's like $112.5 million of net benefit in Q4 '24. So that's the math. And that will be accounted in the cost of goods sold. And so we will break out the gross margin with the IRA and without IRA. So you can see this, and it will be very clear.
Corinne Blanchard: Great. Thank you. And just one quick follow-up. But previously, you had mentioned you expected to restart 4.5 million quarterly capacity by the end of 2024. As of today, - and look, I understand visibility can change and demand can change. But as of today, that's still something that you anticipate by next year to reach?
Badri Kothandaraman: Well, it all depends. That is why we qualified it with saying pending robust demand. And if that demand is, for example, let us say we go through another recession next year, then I mentioned earlier that we would look at how to balance this out between U.S. and international, and we will give you the appropriate guidance at that time.
Corinne Blanchard: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from Sophie Karp with KeyBanc. Please go ahead.
Sophie Karp: Hi. Good afternoon. Thank you for squeezing me in. I wanted to ask you a question on kind of go-to-market strategy, particularly as you expand to Europe, where competition is higher across different product lines. Does it make sense for you to, I guess, launch some kind of brand awareness campaign aimed at the end consumer so that people could maybe learn and face the brand by name? Or do you think that you should continue reaching customers by primarily targeting dealers and installers?
Badri Kothandaraman: If you take a book out of what we have done here in the U.S., we really have focused on our installers, right? Our installers are really the front for the homeowner. And obviously, that has been very effective. Having said that, we do use all of the social media tools that we have at our disposal to reach an end consumer. So we do provide cover for our installer partners. But really, our focus remains letting our installers be the ones that are actually selling the product to the end consumer. Now the end consumer does see the Enphase product very clearly because they have that all in one app that they see and they see the Enphase brand. So - so they do get to see it. But in general, we let our installer partners be the front for our company's products.
Sophie Karp: Got it. Thank you. And then maybe a quick one on TPO versus, I guess, cash sales and loans. Do you have any visibility with your installers, or any commentary you can share on how they navigate in the environment where TPOs are maybe taking the market share, becoming more price competitive given the interest rates and the IRA benefits? And what does that mean for the volume of business that they can be doing going forward?
Badri Kothandaraman: We do see a number of installers trying to shift their business from cash, I mean, from loans to PPA. Usually, these are slightly bigger installers, less on the long tail. And we work with them. We work with many of the leasing partners. They buy our microinverters. So for us, so far, it hasn't nominally changed anything for us, but we do see some shift happening. That is correct.
Sophie Karp: Great. That's all for me. Thank you.
Operator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Badri Kothandaraman for any closing remarks.
Badri Kothandaraman: Thank you for joining us today and for your continued support of Enphase. We look forward to speaking with you again next quarter. Thank you.
Operator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2023 Q1  (2023-04-25 12:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Enphase Energy's First Quarter 2023 Financial Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please also note that, today's event is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the floor over to Karen Sagot. Ma'am, please go ahead.
Karen Sagot: Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us on today's conference call to discuss Enphase Energy's First Quarter 2023 Results. On today's call are Badri Kothandaraman, our President and Chief Executive Officer; Mandy Yang, our Chief Financial Officer; and Raghu Belur, our Chief Products Officer. After the market closed today, Enphase issued a press release announcing the results for its first quarter ended March 31, 2023. During this conference call, Enphase management will make forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, statements related to our expected future financial performance, the capabilities of our technology and products and the benefits to homeowners and installers; our operations, including manufacturing, customer service and supply and demand; anticipated growth in existing and new markets; the timing of new product introductions and regulatory matters. These forward-looking statements involve significant risks and uncertainties, and our actual results and the timing of events could differ materially from these expectations. For a more complete discussion of the risks and uncertainties, please see our most recent Form 10-K and 10-Qs filed with the SEC. We caution you not to place any undue reliance on forward-looking statements and undertake no duty or obligation to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future events or changes in expectations. Also, please note that financial measures used on this call are expressed on a non-GAAP basis unless otherwise noted and have been adjusted to exclude certain charges. We have provided a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures in our earnings release furnished with the SEC on Form 8-K and which can also be found in the Investor Relations section of our website. Now, I'd like to introduce Badri Kothandaraman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Enphase Energy. Badri?
Badri Kothandaraman: Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today to discuss our Q1 2023 financial results. We had a decent quarter. We reported revenue of $726 million, shipped approximately 4.8 million microinverters and 102-megawatts hours of batteries, and generated free cash flow of $223.8 million. Approximately 65% of our Q1 microinverter shipments were IQ8. We exited Q1 at 46% gross margin, 14% operating expense and 32% operating income, all as a percentage of revenue on a non-GAAP basis. Mandy will go into our financials later in the call. Let's now discuss how we are servicing customers. Our Net Promoter Score worldwide was 75% in Q1 compared to 71% in Q4. Our North American NPS was 77% compared to 74% in Q4. Our average call wait time was 1.2 minutes compared to 1.6 minutes in Q4. We are focusing on route cost fixes of customer issues and improving our business processes rapidly to enhance customer experience. Let's talk about microinverter manufacturing. Our overall supply environment is quite stable. There are no major shortages right now. We began manufacturing at Flex Romania in the first quarter, bringing our quarterly capacity to approximately 6 million microinverters. Our European business is growing rapidly and many customers have asked us for local manufacturing, and we will be able to do that going forward. Let's come to US manufacturing. As we discussed last quarter, the IRA, Inflation Reduction Act, will help bring back high-tech manufacturing to the US and stimulate economy through creation of new jobs. We are opening manufacturing lines with three different manufacturing partners, adding a capacity of 4.5 million microinverters per quarter, bringing our overall global capacity to 10 million microinverters per quarter as we exit 2023. We expect to begin US manufacturing with one partner in Q2 and with the remaining two in Q3. Let's now cover the regions. Our US and international revenue mix for Q1 was 65% and 35%, respectively. In the US, our revenue decreased 9% sequentially due to seasonality and macroeconomic conditions and increased 28% year-on-year. The sell-through of our microinverters in Q1 decreased 21% sequentially compared to Q4, worse than the typical seasonality of 15%. Our microinverter channel inventory at the end of Q1 was relatively normal, while the storage channel inventory was a little elevated. I'll go into details later in the call. In Europe, our revenue increased 25% sequentially and more than tripled year-on-year. Our Europe non-GAAP gross margin is quite healthy, over 45%. Another point to note is that the sell-through of our microinverters in Europe reached an all-time high in Q1. We are now shipping IQ microinverters into France, Netherlands, Spain and Portugal. In addition to Germany and Belgium, we just recently started shipping IQ batteries to Netherlands, France, Austria and Switzerland. Let me provide some brief comments on Latin America, Australia and Brazil. In Latin America, revenue decreased 2% quarter-on-quarter and increased more than 70% year-on-year. Our revenue in Australia increased 6% quarter-on-quarter, while our revenue in Brazil more than doubled. We are growing very rapidly in Brazil. And given the big market size, we are expanding the team and prioritizing new products. Let me provide some additional color on the US followed by Europe. We usually recognize revenue when we ship product to distributors and large installers. Most of our installers buy our products from distributors. It is therefore relevant for us to talk about the sell-through of our products from distributors to installers. Since we have a healthy market share in the US, our statistics are a meaningful representation of the business trends. As I said earlier on this call, our sell-through of microinverters in the US was 21% lesser in Q1 compared to Q4. Our sell-through in California was only 9% lesser than Q4. There was some impact due to the weather in early Q1, but the NEM 2.0 rush in Q1 more than compensated for it. California installers took advantage of the NEM 2.0 rush and have built up a solar backlog for the next three to four months. We believe when the stockholders aren't expanding their crews to accelerate installation, they're laser focused on their cash flow due to the high interest rate environment and are looking clarity -- for clarity on the NEM 3.0 demand. Sell-through of our batteries in California was 23% lesser in Q1 compared to Q4, as installers focused mainly on solar. We expect this trend to continue for the next three to four months. After that, we see NEM 3.0 as a net positive for California and expect strong demand to resume for solar plus storage. Let's cover the rest of the US. The sell-through of microinverters in non-California states was 25% lesser in Q1 compared to Q4. We observed that the sell-through was even lower in states with low utility rates such as Texas, Florida and Arizona. In these states, the economics of loan financing has worsened due to rising interest rates. The sell-through performance in the Northeast US was a little better. Coming to IQ Batteries, the sell-through in non-California states was 28% lesser in Q1 compared to Q4. Let's briefly discuss the health of our US customer base and some trends in financing. Our Q1 data shows higher sell-through rates for long tail installers compared to Tier 1 and 2 installers. Our installers, in general, are navigating three key challenges: first, the rapid increase in interest rates over last year; second is switch from selling low APR with high dealer fees, the selling market rate loans with low dealer fees; and third, the delayed payment from the loan originators or as the industry calls it, reduction of M1 payments. Let's discuss about the second and third challenges. We see the move to high APR and low dealer fee loans as a positive for the industry. The demand for market rate loans remained strong. New capital providers who were not able to buy below market rate loans are now offering solar financing. Installers are adjusting their sales practices for a higher interest rate environment. We are also seeing new lease providers entering the market with focus on servicing the long tail. We think capital will be available for both long-tail -- for long-tail installers regardless of the mix of loan and lease. On the reduced M1 payments, loan originators are providing less cash to installers at the time of contract signing and a greater percentage after installation. This creates a working capital challenge for the installers and is forcing them to become more efficient. As the installers adjust to this new reality, we expect the sell-through of microinverters and batteries to incrementally improve in Q2 compared to Q1. Q2 is seasonally stronger and should help the situation even more. Let's come to Europe. Our European business is doing very well. We expect healthy revenue growth in Q2 compared to Q1. Our business is growing much faster than the market. We plan to introduce IQ8 microinverters and IQ batteries into many more countries in Europe throughout the year. Our value proposition is our differentiated home energy management systems combined with high quality and great customer experience. We are integrating the products from our latest acquisition, GreenCom Networks into our Enphase Home Energy System, starting in Germany this quarter. This will help network third-party EV chargers and heat pumps with Enphase solar plus storage systems. The benefit to homeowners is reduced electricity bills due to increased self-consumption in addition to having control via the Enphase app. Let's talk about new products. I say internally in the company that 2023 is the year of new products, and it's coming in good time. We are getting ready to launch our third-generation IQ battery in North America and Australia this quarter. In Australia, we will also launch the IQ8 microinverters. As I previously discussed, the IQ battery has a modularity of five-kilowatt hours and delivers double the continuous and triple the peak power compared to our prior generation of batteries. The higher charging and discharging rate of a third-generation battery will be uniquely beneficial for NEM 3.0 systems in California through its ability to generate revenue by exporting into the grid at the appropriate time. In addition, our third-generation battery is very easy to install and commission. We are currently piloting these third-generation batteries in Australia and in the US with select installers and are very excited about the experience we are about to deliver to our customers. Next, let's talk about our latest new product for the residential segment in emerging markets. This product, the IQ8P microinverter will deliver 480 watts of AC power, supporting panels up to 650 watts DC for Brazil, Mexico, Spain, India and emerging markets. We are on track to release IQ8P into production in the second half of the year. The other variant of IQ8P microinverter with the new three-phase cabling system is well-suited for small commercial solar installation, ranging from 20 to 200 kilowatts, such as gas stations, schools, hospitals, churches and small business. These microinverter systems offer the same grid compatibility, high quality and rapid shutdown capability as our standard residential products. We expect to release this product into the US small commercial solar market in the second half of 2023. Let's discuss EV chargers. We shipped over 8,600 chargers in Q1, compared to 7,600 charges in Q4. We are now shipping Enphase-branded EV chargers from Flex Mexico, helping us increase capacity and reduce costs. We are on track to introduce IQ smart EV chargers in Q2. These charges will have WiFi connectivity, enabling use cases like green charging and allowing the homeowners visibility into operation of their Enphase solar plus storage, plus EV charger system through their app. Let's now discuss the installer platform. We released several updates to our solar graph design and proposal software, including basic NEM 3.0 functionality, battery design, document management and other improvements are requested by installers. We have more than 1,000 installers using the software. NEM 3.0 incentivizes homeowners to use solar and battery systems for avoiding energy imports, while compensating homeowners for exporting energy when the grid needs it. The updated solar graph platform offers a simplified experience for designing an NEM 3.0 system by optimizing panel placements, configuring battery sizing, leveraging its modularity and enhancing system operations for self-consumption and energy export to deliver the best possible payback. We see that solar plus storage under NEM 3.0 can achieve a payback period between six and eight years depending on the utility. As we said before, the higher power of our third-generation battery helps us to export more energy to the grid and maximize savings. Let me conclude. With the residential solar and storage market growing rapidly in Europe, we are in a great position to significantly accelerate our business. The situation in the US is a little different with NEM 3.0 in California and the macroeconomic challenges in rest of the US. Our strategy doesn't change. We are focused on working closely with our installers to address their issues, making new products and entering new markets and countries. The fundamentals are intact for our industry. 30% ITC for the next decade, the rising utility rates, the focus on climate change and the desire for resilience are all going to push the need for solar plus storage more than ever before. With our differentiated products, high quality and exceptional customer experience, we are in a strong position to capitalize on this trend. With that, I will turn the call over to Mandy for her review of our finances. Mandy?
Mandy Yang : Thanks, Badri, and good afternoon, everyone. I will provide more details related to our first quarter of 2023 financial results as well as our business outlook for the second quarter of 2023. We have provided reconciliations of these non-GAAP to GAAP financial measures in our earnings release posted today, which can also be found in the IR section of our website. Total revenue for Q1 was $726 million, slightly up from the fourth quarter of 2022. We shipped approximately 1,957 megawatts DC of microinverters and 102-megawatt hours of IQ batteries in the quarter. Non-GAAP gross margin for Q1 was 45.7% compared to 43.8% in Q4. The increase was driven by increased IQ8 product mix and improved logistics. The gross margin was 45% for Q1. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $98.4 million for Q1 compared to $87.7 million for Q4. The increase was driven by international growth and R&D. GAAP operating expenses were $158.7 million for Q1 compared to $153.7 million for Q4. GAAP operating expenses for Q1 included $56 million of stock-based compensation expenses and $3.7 million of acquisition-related expenses and amortization for acquired intangible assets and $700,000 of restructuring and asset impairment charges. On a non-GAAP basis, income from operations for Q1 was $233.6 million compared to $229.4 million for Q4. On EBIT basis, income from operations was $167.7 million for Q1 compared to $157 million for Q4. On a non-GAAP basis, net income for Q1 was $192.3 million compared to $212.4 million for Q4. This resulted in non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.37 for Q1 compared to $1.51 for Q4. GAAP net income for Q1 was $146.9 million compared to GAAP net income of $153.8 million for Q4. This resulted in GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.02 for Q1 compared to $1.06 for Q4. The decline for both non-GAAP and GAAP net income and earnings per share was driven by our higher effective tax rate as we are now a significant US cash taxpayer. We exited Q1 with a total cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balance of $1.78 billion compared to $1.61 billion at the end of Q4. We did not make any open market share repurchases against our $200 million share repurchase authorization. Instead, we spent approximately $72 million to cover withholding taxes for the employees divesting in Q1 that received the dilutive shares by 338,000 shares. We expect to continue this anti-dilution program throughout the year. In Q1, we generated $246.2 million in cash flow from operations and $223.8 million in free cash flow. Capital expenditure was $22.5 million for Q1 compared to $16.4 million for Q4. The increase was primarily due to investment in R&D equipment and US manufacturing. Now, let's discuss our of 2023. We expect our revenue for the second quarter of 2023 to be within a range of $700 million to $750 million, which includes shipments of 80 to 100-megawatt hours of IQ Batteries. We expect GAAP gross margin to be within the range of 41% to 44% and non-GAAP gross margin to be within the range of 42% to 45%, which includes -- which excludes stock-based compensation expenses and acquisition-related amortization. Our guidance numbers do not include any IRA benefit. We expect our net operating expenses to be within the range of $155 million to $159 million, including approximately $57 million estimated for stock-based compensation expenses, acquisition-related expenses and amortization and restructuring charges for site consolidation. We expect our non-GAAP operating expenses to be within the range of $98 million to $102 million. We intend to keep the non-GAAP operating expenses flat in Q2. We will continue investing in product innovation and international growth while making other areas of the company more efficient. Moving to tax. Since we have utilized most of our net operating loss and research tax credit carryforward, we are now a significant US cash taxpayer. We expect GAAP and non-GAAP annualized effective tax rate for 2023 to be at 22% plus or minus 1% before any IRA impact. Now I'd like to discuss how the advanced manufacturing production credits from the IRA will be reported in our earnings while waiting on the implementation guidelines from the US Treasury. Based on the current guidelines, the production credit can be claimed as direct pay or in the form of tax credit. Under direct pay, the production credit will be accounted for as a reduction in cost of goods sold. And in tax credit, you will be reported in the tax expense line. Incrementally we will provide us the same dollar impact to our earnings per share as the production credit is nontaxable. We expect the production credit net of any incremental costs for domestic manufacturing to be in the range of $20 to $30 per microinverter sold to customers. We expect to ship 50,000 net in USA microinverters to customers this quarter. We plan to have our US contract manufacturing facilities to be fully operational by the end of 2023. We estimate shipments to reach our US capacity of 4.5 million microinverters per quarter by the end of 2024, assuming robust demand. With that, I will open the line for questions.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, at this time we will begin the question-and-answer session [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from Colin Rusch from Oppenheimer. Please go ahead with your question.
Colin Rusch: Thanks so much, guys. Can you talk a little bit about channel levels outside the US? And how much of the 2Q guidance is really about just selling into the channels? I get the channel is full to serve the markets in both Latin America and Europe?
Badri Kothandaraman: Yes. Actually, in Europe, our channel is rather light. We've been tight on product in the last few quarters. And so the channel is light. By light, I mean, we consider channel to be normal between eight and 10 weeks of inventory and light means less than eight weeks. So basically, that's the situation there.
Colin Rusch: Okay. And then with the battery volumes decline sequentially and continuing in 2Q, can you talk a little bit about how much of that's related to the product cycle you guys are going through? And how much of that is just related to overall underlying demand?
Badri Kothandaraman: Yes. On batteries, as an executive team, we are hyper focused on batteries as much as on our microinverters. Our learning curve on batteries has been tremendous. As we speak, our second-generation batteries are getting better and better every day in both their installation and performance. Our third-generation battery, like what I said is coming soon into the US and Australia in Q2, that will be even better with a wired communication can and with double the continuous power and triple the peak power and with enhanced modularity, as well as serviceability that helps us in dropping costs compared to the prior generation. And of course, it's LFP, so it's the safest battery. The demand in the US, that demand being down is temporarily. I described the dynamics due to the NEM 2.0 pulling in California, as well as the increased interest rates outside of California. We believe that's a temporary problem. Installers will figure out what to do outside. And California, we're incredibly bullish on NEM 3.0. We think our battery is going to be perfect for NEM 3.0, because the increased power of the battery will give the ability to export more energy during the time when the grid needs it in August and September, and people can get paid handsomely for it. And because of that, you see the payback for a solar plus storage system under NEM 3.0 is approximately six to eight years, depending on which utility you are in. So, we think NEM 3.0 will accelerate the attach rate of batteries, and it might take a little bit of time for the industry and for the consumers to realize it, but I have no hesitation that NEM 3.0 will be better for California. Now, let me come outside the US. So far, we've been shipping to Germany and Belgium in Europe. This quarter, I would say, in end of March as well as in the beginning of April, we introduced batteries to four more countries, basically, France, Netherlands and Switzerland -- actually, Austria, to correct myself, that was a month or two ago. So, we just introduced batteries in four countries. We are going to introduce our third-generation battery in Australia in Q2 in addition to the US. In both Q3 and Q4, we are going to target several more countries in Europe. We'll be in Italy and UK by Q4. So, on the batteries, we're just getting started in Europe. And I think the volumes will start ramping there. And in the US, it's a matter of time, the rest of the US recovers, the installers start selling batteries again. And in California, it will be a no-brainer with NEM 3.0. So the numbers are only going to get better from here on. The long answer, I just wanted to give you a full picture.
Colin Rusch: Thanks so much for real help. I’ll get back in the queue. Thanks guys.
Operator: Our next question comes from Maheep Mandloi from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead with your question.
Maheep Mandloi: Hey, good evening. Thanks for taking my questions. Maybe just on the battery question, just to elaborate on that. Do you see any opportunity for lower peak kilowatt battery, which is mostly used to -- as a rate arbitrage device versus a full home pack of solutions? Just any thoughts on that kind of a device, which -- where you could use your Gen 2 solutions as well?
Raghu Belur: Yes. I think both Gen 2 and Gen 3, if you look at Gen 3, as Badri mentioned -- this is Raghu, by the way. The power is double the max continuous power of the Gen 2 and three times the peak power. The peak power, as a reminder, is what gets used to manage heavy loads during start-up time. But to you -- answer your question, the power is -- can be modified. We can set the limits to what the power needs to be in software. So what that does is just makes the whole process very efficient for the installer. They have got one SKU to purchase. They can install that one SKU, which would be the five-kilowatt hour SKU. And then they can vary the power depending on what the homeowners' needs are, whether that is going to be an NEM 3.0 system, which could be just one battery with a PV system, and it happens to be grid tied, for example, or a 10-kilowatt hours of battery that could be providing partial loan backup or you could be doing 20-kilowatt hours and doing whole home backup. So all of that -- the beauty of the system is that it all can be configured in software and gives you a tremendous amount of flexibility and simplicity for the installer.
Maheep Mandloi: Got it, got it. And just a second question from me on ASPs. If you could just talk about how to think about ASP trends here. You talked about inventory being slightly light in Europe, but as we come out through the rest of this year and some of these component shortages and logistic issues slowed down, do you expect any reduction in ASPs in Europe or the US markets? Thanks.
Badri Kothandaraman: We don't see any drop in pricing. In fact, we see our gross margin sequentially up a couple of percent from Q4 to Q1. And also, I broke out the gross margins in Europe because some of you had been asking me. The gross margins in Europe are incredibly healthy. They're over 45%. The gross margin in the US is incredibly healthy. Pricing is stable for us. Gross margin means both price as well as cost. And so we do value-based pricing, which is basically price products based upon the value they bring compared to the next best alternative like alkaline batteries, it may be increased power, increased safety. In microinverters, it may be increased quality, increased service. So that's on the pricing side. On the cost side, we have a world -- a task force that runs all the time called world-class costs. So we are constantly discovering ways to save a cent in the microinverter. For example, based on last year's shipments, last year, we shipped 15 million microinverters in 2022. So $0.01 reduction for us means $154,000. So it's very important for us, even $0.01 reduction, even $0.005 reduction is important for us. So we take it extremely seriously. On batteries, with a third-generation battery, which has got higher modularity as increased serviceability. Now I think we can reduce the overhead contribution and costs to a minimum. And on batteries, the gross margin for every generation will get better than the prior generation. So a long answer again, but ASPs, we do not see much change and our cost programs are going well.
Maheep Mandloi: Got it. Appreciate it. And thanks for taking my questions here. Thanks.
Operator: Our next question comes from Corinne Blanchard from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead with your question.
Corinne Blanchard : Hey, thank you for taking my questions. Could you comment a little bit on competition in Europe versus China-based company and maybe the risk of margin erosion in that market?
Raghu Belur : Yes. This is Raghu again. Competition is strong everywhere. It's always been. It's nothing new, both here in the U.S. as well as in Europe. And so for us, we are always striving to make sure that we are providing value and providing a highly differentiated solution. So if you look at the solutions that we provide, both here as well as the U.S. from a product point of view, I'll talk about other stuff as well, from a product point of view, we are truly a distributed architecture that gives us much better performance, much better reliability. And because it's a low-voltage DC system, both solar and batteries, et cetera, it's arguably much safer as well in addition to being very simple to install, maintain and manage. The second thing we also look at very closely is that providing very high-quality, high-reliability products. And that's, again, a big differentiator, and it starts with the architecture as well as all of the work that we do in delivering a very high-quality product. And finally, it's customer service. Just making sure that, as Badri mentioned, if you look at what our NPS is, look at what I call wait times. Somebody calls us, we answer the phone immediately. It's one phone call to make because, typically, they're buying the entire Enphase system. And so delivering the best customer experience, both for our installer -- our distributor partners, installer partners as well as for the home owner. For the homeowner, they have just one app to look at, and they can -- they have the control of their entire system on the palm of their hand. So to summarize, it's highly differentiated products, high-reliability products and great customer experience. And that's how we manage -- that's how we deal with our competition and reflected in our -- in pricing and gross margin, as Badri mentioned.
Corinne Blanchard : Got it. Thank you. And a follow-up to a different topic, but coming back to California, you mentioned there's about a three to four-month backlog from the process that was done in 1Q. I know you do not provide like further than next quarter guidance, but do you expect like sequential improvement throughout the year, I mean, in the second half of the year better than the first half? Just trying to get a view there.
Badri Kothandaraman : It's hard for me to say right now, but I know that NEM 3.0 has got great fundamentals in California. And contrary to what I've read from the reports, it is a change. Selling from NEM 2.0 to NEM 3.0 requires the installers to adapt. And now the storage attach is going to be a lot more, it is a change in selling. It is a change they are not used to yet. So the next three to four months will be probably well spent in training the installers on how to sell NEM 3.0, because with NEM 3.0 now, the consumption of the homeowner is important. NEM 3.0 has got tariffs for 24 hours during the day, times 365 days a year, so 8,000 plus points, 8,000-plus data points. So it's very important. Your consumption profile is important. So your savings obviously depends on the consumption profile. So we need to make a few things clear to the homeowner. And we need to clearly tell him that basically -- him or her that self consumption -- you're going to do self-consumption most of the time, which means what, your consumption is going to be met by either solar and/or storage. But during the month of August and September, we have all seen blackouts in California, during the month of August and September, why? Because the demand on the grid is higher than supply. There -- in August and September, under NEM 3.0, you get paid for actually helping the grid. You get paid handsomely. And at that time, battery is going to be your best friend. You're going to be making a lot of money on batteries. So I think, my personal opinion is NEM 3.0 -- of course, it requires a lot of evangelizing, a lot of selling, but NEM 3.0 will be a catalyst for solar plus storage. Like Germany, if you go look at Germany. Germany, the solar market is over 2 gigawatts, maybe 3 gigawatts right now. The attach rate is over 80%. That's a fuel self consumption market. And the tariff structure is similar. I think the import rate is €0.41 per kilowatt hour and the export is something like €0.11 per kilowatt hour, so a very similar construct. I think the result will be the same. Of course, it's not going to be overnight. It's going to take time, but great for the long term.
Corinne Blanchard: Thank you.
Operator: And our next question comes from Brian Lee from Goldman Sachs. Please, go ahead with your question.
Brian Lee: Hey, Badri and team. Thanks for taking the questions. Maybe just a follow-up on that one. Just if we drill down on storage specifically, that hasn't really grown here for a number of quarters, and you're guiding sequentially down there on shipments. I know NEM 3.0, it sounds like you're going to take a little bit of time to filter through the market. But do you anticipate that your storage volumes will grow sequentially at any point moving through the rest of this year? That would be my first question. And then I have a follow-up.
Badri Kothandaraman: Yeah. I think the storage volumes are going to go -- Q2 is probably the low. They're going to grow from here on and simply because of one reason. We are going to be introducing batteries to a lot more countries. We just introduced to four countries. And we are going to be introducing the third-generation battery in Q2 this quarter. Then, we are going to be introducing the third-generation battery into multiple countries in Europe. So NEM 3.0 is a part of the equation, but not the only thing in the equation. And eventually, the installers are going to figure out how to sell batteries in the rest of the US, despite the high interest rates. So like what I said, I think we are turning the corner on batteries. We have understood how to enhance the customer experience. Even our second-generation batteries are best in class right now. The third-generation batteries will obviously make things even better with double the power, double continuous triple peak. Yeah.
Brian Lee: Okay. Understood. So Q2 is a low point. That's helpful. And then just my follow-up would be, I appreciate the additional commentary about sell-in versus sell-through and providing that context. But I was a little bit confused as to what it means for channel inventory situation and kind of what you're expecting? Because it almost sounds like with sell-through being down much more than sell-in that maybe inventory levels in the US are elevated. I know you said, it was on battery storage, but not micros, but when do you expect maybe sell-in and sell-through to kind of match up more aligned? And then I guess, what is sort of the viewpoint on whether there's some inventory drawdown that's impacting near-term sort of volume opportunity?
Badri Kothandaraman: If you see a mathematic threat, if you see one week of channel inventory equals roughly 7.5%, right -- of the quarter, right? If you split the quarter into 13 weeks, so one week is basically 7.5%. So if something, let's say, if in one quarter if the sell-through is, let's say, 15% down that equates to two weeks of inventory. And so it's nothing over the top. It is if your normal channel inventory is somewhere around 10 weeks -- or 8 to 10 weeks, this would result in a slight -- instead of 8 weeks, you would be at 10 weeks. That's what you're talking about. So now having said that is we expect sequentially better sell-through. You know, Q1 is usually bad for sell-through due to a combination of weather plus now there is a macroeconomic effect on top of it. So Q2 is seasonally better plus with the installers getting little bit more adjusted to the situation. Things are going to be incrementally better in terms of sell-through in Q2 onwards.
Brian Lee: Okay. Appreciate that. Thank you.
Operator: And our next question comes from Philip Shen from ROTH MKM. Please go ahead with your question.
Philip Shen: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. First one's on pricing as a follow-up to a prior question. Our check suggest pricing through the US resi ecosystem is coming down rapidly. So US resi solar module pricing is down 15% to 30-plus percent. Powerwall pricing is down. Meaningfully some of your inverter peers have lowered inverter pricing. We've heard that you guys have -- you may have lowered pricing as well for specific larger customers on a one-off basis. I think, Badri, you just mentioned that you don't see any drop in pricing, but can you talk -- can you give us some more color on how you expect to maintain price, especially in this more difficult environment? And can you talk about price specifically in Q3 and Q4, if you expect it to hold, how does it hold? And if there is some risk, maybe talk about that risk? Thanks.
Badri Kothandaraman: You can see our numbers. Gross margin is 2 percentage points better in Q1 than Q4. It basically comes because of our disciplined pricing management plus the conversion for us to IQ8. IQ8 comes with an outstanding cost structure. And right now, we are at 65% converted to IQ8. We expect to be at nearly 90% converted to IQ8 by Q3. So -- and we have an active cost reduction effort going on. So even if we do one-off deals, for example, in order to accelerate our market share, these are not going to cause a dent for us. So we expect pricing to be generally stable. The same thing is true on batteries. On batteries, we are learning rapidly. We are learning a lot on costs, especially the overhead costs on the battery returns. The serviceability of batteries are tough if you ask anybody in the industry. And I think we are getting better and better and better at those, basically improving the battery quality by root cost corrective action, by understanding defects, by eliminating the defects, by putting in permanent corrective actions in place. Then also building in serviceability into our new products. So why take down $3,000 products from the wall? Why not take down a $40 board from the wall instead? Why not repair it in situ? Why not service right there in 30 minutes? So there's a lot of money to be taken out of batteries from a cost perspective. That's what we are doing.
Philip Shen: Great. Really appreciate that color. As a follow-up there, Badri, to what degree do you think you may be giving up on some volume? So I think Tesla is a string inverter, they're ramping up, and I think they're selling inverters only. And yes, I know your technology is meaningfully better, does many things that they can't do. But in this tough economic environment, installers may be prioritizing cost. So with the high gross margin where you are now, you may be able to maintain some share without giving much on price, but still keeping some of that volume. So how do you make that trade-off between price and volume as we get through the next few quarters?
Badri Kothandaraman: Yes. I don't. For me, it is high quality leads to high price. And why? Because it's the entire cost of ownership. Installers have become smart -- smarter. Basically, they understand it is not about just the price of the inverter. The time, the money, it causes them to go and address the failure is so huge compared to a few dollars move on the inverter for high quality. So high quality is what we focus on, and installers have realized that. And they are continuing to work with us. And you can see the latest energy say the reports for the data. And the data is there. So we don't plan on changing our strategy there.
Philip Shen: Great. Thank you so much for the color.
Operator: Our next question comes from Andrew Percoco from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead with your question.
Andrew Percoco: Great. Thanks so much for the time. I just wanted to follow-up, Badri, on some of your prepared remarks around the health of the customer base, specifically the long tail. Can you just maybe talk about what you're seeing from some of those customers? Talk a little bit about working capital needs? But just when it comes to the financing environment, the confidence level and their ability to get financing. And then maybe on the other side of that, to the extent the core long tail doesn't perform as expected, what's the optionality to sell to some of the larger players in the market? And what might that mean for pricing and margins?
Badri Kothandaraman: Yes. Just to recap what I said -- and it's good for everyone to hear it again, is our overall sell-through of microinverters in the US was 21% lesser in Q1, compared to Q4. California was only 9% out of that because we understand the situation with NEM 2.0. So the NEM 2.0 rush basically compensated for any weakness due to the macro. On the rest of the US, the sell-through dropped by 25%, compared to Q4. And the most notable drops were seen in the states with the lowest utility rates, Texas, Florida, Arizona. Then -- we then did an analysis on how did the long tail installers do in comparison with the Tier 1 and 2 installers? We found in our analysis, the sell-through rate of long tail installers was quite better compared to the Tier 1 and 2 installers. Now I'm not exactly sure of the reasons, I can only speculate. Maybe they're local. There they do a better job of servicing the client, maybe they deal with high-value clients. But we thought from the questions we had that long tail was going to be a little more stressed, but we found the opposite in our data. But having said that, I mean all installers are affected by three things like what we said. The interest rates are high. That's the first thing. So basically, it's getting more difficult to -- solar with loans is getting a little more difficult to sell. Basically, earlier, they used to do low APR loans with high dealer fees. And that was common, whether it's long tail or Tier 1 and 2 installers. Now they are switching to higher APR with lesser dealer fees, sometimes no dealer fees. A cash flow issue. That is the milestone on payment is a lot reduced now. That's causing stress. Some of the -- our expectation was some of the Tier 1, 2 installers may be able to handle that situation better than long tail, but we didn't -- the data didn't indicate that. For us, the data said that the long tail is okay, it's holding up. And we think it is a matter of time. We think the industry as a whole is going to adjust. Of course, there are a few installers who may actually find it difficult. But in general, the industry is going to adjust to the new loan structures. Probably, it's a big opportunity for more people to come in to the market to offer loans and leases to long-tail installers, leases to long tail installers hasn't been ramp until now, but that's an opportunity that we see already a few players come in. So I think it's going to be interesting to watch the situation in the next few quarters. But I think this is a resilient industry. And I believe things are only going to get better from here. Q1, as I indicated, is usually the worst quarter of the year due to seasonality. And so that -- Q2 is usually a good quarter in terms of seasonality and with the adjustments installers are making in running their business, we expect things to be incrementally better.
Andrew Percoco: Got it. That's helpful. And maybe just last one for me on net metering, officially took effect, I guess, a week or so ago. Any kind of first indications from the installers in terms of what they're seeing? In terms of, to your point, some of the friction potions around coating and installations. Are they -- any indications of how much growth might slow in California now that it's officially taken effect? I know it's only a weekend, but any color that you have there would be helpful.
Badri Kothandaraman: It's only a week, as you said, we have talked to a number of installers. All of them are optimistic that their solar plus storage business can boom. They are all -- we shared solar graphs with them. We shared the designs. We showed them three examples per utility. We showed them how a pure solar case looks. We showed them that solar now in west-facing roofs is not bad. We showed them solar plus storage is actually better than NEM 2.0. or equivalent. So, now actually storage has got meaningful savings right now. Earlier with NEM 2.0, storage didn't have value in terms of savings, but had a lot of value on resilience. Now, storage provides economic advantage in addition to it. So installers are getting it. As I said, they do have a little time on their hands in order to start accelerating the originations. But I think the data is there, that's a put. And we do expect -- like in Germany, we do expect grid-tied batteries to become popular too because imagine you have 8-kilowatt solar system, and the crew is already there. They're installing the solar system. And all I need to do is to install one of Enphase's 5-kilowatt-hour battery. That battery is not big. It is small. It can be done very quickly on the wall. There is no partial home, whole home, nothing to worry about. There's no work on the main panel. It's a simple 5-kilowatt-hour battery and they provide savings right away. So, selling needs to pick that up. I'm sure they can sell it.
Andrew Percoco: Understood. Thanks so much for your time.
Badri Kothandaraman: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jordan Levy from Truist Securities. Please go ahead with your question.
Jordan Levy: Thanks all. And thanks for all the commentary. Just a quick one for me to follow-up on a question of share. I'm just curious with the EU green deal industrial plan, have you seen any shift in the competitive environment over there? Any pop-ups of mom-and-pops trying to sell into the market or anything like that?
Raghu Belur: No, we haven't seen. I think the competitive environment is what has been there and it's consistent. And so -- and as I mentioned earlier on the call that given our differentiated solution or reliability, customer service, et cetera, we compete very effectively. So, I don't think that environment has changed, if I understood your question correctly.
Jordan Levy: And would you say that's true both on the battery and micro side?
Raghu Belur: Yes, it's a solution play, right? That's the most important -- short answer, yes, it's a solution play. When people buy solar there, if you look at countries like Germany as an example, when they say I'm installing solar system, what they really mean is they're installing solar and batteries and EV chargers and heat pumps. So, I think we have to provide the complete solution if you want to be an effective player in -- particularly in Europe.
Jordan Levy: Great. Thanks so much for that.
Operator: Our next question comes from Mark Strouse from JPMorgan. Please go ahead with your question.
Mark Strouse: Yes, good afternoon. Thanks for taking our questions. Getting late in the day here, so I'll just stick to one and take the rest off-line. I wanted to come back to the OpEx. The guidance for 2Q is kind of flattish quarter-over-quarter. Just from a high level, not necessarily looking for specific guidance, but from a high level, I mean, to the extent that the macro continues to deteriorate, California transition might take longer than expected. How should we think about OpEx going forward and kind of balancing near-term profitability with a lot of the investments that you're making in geographic and product expansion and everything else?
Badri Kothandaraman: You should always think about OpEx at 15% of sales. That's the general model. All I said in Q2 that we're not going to be compromising on innovation. We're not going to be compromising our international growth. We're going to make generally the company better in other areas. But our baseline is 15% of revenue, and we don't plan on exceeding that.
Mark Strouse: Okay. Fair enough. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Christine Cho from Barclays. Please go ahead with your question. 
Christine Cho: Thank you for taking my questions. For the US manufacturing, I think you guys just said in your prepared remarks, shipments should be 4.5 million per quarter by the end of '24, assuming robust demand in the US. But in the event that your US demand is less than that, would you still want to utilize that capacity and export the product and back out some of your production elsewhere? How should we think about that?
Badri Kothandaraman: Yes. We will most likely do that, but we don't do things just for profitability. We do have contract manufacturing plants that are worldwide. We have worked hard to establish balanced manufacturing strategy. So we just need to be careful in looking through and making sure that we make the best decision for both profitability and balancing manufacturing.
Christine Cho: Okay. And then on the IQ8 rollout, that's been slower than expected. Could you just go into some more detail into what's driving that? Is it on the supply side with any of the components, or is it on the demand side, as customers sound like they've had to work through inventory over the last quarter or two? And I think on the last quarter call, you said you expected it to jump to 80% in 2Q. So is that still the expectation? And just with the gross margins, it's very high this quarter and the IQ8 drove that. But your 2Q guidance is lower and batteries are lower. So that's going to be less of a drag. So is this just conservatism, or is there anything one-off that we should be aware about in 1Q or 2Q?
Badri Kothandaraman: There's nothing one-off. You're right, we are -- originally, I thought 90% by Q2, last earnings call, I told you 90% by Q3. That's the number, 90% by Q3. 80% by Q2 will be okay. We are -- for example, in Europe, 50% of our volumes are IQ8 right now. We're introducing IQ8 to many more countries as we speak. Yesterday, we introduced IQ8 to Spain and Portugal. Soon, we will introduce to Poland, Germany, et cetera. We plan on doing the bulk of those introductions. In this quarter, most of them, there will be some spillover in Q3 for a few, but we very much want to achieve 90% in Q3. That's our target.
Operator: Our next question comes from Kashy Harrison from Piper Sandler. Please, go ahead with your question.
Kashy Harrison: Good afternoon. Just one quick one for me. So you're currently sitting on, call it, $600 million of net cash, generated around $225 million of free cash flow during the quarter. So just wondering what your thoughts are on using the free cash generated this year to perhaps more aggressively repurchase stock? Thank you.
Badri Kothandaraman: Yes. I mean, we have stated our strategy. It is unchanged. Basically, first to make sure that we have plenty of cash for the needs of the business. The capital that we need for our portion of you is manufacturing, et cetera, we're doing exactly that. The next one we look at is -- we look at are there any M&As that we should be taking advantage of now? We look at a number of companies on a weekly basis in the areas of batteries, even in power conversion, in software, in home energy management, EV charging. We look at many, many areas. And that's the second priority. The third one is, if we -- basically, if we have cash left over from number one and number two, we will buy back stock assuming the share price is below conservatively estimated intrinsic value. So we will do that. Our Board looks at it very carefully. And that's our strategy.
Kashy Harrison: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Eric Stine from Craig-Hallum. Please, go ahead with your question.
Eric Stine: Hi, everyone. One here at the end for me. So I know a lot of moving parts. You've got a big revenue range on one hand, less seasonality on the other. Channel inventory that you've detailed, I'm just curious if you'd be willing to kind of go through a scenario that gets you to the high end of that revenue range and a scenario that gets you to the low end of that range and maybe how that breaks down between the US and international?
Badri Kothandaraman: Yes. I mean, we are pretty conservative when it comes to our guidance. You should see our track record in general. And we do have -- like, what I said, we do have a lot of dry powder in terms of new products. This year is the year of new products, and we are going to be releasing new products constantly. And so, we think other than the base business, which we guided on in Q2, there is a lot more to come there. So our guidance is a little bit wider this time, plus/minus $25 million. It is to reflect a slightly more uncertainty compared to the last time. But our Europe business is doing incredibly well. We grew 25% in one quarter from Q4 to Q1. We have doubled -- we doubled from 2020 to 2021. From 2021 to 2022, we grew 132%. I just released my annual letter yesterday. You can see that 132% growth from 2021 to 2022. And so Europe is doing incredibly well for us. We are focused on entering a lot more countries there. We are focused on IQ8 microinverters. We're focused on IQ Batteries, lots of regions big market over 10 gigawatts compared to the US, which is 5 gigawatts right now. So bottom line, we are pretty conservative.
Eric Stine: Got it. And then I mean, you do have the wide range, but it did seem in your commentary that you do expect improvement versus the first quarter. I mean, so is it fair to say that your expectation would be that the top half of that range?
Badri Kothandaraman: I mean we gave $700 million to $750 million. And there's nothing else we say -- we cannot say, we are in the top half of the range.
Eric Stine: Okay. Got it. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Joseph Osha from Guggenheim Partners. Please go ahead with your question.
Joseph Osha: Hi, there. I just wanted to return to some of the mechanics around the ramp of onshore manufacturing. Mandy said 50,000 units this quarter. and then two lines by the end of the year. So my first question is, does that 50,000 mean manufactured or shipped for revenue? And then secondly, looking at the end of the year, just wondering if you can tie those comments back to maybe a unit number or a run rate at the end of 2023, not 2024? Thank you.
Badri Kothandaraman: Yeah, 50, 000 microinverters shipped to customers. That's what we talk about. We always talk about shipments. Then – 
Joseph Osha: All right.
Badri Kothandaraman: Therefore, you should take that number, you should take 4.5 million unit number by end of 2024, you can do some kind of an interpolation, you can work with us and a linear interpolation may be fine too.
Joseph Osha: Okay. All right. Probably even a sell-side analysts can handle that math, but -- so you're not giving me a specific number for end of 2023 at the moment, right?
Badri Kothandaraman: Yes. And like what you said, you can really calculate it.
Joseph Osha: Okay. All right. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith from Bank of America. Please go ahead your question.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Excellent. Thank you, guys. Good afternoon. I'll make it quick here. Just with respect to the commentary on temporary impacts, I just want to clarify that super quickly. Obviously, you've got this NEM dynamic for the next couple of quarters or so as you deal with the origination on NEM 2.0. How do you think about that squaring up against this temporary impact on installations? I know, you commented earlier, there's a transition period on sales. How much of a non-California improvement are you guys thinking about especially in the back half of the year as NEM 3.0 kind of rolls in more meaningfully?
Badri Kothandaraman: I mean, we cannot predict what it's going to be in the back of -- all I know is Q1 is supposed to be seasonally a tough quarter. And on top of it, in Q1, installers had to face all of these uncertainties for the first time, Q1 as well as probably Q4 a little bit. So I think -- we said, and we hope this is true, is installers are going to adjust. Everybody is going to adjust. And of course, as long as interest rates are so high, we cannot -- we're not saying that, the numbers are going to return back to where it were. That is going to be stress on those numbers because interest rates were high, but there are going to be some innovation in financing, innovation in loans, innovation in leases that are going to come. It's going to provide more access to our long tail installers. The demand will unleash only when the interest rates are back to normal. But until then, it will get incrementally better compared to Q1.
Raghu Belur: And the things that we control -- we can control, right, for example, helping our installer partners, training them on how to sell NEM 3.0 system. This is where solar graft plays a very key role in helping them to show exactly what and how easy it would be to build a NEM 3.0 system with our R3 battery and show the payback period and bill offsets, et cetera, and how to sell that to the homeowners. And that we are doing right now as we speak. So I think there are things that we control, and then there are the macroeconomic trends. And there will be people who will be, as Badri mentioned, innovating on the finance side.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: When you said temporary here and demand being down -- just to clarify that super quickly, I know you only guide one quarter forward. I'm just trying to understand how temporary?
Badri Kothandaraman: What we said is in California, the point of sales, which is sell-through data can show as much decline because in California, the installers have their hands full with NEM 2.0 installations for the next three to four months. And now in this time, which is when the originations are happening for NEM 3.0, this is the time where we are working with those installers and helping them understand and pitch the value of NEM 3.0 to homeowners. So that's in California. Outside California, the situation is purely dominated by high interest rate environment. So there, we are talking about installers, first of all, getting used to working with reduced cash flow, number one; innovation on loans, which is they need to start selling high APR loans with lesser dealer fee, lease -- people offering leases to long tail installers, those innovations will -- we expect those innovations to start to come. But like what I told you, the demand will get unleashed to its original levels when the interest rates come back to normal. But until then, we expect the sell-through in non-California states to incrementally improve as installers get used to the situation. That's what we said.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Excellent. Thank you, guys.
Operator: Our next question comes from Pavel Molchanov from Raymond James. Please go ahead with your question.
Pavel Molchanov: Thanks for taking the question. Just one for me. In the 10-Q, you broke out revenue between products and services, and this may have been the first time you're doing that. Should we look at that $24 million service line as essentially the software slice of the revenue mix, or does that signify something else?
Badri Kothandaraman: We'll give you more color on those basically, maybe in the -- after call. We wanted to break down, yes, some of the software acquisitions. We have done a few acquisitions on the installer platform. We have done a few on the EV charging side as well. Yeah, just to remind you, we have -- starting with the front end lead generation, we acquired a company called SolarLeadFactory that basically helps in providing leads to installers. And with that company, we are able to at least understand a little bit the origination side of things. And the name of the game for us there is to -- lead quality is a very big pain point for the industry. The statistics on leads are pretty bad, which is of every 100 leads that are sold, only two leads or three leads go and become a contract. So we would like to change that by software, by making sure that, that experience on lead management is done right. To take that 2% or 3% number to a 10% number. So that's the first acquisition. The second acquisition is Solargraf. Solargraf is design and proposal. Design and proposal means you have a home energy management system. That consists of solar storage, EV charger and especially as the tariffs get complex, it becomes difficult for anybody to estimate your savings. So it is vital that there is software that basically estimates what a homeowner can save and provide him most accurate payback calculations depending on its consumption. So that's Solargraf, and that is now helping us a lot. 1,000 installers are using it with NEM 3.0, it is helping us to sell the NEM 3.0 more clearly to our installers and show them the value of a solar plus storage system. So that's the second one that we bought. That's Solargraf design and proposal software. The third one is permitting services. Installers have to submit a lot of paper work in order to submit to the local AHJ. Our thought is making that process entirely seamless through software, and it should not take more than an hour. After they submit us, meaning it should take a maximum of an hour, and there should be no -- there should be manual checks, but nothing manual about it. So we are taking that acquisition, and we are driving it to fully automated permit plans at creation. That's number three. On the platform side, we already do the monitoring. We already have commissioning, app, et cetera. So that's ongoing. I'm not going to talk about that. The last bit is basically O&M. O&M is operations and maintenance. Here, I mean, the term is kind of a misnomer. But this company, we bought 365 Pronto. They basically have a marketplace -- once again, software company. One end of the marketplace are customers who want to do an O&M, who want an O&M job to be done. The other one -- the other side of the marketplace are service technicians or installers who are capable of doing that job. So that is maybe 300-plus installers logging in on the other side, and there is people submitting O&M jobs. And we try to match the two. And once again, it is a software play and can be effective for a lot of jobs like, for example, replacing a main panel, like installing your EV charger. There was a drive to cellular modems, 3G going away and 4G coming in, jobs like that, which the installers really don't have an extended crew, 365 Pronto is their extended group. They come in, they basically pay us a service charge and they get their jobs done. So a lot of companies there. That's our digital platform. All of them are catered towards servicing our installers, to make installers' lives easier. So we'll work with you to explain it a little better.
Pavel Molchanov: Very useful context. Appreciate that.
Badri Kothandaraman: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jeff Osborne from TD Cowen. Please go ahead with your question.
Jeff Osborne: Hey, Badri, thanks for squeezing me in. Just two quick ones. On the -- given the channel inventory somewhat normalized, I imagine your lead times are down. I was just curious what level of visibility you folks are getting from the distributors and if that's changed?
Badri Kothandaraman: Well, yeah, as you can imagine, in good times, we will have nine-month visibility. In bad times, we will have approximately three-month visibility. Those are the ranges.
Jeff Osborne: Got it. And I think in the prior several earnings calls, you had talked about being booked above the high end of guidance in response to, I think, Josh's question, I forget who it was that asked. But is that not the case anymore?
Badri Kothandaraman: No. I mean I'm not saying that, but we have to be sensitive to installers. We -- even though our orders are non-cancelable, for that quarter, the installer situation, considering their cash situation is important, so we might accommodate push out requests, et cetera. So that's why even if we are fully booked, I don't -- I didn't -- I answered his question that way.
Jeff Osborne: Got it. Thank you. That’s all I have.
Operator: Our next question comes from Sophie Karp from KeyBanc. Please go ahead with your question.
Sophie Karp: Hi. Thank you for taking my questions. So I wanted to ask you about California versus the rest of the country where the challenges are distinctly different and this seems like in California it's a transition to NEM and the rest of the country is more interest rates and diversity security rates equation. So if you were to speculate about where you're going to see the most meaningful improvement as it relates to your business in the second half of the year, would that driver be the rest of the country, or California adjusting to the new NEM regime that is going to pull you forward a little bit? Thank you.
Badri Kothandaraman: A hard question for me to answer. I expect the rest of the country to get incrementally better as we go. I do expect -- I do see NEM 3.0, I do see that there is a simple, clear value proposition. I do see California having very high utility rates, I do see a clear payback of six to eight years with solar plus storage. So, -- but I also do see a time -- it will take us some time, maybe not much, to train installers in order to sell NEM 3.0. So, I'm optimistic on both fronts, actually.
Sophie Karp: Okay. And then if I may, on the battery, like the third-generation battery, would you -- was it fair to say that this is going to be the main product for California market at this point? Are you still training installers to use the current generation of the battery? Just kind of curious how you think about this, like double transitioning, if you will, right, the new NEM regime and the new battery that like -- or just start training them on the new generation of battery because it's a high-value proposition product, or how should we think about the timing of this?
Badri Kothandaraman: Right. Both batteries are equally good in terms of quality, in terms of commissioning now, in terms of performance. The nice thing about the Generation 3 is the double -- the continuous power. What happens because of that, it allows you to export the same amount of energy in half the time. And therefore, when you have -- for example, when you have one particular hour in California, where your rates are going to be high, you maximize it with our battery. So, yes, to answer the question, over the long-term, I would expect this battery with a high charging rate to uniquely help California.
Sophie Karp: Okay. Thank you.
Badri Kothandaraman: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Biju Perincheril from Susquehanna. Please go ahead with your question.
Biju Perincheril: Thanks. Thanks for taking my question. Badri, you have some internal sort of top of the funnel indicators from the software platform that you just went through. And can you sort of talk about the trends that you're seeing from there as far as installer demand is concerned?
Badri Kothandaraman: Yes, I mean we usually talk about them if they are meaningful enough. Right now, our solar graft platform, it is over 1,000 installers. We'll break out a lot more trends as we go through the year. But it's safe to say that, that platform showed -- I'm not sure how statistically representative that is, but that platform did show the originations in California for Q1 were quite high. It also showed that the originations outside California in Q1 was a little better than Q4.
Operator: And ladies and gentlemen, with that, we'll be concluding today's question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference call back over to Badri Kothandaraman for any closing remarks.
Badri Kothandaraman: Thank you for joining us today and for your continued support of Enphase. We look forward to speaking with you again next quarter. Bye.
Operator: And ladies and gentlemen, with that, we'll conclude today's conference call and presentation. We thank you for joining today's conference call. You may now disconnect your lines.

===== 2022 Q4  (2023-02-07 16:30:00) =====
Operator: Good afternoon and welcome to the Enphase Energy Fourth Quarter 2022 Financial Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please note today’s event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Karen Sagot. Please go ahead.
Karen Sagot: Good afternoon and thank you for joining us on today’s conference call to discuss Enphase Energy’s fourth quarter 2022 results. On today’s call are Badri Kothandaraman, our President and Chief Executive Officer; Mandy Yang, our Chief Financial Officer; and Raghu Belur, our Chief Products Officer. After the market closed today, Enphase issued a press release announcing the results for its fourth quarter ended December 31, 2022. During this conference call, Enphase management will make forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, statements related to our expected future financial performance, the capabilities of our technology and products and the benefits to homeowners and installers our operations, including manufacturing, customer service and supply and demand, anticipated growth in existing and new markets, the timing of new product introductions and regulatory matters. These forward-looking statements involve significant risks and uncertainties and our actual results and the timing of events could differ materially from these expectations. For a more complete discussion of the risks and uncertainties, please see our most recent Form 10-K and 10-Qs filed with the SEC. We caution you not to place any undue reliance on forward-looking statements and undertake no duty or obligation to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future events or changes in expectations. Also, please note that financial measures used on this call are expressed on a non-GAAP basis unless otherwise noted and have been adjusted to exclude certain charges. We have provided a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures in our earnings release furnished with the SEC on Form 8-K and which can also be found in the Investor Relations section of our website. Now, I’d like to introduce Badri Kothandaraman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Enphase Energy. Badri?
Badri Kothandaraman: Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today to discuss our fourth quarter 2022 financial results. We had a good quarter. We reported record quarterly revenue of $724.7 million, shipped approximately 4.9 million microinverters and 122-megawatt hours of batteries and generated free cash flow of $237.3 million. Approximately 55% of our Q4 microinverter shipments were IQ8. We exited the fourth quarter at 44% gross margin, 12% operating expenses and 32% operating income, all as a percentage of revenue on a non-GAAP basis. Mandy will go into our financials later in the call. Let’s now discuss how we are servicing customers. Our Q4 net promoter score worldwide was 71% compared to 70% in Q3. Our North American net promoter score was 74% compared to 71% in Q3. Our average call rate time was quite down to 1.6 minutes compared to 4.8 minutes in Q3. We started our teams well, focused on root cause, fixes of customer issues and improved our business processes. Let’s talk about microinverter manufacturing. Our overall supply environment remains quite stable in general. There are issues that crop up from time-to-time. Our teams are staying on top of them. Our quarterly capacity was 5 million microinverters exiting Q4. We are on track to begin manufacturing at Flex Romania starting this quarter, enabling us to service Europe better. This will enable a total quarterly capacity of 6 million microinverters exiting Q1. We are going to increase this capacity even more with U.S. manufacturing. Let’s cover that now. As we discussed last quarter, we are pleased that the IRA will help bring back high-tech manufacturing to the U.S. and stimulate the economy through the creation of jobs. We are excited to service the U.S. customers better with local manufacturing. We plan to begin U.S. manufacturing of our microinverters in the second quarter of 2023 with a new contract manufacturing partner and in the second half of 2023 with our two existing contract manufacturing partners. We plan to open 6 manufacturing lines by the end of this year adding a quarterly capacity of 4.5 million microinverters, bringing our total quarterly capacity to more than 10 million microinverters as we exit 2023. We continue to await the details of IRA implementation from the U.S. Department of Treasury. Let’s cover the regions. Our U.S. and international revenue mix for Q4 was 71% and 29% respectively. In the U.S., our revenue increased 15% sequentially and 59% year-on-year. We had record quarterly revenue, record quarterly sell-through for our microinverters and record quarterly installer count in the fourth quarter. Our microinverter channel inventory was quite healthy at the end of the fourth quarter, while our storage channel inventory was a little elevated. I will go into more details about our batteries later in the call. In Europe, our revenue increased 21% sequentially and more than 130% year-on-year, led by strong demand in Netherlands, France, Germany, Belgium, Spain, Portugal and the UK. We had record sell-through and record installer count in Q4 as we continue to grow our business. We started shipping our IQ8 microinverters into Netherlands and France in Q4. We are working hard to introduce IQ8 into other European countries shortly. Also, we are currently shipping IQ batteries into Germany and Belgium. We expect to start shipping IQ batteries into Austria, France, Netherlands and Spain in the first half of this year. Our GreenCom Networks acquisition, which closed in the fourth quarter helps to integrate Enphase microinverters and batteries with third-party EV chargers and heat pumps, enabling homeowners to control their devices from one app, which is the Enphase App. We are integrating the GreenCom offering with the Enphase ecosystem and expect to make it available to our European installers shortly. Now I will provide some color on Latin America, Australia and Brazil. In Latin America, our revenue doubled year-on-year. We had steady growth in our solar plus storage business in Puerto Rico during 2020. In Australia, the solar market continued to recover in Q4 after a weak first half of the year. We expect to introduce IQ batteries in Australia, along with IQ8 microinverters in the second quarter of ‘23. As for Brazil, we experienced significant quarter-over-quarter revenue growth as we saw increased deployment of our IQ7 family of microinverters. The residential solar market in Brazil continues to grow rapidly. We have a very strong team in place. And we are excited about our future growth in the country. The emerging residential markets in Brazil, Mexico, Spain and India are all moving to high-wattage panels. In order to service them better, we plan to introduce a high-power 480 watt AC microinverter in the second quarter. Let’s discuss our overall company outlook for Q1. We expect our Q1 revenue for the company to be within a range of $700 million to $740 million. We are fully booked for Q1 right now. Let me provide some additional information on the key regions, first about Europe, then about the U.S. Our Europe business is doing very – is very strong as I noted. Note that we also doubled our revenue from 2020 to 2021 and more than doubled again from ‘21 to ‘22. We have a strong team in place and are quite bullish about 2023. We expect to introduce IQ batteries and IQ8 microinverters into many more countries in Europe as we progress through the year. Our value proposition is our differentiated home energy management systems, combined with high quality and great customer experience. As for Q1, we expect healthy growth compared to Q4, consistent with the overall growth in the European market. Let’s now cover the U.S. We expect our U.S. business to be slightly down in Q1 compared to Q4, primarily driven by seasonality and the macroeconomic environment. We are seeing that our distributor and installer partners are a little more cautious in booking orders. We normally have a 6-month order visibility and that has been somewhat reduced as our partners watch their spending closely. On the sell-through of our microinverters, while December was quite strong for us we saw a more pronounced seasonality in January than normal. There are a couple of interesting observations I thought I will share with you. Even with the pronounced seasonality and sell-through in January, we would like to point out that our activations are holding up. The second point to also note is that in conversations with our installers and distributor partners, they have started to see originations pickup in January when compared to December. Although the data we have is limited, these two points make us cautiously optimistic about Q2. We have also seen some analyst reports about a possible shift from loans to PPA due to the high prevailing interest rates. We work with thousands of installers every quarter. Our installer base is very diverse, both small and large installers that offer cash, loans and PPA options to homeowners. Any shift from one type of financing to another only has a minor impact to our business, almost negligible. No matter what the conditions are, our approach at Enphase does not change. We manage for the long-term. The basic thesis ongoing solar and storage remains intact, aided by a few factors: first, the utility rates, which are rising in many states across the U.S.; second, the 30% ITC tax credit, which has been extended for 10 years with the IRA; and third, the desire for energy independence and tackling climate change. At Enphase, we will continue to make best-in-class home energy systems with a laser focus on product innovation, quality and customer experience. Let’s switch to talking about battery. We shipped 122-megawatt hours of IQ batteries in Q4. We have now certified approximately 2,300 installers worldwide since the introduction of IQ batteries into North America, Germany and Belgium. Our installers in North America experienced a median commissioning time of 91 minutes exiting Q4 compared to 118 in Q3. We made significant software changes to improve communication, grid transitions and commissioning time, and I am quite happy with the performance of the team. As a result, we saw slightly higher sell-through of our batteries in Q4 versus Q3. We have also got a number of feedbacks from the installers about the fact of improved performance in terms of commissioning. We plan to ship 100 to 120-megawatt hours of IQ batteries in Q1. We also expect to start ramping our third generation IQ battery in North America and Australia in the second quarter. This battery has got 5-kilowatt hour modularity, 2x the power compared to our existing battery and 30-minute commissioning time in addition to being easier to install and service. We expect the higher charge discharge rate as well as the 5-kilowatt hour modularity to be uniquely beneficial to the homeowners under the upcoming NEM 3.0 tariff in California. With the significant changes we are making to our IQ batteries, we are confident that storage installations will become as efficient as microinverters. And as a result, the profitability for installers should get better. We expect our battery business to perform well in the second half of the year, both due to our third generation battery as well as NEM 3.0 adoption in California. Let’s now talk about our product for the small commercial solar market in the U.S. We are on track to pilot the IQ8P product and release it to production in the second half of the year. As our panel power continues to increase rapidly, we are increasing the power of the microinverter by 50% from 320 watts to 480 watts AC while sticking to the single panel architecture. This product as well as the 480 watt residential microinverter for emerging markets share the same design. Let’s discuss EV chargers. We shipped approximately 7,600 EV chargers in Q4 as compared to 6,370 charges in Q3. We began manufacturing Enphase branded EV chargers at our contract manufacturing facility in Mexico this quarter, helping us to increase capacity and reduce costs. We expect to introduce IQ smart EV chargers to customers in the U.S. in the second quarter. These chargers will provide connectivity and control, enabling use cases like green charging and allow homeowners visibility into the operation of their Enphase solar plus storage plus EV charger system through the app. We recently demonstrated our bidirectional EV charger technology combining vehicle-to-home, vehicle to grid and green charging functionality. This new bidirectional EV charger, along with Enphase’s solar and battery storage can all be controlled from the Enphase app, empowering homeowners to make use, safe and sell their own power. We are working with standards organization, EV manufacturers and regulators to bring this technology to market in 2024. Let me give you a quick update on our Enphase Installer Network, or EIN. We have now onboarded more than 1,300 installers to our EIN worldwide through a highly selective process focused on installed quality and exceptional experience to homeowners across the globe. Let’s discuss the installer platform. We made several updates to the Solargraf design and proposal software during the fourth quarter, incorporating battery design and proposal, document management, consumption modeling and several other improvements as requested by our installer partners. In addition, we made significant strides in automating the creation of permit plan sets with Solargraf software. We now have over 1,000 installers using Solargraf software. Next, I’d like to comment on NEM 3.0 in California. The CPUC has finalized its decision on NEM 3.0 in Q4. While we wish the export rates had been stepped down a little more gradually, the policy is generally in the right direction for incentivizing homeowners to adopt storage. The next step is for installers to educate homeowners to increase adoption of NEM 3.0 and companies like Enphase need to help in making this transition possible. That’s where Solargraf’s design and proposal engine comes in. Installers will be able to use Solargraf to provide homeowners with a proposal that optimizes their bills under NEM 3.0 tariff to minimize payback and maximize ROI. The advantage with Solargraf is that the underlying algorithm used by [indiscernible] will be the same as what is used in the actual operation of the Enphase home energy system. As the system complexity increases with solar, batteries, EV chargers and dynamic rate structures such as NEM 3.0, the tight coupling of Solargraf and actual product operation will maximize value to homeowners. In summary, we are quite pleased with our performance. As a reminder, our strategy is to build best-in-class home energy systems and deliver them to homeowners through our installer and distributor partners, enabled by the installer platform. We have many new products that are coming out in 2023 that will increase our served available market and positively contribute to the top line. We look forward to introducing IQ8 microinverters worldwide, introducing IQ batteries into more countries in Europe, launching our third generation battery in North America and Australia as well as introducing our highest power 480-watt IQ8P microinverter for both the U.S. small commercial and emerging residential markets. We are also excited about the upcoming Solargraf functionality, especially the NEM 3.0 functionality and finally, the work we are doing to bring both smart EV chargers as well as bidirectional EV charging capabilities to the market. With that, I will now turn the call to Mandy for a review of our financials. Mandy?
Mandy Yang: Thanks, Badri and good afternoon, everyone. I will provide more details related to our fourth quarter of 2022 financial results as well as our business outlook for the first quarter of 2023. We have provided reconciliations of these non-GAAP to GAAP financial measures in our earnings release posted today, which can also be found in the IR section of our website. Total revenue for Q4 was $724.7 million, representing an increase of 14% sequentially and a quarterly record. We shipped approximately 1,952.4 megawatts DC of microinverters and 122.1 megawatt hours of IQ batteries in the quarter. Non-GAAP gross margin for Q4 was 43.8% compared to 42.9% in Q3. The increase was driven by a favorable IQ8 product mix. GAAP gross margin was 42.9% for Q4. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $87.7 million for Q4 compared to $78.6 million for Q3. The increase was driven by international growth, customer service and R&D. GAAP operating expenses were $153.7 million for Q4 compared to $132.5 million for Q3. GAAP operating expenses for Q4 included $59.4 million of stock-based compensation expenses and $4.9 million of acquisition-related expenses and amortization for acquired intangible assets and $1.8 million of restructuring and asset impairment charges. On a non-GAAP basis, income from operations for Q4 was $229.4 million compared to $194 million for Q3. On a GAAP basis, income from operations was $157 million for Q4 compared to $135.4 million for Q3. On a non-GAAP basis, net income for Q4 was $212.4 million compared to $175.5 million for Q3. This resulted in non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.51 for Q4 compared to $1.25 for Q3. GAAP net income for Q4 was $153.8 million compared to GAAP net income of $114.8 million for Q3. This resulted in GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.06 for Q4 compared to $0.80 for Q3. We exited Q4 with a total cash, cash equivalent and marketable securities balance of $1.61 billion compared to $1.42 billion at the end of Q3. In Q4, we generated $253.7 million in cash flow from operations and $237.3 million in free cash flow. Capital expenditure was $16.4 million for Q4 compared to $8.9 million for Q3. The increase was primarily due to investment in additional contract manufacturing sites and R&D equipment. Capital expenditure for the full year of 2022 was $46.4 million. Now, let’s discuss our outlook for the first quarter of 2023. We expect our revenue for the first quarter of 2023 to be within the range of $700 million to $740 million, which includes shipments of 100 to 120-megawatt hours of IQ batteries. We expect GAAP gross margin to be within the range of 40% to 43% and non-GAAP gross margin to be within the range of 41% to 44%, which excludes stock-based compensation expenses and acquisition-related amortization. We assume a conservative euro FX rate in our Q1 guidance, and we don’t expect significant impact to our financials from fluctuations in FX rates. We setup our GAAP operating expenses to be within the range of $177 million to $181 million, including approximately $77 million estimated for stock-based compensation expenses, restructuring charges for site consolidation, acquisition-related expenses and amortization. We expect our non-GAAP operating expenses to be within a range of $100 million to $104 million. Moving to tax. Since we have utilized most of our net operating loss and research tax credit carry-forwards in 2022, we announced a significant U.S. cash taxpayer. We expect GAAP and non-GAAP annualized effective tax rate for 2023 to be at 22% plus or minus 2% before any IRA impact. In closing, we are pleased with our 2022 financial performance. We grew our revenue by 59% year-over-year, while spending on non-GAAP gross margin to 42.6% in 2022. We increased non-GAAP diluted earnings per share by 92% to $4.62 per share in 2022 and generated record free cash flow of $698.4 million more than double from 2021. With that, I will now open the line for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Colin Rusch of Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.
Colin Rusch: Thanks so much, guys. I appreciate all the detail here. Can you talk about what your – how your pricing strategy is evolving here as you move into different configurations for the devices, and you continue to try to monetize the value here. Are there areas where you can increase price a little bit? Are you trying to hold it flat? Just talk to us about how that’s evolving here.
Badri Kothandaraman: Yes. The pricing in general right now is very stable. We do value-based pricing. We look at pricing versus the next best alternative. And we usually look at what value do we add in compared to that alternative. And typically, the things we focus on for microinverters are how is our quality compared to competition with our customer experience compared to competition. How is our ease of use compared to competition is the product a lot more easier to install and that matters to the installers and they – once they install, they do not want to come back to that site again. So they need excellent support. So if we look at all of these puts and takes, and we look at it versus the next best alternative. We price our products. We are extremely disciplined. There we also have a segmentation strategy, which means that we look at different flavors of power, and we price it according to the value those provide. In batteries, our strategy has been similar with the first two products in our generation, first generation and second-generation batteries, we fell a little bit short in terms of the differentiating features. And now with the third generation, I think we are going to be quite unique. We have modularity of 5-kilowatt hours, we will have double the power compared to the prior generation, which means a 5-kilowatt hour battery will have 3.84 kilowatts of continuous power and 7.68 kilowatts of peak power, which is amazing power. And then in addition, that’s going to have 30 minutes commissioning time, the thing that we didn’t get right on the first two generations. So with batteries, we are back into the value space, again, and we will price those products accordingly. So the short answer to your question, pricing is quite stable now.
Colin Rusch: Okay. Excellent. And then as you look at making a bigger push into the commercial rooftop market, can you talk a little bit about the preparation in the channel in terms of education and training on the product, what you’re seeing already in terms of sell-through with some of the legacy products as you prepare to really get into full swing by the middle or latter part of the year?
Badri Kothandaraman: Right. This product, we had originally 3 years ago, we started with introducing the IQ8D product. And that at that time was a good idea. It was 640-watt AC. And that microinverter covered two panels. And we got excited by that. We’ve worked on it. And that product, it took us some time to work on it because not only we had to get the microinverter right, we had to get the entire chain right, which is the microinverter performance, the gateway performance, most important, the software performance. And then we needed a proper design and proposal inject light Solargraf. So it took us quite a bit of time. And then we realized a few months ago that, yes, we can come with that product, we can release that product out, but that product is going to fall short in terms of power because the panel power in the commercial business has moved to, let’s say, greater than 500 watts. So, two panels will be 1,000 watts. 1,000 over 640 is a DCA ratio of more than 1.5. 1.5 is not acceptable in this business. The right number is between 1.2 and 1.25. So then we regrouped, we told the installers we are going to make a quick change, going back to the single panel, single micro architecture, we are increasing the power, leveraging what we did on the IQ8D. So it was not lost. We increased – we used that architecture and we basically are introducing now a product that is a 480-watt AC product. And that will take care up to 650 watts of panel power. So – and also accompanied by that product, we need the entire platform. What I talk about in the installer platform, which is starting from lead generation qualification because this is a design win business. It’s not like the residential business. There is some cycle time. You have to capture opportunities properly. You spend a lot of time in understanding analyzing the ROI, the tools need to be excellent for that. And then you need help the installers through the entire process. And so I think we are finally almost ready that we are looking to introduce – beat our test with the installers in the second quarter using the entire flow. Then we are planning to release to release it start ramping in the third quarter. And it’s going to take us a few quarters to ramp because like what I said, this is not like the residential business. It’s a design win business. And so we have to work with customers for an extended period of time and then convince them of the value proposition, and we will start winning. But our basic piece is there is the same. Product innovation great quality and support customers well, which is customer experience.
Colin Rusch: Great. Thanks so much, guys.
Badri Kothandaraman: Thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from Philip Shen of ROTH Capital Partners. Please go ahead.
Philip Shen: Hi, everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. Congrats on the strong Q4 and Q1. Badri, one thing that I noted in your prepared remarks was that you talked about how some of your customers are experiencing more caution or they are a little bit more cautious in booking orders. Normally, you have a 6-month order visibility, and that has been somewhat reduced as your partners watch their spending closely. Can you expand on that a little bit and help us understand when do you expect to get back to your 6-month visibility? You talked about originations improving in January. But based on some of the conversations we’re having in the industry, it seems like there is a fair amount of tumult and challenge out there with trade credit being pulled back and some bankruptcies and just some challenges out there. So how do you expect to navigate that overall and perhaps share gain is one source of strength. But just wanted to understand, as we look through the rest of the year beyond Q1, how do you expect the year to develop. Thanks.
Badri Kothandaraman: Yes. I mean, look, seasonality has always existed in the solar industry from Q4 to Q1. And historically, I would say that, that seasonality is a 15% number. That means, in general, the sell-through in Q1 is usually 15% down compared to the sell-through in Q4. Now right now, and I’m giving you a lot of data from January, and that’s the data we have. Our Q4 was very strong, including December. January, we start to experience a little more than 15%. That’s why I said more pronounced seasonality. And of course, we think it is due to the macroeconomic environment, but what we saw interestingly was the activations remain the same. I mean approximately and they were a little bit down they didn’t have that much of a seasonality. So that basically was somewhat good because the customer demand at least whatever we saw was – I mean, did not get that much affected. But having said that, I think the installers are quite cautious. Therefore, they basically are only buying what they need from their distributors, which is a stark difference from 2022, where they were focused on supply. They were focused on maximizing what they had in their warehouse. Now is that they are worried about their spending, they are worried about their OpEx, they are worried about their cash flow. Therefore, they are going to make sure they do exactly what is required. So that’s why I think – and I don’t have a crystal ball. I cannot be sure. That’s why I think we are seeing some customers who used to book 6, 9 months ahead, now will not book so much ahead. They will be a little more conservative. And regarding your question on more – that the originations, whether they are improving or not, this is the data. We work with thousands of installers. We have a very strong sample set. We talked to a lot of distributors. Some of our distributors service hundreds of long tail installers. So we don’t see originations ourselves. We only – what I reported to you is anecdotal information. But we hear that originations and especially originations in California are back to being strong in January. That’s what we hear. And I think that is – that’s why I said that – plus the fact that we are not seeing that much of a link in activation points me to cautiously optimistic Q2 versus Q1.
Philip Shen: Okay. Great. Thanks, Badri. Shifting gears to the IRA historical, I think on the last call, you were talking about the ability to get the majority of that credit. I was wondering if you could comment on the latest you see in terms of the microinverter credits? Do you expect to get the vast majority of that? And then in terms of the timing of the Section 45X or manufacturing PTC guidelines, some of our checks suggest this could be released much later than originally expected maybe a year later. Just curious if that impacts your plans at all? And if you can talk about CapEx required for the facilities and factories, that would be great. Thanks.
Badri Kothandaraman: Yes. So I’ll answer the question in reverse. CapEx required, basically, an auto line is roughly 750,000 units and auto line cost is including tax, etcetera, anywhere from $8 million to $10 million per line. So if we have to do six lines, that’s anywhere close to $60 million – $50 million to $60 million. So that’s the CapEx spending. Now to answer your question, do we expect to get the vast majority. Yes, we do. And then does the announcement of the treasury indication change our plans, no, it does not. We are going to start manufacturing in the second quarter. And we are going to ramp up a couple of lines with a new contract manufacturer in the second quarter. And then we are going to start the remaining lines. So totally, we will have six manufacturing lines by the end of 2023 with three contract manufacturing partners.
Philip Shen: Great. Thanks very much for color, Badri. I will pass it on.
Badri Kothandaraman: Thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from Brian Lee of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Brian Lee: Hey, guys. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the questions. Kudos on the solid execution. First question I had was just around NEM 3.0. I think there is different implications of that policy uncertainty near term and medium term from what we’re hearing. So maybe just wanted to get your thoughts near-term, some views out there that maybe there is a pull forward on demand in California would be curious what you’re seeing with respect to that? And then kind of in the medium term, we’re hearing the industry is still maybe trying to figure out how to navigate this. So curious how you specifically are thinking about the second half of 2023 in the U.S. you kind of base case in California to be down significantly? And then how do you see yourself navigating that, if that’s the case? Are you driving more product to other states, focusing more in Europe? Just curious just how you’d be thinking about planning into that period of higher policy uncertainty in the back half? And then I had a follow-up.
Badri Kothandaraman: Yes. On NEM 3.0, we aren’t really seeing any pull forward right now. But in talks with few installers in California, both big and small, like what I said, the originations are up strongly. They are all quite optimistic. And maybe we will see something soon that’s why I talked about an optimistic Q2. But so far, we haven’t seen any pull forward demand yet. Now on talking about NEM 3.0 in general. NEM 3.0 is going to be incredibly positive for us. Because NEM 3.0, I mean, just so everybody gets it, I’ll talk about NEM 3.0, the features of NEM 3.0. Basically, the – previously, the import and export rates were the same. So therefore, when you exported electrons with the solar system didn’t really matter. As long as you exported, it got directly subtracted from what your input. That’s why it’s called net metering, and that was net metering 2.0. With NEM 3.0, it matters when you export these electrons. So you have 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. So basically, 8,760 data points, and there is an export rate for each of those data points. Each of those hours, there is an export rate. And – but what it works out to be is if you are interested in a pure solar system, your payback dropped understandably from, let’s say, 5 years, it increases actually to something like 7 or 7.5 years with the pure solar system. But the moment you add batteries, you can add batteries in steps of 5-kilowatt hour, 10-kilowatt hour, 15-kilowatt hour, the moment you add batteries, that payback comes right back in to that 5 to 6-year time, to that 5 to 6-year period. That is the stock difference with NEM 2.0. With NEM 2.0, the grid was the battery. Batteries didn’t have an ROI because batteries were primarily for resilience only. With NEM 3.0, batteries are going to be financially attractive. But it is complex. NEM 3.0 is definitely complex. So the installers need to demystify it for the homeowners. And that’s where an engine like solar draft and other engines come in, where if we are able to show this to the homeowner, we think it is a no-brainer. The homeowner will always pick solar plus storage. Now to add some more variance to it, Germany, for example, if you look at Germany, this is exactly what happened. They call it as a feed-in tariff where – so that is not 8,760 different rates for those hours, but they have one rate, which is a much reduced rate. And therefore, self-consumption becomes the norm in Germany. No one thinks about exporting solar, right? And that have an 80% attach there. This is going in the same direction, going in the same direction. In Germany, you have grid-tied batteries because power doesn’t go out there much. It goes out maybe once a year. We have grid tied battery. Grid tied batteries means you – the installation is simpler, and it is cheaper. I’m not sure whether California will go in that direction. Time will tell because we do have some color. We do have resilience issues as well. But I am sure markets will evolve a little in that direction, too. So bottom line, we are incredibly optimistic. We got the right batteries for it with the third-generation battery. We got the modularity, which I think will start becoming popular. Grid tied may become popular, but we will be ready to do either grid tied or off grid, on grid with backup. The things that are looking, we like NEM 3.0. Of course, we didn’t like the fact the step down happened right away. But I think in the long-term, it’s an okay decision.
Raghu Belur: One more – I will make one more comment to what Badri said. Obviously, the battery is the third generation of our battery is uniquely valuable for – in this NEM 3 environment. But in addition, it’s also the optimization engine that we will be running, right. The engine has to in near real time, every hour make a decision on whether it is charging the battery, discharging the battery, managing the load, etcetera. All of that energy management engine becomes extremely valuable and extremely critical. It all begins with the design engine itself. What we have mentioned this, as Badri mentioned it in his script, that design engine, the engine that you run in order to design the system is actually the same engine that you run to actually operate the system. And so bringing those two pieces together is extremely critical and extremely valuable. And that’s what we are spending a lot of time optimizing our engine and building up the design as well as the operation. And that it starts with the battery and it – that software is becoming extremely critical.
Brian Lee: Yes. No, I appreciate the color. Maybe two quick follow-ups. So, the long-term thesis I get, I guess on a shorter to medium-term basis, as you mentioned, Badri, the change is immediate and the industry is still trying to figure it out. So, are you – I guess what are you hearing from installers? Are they ready to convert customers, up-sell customers to batteries starting as early as the second half, or are we going to have pretty meaningful friction here until the market figures out the new rules and I guess some of the macro uncertainty, which you even alluded to earlier kind of settles out. And then secondly, if I just look at your numbers, battery volumes for your shipment guidance in Q1 will be down year-on-year for the first time since you guys started breaking that out. So, batteries all of a sudden don’t look like they are growing for you. What should we be thinking about for the next few quarters into the back half? Like does NEM 3.0 drive growth again, or is this a sort of more uncertain period of battery growth at least in the next couple of quarters until, again, the market kind of figures it out.
Badri Kothandaraman: We think you should think that NEM 3.0 is going to be great for us. We are going to be growing with – along with NEM 3.0, we are going to be growing. In addition, we are going to be growing outside California too, because I am not sure whether you cut the color on what I have said, the – we are working on the battery transition right now. The second-generation product is going to give way to the third generation. And we have fixed all of our issues in the field for the most part in terms of commissioning and all of the software performance is all in – is quite stable right now, and we are getting ready for the transition of the third-generation battery. The third-generation battery appointed to you on the benefits power, the 30-minute commissioning time, and modularity. So, we think that starting in the second half of the year, we think NEM 3.0 will be a huge catalyst for this in California. In addition, we expect to also see very healthy growth outside California. Your other question, we talk to a number of installers all the time. We recently talked to a bunch of California installers on exactly this, whether are they ready, and most of them are quite optimistic about increasing their battery attach because for the first time, with the batteries, the payback will be a very good payback between 5 years and 6 years. And I think many installers, of course, are worried about the customers having to shell out a little bit more upfront. But with the ITC, 30% tax credit and with an incredible payback they think the sale will be more easier than what you think. So, we are quite bullish about NEM 3.0 and especially our third-generation battery in that context.
Brian Lee: Alright. That’s great. Best of luck guys. I will pass it on.
Operator: The next question comes from Mark Strouse of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Mark Strouse: Great. Thanks very much for taking our questions. So, a lot of focus on the U.S. markets, but I just wanted to go back to your comments about Europe. So, that’s obviously been very strong in the last couple of years, kind of doubling each year. I know you don’t guide annually, but just kind of how should we think about that market in 2023? Do you think kind of an approximate doubling is kind of the base case that we should be expecting from here?
Badri Kothandaraman: Well, as you said, we do not guide something annually, but European market is growing. At least our internal reports talk about served available solar market of about 13 gigawatts in 2023. The markets to really – the markets that are really driving are Netherlands, Germany, Spain, France, Italy, and even actually Austria, Poland, etcetera. They are all becoming quite significant markets. In addition, attach – battery attach is also growing. Like what I have stated in the prior question – answering the prior question, the attach rate on batteries in Germany is 80%. So, solar plus storage is growing healthily. And the geopolitical situation accelerated it last year, and that’s continuing what do – what’s our position is. We have a very differentiated product. We have microinverters on the roof, which are very high quality, easy to install. We have a huge customer service operation there in France and in Germany, and we take care of customers well. On batteries, we are just starting to ramp. And we have introduced our batteries in two countries, Germany as well as Belgium. We expect to introduce many more countries this year, and that will happen every quarter. And so we expect to add a lot more battery revenue there. And I forgot to mention, IQ8, we will be introducing IQ8 into every country in Germany – I mean every country in Europe shortly. So – and then on top of it, we bought this company called GreenCom Networks. Their job is to network third-party EV chargers and third-party heat pumps to the Enphase solar and storage system, and therefore, homeowners can operate – can optimize their system from one app, can see everything that is happening. So, to answer your question, the market is growing. The market is growing really significantly. That’s what I told you 13 gigawatts, we are well positioned due to our differentiating value proposition, and we recently bought a company, GreenCom Networks that is even going to make that situation better where we provide a complete home energy management system to our installers.
Mark Strouse: Okay. And then maybe, Badri give you a little bit of a break. Mandy, can I ask, I mean, we are all doing the math on the domestic manufacturing tax credits. But I mean is there any color that you can share yet as far as kind of the upside from the tax credit, the potential downside from higher input costs just kind of the blended average, the appropriate way to be thinking about that U.S. manufacturing from here?
Badri Kothandaraman: Yes. I mean net-net, we expect a net benefit of between $20 and $30 a unit. I am giving you a wide range right now because we do have some puts and takes, and we will refine it as we go.
Mark Strouse: Okay. Thank you very much.
Operator: The next question comes from Steve Fleishman of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.
Steve Fleishman: Yes. Thank you. Just you are growing your production capacity, you are doubling it from $5 million a quarter to $10 million. You said, I think by year end of 2023, just could you give us a sense of your conviction that the demand will be there to meet that doubling of production.
Badri Kothandaraman: Yes. Look, if you look at our past growth rates, you can see it, we grew from – we grew, I think, ‘21 to ‘22, we grew 59%. And at that time, I think end of ‘21, we were doing, if I remember right, around 3-ish million units a quarter. End of ‘22, we are now – we just reported 5-ish million units a quarter. So, you can see that that’s the nice growth. So – our long-term thesis on solar is – we are extremely bullish. We – especially with countries like Europe and with a strong position in the U.S. with our rapid entry into other emerging markets. We think it is the right call to basically invest in the right manufacturing, especially given the IRA benefits. So, even if we don’t use all 10 million units per quarter, we will use it sooner or later. And I think the ROI is well worth especially considering the net benefit to us. So, our logic was quite simple. We weren’t worried. We did a few back-of-the-envelope calculations. We thought it is the right thing for us to invest in these lines and fortunately, we have very strong and great contract manufacturing partners who need to do a lot of the heavy lifting, all our capital that we set out is quite limited. They do a lot of the heavy lifting, like what they are doing today, and two of them are existing contract manufacturers. So, we have deep relationships. And we are going to work with them in the long-term. So, we thought that’s the right decision for us to do, and we basically accelerated that effort. And once we make a decision, it takes us a few quarters. In the past, it has taken us four quarters to six quarters to ramp up the likes. So, our thesis is quite bullish on solar, and we think that’s the right call.
Steve Fleishman: Okay. No, that’s – so ultimately, expect obviously, significant volume growth from that. And then on margins, you mentioned, I mean you have had the gross margin held up well, but then the $20 to $30 that you just mentioned, is that a gross margin benefit net of cost?
Badri Kothandaraman: That’s the net – the IRA gives you an incentive, which is $0.11 a unit, $0.11 per AC watt. Now, every microinverter that we make, let’s say, the microinverter that we make 320 AC watts. 320 AC watts multiplied by $0.11, right. So, that number is roughly about $35. So, that $35 is the net benefit. Now, it takes us some incremental cost to manufacture in the U.S. versus manufacturing in Mexico, call that as some delta, right. It also takes us – we want to make sure our contract manufacturing partners are healthy as well. So, therefore, they share a little bit of that incentive. Therefore, the net benefit for us would be that $35 minus the incremental cost adder, minus the benefit we pass on to our contract manufacturing partners, and that number is what I reported as $20 to $30 net benefit per unit. That’s all incremental to what we have today.
Steve Fleishman: Great. I will leave it there. Thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from Jeff Osborne of Cowen & Co. Please go ahead.
Jeff Osborne: Hi. Good afternoon Badri. I have two quick ones. You touched a lot on Europe, but I was wondering if you can specifically drill down on the visibility you have there in terms of Q1 and Q2.
Badri Kothandaraman: Yes. Europe is actually the opposite. We do have good visibility. We do have these strong orders. Partners, our installer partners, distributor partners, they rely on us for supply. A few of them even come to our headquarters quite routinely, that’s something that we are starting to see. And we also visit them quite a bit. So, I think we do have decent visibility there.
Jeff Osborne: Great to hear. And then either for yourself or Mandy, I didn’t know if there is a way of doing sort of a gross margin walk between Q3 and Q4. Certainly, the IQ8 cycle is helping. But wasn’t sure if that’s the complete story, if there is a mix issue in terms of ancillary equipment or softer battery sales that led to the strength in the quarter? And then how do we think about the gross margin walk to get to the high end of the range for next quarter?
Badri Kothandaraman: Yes. It’s mostly about IQ8 mix. The IQ8 mix is 55% in Q4. That means if we – out of the 4.8 million microinverters that we shipped worldwide, 55% are IQ8. So, that’s principally contributing to the gross margin. And that number, the 55% was, how much Mandy in…?
Mandy Yang: It was 47% in Q3.
Badri Kothandaraman: Yes. 47% in Q3. That number, we expect that number to be a little greater than 60% in Q1, that explains the model.
Jeff Osborne: I appreciate that. A very quick follow-up. As IQ8 grows in Europe, is that accretive or dilutive to the results that you just reported?
Badri Kothandaraman: That will be accreted.
Jeff Osborne: Got it. Thank you. That’s all I have.
Operator: The next question comes from Ameet Thakkar of BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Ameet Thakkar: Good afternoon Badri. Thanks for squeezing me in. Just I guess a follow-up on that last line of questioning. But I think you guys have targeted to get to 90% in terms of IQ8 mix by the end of the second quarter, I think you just said 60% is kind of what’s baked in for the first quarter. Are you guys running a little bit behind on that?
Badri Kothandaraman: We are running a little behind, I would say. I would – I am going to – or rather we are going to introduce IQ8 into several countries in Europe in the near-term. So, in Q2, we will probably be at maybe a little lower than 80%. And I think in Q3, we should probably catch up to that 90%.
Ameet Thakkar: Great. Thanks for that. And then I think this time last year when we had this call, and certainly a battery kind of uptake in California will increase, and that might change things. But I think you guys said that like California was roughly 20% of total revenues post the initial NEM 3.0 proposal. I was just wondering if you could kind of give us kind of a refresh on where ‘22 ended up in terms of California as a percent of total revenues.
Badri Kothandaraman: Those numbers are right. Yes. California, the revenue is approximately 20% of our total revenue. That’s correct.
Ameet Thakkar: And it’s still 20% in ‘22?
Badri Kothandaraman: Yes. That’s right.
Ameet Thakkar: Great. Thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith of Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Thank you. Hi. Good afternoon to you. Thanks for the time, appreciate it. Just first off, I wanted to come back to the margin question and talk a little bit more about structural margin expectations. I know we talked about value pricing earlier. Can you elaborate a little bit on where you stand vis-à-vis your margin expectations for the course of this year? You talked about pricing, pricing integrity, maybe there is a little bit of mix here question between storage and the other products here. How do you think about the evolution of margins here through the course of the year, especially as you think about mix? And then also a little bit of a nuance from earlier, if I can follow-up. On utilization, obviously, you are fully utilized today. You think about bringing on that capacity. Is there any margin impact from underutilization as you bring on some of this, given the comments about the backlog dynamic?
Badri Kothandaraman: Right. On the margin question, as we convert more of our mix to IQ8, margins will get incrementally better, and we will take care of it in our margin guide. Like what I have told you, margin is not always about pricing. It is about a lot of focus on costs. And we have an initiative called world-class in the company where we continuously focus on every small, whether it’s a capacitor, whether it’s a resistor, the gate driver, the AC fed, the porting, plastics, the cables, the connectors, we have a large team working on the transformers. We have a large team working on it. And what you see is a combination of good cost reduction efforts, plus good pricing efforts. So, we will – if you had noticed, we improved our non-GAAP gross margin guidance from the prior quarter by 1% because of the IQ8 transition plus the progress we are making on world-class costs. And I have told before that batteries, we are in our second generation, every generation, we will improve costs. And we will not be in a business until we are convinced we can meet that our model, the gross margin, the company operating model. So, on batteries, we are continuously working on it. Our third-generation battery will be better than the second-generation battery. We already have a plan on the fourth-generation battery to reduce energy intensity significantly, so that will be even better. So, it’s a continuous program. And your second…
Raghu Belur: Utilization.
Badri Kothandaraman: Okay. Utilization, utilization is to first order negligible impact. Those are the contracts that we have with our partners.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it. Alright. Great stuff. And then just if you can comment just quickly on just obviously, loan versus lease the evolution, what’s your ability to deviate and press volumes into the lease markets here if you think about it that way versus just helping and enabling your loan customer.
Badri Kothandaraman: We do business with a number of installers who offer leasing. And with some of those we have 100% share. With some of those, we have a healthy share mix. So overall, we are very well positioned. We have a significant shift between loan and lease. I don’t think we will miss a beat.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it. Great confidence. Thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from Eric Stine of Craig-Hallum. Please go ahead.
Eric Stine: Hi, everyone. Thanks for sneaking me in here. So maybe just on the contract manufacturing coming back to the U.S. Obviously, with that, with Romania coming on, it’s about better servicing the customer and lead times. But I am just curious, I mean, is there any margin benefit to that as well, you have been servicing global from Asia and Mexico to this point, any benefit from being closer to the customer?
Badri Kothandaraman: Net-net, it is a wash because if you think about it, it depends upon where the raw materials come from. So if you have manufacturing, for example, in Europe, unless you move all the raw material factories to Europe, to a first order, you will not get that benefit. So basically, you have to look at it as the full chain where your total cost is a function of how you transport the raw materials, then you make the product and then you ship the product to your customers. So in the case of Romania, yes, we are closer to the customers, but you do need to get raw materials to the factory. So I would say it is a wash. It is a wash. It’s not significant enough to talk about, but it will become significant if we are able to do exactly what I said, which is us, if we are large enough and if we are able to convince some of our – some of the suppliers to move factories to open up factories closer to the manufacturing area, definitely, there is some cost to be taken out.
Eric Stine: Any indications that, that is starting to happen. I mean, people come into the U.S. the tax credits and that sort of thing?
Badri Kothandaraman: Yes. As we get bigger and bigger, those will eventually happen. Right now, it is a process. I can’t tell you that it’s an event. It will happen one fine day. But for example, in Mexico, we have started to see that. Some of our suppliers have setup factories for enclosure, for example, or for connectors, they have started to setup. We are realizing some gain there, but it is an evolution.
Eric Stine: Okay, thank you.
Badri Kothandaraman: Thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from Maheep Mandloi of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
Unidentified Analyst: Hey, thanks for squeezing me in. This is David Benjamin on the line for Maheep Mandloi. I was wondering if you could give us a little insight into the mix for Europe in Q1?
Badri Kothandaraman: We basically told you that the revenue mix between U.S. and international is 71% and 29% and most of our international revenue is Europe.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay. And that’s the same for Q1 is – do you think that’s going to be in line for Q1 as well?
Badri Kothandaraman: We don’t usually talk about that mix for Q1, but I think it will be slightly better because Europe is a little strong in Q1 compared to the U.S.
Unidentified Analyst: Great. Thanks. And just a follow-up, on batteries, can you talk a little bit about what you think with the new third generation, if you think – or what do you think the retrofit opportunity is going to look like?
Raghu Belur: This is Raghu. I think retrofit in general, for storage is going to be better than before because if you recall the IRA now has 30% battery ITC, standalone battery ITC, which means that you can be decoupled from solar, you can come in and add battery later on into the system and still get your 30% ITC. And that’s – and for us at Enphase, we have a unique benefit because we are AC coupled we can very easily do that. So if you have an existing system, even if it’s an older generation solar system, you can come in and add an AC coupled battery. And you can add it in modularity of 5 kilowatt hours, you can grow it how many hour system you want to add, you can add it over time. All of those things are possible with our system and get access to the 30% ITC credit. So definitely a benefit for retrofit.
Unidentified Analyst: Great. Thanks very much.
Operator: The next question comes from Kashy Harrison of Piper Sandler.
Kashy Harrison: Good afternoon and thank you for taking the questions. So Badri, in your prepared remarks, you mentioned that distributors – some of your distributors are starting to see a bit of recovery in January. I was just wondering if you could maybe share some details on what those distributors are now seeing in terms of year-on-year growth and maybe how that compares to what they had seen in the prior quarters?
Badri Kothandaraman: No, those are not our data. So we cannot share those. All I said is basically – there are two things, which I said, we are seeing the distributor and installer partners a little more cautious in booking orders. Normally, we have 6-month order visibility and that has been – that is now somewhat reduced as they watch their spending. And then I also talked about the fact that our sell-through, which is what the distributors sell to the installers. Our sell-through was quite strong in December, while we saw a little bit more seasonality than normal in the month of January. On the originations, which I talked about where basically anecdotal data points from the installers that a few of them have seen the originations pickup in January compared to December. We also have our Solargraf design and proposal engine. We also have another company we bought called SolarLeadFactory, which also deals with selling leads to our installer partners. We are also seeing very similar trends that January is better when compared to December. So although the data we have is limited. And so I mentioned that the – this point makes us cautiously optimistic for Q2.
Kashy Harrison: Fair enough. Thanks for the clarification there. And this is my follow-up question. In the event that you’re the only major player that’s able to capture the microinverter credit. Can you speak to your willingness to use the manufacturing credits as a tool to gain market share? In other words, just passing on all those benefits to the customer and just using that to gain share? And that’s’ for me, thank you.
Badri Kothandaraman: Yes. I mean we normally don’t think like that. We think we are quite disciplined. The product must add value and it must add value compared to the next best alternative. That’s the only way for us to win long-term. So this one is an incremental benefit and we have to do a lot of work for that. There is a lot of R&D. There is a lot of work we have to do in reliability in qualifying these factories and having the right operations running there. Of course, I talked about the capital outlay, etcetera. So all of those are we are investing in all of those right now. But we are going to be extremely disciplined. We are not going to use this as an opportunity to lose that discipline in pricing.
Kashy Harrison: Thank you.
Operator: Next question comes from Praneeth Satish of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Praneeth Satish: Thanks. When you look at the U.S. market, I think you mentioned more than the typical 15% seasonal slowdown in January. Can you maybe just unpack whether that’s more concentrated in in states like California? Or is it more evenly distributed across the country?
Badri Kothandaraman: I mean, in California, there is an added complexity due to the due to the weather in the first few weeks of January. So I would say yes, that’s the only difference there. So once the weather is normalized, I think, we are going to find it is equivalent across the states.
Praneeth Satish: Okay. Got it. And then just switching gears, I wanted to ask on the bidirectional charger and what you’re working on there. I guess how much demand do you think there’ll be for this product down the road? I think it’s small now, but down the road? And then when you think about pricing, I mean, how much value do you think you could ascribe to bidirectional charger given all the opportunities that it opens up.
Raghu Belur: Yes. This is Raghu. To begin with, we shouldn’t think about a bidirectional EV charger or something stand-alone by itself. It’s a core part of our energy management system. Energy management system will include, obviously, solar, stationary batteries, bidirectional EV chargers, grid management, etcetera. So it is part of that full solution that we offer. And within that full solution set, energy management piece, the software that’s federating how the energy should flow between all of these resources as well as into the house. So that’s the way we think about it. As far as – on a first principle basis, it would be if you buy an EV, you should buy directionally EV charger. It’s really as simple as that in order to gain the most benefit out of it because should think back, as we said, it does both of those use cases we talked about, which is both vehicle-to-home as well as vehicle to grid, vehicle-to-home means providing resiliency for the home. It’s the resiliency that the IQ8 on the roof provides see that our battery, modular battery system provides the resiliency now added resiliently that the car can also provide. And when it comes to vehicle to grid, this is about the ability to leverage the energy that you have stored in our – store in your car to provide things like grid services on act like a virtual power plant. So I think you bring a lot of value to it by being part of our energy system and really, I would expect that anybody who buys in EV would be naturally motivated to buy the Enphase Energy system, which would include the solar, the battery and the bidirectional EV charger.
Praneeth Satish: Great. Thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from Sophie Karp of KeyBanc. Please go ahead.
Sophie Karp: Hi, thank you for taking my question. A lot of my questions have been answered, maybe just one last one, if I may. So you doubling your capacity and presumably, the U.S. market will be going forward served by the manufacturing capacity in the U.S., right? So is there any risk that these capacity additions in the U.S. cannibalize some of your existing lines outside of the U.S. that current be important here? Or is the international growth that you’re expecting so strong that basically your international capacity will just serve outside of the U.S. demand? Thank you.
Badri Kothandaraman: Yes. I mean, once again, we are – I clarified this actually before. We are very disciplined. We will not – we are working with the same contract manufacturers. So we can see the business in totality with the – we are not going to basically shortchange them on their locations elsewhere. So it has to be carefully done and we have orchestrated the right plans. Fortunately, for us, our business is healthy, ramping up in Europe, Europe, for example, as well as U.S. quite strong usually. And it takes us anyway, four to six quarters to ramp such lines. So what we will do is a careful allocation process to make sure that all of the factories are correctly loaded. That’s what we will do.
Sophie Karp: Thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from Corinne Blanchard of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Corinne Blanchard: Hey. Thank you for taking my question. I just wanted to go back on the 1Q guidance and the range from $700 million to $740 million. How much of the softness have you embedded and incorporated into the 1Q guidance? And then I know you commented a little bit, but maybe if you can give even more color on what to expect in California in February and March? Thank you.
Badri Kothandaraman: Can you please repeat that one, we were not able to hear it properly.
Corinne Blanchard: Sure. I just wanted to get more color on the 1Q guidance in terms of how much of the softness you have incorporated into the guidance and then your view for California market for February and March?
Badri Kothandaraman: Yes. I mean we gave you 700 to 740 number. We told you clearly Europe, it’s growing quite well. We expect it to grow healthily in Q1 compared to Q4. And we also told you that the U.S. business will be slightly down as compared to Q4. So, that’s the color we gave you. As for February and March, I mean I don’t have a crystal ball, but like what I told you, it seems like the originations are starting to improve. So, we are optimistic things will get better.
Corinne Blanchard: Alright. Thank you. That’s it for me.
Badri Kothandaraman: Thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from Pavel Molchanov of Raymond James. Please go ahead.
Pavel Molchanov: Thanks for the question. Two quick ones about Europe. Now that the European Union is talking about this net zero industrial plan, do you envision receiving any credits or other manufacturing subsidies for your operations in Romania?
Raghu Belur: No, we have not heard about that or any – I mean about receiving any additional subsidies for our plant in Romania. However, there is active discussion going on in Europe about something analogous to the IRA that’s being done here. That we are tracking pretty closely. And if that happens, and there are some benefits for us. We will obviously avail of it. But other than that, we are not hearing of anything else.
Pavel Molchanov: Okay. And then I think other than Europe, your main international exposure is Australia. Can we get a quick update on that?
Badri Kothandaraman: Yes. Australia basically had a weak first half of ‘22. And the fourth quarter is basically recovering back to original levels. The exciting thing for Australia is we are just about to introduce our third-generation battery into Australia in the second quarter. And in addition, we are also planning to introduce our IQ8 microinverters there. So, they are going to have some brand-new products. And many Australian installers – we meet with the Australian installers once a quarter in a round table. And many of those Australian installers are excited about third-generation product. So, that will be an incremental revenue for us once we release it.
Pavel Molchanov: Appreciate the update on that. Thanks, guys.
Badri Kothandaraman: Thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from Sean Milligan of Janney. Please go ahead.
Sean Milligan: Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Could you address or help us understand what percentage of the battery storage sales are going internationally right now? And then I know you are introducing that in a number of new markets. Can you help us understand how the pace of ramp up in new markets, what we should expect for that over this year?
Badri Kothandaraman: Yes. We normally do not breakout batteries between U.S. and Europe. But I will say this that Europe is getting started. U.S., we have introduced batteries now for the last since Q3 of 2020. So basically, 2.5 years there. The Europe guys are getting started, but they are rapidly expanding. We have introduced the product in two countries, Germany and Belgium and there are a lot more countries that we plan to introduce in 2023. Immediately, we are going to introduce in four countries, basically, Austria, Netherlands, France and I think Switzerland and the fifth one as well, which is Spain. So we are going to steadily ramp up the megawatt hours there. And when it becomes we will actually look at it between Mandy and me and see whether we will start breaking that out for future quarters.
Sean Milligan: Okay, great. Thanks.
Operator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Badri Kothandaraman for any closing remarks.
Badri Kothandaraman: Alright. Thank you for joining us today and for your continued support of Enphase. We look forward to speaking with you again next quarter. Bye.
Operator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today’s presentation and you may now disconnect.

===== 2022 Q3  (2022-10-25 16:30:00) =====
Operator: Good afternoon and welcome to the Enphase Energy Third Quarter 2022 Financial Results Conference Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator instructions] After today’s presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Karen Sagot. Please go ahead.
Karen Sagot: Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us on today’s conference call to discuss Enphase Energy’s third quarter 2022 results. On today’s call are Badri Kothandaraman, our President and Chief Executive Officer; Mandy Yang, our Chief Financial Officer; and Raghu Belur, our Chief Products Officer. After the market closed today, Enphase issued a press release announcing the results for its third quarter ended September 30, 2022. During this conference call, Enphase management will make forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, statements related to our expected future financial performance, the capabilities of our technology and products and the benefits to homeowners and installers. Our operations, including manufacturing, customer service and supply and demand, anticipated growth in existing and new markets, the timing of new product introductions and regulatory matters. These forward-looking statements involve significant risks and uncertainties and our actual results and the timing of events could differ materially from these expectations. For a more complete discussion of the risks and uncertainties, please see our most recent Form 10-K and 10-Qs filed with the SEC. We caution you not to place any undue reliance on forward-looking statements and undertake no duty or obligation to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future events or changes in expectations. Also please note that financial measures used on this call are expressed on a non-GAAP basis unless otherwise noted and have been adjusted to exclude certain charges. We have provided a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures in our earnings release furnished with the SEC on Form 8-K and which can also be found in the Investor Relations section of our website. Now I’d like to introduce Badri Kothandaraman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Enphase Energy. Badri?
Badri Kothandaraman: Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today to discuss our third quarter of 2022 financial results. We had a good quarter. We reported record quarterly revenue of $634.7 million, achieved quarterly non-GAAP gross margin of 42.9% and generated free cash flow of $179.1 million. Approximately 47% of our Q3 microinverter shipments were IQ8. We exited the third quarter at approximately 43, 12, 31. This means 43% gross margin, 12% operating expenses and 31% operating income, all as a percentage of revenue on a non-GAAP basis. We will go into our financials later in the call. Let’s now discuss how we are servicing customers. Our Q3 NPS worldwide was 70% compared to 68% in Q2. Our North American NPS score was 71%, the same as Q2. Our average call wait time was 4.8 minutes compared to 4.7 minutes in Q2. The elevated call wait times over the past few quarters are related to the rapid growth in our business. We’re not happy with the call wait time and we are targeting to get our call wait times under a minute by more aggressive staffing of our teams in U.S., Europe and Australia. We remain laser focused on customer service. The emphasis on superior customer experience has further increased due to severe weather events. During the recent storm in Puerto Rico and Florida, our customer service team, field service technicians and engineers were able to help customers with the issues they face. While our systems perform well in general, there is some more room for improvement. Our focus is to ensure seamless installer and homeowner experience through such events. Our teams have shared many stories with us of their efforts to help customers and customers have also expressed their deep gratitude for the help. I’m quite proud of our teams. Let’s talk about microinverter manufacturing. Our situation remains quite stable right now due to diligent supplier management as well as qualification of multiple sources. Our quarterly capacity is around 5 million microinverters today. We are on track to begin manufacturing at Flex Romania starting in Q1 2023, enabling a global capacity of 6 million micros per quarter. The Inflation Reduction Act, or IRA, has extended the investment tax credit, ITC, for residential solar to 30% for another 10 years and also implemented a standalone storage ITC with the same terms, both are very good for the industry at large. In addition, the IRA has a provision for $0.11 per AC watt production based tax credit for domestic manufacturing of microinverters. Therefore, we have been actively looking at manufacturing in the U.S. We are working with three contract manufacturing partners, one new and two we have today already. We plan to open four to six manufacturing lines in the U.S. by the second half of 2023. Our thought process is that we will need the additional capacity anyway considering our fast paced growth globally. There are still a lot of questions to be answered regarding the actual implementation of the IRA for domestic manufacturing. U.S. Department of Treasury is seeking comments from stakeholders in early November for clarification on these questions and we are working with industry partners and stakeholders to provide comments. Once the IRA with details have been finalized and the implementation is clear, the U.S. manufacturing could provide a substantial benefits in terms of the production based tax credit. Let’s talk about IQ batteries. We are on track to add an additional cell pack supplier from China early next year for a third generation battery. Our lead times for batteries are 10 to 12 weeks, allowing us to respond a little more quickly than before to customers. Let’s move on to the regions. Our U.S. and international revenue mix for Q3 was 71% and 29% respectively. We experienced strong growth in Q3, both in North America as well as in Europe. In U.S., our revenue increased 7% sequentially and 69% year-on-year. We had record quarterly revenue and record sell through for microinverters in Q3. Our microinverter channel inventory in the U.S. was at a very healthy level at the end of Q3 while our storage channel inventory was a little elevated due to longer installed times. I’ll go into more details about our IQ batteries later in the call. In Europe, our revenue increased approximately 70% sequentially and 136% year-on-year led by strong demand for our microinverters in Netherlands, France, Germany, Belgium, Spain and Portugal, and for our IQ batteries in Germany and Belgium. Microinverter supply continues to be tight and channel inventory continues to be below normal. We continue to invest heavily in Europe. We are expanding engineering, sales and customer service teams along with opening a manufacturing line in Romania in Q1 2023. In addition, we expect to begin shipments of IQ8 microinverters into the Netherlands and France in the fourth quarter and rest of Europe in the first half of 2023. We also plan to introduce IQ batteries into Austria in the fourth quarter. We recently acquired GreenCom Networks, a home energy management software company with headquarters in Germany. The acquisition allows us to add a local engineering team to service the accelerating clean energy transition in Europe, provide installers with a complete home energy management system integrating Enphase microinverters and Enphase batteries with third-party EV chargers and heat pumps and enable homeowner to monitor and control all of these devices from the Enphase App. In summary, we are quite pleased with our growth in Europe, look forward to the continued momentum. In Latin America, revenue increased 100% sequentially and 129% year-on-year. We have steady growth in our solar plus storage business in Puerto Rico during Q3 and expect continued growth in the region as demand for solar and storage has increased since the recent hurricane. The storage attaches nearly a 100% in Puerto Rico. Our IQ8 Microinverters as well as IQ Batteries provide a differentiated solution invaluable to customers during a storm. Now I’ll provide some general color on Australia, Brazil and India. In Australia, the solar market continued to recover in Q3 and we believe the forecasted increase in electricity prices will drive demand. We expect to introduce IQ Batteries in the first half of 2023 in Australia. Yes, for Brazil, we had sequential revenue growth in Q3 due to a steady increase in demand for IQ7A™ microinverters. In India, we made progress on adding more installers in the Enphase Installer Network. The module power is substantially increasing in these emerging markets. We plan to introduce a 480-watt AC high power residential microinverter in the first half of 2023 to match the increase in module power. Let’s discuss the company’s overall bookings for Q4. Our demand for Q4 is quite robust and easily exceeds the higher end of our guidance range. As for Q1, it’s a little bit early to comment, but we see that the bookings are quite healthy right now. On supply, the component availability is getting better. There are still some spots of tightness that keep coming up from time to time and our operations team is doing a nice job closely managing the situation. The logistic situation has also improved a little bit with reduced shipping times. Let’s talk about batteries. We have now certified approximately 2100 installers worldwide since the introduction of IQ batteries into North America, Germany and Belgium. We shipped 133.6 megawatt hours of IQ batteries in Q3. We are working hard to improve our customer experience as it is not yet up to our standard. We continue to host weekly installer round table to deeply understand their pain points. Our installers in North America experienced a median commissioning time of 118 minutes exiting Q3. We have made substantial improvements in our software, which was just released a few days ago to reduce commissioning times further and make grid transitions more robust. With these changes, we expect the median commissioning time to improve to 80 minutes exiting Q4. The third generation of our IQ battery product will have additional features which further addresses the installer pain points. Our installers are extremely busy, given the strong demand. Any inefficiency in the installation process impacts their profitability. This means the battery installation experience must be as good as the microinverter experience, which is what we are working to improve. With the significant changes we are making in the product, we are confident that storage installations will become as efficient as microinverter installations, and as the result installer profitability will improve and storage deployment will accelerate. We expect to ship 120 to 135 megawatt hours of IQ batteries in Q4. And we expect steady progress throughout 2023. On the new product front, we expect to generate our third-generation IQ battery starting in North America and Australia in the first half of 2023. We then plan to introduce it into Europe and emerging markets in the second half. The battery will have wired connectivity to the IQ Gateway and System Controller via a CAN bus. The modularity of the battery is five kilowatt hour. The battery will have double the continuous and peak power compared to the second generation enabling heavier loads such as air conditioners to start more easily. We are targeting commissioning times to be sub 30 minutes with this battery. With every generation of batteries, we expect to make steady improvement in the customer experience just like what we did with microinverters. We’re already working on our fourth-generation IQ battery to be introduced in 2024, which will result in a substantial energy density improvement compared to the third-generation. Let’s talk about our product for small commercial solar in the U.S. Based on customer feedback from pilot runs on IQ8D, which was our previous product, we are increasing the power of the microinverter by 50% from 320 watts to 480 watts DC. And we are reverting back to a single panel architecture. We understand this is a few more months of delay, but we think it is a right long-term decision as panel power continues to increase rapidly in the small commercial space. We expect to pilot this product in the first half of 2023. This product is very closely aligned with the 480 watt residential micro inverter for emerging markets, except for the three phase cabling. We are bullish about penetrating the small commercial solar business shortly with this powerful new product. Let’s discuss EV chargers. We shipped more than 6,370 chargers in Q3 compared to 8,250 in Q2. We are on track to manufacture Enphase branded EV chargers at our contract manufacturing facility in Mexico by the end of this year, helping us to increase capacity and cut down cost. As for new products, we expect to introduce smart EV chargers to U.S. customers in the first half of 2023 followed by Europe. We are excited about this product as it will provide connectivity and control, enabling use cases like green charging and allowing homeowners visibility into operation of their Enphase solar plus storage plus EV system through the Enphase App. We are very bullish about our EV charging business and continue to invest in it significantly. Let me give you a quick update on our Enphase Installer Network or EIN. We have now onboarded more than 1200 installers to our EIN worldwide through a highly selective process focused on installation, quality and an exceptional experience to homeowners across the globe. We have talked about our installer platform on previous calls, from lead management to design and proposals to FinTech connectivity, to automated permitting, to installation and commissioning and operations and maintenance. We recently added battery design and document management features to our solar graph software. We are also making enhancements to our solar graph software to cut down permit plans to creation cycle times significantly. Next, I’d like to comment on NEM 3.0 in California. As of now, there is still no decision from the California Public Utilities Commission, CPUC. We hope the CPUC eliminates the grid participation charge while providing a glide path for the solar only market, as well as incentivizing the solar-plus-storage market. In summary, we are happy with our performance and strong demand for our products. We are working on several important initiatives to grow our business fully ramping IQ8 Microinverters across the world, fixing customer experience on our IQ Batteries, accelerating our business in Europe further, and introducing high power IQ8 Microinverter variants for residential and small commercial solar markets. With that, I will turn the call over to Mandy for a review of our finances. Mandy?
Mandy Yang: Thanks Badri. And good afternoon everyone. I will provide more details related to our third quarter of 2022 financial results as well as our business outlook for the first quarter of 2022. We have provided reconciliations of this non-GAAP to GAAP financial measures in our earnings release posted today, which can also be found in the IR section of our website. Total revenue for Q3 was $634.7 million, representing an increase of 20% sequentially and a quarterly record. We shipped approximately 1,709 megawatts DC of microinverters and 133.6 megawatt hours of IQ batteries in the quarter. Non-GAAP gross margin for Q3 was 42.9% compared to 42.2% in Q2. The increase was driven by a favorable IQ8 mix partially offset by the further strengthening of the U.S. started against the Euro. Our Q3 gross margin was negatively effective by 70 basis points from the euro to USD has declined from Q2, here gross margin was 42.2% for Q3. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $78.6 million for Q3 compared to $71.2 million for Q2. The increase was driven by investment in R&D customer service and sales. GAAP operating expenses were $132.5 million for Q3, compared to $125 million for Q2. GAAP operating expenses for Q3 included $49.1 million of stock-based compensation expenses and $4.8 million of acquisition related expenses and amortization for acquired intangible assets and restructuring charges for site consolidation. On a non-GAAP basis, income from operations for Q3 was $193.9 million compared to $152.4 million for Q2. On a GAAP basis, income from operations was $135.4 million for Q3 compared to $94 million for Q2. On a non-GAAP basis, net income for Q3 was $175.5 million compared to $149.9 million for Q2. This resulted in non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.25 for Q3 compared to $1.07 for Q2. GAAP net income for Q3 was $114.8 million compared to GAAP net income of $77 million for Q2. This resulted in GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.80 for Q3, compared to $0.54 for Q2. We exited Q3 with a total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balance of approximately $1.42 billion, compared to approximately $1.25 billion at the end of Q2. In Q3, we generated $188 million in cash flow from operations and $179.1 million in free cash flow. Capital expenditure was $8.9 million for Q3 compared to $8.7 million for Q2. Now let’s discuss our outlook for the fourth quarter of 2022. We expect our revenue for the fourth quarter of 2022 to be within a range of $680 million to 720 million, which includes shipments of 120 to 135 megawatt hours of IQ batteries. We expect GAAP gross margin to be within a range of 39% to 42% and non-GAAP gross margin to be within a range of 40% to 43%, which excludes stock-based compensation expenses and acquisition-related amortization. We assume a conservative euro FX rate in our Q4 guidance and we don’t expect significant impact to our financials from the USD strengthening, given most of our revenue is denominated in US dollars. We expect our GAAP operating expenses to be within a range of $152 million to $156 million, including approximately $65 million estimated for stock-based compensation expenses, restructuring charges for site consolidation, acquisition-related expenses and amortization. We expect our non-GAAP operating expenses to be within a range of $87 million to $91 million. As we discussed last quarter with a year-to-date profit reported. We expect to utilize all of our net operating loss and research tax credit carry forward in 2022 and become a U.S. cash tax payer. Our non-GAAP tax expense reflects cash tax expense and reserves, we expect our non-GAAP tax expense for the fourth quarter 2022 to be approximately 15% of our non-GAAP profit before tax. We expect GAAP tax expense to be approximately 22% of profit before income tax for the fourth quarter of 2022. Moving forward to 2023, we expect to have our non-GAAP and GAAP tax rate at 22%, plus or minus 2% before any IRA impact. If IRA is implemented with favorable terms to us for domestic manufacturing, our tax rate may be reduced from 22%. In closing, we are pleased with our financial performance at the midpoint of our Q4 guidance plus the first three quarters of 2022 actuals, we estimate 2022 year-over-year revenue growth of 67%, while extending our non-GAAP gross margin to 42% and non-GAAP operating income to 29% of our estimated 2022 revenue. With that, I will now open the line for questions.
Operator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from James West with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.
James West: Hey, good afternoon, Badri.
Badri Kothandaraman: Hi.
James West: Badri, curious how you’re thinking about potentially increasing your manufacturing expansion, in particular, Europe given the strong growth there. Do you think it’s time to maybe go ahead with another? I mean, you’re bringing one line on now, I understand that, but bring another line on and then maybe secondarily with the IRA, how are you thinking about U.S. manufacturing capacity?
Badri Kothandaraman: Right. We talked about it earlier in the prepared remarks, so we are opening a line in Flextronics in Romania, and that will start production in Q1 of 2023. That’s got a fully automated line. The capacity is around 750,000 units. We’ll review that and see if we need to add one more line immediately. Now coming to the U.S., we explain the following, because of the production based tax credit of $0.11 a watt on microinverters manufactured in the U.S. We are planning for domestic manufacturing here. We are working with three contract manufacturing partners, two of which are existing and one of which is new. We are planning to add a total of four to six lines in the U.S. At this time, we are planning that by the end of Q4 2023, so four lines, per line would be 750,000 units a quarter. Four lines would be 3 million units a quarter in the U.S., six lines would be 4.5 million units a quarter in the U.S. We are going ahead with those plans because for us, any way we need the auto lines regardless of where they are, so we are already going ahead with the capital because we need those lines no matter what. But then we are looking at the finer details of the IRA implementation plan, we are working with the Department of Treasury as well as all the stakeholders there. And basically, there are some key details and clarifications that need to be finalized, regarding domestic content, et cetera. Once all of those are clear to us, then we can tell you more precisely the financial impact of our actions.
James West: Okay, very helpful. Thanks. Thanks Badri. And then one question on the battery side, you talked about the install. It may be issues there that the 118 minutes or so and you’re getting that down. Is that really surely a software and maybe modularity issue on the actual battery itself or is there more to that?
Badri Kothandaraman: Well, I mean it’s a complex system and it’s got it’s a mixture of both hardware and software and basically – yes, first of all, to give you a big picture there, we introduced our batteries in the third quarter of 2020. We introduced batteries at that time. Our premise was it’s an AC coupled battery. It’s an air cooled battery. There is no liquid cooling. It’s modular 3.3 kilowatt hours added at a time. It is easy to use and we plan to provide 24/7 support, all in one system with solar plus storage. Where I think we needed to do better was in installation experience of installers, the commissioning time. We – it’s no secret. We have highlighted that in almost every call. The commissioning time was multiple hours before that. Now, it’s a lot better. It’s a lot more stable. We have learnt a lot. It’s incredible. The amount of learning that, that we got in the company. In addition to commissioning times, are there issues? Your question, the – making the battery perform flawlessly through all types of grid transitions is by no means easy. We have learned that in places like Puerto Rico where the grid basically can have a very, very deep slope, which is very high slope, things can change drastically. The voltage and frequency can change. Yet, we need to make sure customer experiences is right. And we have learnt a lot. We made mistakes. We’ve learned from it from both our installer round tables as well as customer calls. We have gotten better and better and better with every quarter. I think now we are in a great shape is what I would say. We just released software that’ll help in commissioning and a better experience on great transition like what I said. We are incredibly optimistic on storage. Our installers, when we meet with them on a weekly basis, they want to install more of Enphase batteries and we need to help improve their profitability. So I think that the improvements that we made will help a lot. In addition, we learn from one generation to an to another generation like how we have eight, we are in our eighth generation of microinverters. We are going to be in a third generation of batteries pretty soon. There we are going to go to a wired architecture. Today, our battery is based on a ZigBee wireless architecture. We’re going to go to a wired architecture. It’s very similar to the automotive standard, which is the CAN bus that’ll make communications quite robust. In addition, we are going to double the continuous and peak power, which means that it becomes – they don’t need to buy more kilowatt hours for their air conditioner, for ex – yes, for example. So we’ll be able to provide a lot more juice for the same kilowatt hours in terms of discharge power. So the combinations of all the things I said, I think we are in a fantastic shape. Our installers want to use us and we are going to make steady progress throughout 2023.
James West: Okay. Great. Thanks, Badri.
Badri Kothandaraman: Thank you.
Operator: The next question is from Colin Rusch with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead
Colin Rusch: Badri, thanks so much for the detail on the incremental functionality in the battery. I’m curious about the decision to add those features in. Is that coming from the field? Is that – was that on the roadmap initially? And are those elements real drivers for incremental demand as you bring them forward in your view?
Badri Kothandaraman: Yes. I mean, they are coming both, some were already planned and some are coming from the field. This is why we meet with our installers and their requirements. They have a long list of requirements, which we carefully review and we put into the features. We are already planning, I said about the third generation that will come in the first half of 2023. We are already working on the fourth generation. Our technology team, the CTO team is already working on the fourth generation that’s got more feedback from the installers. Our product development cycle times are a little bit long, which is what I’m [indiscernible] working on. And so to answer your question, I mean, we are learning all the time from the field. Some things are just good to do that we have already planned prior, but a lot of things we learn from our installers.
Colin Rusch: That’s super helpful. And then on the commercial rooftop market, in terms of changing the approach, can you talk a little bit about the margin opportunity with the change in architecture in this approach versus what we had thought about before with the two models per microinverter and how we should think about that relative to corporate margins?
Badri Kothandaraman: Yes. I mean our thought process when we talked about IQ8D before was, okay, we can generate, we can get a 640 watt microinverter that addresses two panels. That means per panel the microinverter will produce 320 watt AC. And yes, we have been a little bit delayed on that product. And what – when we did pilot testing a few months ago, our installers basically once again gave us feedback that the module roadmap for small commercial is well beyond 500 watts right now. And if it is 500, you take 500 divided by 320. That’s the DC, AC ratio of 1.5. 1.5 is not ideal. We want to stay under 1.3. So for us, we thought about it hard. We said in our installer feedback is critical. We need to change. We need to get a product with much higher AC power. Earlier, we were not that much advanced on GaN. Now, what we can do is to pack that 480 watt AC power into the same footprint for IQ9. So in IQ9, we plan to have that 480 watt of AC in the same footprint as IQ8D. And how is that possible? It is possible because of innovative technology like GaN. So GaN stands for gallium nitride, gallium nitride output transistors right now we use silicon transistors 600 volts silicon transistors. These GaN transistors can basically, they have the thermal characteristics can withstand high power. And so those will enable us to keep the footprint quite competitive in state-of-the-art. And then the additional benefits are the GaN allows us to operate the feds at a higher frequency. Today, we operate at a 100 kilohertz. GaN allows it to operate a lot more up to 1 megahertz. We are planning to utilize 1 megahertz for IQ 10, but on IQ9, we will probably be around 200 to 300 kilohertz. And then what happens is the transformer scales basically to these – to one over the square root of the increase. So that means that the transformer can come down, the size of the transformer can come down. The transformer is big, you’ve seen the round thing there in the top left of the microinverter, that’s the transformer. So that footprint can come down, the volume can come down, the FX can still be the same. And soon there will be an opportunity, although we are not planning to do in the DC stage yet, implement again in the DC stage, there is opportunity for us to implement again in the DC stage as well. So lots of optimization possible. Name of the game is to keep the footprint the same, not bloated. Size is important for us and I think we can get the cost structure as well under control. And if we are able to pack in 480 watts AC punch into similar number of components, similar cost structure, then we directly get the cost benefit there in terms of cost per watt.
Colin Rusch: Okay. That’s super helpful. Appreciate it.
Badri Kothandaraman: Yes. Thank you.
Colin Rusch: I’ll take it offline. Thanks guys.
Operator: The next question is from Mark Strouse with J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead.
Mark Strouse: Yes, good afternoon. Thank you very much for taking our questions. I’ve got two questions. Maybe I’ll just kind of roll them into one. The IQ8, I believe you mentioned that was 47% of shipments this quarter. I believe in 2Q that number was 37%. Just kind of what drove that, that seems like a relative kind of slowing in what I would’ve expected kind of the progression over the coming quarters to be. And then the second part of that is kind of despite that relatively slowness in IQ8, gross margins are still coming kind of ahead of expectations. So just a bit more color on those two metrics please.
Badri Kothandaraman: Yes. If you see, you got to look at it a little bit carefully. It’s 37% of 3.3 million microinverters that we shipped in Q2, that’s approximately one point something in Q2, while now it is 47% of 4.3 million microinverters. So therefore, I would say, the IQ8 microinverter volume is doubled from Q2 to Q3. What we have seen historically is the transition, is complex. It can take over four to six quarters. That’s what – I mean, around four to six quarters. This is what we told you before. We started Q1 was at 20% I think or 19%, Q2 37%, Q3 47%. We expected to further climb in Q4. Our target is to get to 90% conversion in Q2. That’s what our target is. You asked a question on gross margin. On gross margin, our product mix of IQ8 was higher, like what I told you, 47%. In addition, we do several initiatives on world class cost. It’s not that we are here only working on IQ7 to IQ8 conversion. We are constantly looking at what are the opportunities for us to save money. It could be in parting price negotiation. It could be converting our bulkhead from a custom bulkhead to a standard bulkhead. So we can eliminate cabling. It could be working on a cost of a heat spreader. It could be working on elimination of an IC – a small IC by integrating it into the ASIC. So we have a lot of cost reduction programs that are ongoing at any point in time and we are seeing some other benefits of that coupled with IQ8.
Mark Strouse: Very helpful. I’ll take the rest offline. Thanks, Badri.
Badri Kothandaraman: Thank you.
Operator: The next question is from Brian Lee with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Brian Lee: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. Maybe first one for you, Badri. Appreciate the color around the U.S. manufacturing strategy here heading into 2023. Can you kind of speak to, I know you mentioned four to six lines and number of units per line, but your megawatt capacity on the inverter product, the microinverter product has been going up steadily, 320, 350, 390 is what you printed this quarter, but then you’ve got the commercial product that’s going to be all the way up to 480. So as we kind of think about mix implications for what the actual megawatt capacity or gigawatt capacity is going to be. Can you kind of get a sense of – should we be thinking you’re doing 130 watt micros on average out of the four to six lines? Are you going to be doing some commercial as well? So it’d be all the way up to 480. And then I guess consistent with on that same topic, the two to three contract manufacturers you’re talking to in the U.S. What are the sort of early discussions around the credit? Is this going to be a credit you fully capture? Are you going to share some of the economics? What are some of the discussions you’re having with those partners? And then I have a follow-up.
Badri Kothandaraman: Yes. I mean the answer to your first question is quite simple. We believe the U.S. residential market as well as the Europe residential market will keep – module requirements will keep going up and we have the right products in the IQ8 family to take care of it. We have a product. The highest power family in the IQ8 family is IQ8H and that is 384 watts AC. So we expect slowly our mix to move from IQ8+ to IQ8H over the years. However, the emerging market, if you see India, if you see Australia, if you see Brazil, even pockets in France, et cetera is there the module power is increasing disproportionally and 550 watt panels sometimes are common there. So the 480 watt AC micro will be able to address residential emerging markets for solar. Then I talked about small commercial. The same 480 watt micro with minor changes for three phase cabling, we’ll be able to address the small commercial market for quite some time. Because there again the panel power is climbing about 500. Even if it goes to 600, this product will still have an outstanding DC/AC ratio. So to answer your question, most of the volume will be closer to the 384 watts over time. There’ll be – portion of it will be at 480. And this line – these lines I’m planning and it’s still early days, these lines I’m planning can produce product for everybody, not just the U.S. could also produce product for other markets. Second question you asked, how are the financial discussions with the contract manufacturers? We are still in the early stage. We have signed a letter of intent with those. However, I think we still need a lot more clarifications from the U.S. government on what kind of domestic content they need and other rules, whether it’s a direct pay or whether it’s a tax credit there are still many fine details that need to be ironed up. However, for us, the logic is we are anyway growing fast as a company we have to build extra lines somewhere. And therefore, these lines that I invest in they’re not going to be wasted. They’re not going to be extra. They will probably be required. You can think about it as I’m accelerating them by a few months. So stay tuned. We will – as we know more, we will share a lot more details with you on the financial benefit.
Brian Lee: Okay, fair enough. Super helpful. Just if I could squeeze in a quick modeling one. I know this can be lumpy quarter-to-quarter, but if I look at the implied ASP per watt this is the first quarter in a while where it was down sequentially and by a decent amount versus the size this quarter. Is there something in the mix here this quarter? How should we be thinking about that price trend into 4Q especially outpaced 3Q market? Thanks.
Badri Kothandaraman: Yes. I mean with regarding pricing, the pricing remains stable, so it must be mix related. And I will have our team follow up with you after.
Brian Lee: Okay. I’ll take it offline. Thank you.
Operator: The next question is from Eric Stine with Craig-Hallum. Please go ahead.
Aaron Spychalla: Yeah. Hi, it’s Aaron Spychalla on for Eric. Thanks for taking the question.
Badri Kothandaraman: Thank you.
Aaron Spychalla: Thanks. On the battery side, you kind of mentioned the China capacity coming on the first quarter. Can you just remind us, what that gets you to and then how you’re thinking about capacity as we look forward? And then any thoughts on kind of U.S. as you think about that?
Badri Kothandaraman: Yes. I mean, the third-generation battery is going to be released in the first half of 2023. And for that battery we are going to add an extra cell pack supplier from China. And in general, you should think about our battery capacity is going to be well north of 250 megawatt hours a quarter. That’s what we are going to get to. With regarding U.S. manufacturing of batteries, we don’t have any concrete plans at this point in time. We are looking at it, but we will share something when we are ready.
Aaron Spychalla: Understood. Thanks. And maybe just one follow-up. Great growth in the EU. Can you just kind of talk a little bit about the competitive dynamics there with the growth you’re seeing? And then just you touched on it a little bit, but maybe a little more on the investments that that you’re looking to make in those markets?
Badri Kothandaraman: Yes. So in Europe we are very strong in Netherlands, we are continuing to win customers there. We are strong in France as well. We are starting to grow a lot significantly in Germany. We are – we have had a healthy business in Belgium. Spain is also ramping for us, Spain and Portugal are ramping for us. We are starting to look at Poland, Austria there will be starting to ramp a lot of our efforts there as well as Italy. That’s the high level view. We have – what we realized from Germany is that sector coupling is very popular. So what does that mean and why is it important? The natural gas crisis in Europe is causing people to consider full home electrification. When you want to electrify your home, you need everything to be connected. You need your mobility needs to be connected to your energy system. Your heating equipment need to be connected. So a sector coupling is basically the intersection of the renewable energy sector with the mobility sector and the heating sector. Therefore, any energy management solution that we provide needs to talk to these seamlessly. This is why we bought a home energy management software company called GreenCom Networks. All they do is to efficiently network third-party EB chargers and heat pumps to our solar, meaning end phase solar and storage. So that we can address, we can help in the full home electrification trend that is happening in Germany. So that’s a big deal. It’s a big deal and it is accelerated due to the energy crisis that slowly spreading to the other regions as well. And I think eventually, although Europe is ahead, eventually it’ll come down, it’ll come to the U.S. and other reasons too. So that’s big for us and we are excited to have an engineering center in Germany now to cater to customers. We are also introducing, as far as IQ8’s are concerned, we are introducing IQ8’s to all countries in Europe as well as Australia. We are introducing to Netherlands and France in Q4 and we will introduce to more countries in Europe by the first half of 2023. As far as batteries are concerned, today Germany and Belgium are where we sell our batteries to. We are going to add Austria pretty soon, Austria by the way, very interesting market. I think it is 800 megawatts of solar and with a very healthy attach rate, almost greater than 80%, so very interesting market, will be playing there pretty soon. I talked about Poland already. We are making plans, so lots of things happening there. And because we started off from a small revenue base in Europe, we’ve been growing quite nicely. We doubled Europe revenue from 2020 to 2021. We are going to once again double the revenue from 2021 to 2022 and we expect very healthy high double digit growth from 2022 to 2023.
Aaron Spychalla: Great. Great. Thanks for all the color and for taking the questions.
Operator: The next question is from Phil Shen with ROTH Capital Partners. Please go ahead.
Phil Shen: Guys, thanks for taking my questions. First one’s on storage. Was wondering if you could talk through what your expectations for battery sales might be for next year. How should we think about the growth trajectory of storage as we get through 2023? I know you haven’t given official guidance, but I was wondering if you might be able to just give a little bit of color on what the expectations might be now. Thanks.
Badri Kothandaraman: Yes. We usually do not guide for more than one quarter. We already told you the number for Q4 $120 million to $135 million. We are doing the right things for the business. We – based on our conversation with the installers, they love using the product. We need to fix a few things like what we talked about. We are going to be introducing our third-generation battery pretty shortly. So we are incredibly optimistic on our storage volumes. We expect storage volumes to continuously improve through 2023. Europe is another good story as well on storage. The volumes are low right now, but they’re starting to ramp up and be meaningful. So between the fixes that we did, the third-generation coming out, Europe’s starting to ramp up heavily on batteries, I’m very, very optimistic on 2023.
Phil Shen: Great. That’s great color. Thanks, Badri. As it relates to 2023 again, but just for the general micro business I know there’s not official guidance, but was wondering if you could talk through, how does a potential recession maybe some potential for demand slowing in 2023 for resi solar in the U.S.? How could that – how are you thinking about that? Are you seeing any of initial signs of that at all? And I think you saw the 70% year-over-year growth in Europe this quarter, what kind of sequential growth could we see in Europe as we get through next year for the micro inverter business? Thanks.
Badri Kothandaraman: Yes, I mean the, you asked us, do we see any slowdown? We don’t. Our demand is very strong as we see it. It’s of course too early to talk about Q1, but even Q1 bookings are right now quite healthy. So that’s what we see today. The – there are a few factors that are in favor for us. The utility rates are continuing to climb, so that accelerates our business. The IRA, Inflation Reduction Act and the ITC extensions for both for ITC 30% ITC for solar and storage are fantastic. So those also provide a nice launch. And then for us this is not true in the U.S. but Europe, the energy crisis in Europe is accelerating renewables big time. So these are the three things where we are seeing a lot of tailwinds from these three things and our demand is strong.
Phil Shen: Great. Thanks, Badri.
Operator: The next question is from Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.
Steve Fleishman: Yes. Hi, good afternoon. Thanks. Badri, just in thinking about U.S. manufacturing, could you give us any color on what the cost difference might be in the U.S. and how much of the $0.11 that could offset in terms of just manufacturing costs here?
Badri Kothandaraman: Yes, I mean it’s too early to talk about it, Steve. But again the $0.11 per watt is the big number, if you do the economics, you see, let’s say I ship a inverter with 384 watts of AC, $0.11 a watt $43, right? And the manufacturing cost that, of course, we have the total manufacturing cost, which is bill of materials plus value added manufacturing. The bill of materials will roughly stay the same regardless of the, there may be some small changes, but if domestic content is not required, the bill of materials will likely stay the same. So therefore the variable here is value added manufacturing and how efficient the contract manufacturers can set up the factories? What level of automation they can have? How can we help in them achieving great levels of automation. That’s the question. Those are the discussions we are having right now. But we see a very clear benefit at the end of the day, which is very meaningful. That’s why we are going to go ahead and plan for this. But having said that, we do need clarification on a few points that I already said. The domestic content, the forms of credit, the way it’ll be given, et cetera. So, we are going to iron out those details hopefully in the next three months and things will be a lot clearer. But for now we are investing in it, like what I said many times already, the – we are already our growth, we are growing sequentially quarter-on-quarter. So therefore we need the additional capacity anyway regardless of the location. So, our investment will not be redundant or will not go waste.
Steve Fleishman: And just in terms of the U.S., the relative competitive position that you see, because I believe the string inverter credit is more like $0.06. Do you see whatever the cost is kind of a relative competitive position improvement in U.S.?
Raghu Belur: Yes, hi, this is Raghu. Really what it is us from a price – if this year, I mean I assume it’s more like a pricing question than when you say competitive, look, we’ll always price to value, right? No matter what. And so what that means is that putting the cost issues aside, regardless of where we manufacture or if we manufacture in the U.S. and whatever obstructs that we get from the production based tax credit, the pricing, we are always going to do a price added value. And today we are our competitive position is very strong with the current pricing where it is. And we’ll never change that strategy of pricing that where, we’ll – we are not chasing market share by lowering prices. We are chasing market share by adding value. And so that doesn’t change. I hope I answered your question. I took a slightly different route.
Steve Fleishman: No, that’s helpful. Last very quick question just on, Badri, you mentioned these positive drivers for demand utility rates, IRA, Europe energy crisis. I guess the one negative might be higher financing cost. How much, if at all, are you hearing that as a concern from your installer network?
Badri Kothandaraman: Like what I said, I mean, we haven’t seen any slowdown in demand. Our backlog remains strong. Our Q1 bookings remain healthy. So yes, I can only react to the data points, I see.
Raghu Belur: Just to add to what Badri said, bear in mind ITC has also gone up in the U.S. So, what would’ve been 22% ITC next year is now back up to 30%. So that is an offset as well.
Badri Kothandaraman: That’s right.
Operator: The next question is from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Excellent. Hey, good afternoon Badri and team. Thank you and congratulations again. So just on the cost side of this equation, right, I mean I just want to make sure I heard you right on the U.S. manufacturing, I mean, how much of an incremental cost and/or incremental need from U.S. content is it required? I’m just trying to understand the relative cost under the ledger versus the $0.11 a watt that we’re talking about. I guess that you guys hold onto the $0.11. I’m just trying to understand what the offsets would be, especially considering the fact that you still have a pretty good line of set on U.S. growth and therefore being able to just serve U.S. demand from U.S. manufacturing, and avoiding logistics at the same time. So the net, net, net of the two of those, as best you understand it today, obviously considering I guess [ph] still pending,
Badri Kothandaraman: Right. So like what I said, maybe you did not hear what I said. Is the production based tax credit is $0.11 per AC watt. If we take a 384 watt micro inverter, that is $43 of credit. Now when we look at our microinverter, you have bill of materials and then you have value-added manufacturing cost, and then you have overhead, which is warranty expenses and all of those. So if you see all of those constitute the cost of the product. Now the bill of materials, assuming there are no restrictions on domestic content, expect the bill of materials to be roughly staying the same. The value-added manufacturing cost is the one that’s the variable cost depending on the country. And then the warranty expands in logistics, freight, et cetera, largely the same because now it is local and while the cost to ship raw materials to the U.S. may increase, but the cost to ship to customers will decrease. So that is a wash. So really if you consider those three components, we need to look at one portion of that, which is value-added manufacturing. Now our contract, it needs to be economical for our contract manufacturers as well. They also need to make, they need – they also need to be profitable. It’s not going to happen if they do not make any money. So therefore, we are working on finalizing the agreements we do have letters of intent, which we think are reasonable constructs and bottom line is with the constructs we have in mind, provided this AR [ph] implementation is approved. I think, the money to be made or the credit that we can get would be significant and it’ll create a lot of jobs, which is really what we want.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Right. I was just making sure I heard you right. It was a pretty bold and impressive statement. So excellent. And then just outside of that, obviously, OpEx trends heading well here of late. Can you comment at all on that? Just, I mean, again, the sustainability of the trends that you’re seeing of late and any comments on perspective as you continue to scale here, OpEx relative to rest?
Badri Kothandaraman: OpEx, we are growing so fast that it is impossible for OpEx. It’s impossible for us to spend money, yes, spend a lot of money. But that doesn’t mean we are changing the model. Our model is 15% of sales. Sooner or later, it’ll settle down to that number. We will not compromise on any investment on microinverters, batteries, EV chargers, home energy management system, installer platform, all of them are very important for us. We will not compromise one bit on that.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it. All right. Turn off. Thank you guys.
Badri Kothandaraman: Thank you.
Operator: The next question is from Gus Richard with Northland. Please go ahead.
Gus Richard: Yes, thanks for taking the question. Just wondering, you guys have been growing at 70%. Can you sustain that level of growth? And I’m not asking for a forecast and if not, where do you see the limits of growth coming in? Is it your installer network? Is it availability components? Could you just discuss that a little bit it’d be helpful?
Badri Kothandaraman: Right. When you start from a small base, of course the growth is going to be high. And then when you build it to some respectable numbers after that, the question is are we going to be able to sustain the growth? We think there are great drivers for sustaining the growth, which is the utility rates even in Europe, for example, in Germany are quite high. The energy crisis is accelerating in our renewables in Europe. So all of those are external drivers. They’re tailwinds that are in our favor. So we think we can sustain good double-digit growth percentages in general. But we do need to maintain a focus on quality and customer experience. And many of the installers love the quality on microinverters. And our market share gain that we have is based upon our quality plus the customer service that we provide them on microinverters. I talked about the – some stumbling blocks on storage and we are working on them and we expect storage will be also providing a similar customer experience enabling us to unleash that opportunity as well in Europe. So we are incredibly optimistic like what I said, we doubled from 2020 to 2021. We doubled a gain from 2021 or we will double the gain from 2021 to 2022. And 2022 to 2023 it may not be possible for us to double, but we will have very healthy double digit, high double digit growth percentage.
Gus Richard: Got it. Thanks so much.
Badri Kothandaraman: Thank you.
Operator: The next question is from Joseph Osha with Guggenheim. Please go ahead.
Joseph Osha: Hello. Hello. Two questions. First, Badri, you gave some very helpful sort of rates of increase for your different geographies. I’m wondering if you could just did a very high level give us a sense as to how the U.S. versus all of Europe versus everything else breaks down?
Badri Kothandaraman: Yes, we said in the prepared remarks, 71% of our sales came from North America, 29% came from rest of the world. And…
Joseph Osha: Yes, and I’m sorry to give you a hard time, I was kind of after how that 29% might break down?
Badri Kothandaraman: Oh, yes, the 29% breakdown most of it in Europe right now.
Joseph Osha: Okay. Thank you.
Badri Kothandaraman: I think most of, yes, most of it is in Europe. If you ask, which are the regions that are strong in Europe, they are Netherlands, France, Germany, and followed by Spain, Belgium, Portugal.
Joseph Osha: Thank you. I was just after the waiting of that 29% and that answers the question. Thank you. And then I’m going to completely shift gears for the second question. Obviously, wide-bandgap materials make great sense for that really high performance, that you use in the switch. But I was interested to hear you say that you might – we might see some wide-bandgap stuff on the DC side as well. Can you give us a little more sense as to what you’re thinking about there?
Badri Kothandaraman: The same thing, the DC stages for GaN will also make the form factor very efficient and the thermals pretty efficient. So, sometimes you can – today, we have four facts on the AC site with GaN, you can do interesting things like make those four facts – two facts because we can combine two of them. So GaN helps us to do a lot more things that in the same footprint as we have today.
Joseph Osha: Sure, yes. Just that, that, yes, and typically in these applications you see people using it in that application you just described, which is that high performance fed on the switch, but I’m just curious on the DC side, it’s not quite demanding and it’s some expensive thing to do. So I’m just wondering if you could talk a little bit about what you meant with that?
Badri Kothandaraman: Yes, if you struggle – if you look at the way the module power is increasing one way is that’s happening is you’re seeing the format of the cells increase from 156 millimeters to 180 to 210, and then they’re moving to half cut cells and sub-strings within the cell. So what that’s driving is that the current part of the module is also going up, which means that we need to handle higher current on the input stage of our microinverters. So you want to make that stage as efficient as possible as well, because you don’t want to compromise the efficiency of the input stage. You’re already doing a good – we are going to move to gain feds on the AC side, improve the efficiency on that side but you’re at the same time we’re going to make sure that we also improve the efficiency on the DC side as the module trend changes towards higher current. That’s the other driver for driving towards using GaN on the DC side as well. So what that means overall is drive higher efficiency, drive higher efficiency has the benefits of obviously better yield, but more importantly, better reliability, better thermals. Better thermals means you can reduce the size of the part GaN also obviously allows you to drive to higher frequency, which also shrinks all of the – all of the components such as transformers, common mode chokes, inductors, et cetera. So all in all, it’s a very positive trend when you move GaN both on the DC side as well as the AC side.
Joseph Osha: Okay. No thanks. That point on occurrence is very helpful. Thank you.
Operator: The next question is from Kashy Harrison with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.
Kashy Harrison: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the questions. So with respect to the line that you’re adding in Romania could you share any thoughts on how long you think it may take for that facility to be producing that peak capacity, maybe just using historical line editions as a reference? And then can you remind us if the COGS that you’re going to be paying for Flex is going be in USD for that facility or is it going to be in Euros?
Badri Kothandaraman: Yes. We are going to start producing in Romania from Q1 2023. Historically, it has taken us very short time, one to two quarters to ramp to full capacity. We’ll be able to do 750,000 micro inverters a quarter. So by the first half we should be by and large ramped up. And Mandy Yang of the question.
Mandy Yang: Yes. The cost we pay Flex is in USD.
Kashy Harrison: Okay, helpful, thank you. And then just, just one quick clarification from just the general discussion on the small commercial product. Badri, are you implying that the small commercial product is effectively IQ9 given the discussion on GaN, or is it not IQ9?
Badri Kothandaraman: Well, the small commercial product will start with what is called as an IQ8P. This IQ8P product is IQ8 high power. That will be 480 watts AC single panel, single micro and we are utilizing all the work we did for the IQ8D basically a larger form factor with silicon junction fits. And then what we will do with IQ9 is to shrink that form factor to be identical to what we have today, yet achieve 480 watts of AC, and that’s the power of GaN.
Kashy Harrison: Got it. Thank you.
Operator: The next question is from Pavel Molchanov with Raymond James. Please go ahead.
Pavel Molchanov: Thanks for taking the question. Two quick ones on M&A. You’ve done, I think, five deals in the past 12 months. What would your organic top line growth rate be if you strip out the M&A?
Badri Kothandaraman: It’s a hard to answer, but I’ll give you some color. We started working on the installer digital platform. Our first acquisition was Solargraf. We did that in Q1, January 26th of 2021. We did that. We then followed it actually let me – let me back up Solargraf basically provides software to installers to provide a proposal to the homeowners. It also has got connectivity to various financial partners – FinTech partners. So that’s the first acquisition we did. The second acquisition we did was we bought a company in India called it – it’s a company called DIN and we bought a portion of that company, which made or which created permit plan sets for installers in the U.S. and turned them around in QuickTime. So that’s two. And then the third one is basically 365 Pronto. 365 Pronto is a two sided marketplace that brings service providers with customers and the customer may be an installer wanting to do something like replacing a cellular modem at a homeowner site. So he doesn’t have the labor. He contracts the labor from a labor marketplace. That’s 365 Pronto. The fourth one is ClipperCreek. That’s more straightforward. We have already broken it out, and that’s EV chargers. And why we bought EV chargers is because of why we made the GreenCom acquisition too. This is EVs are going to be ramping up. It takes a lot of power or energy to charge your electric vehicle and EV will accelerate solar and storage even more. And the homeowners really need to be able to manage the EV they want, I mean, the way they want to. They should be able to say, I want to charge the EV through solar. I want to charge the EV at this particular time. So it needs deep interaction with the solar plus storage system. That’s why we bought that company. The last one we bought was SolarLeadFactory, and that is a gain for providing installers leads. Can we provide installers, leads for an attractive price in the name of the game is leads are so high quality that the probability of them converting to a final installation is a lot higher than competition. So that was the fifth acquisition. And then, yes sorry, the sixth one is the one I did recently, which is GreenCom Networks in Europe where, once again same concept in order for full home electrification, renewable energy must be connected to mobility as well as heating. It’s called sector coupling. Home energy management software is critical. GreenCom provides that software, so that homeowners can add, can see what they want through one app, one mobile app not multiple, multiple sources. So all of these together, we expect for example GreenCom to that home energy management system to accelerate the sales of our solar plus storage systems starting in Germany because now the installer has got a credible story, he can go to the homeowner and say that look, I can connect solar, Enphase solar plus storage and I can connect it with your heat pumps. I can connect it with your EV chargers. I can help you manage it from one app. So he’s got a credible story. We expect that to drive demand. And so you can see even Solar Leads Factory where we help our installers with leads is tightly coupled to our business. Same thing on Solargraf that again is, we have a large installer base and they know that we do things with high quality. So they start using that as a service. That’s their premise. That’s why we bought it. And by offering installers a one-stop shop having all of these services, it just becomes easy for them to not even think, just buy from us. Of course, the flip side is we have to make them highest quality. It doesn’t come for free. We have to work on it. We have to make it the highest quality. But our strong belief, if we do this right, that organic meaning the core business, solar plus storage will ramp even more. So it’s hard for me to break things out and we cannot say this installer purchased extra inverters because of this particular software, hard to break out. But that’s the rational. Yes and you’re seeing, some of the benefits you will start seeing, especially the Europe ramp, you’ll start seeing some.
Pavel Molchanov: That’s very helpful. And as you were – out each of those deals, it struck me how much more diversified your sales mix is versus two years ago. In that context, will you start breaking out revenue by product line, versus just giving a micro inverter in megawatts?
Badri Kothandaraman: Well, I mean, we don’t plan to right now, but when things get meaningful and big, Mandy will take a look at it.
Pavel Molchanov: All right. Thank you.
Badri Kothandaraman: Thank you.
Operator: The next question is from Christine Cho with Barclays. Please go ahead.
Christine Cho: Hi, thank you for squeezing me in. On the battery side, I know you mentioned install times as kind of being impediment to, growth here on the deployment, but it also just looks like attach rates are down across the board in the U.S. not just for you, but for other batteries that are supposedly easy to install. And supply doesn’t seem like it’s an issue. So is it possible that pricing is at a place where it’s negatively impacting demand and customers are just waiting for our prices to come down? And kind of with that as a backdrop, how should we think about how battery prices will trend with your third generation battery?
Badri Kothandaraman: Yes, I don’t think it’s a pricing issue. The demand remains strong. We have a particular advantage is, we do work with several thousands of long tail installers, so we get direct feedback from them. They will, they have limited time on their hands. If they perceive storage as hard to do and not very profitable, they have to tilt their time towards solar where they know how to do it and they’re profitable. So it’s our job, the other companies do, but that’s where we need to improve. Enphase needs to improve. I’m not talking about others, Enphase needs to improve. We need to fix the installer experience. We need to make it easy to install. And we believe that pricing is not an issue. We think the storage ITC provides an enormous benefit. We also think that the power outages are becoming more common than, resilience is important for people. So demand is high, the labor is limited. We have to make, we have to do a good job. Enphase has to do a good job if, in order for us to improve the volume significantly.
Christine Cho: Okay. And the 130 megawatt hours that you guys did this quarter, is it possible to get a break of that across the U.S., Germany and Belgium?
Badri Kothandaraman: We don’t usually break it out. Once again we don’t do that, but Mandy will take an action item to see if, we will consider breaking out for the next year.
Christine Cho: Okay. And then if quickly, if I could just touch upon your Euro exposure. I think in the prepared remarks, you said 70 bps on the currency deterioration. I’m not sure if I got that right. And I think in the past you’ve potentially talked about evaluating hedges sometime in the future. What are your thoughts here, and especially as you continue to grow Europe you’ve also said there’s I think, a partial offset on the cost side. I would assume that’s mostly labor. But aren’t your raw materials mostly denominated in USD? So if we could just get a little color on what your mismatching currency is?
Mandy Yang: Sure. So first of all most of our costs are in USD, right? So our exposure really is on the sales that are denominated in a Euro, right? But as I provided some color earlier, right our FX exposure still very limited, right? Because most of our sales are denominated in USD, right? With that said, we are actually evaluating hedging program, right? We are watching the Central banks rate hikes in both regions, right? When it makes sense, we would trigger the hedging against our euro revenue. So yes, that’s what I will put by.
Operator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Badri Kothandaraman for any closing remarks.
Badri Kothandaraman: All right. Thank you for joining us today and for your continued support of Enphase. We look forward to speaking with you again next quarter. Bye.
Operator: The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today’s presentation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2022 Q2  (2022-07-26 16:30:00) =====
Operator: Good day and welcome to the Enphase Energy's Second Quarter 2022 Financial Results Conference Call. All participants will be in a listen-only mode. [Operator instructions] After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Karen Sagot. Please go ahead.
Karen Sagot: Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us on today's conference call to discuss Enphase Energy's second quarter 2022 results. On today's call are Badri Kothandaraman, our President and Chief Executive Officer; Mandy Yang, our Chief Financial Officer; and Raghu Belur, our Chief Products Officer. After the market closed today, Enphase issued a press release announcing the results for its second quarter ended June 30, 2022. During this conference call, Enphase management will make forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, statements related to our expected future financial performance; the capabilities of our technology and products and the benefits to homeowners and installers, our operations, including manufacturing and customer service and supply and demand, the anticipated growth in sales and the markets, new products introductions and regulatory matters. These forward-looking statements involve significant risks and uncertainties and our actual results and the timing of events could differ materially from these expectations. For a more complete discussion of the risks and uncertainties, please see our most recent Form 10-K and 10-Q filed with the SEC. We caution you not to place any undue reliance on forward-looking statements and undertake no duty or obligation to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future events or changes in expectations. Also, please note that financial measures used on this call are expressed on a non-GAAP basis unless otherwise noted and have been adjusted to exclude certain charges. We have provided a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures in our earnings release posted today, furnished with the SEC and which can also be found in the Investor Relations section of our website. Now I'd like to introduce Badri Kothandaraman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Enphase Energy. Badri?
Badri Kothandaraman: Good afternoon. And thank you for joining us today to discuss our second quarter 2022 financial results. We had a good quarter, we reported record revenue of $530.2 million, achieved non-GAAP gross margin of 42.2% and generated free cash flow of $192 million and 37% of our Q2 microinverter shipments were IQ8. We exited Q2 at approximately 42, 13, 29, this means 42% gross margin, 13% operating expenses, and 29% operating income, all as a percentage of revenue on a non-GAAP basis. As a reminder, our baseline financial model is 35, 15, 20, Mandy will go into our financials later in the call. Let's now discuss how we are servicing customers. Our Q2 net promoter score or NPS worldwide was 68%, the same as in Q1 and our North American NPS was 71% compared to 74% in Q1. Our average call wait time increased to 4.7 minutes in Q2 compared to 3.2 minutes in Q1, primarily due to an increase in call volume related to the growth in the business. During Q2, we added customer service agents and field service technicians in U.S., Europe and Australia. We remain focused on customer service and ensuring that we are easy to do business with. Let's talk about our microinverter manufacturing. Our supply chain situation is quite stable due to diligent supplier management as well as qualification of alternate suppliers. With the growing demand for our products, we remain vigilant regarding the global supply chain and logistics challenges. Our quarterly capacity across all contract manufacturing facilities is around five million microinverters today. We're on track to begin manufacturing at Flex's factory in Romania starting in Q1 '23. This will enable a capacity of six million microinverters per quarter for us globally. We're also working on reducing manufacturing costs by adding more fully automated lines instead of semi automated lines. Let's talk about IQ batteries. We are on track to add an additional cell pack supplier early next year for our third generation battery. Our lead times for batteries are still around 14 to 16 weeks due to global logistics challenges. Let's move on to the regions, our U.S. and international revenue mix for Q2 was 80% and 20% respectively. We experienced strong growth in the U.S. and even stronger growth in Europe. In the U.S., revenue increased 15% sequentially, and 66% year-on-year. We are pleased to report record quarterly revenue in the U.S. and record sell through for our microinverters in Q2. We continue to win both large and small solar and storage installers. Our microinverter channel inventory was at a healthy level at the end of Q2 while our storage channel inventory was a little elevated due to longer installed times. In Europe, the revenue increased 69% sequentially and 89% year-on-year led by strong demand for our microinverters in Netherlands, France, Germany, Belgium, Spain and Portugal. We are starting to see good demand for our IQ batteries in Germany. Homeowners want self consumption as the region not only faces energy prices that are rising but also growing demand for home electrification driven both by electric vehicles proliferation, as well as natural gas shortages. We plan to introduce IQ batteries into a few more European countries later in the year. We also expect to ship our IQ8 family of microinverters into Netherlands and France later this year. Sector coupling is the latest buzzword in Germany and it denotes the integration of three sectors, the heating and cooling sector, the transport and mobility sector along with the power producing renewable sector, all three of them are required to achieve full home electrification. We're working towards sector coupling by making our solar plus battery system seamlessly work with third-party EV chargers and heat pumps and providing a single interface for homeowners to monitor and control their energy through the Enphase app. Bottom line we are quite happy with the progress in Europe, we're aggressively expanding the team. We expect this momentum to continue, supply is tight, the channel inventory continues to be below normal levels. We're working hard to get supply into the region. In Q3, we expect to grow revenue more than 40% compared to Q2. In Latin America, revenue increased 22% sequentially and 61% year-on-year. We had steady growth in our solar plus storage business in Puerto Rico during Q2. Now I will provide some color on Australia, Brazil and India. In Australia, we're starting to see the market beginning to recover from COVID interruptions as well as Federal Election. We remain optimistic about our growth in the country and expect to introduce IQ batteries in early 2023. As for Brazil and India, we continue to ramp IQ7A microinverters in Q2 and are starting to see a steady increase in demand quarter-on-quarter. Let's discuss the overall bookings for Q3. Our customer demand for Q3 is very robust and exceeds the higher end of our guidance range. The component availability is certainly better than what we have experienced in the last 18 months. This has enabled us to meet the growing demand. But there are still global logistics challenges that are not unique to Enphase. Let's discuss batteries. We introduced IQ batteries into North America two years ago in the third quarter of 2020. Since their introduction, we have grown battery shipments by an average of 28% per quarter over the last two years. We have certified more than 1,600 installers worldwide till date, and we are continuing to win around 15 new installers a week in the U.S. In the second quarter of 2022, we shipped 132.4 megawatt hours of IQ batteries, a 10% increase from the first quarter of 2022. In addition to North America, we're also ramping up batteries in Germany and Belgium. We have learned a lot in the last two years, we have made several improvements to both the installer and the homeowner experience. Currently our installers in North America are experiencing two plus hours of commissioning time which we would like to cut down by half. We're also updating the device firmware at both our distribution centers as well as in the channel to avoid updates by installers on site. We expect the commissioning time of 90 minutes as we exit Q3 and 60 minutes as we exit Q4. We also plan to release several software improvements for homeowners during Q3 for enhanced outage performance. For Q3, we expect to ship between 130 and 145 megawatt hours of IQ batteries. I recently visited the top installers in Puerto Rico in May and in Puerto Rico, the storage attached is 100%. I came away extremely excited about how our IQ batteries as well as IQ8 microinverters can provide a very highly differentiated solution compared to the competition. Both the sunlight jumpstart feature and the unlimited solar to battery ratio are really valuable to our installers, particularly in Puerto Rico, where outages are quite frequent. Our focus is to make the installer and homeowner experience seamless throughout these outages. While we're focused on providing a great experience with our current IQ batteries, we expect to introduce our third generation IQ batteries starting in North America in early 2023. We expect this battery to deliver double the power enabling homeowners to start heavy loads. The product will also use the robust wired cam protocol for seamless connectivity. We expect the third generation battery to have simple installation, leading to an improved customer experience. Let's now talk about our small commercial product. As previously discussed, we piloted IQ8B with a few installers in the second quarter, in order to receive feedback. The product has been working well and the feedback that we got was quite useful. The installers have told us that the module power for the small commercial business significantly higher as manufacturers are moving rapidly to the larger format cell. Given this, we're going to increase the AC power of the micro inverter in order to avoid potential clipping. We think it is prudent to do this now and introduce the product in early 2023. We understand this is a few more months of delay, but we are confident it's the right long-term decision. We are extremely bullish about the small commercial market, where we can add tremendous value to business owners and installers with our high quality, rapid shutdown capable and micro grid forming capability of our micro inverter systems. Let's discuss EV chargers. We acquired ClipperCreek in December of 2021, and the team is now fully integrated. We shipped more than 8,250 chargers in Q2, at a healthy gross margin and the business is quite profitable as well. We introduced EV chargers to our solar distributors and installers in Q2. And we also strengthened our digital marketing efforts to consumers. We are on track to manufacture Enphase branded EV chargers at our contract manufacturing facility in Mexico this quarter. This will help us scale capacity and drop costs. As for new products, we expect to introduce small TV chargers to customers in U.S. and Europe in the first half of '23. This will provide connectivity to the cloud through Wi-Fi as well as local connectivity to the home energy management system, allowing homeowners full visibility into monitoring and control of their Enphase solar plus storage plus EV system. As I've stated before, our strategy is to build a best-in-class home energy systems and deliver them to homeowners through our network of distributors and installers, enabled by our installer platform. So far, we talked about the key products on this call micro inverters, IQ batteries, EV chargers. Let's now talk about the installer platform. Before that some background. We acquired a total of five companies in the last six quarters. Four of those companies are geared to help installers become efficient. The company's we acquired provide lead generation services, solar design software, proposal and permitting services, and know NEM software platform for our installers. Our latest acquisition we did in March is SolarLeadFactory, which provides lead generation services for installers. We want to provide high quality leads to our network of installers in a cost effective manner. Currently, the quality of the leads in general in the solar industry is not very good. We therefore think we have a tremendous opportunity to improve the situation, as it is a big pain point for the U.S. installers. We acquired a company called Sofdesk in January of 2021 18 months ago, which provided us with solar design software capability. Our software business now has the record customer count in Q2 with approximately 950 installers using the solar graph software. We are making improvements to the software based on installer feedback and/or implementing new features including shading and 3D modeling for better accuracy, adding batteries and EV chargers into proposals and integrating electronic signature capabilities for contracts. We acquired a business in Noida in April of last year. This gave us the capability to provide proposal and permitting services to installers. Today, we service large installers and most of the work here is highly manual. We'd like to change that and are working on automation to scale the business and provide the services to our entire network of installers. The next one, in December 2021, we acquired a company in Arizona called 365 Pronto. The company's software platform enables a two-sided marketplace. The buyers or customers consisting of installers, asset owners, or original equipment manufacturers. The sellers or service providers consisting of technicians and third-party installers providing services for residential and commercial solar storage and EVs. Our vision is to simplify maintenance for our installer network by using the software platform and getting them access to a labor marketplace. With these acquisitions now in house, we have the right tools that we are combining into one platform to offer our installer network. We recognize the problems that the installers face such as soft costs, disparate tools, and manual processes, and are committed to building the platform to help minimize those. Let me now give you a quick update on our Enphase Installer Network or EIN. We have onboarded approximately 1,200 installers to our EIN worldwide through a highly selective process focused on install quality and an exceptional experience to homeowners across the globe. Next, let's talk about policy. I'd like to comment on a recent policy issue that is impacting the solar industry. As it pertains to NEM 3.0 in California, we submitted our comments to the proceeding in late June. We hope the CPUC will review the feedback from all stakeholders and eliminate the grid participation charge, while providing a glide path for the solar only market and incentivizing the solar plus storage market. With regarding the federal reconciliation package, despite the recent feedback, we will be actively engaged over the next couple of months to continue pushing for a climate deal that includes the solar ITC extension, and a new storage ITC. In summary, we are happy with our performance for the first half of 2022 and the strong demand for our micro inverters and batteries. Our markets in North America and Europe are growing at a tremendous rate as reflected in our numbers. We remain focused on our products and platform to deliver a superior customer experience for our installers, distributors, and homeowners. With that, I will turn the call over to Mandy for her review of our finances. Mandy?
Mandy Yang: Thanks, Badri. And good afternoon, everyone. I will provide more details related to our second quarter of 2022 financial results, as well as our business outlook for the third quarter of 2022. We have provided reconciliations of this non-GAAP to GAAP financial measures in our earnings release posted today, which can also be found in the IR section of our website. Total revenue for Q2 was $530.2 million, representing an increase of 20% sequentially, and a quarterly record. We shipped approximately 1,213 megawatt DC of microinverters and 132.4 million megawatt hours of IQ Batteries in a quarter. Non-GAAP gross margin for Q2 was 42.2% compared to 41% in Q1. The increase was driven by a favorable product mix. GAAP gross margin was 41.3% for Q2. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $71.2 million for Q2 compared to $66.3 million for Q1. The increase was driven by increased investment in R&D, customer service, sales, and IT infrastructure. GAAP operating expenses were $125 million for Q2 compared to $115.1 million for Q1. GAAP operating expenses for Q2 included $49.9 million of stock-based compensation expenses, and $3.9 million of acquisition related expenses and amortization for acquired intangible assets. On a non-GAAP basis, income from operations for Q2 was $152.4 million, compared to $114.5 million for Q1. On a GAAP basis, income from operations was $94 million for Q2, compared to $61.8 million for Q1. On a non-GAAP basis, net income for Q2 was $149.9 million, compared to $109.7 million for Q1. This resulted in non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.07 for Q2, compared to $0.79 for Q1. GAAP net income for Q2 was $77 million, compared to GAAP net income of $51.8 million for Q1. This resulted in GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.54 for Q2, compared to $0.37 for Q1. We exited Q2 with a total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balance of approximately $1.25 billion compared to approximately $1.06 billion at the end of Q1. In Q2, we generated $200.7 million in cash flow from operations and $192 million in free cash flow, which is more than double from Q1 as a result of our record revenue and improved cash conversion cycle on Q2. Capital expenditure was $8.7 million for Q2, compared to $12.4 million for Q1. Now let's discuss our outlook for the third quarter of 2022. We spent our revenue for the third quarter of 2022 to be within a range of $590 million to $630 million, which includes shipments of 130 to 145 megawatt hours of IQ batteries. We expect GAAP gross margin to be within a range of 38% to 41%. And non-GAAP gross margin to be within a range of 39% to 42%, which exclude stock-based compensation expense and acquisition related amortization. We spent our debt operating expenses to be within a range of $137 million to $141 million, including a total of approximately $60 million in the middle estimated for stock-based compensation expenses and acquisition related expenses and amortization. The estimated stock-based compensation expenses improved approximately $4.9 million earn out now tied to certain performance targets to be paid in the company's stock for the acquisition. We expect our non-GAAP operating expenses to be within a range of $77 million to $81 million. With a year-to-date profit reported, we expect to utilize all of our net operating loss and research tax credit carry forward in 2022, and become a U.S. cash taxpayer. As our non-GAAP tax expense reflect cash tax expense and reserve, we state our non-GAAP tax expense for the third quarter of 2020 to be approximately 10% of our non-GAAP profit before tax, and approximately 15% for Q4 '22. We expect GAAP tax expense to be approximately 24% of profit before tax for both third and fourth quarters of 2022. With that, I will now open the line for questions.
Operator: Thank you. And we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first question today will come from Brian Lee with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Brian Lee: Hey, guys, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the questions. Kudos on the great execution here. First question I had was just on the gross margin guidance. It's the first time since 2020, that you've raised the non-GAAP gross margin range upwards to now 39% to 42%. So just wondering how much of that is simply IQ8 mix and better margins on that product? Or are you also seeing better I guess battery storage margins versus expectations and then maybe finally, is Europe also helping on the margins in terms of expansion, just maybe some of the puts and takes there on the gross margin guide and what's driving it and then had a follow-up.
Badri Kothandaraman: Yes, I mean mainly it is IQ8. It's as simple as that. And with Europe margins and U.S. margins are equivalent for us.
Brian Lee: Okay, fair enough. And then you're clearly doing well in Europe, it seems like you're gaining share, can you speak a little bit Badri as to kind of where you're seeing the share gains? Who you're gaining share from? And then can you kind of talk about, it sounds like the 69% sequential growth was microinverters, as opposed to battery. And so is this a number where as batteries start to become a bit of a bigger part of the mix. And given the higher ASPs, you could actually see another kind of tailwind in the region. I know you're talking about 40% sequential here into 3Q but as we look beyond I guess the next couple quarters, could you even see an acceleration once batteries become a bigger part of the mix in that region? Thanks.
Badri Kothandaraman: Yes, a few answers here. The growth mainly came -- comes from Netherlands and Germany. And basically, you're right that Q2 growth is more growth comes from solar. But storage also grew quite well. For Q3, actually quite balanced. We expect growth to be equally good on solar and storage. And what's happening in Netherlands right. So, Netherlands, we are quite strong there. We service the long tail of installers. They like us because of our quality. And many of the other suppliers have been unable to ship product in these times. And in addition, the utility rates are also rising. So there's a natural momentum in Netherlands and considering the geopolitical situation is even more accelerated. So they're extremely happy about Netherlands and the name of the game for us is to get a lot more supply into the region. That's why we embarked on building the Flex plant in Romania where we can have the microinverters coming out in Europe versus getting shipped from elsewhere. On Germany, it's fascinating. We are quite small in Germany, let me say that first. But the German market is a big market. The last I heard is it's roughly two gigawatts residential time adopting solar. And I'm hearing 80% attach, so two gigawatts times 80% is 1.6 gigawatt hours of batteries, that's the market. So very healthy market. And there are about 5,000 long-tail installers in Germany. And what they need is they need high quality, they need reduced installation time, because they always have labor issues. And every installation is accompanied every solar installation is accompanied by a battery, by a EV charger, which is virtually free due to the rebates. And then normally heat pumps as well. So they require us to basically work with third-party EV chargers, third-party heat pumps, which we are working very hard to have that capability. And we expect to have that shortly. So, it's very similar to what we have told you for the U.S., we would like to provide that single interface for the homeowner, where everything shows up in the app, solar, storage, home loads, EV, heat pumps, he have the capability to monitor and control the things he wants. And with the utility rates being so high, and feed in tariff in Germany, the only option is self consumption. Self consumption means you utilize all solar, figure out ways to utilize all solar which is store it in a battery, use it later. Right do green charging for electric vehicle, do green charging for heat pumps. So lots of interesting, interesting opportunities, lots of work for us to do on Home Energy Management. But I think, this is our strength. And so this is where we have tremendous opportunity. And that's why we expect to grow disproportionately in that region. And in fact, Germany is going to grow, although the numbers are small, Germany, the numbers are quite big in terms of growth from Q2 to Q3, percentage growth is quite big. That's the story in Netherlands, Germany.
Brian Lee: All right, appreciate the color. I will pass it on here.
Badri Kothandaraman: Thank you.
Operator: And our next question will come from Phil Shen with ROTH Capital Partners. Please go ahead.
Philip Shen: Hey, everyone congrats on the strong results. Wanted to dig in deeper into Europe, specifically, if you could talk through the FX headwind there. In spite of that you guys delivered an amazing guide, just wanted to understand to what degree FX impacted Q2, and even the Q3 guide, can you quantify that at all and then can you talk through how you expect to manage that going forward as Europe grows over time? Thanks.
Mandy Yang: Sure, so our FX exposure currently is very limited, we generate 80% of our revenue in the U.S. and 20% from International and also if you look at our expenses, right, certain international expenses actually are in foreign currencies. So we have a little bit natural hedge there for our revenue. With that said, we are actually evaluating FX hedging programs for our European revenue given we are growing very fast there. In terms of our Q3 guidance, we are factoring in our Q3 revenue and gross margin guidance using very conservative Euro FX rates. So we are good there. So, all-in-all our exposure currently is very limited.
Operator: And our next question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith. Please go ahead.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Hey, congratulations, team. Very nicely done again. If I can just following up on some of the Q3 commentary here, just looking at the storage numbers 130 to 145. How are you thinking about the exit rate, that mark down earlier 180 was kind of the earlier contemplated rate, how are you thinking about that ramp here. Can you talk about some of the nuances that you alluded to in the script earlier?
Badri Kothandaraman: Yes, I mean we are incredibly excited about battery. Let me say that, we have grown at an average rate of 28% per quarter, over the last two years. And we are proud of certifying more than 1,600 installers worldwide, long-tail installers are our focus. And we continue to win 15 installers a week in the U.S. In the second quarter, we were 10% higher than the first quarter, we did about 132 megawatt hours and we are shipping into three countries, North America, Germany, as well as Belgium. We've learned a lot, we have made a lot of improvements, I would say still our commissioning times need to improve, we still have two plus hours of commissioning time. And because of that, what happens is, we do have a little bit more inventory in the channel than what I'd like. So we are going to get to the bottom of it, we are confident of getting that under control. And we are going to unleash the demand back up again. And so we're extremely confident, I talked about our trip to Puerto Rico. And there is huge opportunities for us and we expect to get our fair share of that. So, bottom line is we, we expect to grow in batteries, we expect to get the commissioning times fully under control in Q3. And although we don't guide to the 180 number that you talked about, we expect to continuously grow.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it, at the similar trajectory of 28%?
Badri Kothandaraman: Yes, we're not going to guide, when you are going from -- yes, let's say for example, when you go from 10 megawatt hours to 20 megawatt hours, that's a 50% increase, but then the next quarter you go from 20 to 30, that's only that's a lesser increase basically, right. So you need to understand that even a 10% growth quarter-on-quarter is very healthy, that's 40% for the year. And I'm not saying we will grow at 10% every quarter, maybe more, maybe less. But we love the business, we think we are well positioned, our market is the long tail of installers, the moment we make it a lot easier for them in terms of commissioning time, the floodgates will open and we expect to continuously grow.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Hey and just a quick clarification of the earlier question here, just related to the gross margins I mean obviously just very impressive here but as it pertains to IQ8 and where you are I mean I think you're not even a 40% on IQ8 deployment and you're already hitting this increasing gross margin trajectory, in the art of the possible where can we go in gross margins here also considering obviously ramping geographies that could weigh here et cetera. But can you elaborate little bit?
Badri Kothandaraman: Yes, I mean we IQ8 provides a lot of value. Three things is sunlight, backup. Basically, when the grid is out, IQ8 continues to work and provides power, one; number two, it removes any limit on solar to storage ratio, which is the limit of today. In other words, you can have a lot of solar with very tiny storage, and the extreme end being zero storage, that's number two. Number three is sunlight jumpstart, which means that in other batteries when you completely drain the battery, because you use it overnight, and you accidentally drained it, you accidentally drained it in the morning, IQ8 can come and independently jumpstart the batteries. Because it can provide -- it can generate its own microgrid and kickstart the battery. So there is three big differentiators. And we do value based pricing, which is since we are different, since we add value, we expect to get the right price for it. Now so as the IQ8 percentage increases in North America, we expect the margins to kind of drag that which is going up. The second thing is in Europe, for example, in Europe, grids are quite stable. Like for example, in Germany, the installers aren't even, they weren't even interested in backup, they only wanted self-consumption. So the value that they associate with sunlight backup is a little bit less compared to the U.S. So there, we may not get as much value, but we'll get a little bit. So to answer your question, as the percentage of IQ8 become more and more, our gross margins will go up and we will guide them appropriately. That's why we increased up the gross margin by a point right now.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Okay, we shall see. Thank you guys.
Operator: And our next question will come from Colin Rusch with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.
Colin Rusch: Thanks so much, guys. Could you talk a little bit about the competitive landscape from a technology perspective around grid formation and the batteries? Obviously, that's been a point where you guys have led the market, but are you seeing folks start to catch up with you or find workarounds for some of that functionality?
Raghu Belur: So hi, this is Raghu. The way again, what we provide is important, right. We are trying -- we have with the home energy management solution that we have, we are providing a very comprehensive solution. This is not just about the solar part, not just about the battery part or just about the EV part or managing the heat pump, et cetera. Our goal is to provide a one stop shop, a completely comprehensive solution. And everything is managed from software with a home energy management system. This is true in Europe. And actually, it's true here as well. So for us, our value-add when we think about relative to competition is not look at any one single piece. Although we have to be better than them in every individual component that we are building. But it is about looking at the overall solution. So the homeowner has a great experience where they have one app, and they see they get unprecedented visibility into the performance of their entire system. Same thing true for an installer partners as well. They get trained by one company to deliver all of the different components on how to install them, how to commission them, et cetera. And if there is any problem it is one phone call to make during the warranty issues that occur to go to one company. So we expect entire end-to-end solution is where how we differentiate ourselves from everybody else. And we feel like we have done a good job vis-à-vis the competition.
Colin Rusch: I'll take it offline. And I want to just get in a little bit more specific on that. So my follow-up is really about new geographies in the U.S. Can you talk about the number of installers that are your training in new geographies and how some of those emerging markets within the U.S. are developing and potentially driving growth on your core business here?
Badri Kothandaraman: Yes, I mean, like what I said, we certify a lot of installers. I think the last earnings call I said 1,300 I don't remember and now it is 1,600. So we certify a few hundreds of installers a quarter. We work with the long tail of installers in all GEOs all regions in the U.S. Like what I said Puerto Rico, trade market, very interesting market only when I went and saw there. It was quite eye opening for me on the number of times they had a power shut down every day. And there the requirements, for example, are a little bit different from California where the grid is by and large table, right. So this basically gave us a completely new perspective on hey, we need to make sure the homeowner experience through outages. The outage performance of our app needs to be flawless. And the installer experience and the homeowner experience have to be good. So those are the kinds of things we learn. And we do it across all the states, we have salespeople, we have FAEs, we have field sales technicians. They are the ones who will help these 300 installers that we certify. By certification, we mean they have to do the training course plus, they have to complete the first install. And we do have some challenges on the commissioning. So we do initial hand holding with the help of our field service technicians. And then we unleashed installers. And we got to get better like what I said -- I would, yes I would call Nirvana when I do a half an hour commissioning. And I don't even need to train the installers. That's where we are trying to get to, because we recognize that all of the installers will install batteries if they make money on batteries. And in order for them to make money, we Enphase needs to take the lead and help them with standardizing the workflow with streamlining the way the product works and take care of any problems they have immediately. So we are doing all of them with upfront training and round tables and field service technicians and FAEs and our salespeople.
Colin Rusch: Okay, thanks so much, Badri. Appreciate it.
Operator: And our next question will come from Kashy Harrison with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.
Kashy Harrison: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the questions and congrats, another strong update. Badri, you mentioned in Germany, that sector coupling across heating, cooling transport, power has become the topic du jour, obviously core businesses power and you're now participating and expanding into the transport mobility side via EV charging. But I was wondering if you could share any commentary on the heating, cooling and the heating and cooling space. Do you see any opportunities for Enphase to add value within that sector or is that somewhere where it may not be as enticing to you at this point?
Badri Kothandaraman: No at this point, sector coupling is quite complex. We are scratching the surface here by basically providing the capability for the solar plus storage system to connect to heat pumps and electric vehicles. And for electric vehicles there is a fairly reasonable standard called as OCPP which we need to be compliant with and then we can connect to all third-party electric vehicles. On heat pumps, it is still a rudimentary standard called as SG ready standard, there are four modes of operation, which are relatively trivial to implement. They -- all of them, the EVs, the heat pump, solar storage home loads, when you integrate all of them, then you provide the complete control to the homeowner at their fingertips. And we know at least now, yes, at least for now, we don't plan to go and do anything as far as the heating and cooling sector is concerned. We just want to make sure that we enable the sector coupling by achieving interoperability with EV chargers and heat pumps. That's what we're looking at now.
Kashy Harrison: Got it. That makes perfect sense. And then as my follow-up, it's quite evident that you're showing excellent operating leverage in both 2Q results and 3Q guidance based on non-GAAP OpEx as a percentage of sales. I was just wondering if your views on the appropriate levels of non-GAAP OpEx investments are evolving as the company gains increasing scale. And then maybe part and parcel of that, we've obviously it sounds like the labor market in Silicon Valley is cooling. Just wondering if you're seeing any opportunities to optimize that on the corporate G&A side? Thank you.
Badri Kothandaraman: Right. Our baseline 3515 and 3520, that 15 stands for operating expenses as a function of revenue, non-GAAP. We don't plan to deviate from that. We are well under that, one of the advantages that we have is we are able to get talent at. We are able to have the right people at the right places, which means we're able to get a lot of good talent in places like in the -- in places like New Zealand, in Austin, in China, we are able to get the talent that we need. And because we are growing fast, we are able to keep our operating expenses under control. So we don't plan to deviate from the in-person. We don't plan to compromise on any new products. We will get everything that is necessary. With regarding what you said on interesting opportunities created by the recent layoffs in Silicon Valley and other places. I mean, we're always looking for talent at the same time we are always cautious. We don't like to go overboard. If we see people who are outstanding, we won't hesitate to pick it up. But it's easy to get fat here. And we are very disciplined. You can expect us to always meet the 15% with margins. And still not compromise on R&D, because we are growing so fast.
Operator: And our next question will come from Mark Strouse with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Mark Strouse: Yes, good afternoon. Thank you very much for taking my questions. Most of them have been asked. First one, though just given Europe is accelerating beyond what you were calling for just even a few months ago. Just curious you can go back to kind of the manufacturing expansion there. So Romania is still on track for 1Q '23. I believe you've said that's about 750,000 micros. When do you think you need to make a decision to potentially increase that or move elsewhere in Europe. And in Canada can you talk about the opportunities to expand your manufacturing in Europe, but do it profitably, perhaps outside of Romania or Eastern Europe?
Badri Kothandaraman: Yes, I think the decision is staring at our face. I mean, it's kind of obvious, we should get a lot more than 750 to 1,000 microinverters. We are going to make that happen. But first, let's get our manufacturing and production done by Q1 '23. And I think we can immediately add another full auto line and we can take it up to a couple of million units very quickly from Romania.
Mark Strouse: From Romania. Okay. And then just a quick follow-up, Badri, I'm sorry if I missed this, but the -- previously you've been talking about adding a third battery supplier in the second half of this year just tiny with magnitude?
Badri Kothandaraman: Yes, today we have two suppliers A123 and ATL and we are on track to add a third supplier and for our third generation battery, and that will start to ship hopefully in the first quarter of '23. And that time, we will have a third supplier qualified.
Mark Strouse: Okay, fair enough. Thank you.
Operator: And our next question will come from Eric Stine with Craig-Hallum. Please go ahead.
Eric Stine: Hi, everyone. Thanks for taking the questions. So you mentioned the supply chain, starting to show some improvement, but I know that as this has been the case in past quarters and 3Q guide is still well below demand. Just wondering, if you're able to quantify that, how much below the demand level or at least how that's trend in quarter-over-quarter?
Badri Kothandaraman: Yes, we usually don't quantify that. It's a matter of lead times. Basically, our battery lead times are 14 to 16 weeks. That means if an order comes today, it's going to take us 16 weeks to service it. Our microinverter lead times are almost, I would say, eight to 10 weeks. So that's a little bit better. Yes, I mean, the balance for us is to make sure that, that we always look at channel inventory all the time for microinverters and storage and do not get ahead of ourselves. The one place where I wish I could ship more to zero, because the channel inventory there is quite bright. And but it takes cycle time for us to do that. We have to get product there without compromising our schedules to other customers. That's always a challenge. And we are very determined to not upset other customers who have already placed orders. So we are very strict in all of that. Yes, that's how we were.
Eric Stine: Okay, that's helpful. And then maybe just on the manufacturing footprint. I know that when Romania comes on, you'll have the ability are targeting 6 million microinverters a quarter, I think you did what 3.4 in this quarter? I mean, I know it's dependent on geography. But, I mean, do you have kind of a timeframe or maybe big picture, when you think you'll be pushing up against that $6 million and then potentially, obviously need to add more?
Badri Kothandaraman: I mean if you look at it, if you look at our guidance, midpoint of guidance for Q3, that's 610. And if you look at what is the percentage growth, from Q2 530 to 610, that's basically roughly around 15%. So you see, you can that's a proxy for microinverter growth from Q2 to Q3, you correctly pointed out 3.3 million micros in Q2, you apply 15%, that becomes something like 3.8 million, maybe 3.9 million micros in Q3. And of course, I mean, not going to break what future quarters growth rate, but you can do the math. Within a few quarters, we will run up against the sixth. Like what I said, it's a no brainer for us to basically make the decision on the Flex Romania plant to add one more line. Of course, we are going to do that. We'd like to get some data from the plants on the current microinverters first, and then we'll make those decisions. But I mean, it's easy for us to or we have sufficient time to make these decisions because we evaluate these every quarter. And we have options to add, we can add in Chennai, Salcomp, we can add in Guad, Mexico for servicing U.S. customers. We can add in Flex, Romania for servicing Europe customers. And we can also add in Fuyong, China for servicing Australia customers if we need. So everything is flexible, everything can be expandable. And all we need to do is to make the decisions at the right times.
Eric Stine: Okay, thanks.
Badri Kothandaraman: Thank you.
Operator: And our next question will come from James West with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.
James West: Hey, good afternoon, Badri.
Badri Kothandaraman: Hi.
James West: A question on your EV charging business, the ClipperCreek EVs, you talked about two things, one is moving to the contract manufacturer in Mexico and I'm curious how much scale you might be able to add to the production by doing that. And then secondarily you're making the chargers smarter, integrated them into your home energy management system and curious in the timeline to achieve that?
Badri Kothandaraman: Yes, basically, we should be able to do several multiples of the number I gave you.
James West: Okay.
Badri Kothandaraman: So that's why we are doing it to achieve a lot of scale. And then with regarding the making the charger smart, we expect that to be done by the first half of 2023 for both chargers shipping into the U.S. and Europe.
James West: Okay, that's helpful. And then follow-up for me on the cash balances here. I mean, great free cash flow during the quarter, you've got $2.2 billion or so, what do you expect to do with that capital going forward as more M&A on the horizon, is there other return of capital to shareholders things like that you're contemplating?
Badri Kothandaraman: Yes, I mean again the answers are very similar to what I've given in the past, the first thing for us is take care of the needs of the business is, if we need a different, if we need an auto line, if we need something special on the batteries, if we need to buy software, take care of the means of the business that comes first -- have plenty of cash to do that, if we need to expand the facility, for example in the U.S., we need to build a new reliability lab. So I can go on and on. So that's number one priority, number two priority is evaluate continuous pipeline of acquisitions. The areas that we are interested are for example, EV charging is a potential area, we are interested mainly on the software, on the software side to get more software capability. Number two, the second thing we are interested in as potential acquisition targets are anything interesting in batteries, right, anything interest not manufacturing of batteries, but battery systems innovation there, we're interested there, that's two. And then third is home energy management systems, the ability to not only network to things outside the home, such as EV chargers or heat pumps, the ability to network things inside the home, to provide that comprehensive experience to the homeowner. So these three are the things we will be continuously looking at, we might still do some more acquisitions on the platform side of things in order to round it up. That's my next priority to basically look at the acquisitions in those areas. And then the last one is, if we take care of number one, and number two, which is plenty of cash required for the business, have plenty of cash for M&A in certain key specific areas. If those two are taken care of, then we look at buying back shares, there we look at is our share price, do we believe our share price is below a conservatively estimated intrinsic value? And it's not my idea. This is Warren Buffett has taught everybody. And so it's quite logical there and the key question is always how do you estimate your intrinsic value? How do you be conservative, so we have our own formulas for that. And then if we feel that's the right time we'll buy shares, if not, no.
James West: Okay. Very helpful. Thanks, Badri.
Badri Kothandaraman: Okay..
Operator: And our next question will come from Ameet Thakkar with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Ameet Thakkar: Hi, good afternoon. Thanks for squeezing me in and congratulations on the quarter. Just one quick one from me. I think on the third quarter earnings call last year, you guys talked a little bit about ocean freight being eight times more looks like some of the data suggests that ocean freight rates have actually come in a little bit. I was just wondering if you guys seen any benefit in that and was any of that reflected in the quarter? Certainly your lead times haven't really shrunk yet, but just on the ocean freight rates?
Badri Kothandaraman: Yes, the lead times have been shrunk but you're correct, the ocean freight rates have gotten a little better, not a lot better. We are expecting them to continuously from now.
Ameet Thakkar: All right, thanks guys.
Operator: And our next question will come from Maheep Mandloi with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
Maheep Mandloi: Hey good evening, and thanks for taking questions. I think most of the questions have been asked, maybe one on the policy side on the Section 301, are you hearing anything around that as we come to potential hearings against renewing that later this year and the expectations on what would happen on that?
Badri Kothandaraman: No we are not hearing anything specific. That's just some general news that we are hearing about will there be some relief from tariffs given the situation given the economic situation right now, but there is no specific action that we have come across that there'll be any specific relief on that.
Maheep Mandloi: Thanks. And just a last question from me on the revenue growth here. Could you talk about how much we've seen from Europe, LATAM and other regions versus U.S. in Q3 like and anything to help us understand the top-line beat here? Thanks.
Badri Kothandaraman: So Maheep are you asking about Q3, or you asking about Q2?
Maheep Mandloi: Q3.
Badri Kothandaraman: In Q3, we already said, we already gave you specifically on Europe that we do expect to grow revenue in Europe by 40%, compared to Q2. So basically in the U.S., we will grow at very healthy levels. Our U.S. contribution obviously, is very high proportion of revenue. So we will grow at very healthy levels in the U.S., in Europe due to the geopolitical issues, utility prices that are rising, the end, many of our competitors are unable to supply. We have an incredible opportunity in Europe. And we grew 59% -- 69% from Q1 to Q2 in Europe, and we are forecasting to grow by at least another 40% from Q2 to Q3.
Maheep Mandloi: Got you. Appreciate the clarification. Thanks.
Badri Kothandaraman: Thank you.
Operator: And our next question will come from Joseph Osha with Guggenheim Partners. Please go ahead.
Joseph Osha: Hi, everybody. Coming back to the storage business, I know this might be a hard question to answer. If you weren't supply constrained, looking at the remainder of this year, just maybe the current quarter, how much do you think you could ship? I'm just trying to understand what you think underlying demand here is and then I have a follow-up?
Badri Kothandaraman: I mean, like what I said, we are incredibly bullish about the demand. And our installers are incredibly bullish about using Enphase, what we need to get under control is what I talked about, our channel inventory is a little bit high, our commissioning times are a little bit high, we are going to work on them. And this will unleash the demand. So we're not worried about demand. We are growing quarter-on-quarter, we expect to grow, we continue to expect that the growth will be healthy in the coming quarters.
Joseph Osha: So to be clear, it's really more about commissioning time and channel inventories than necessarily cell constraints per se. Is that a correct way of putting it?
Badri Kothandaraman: Yes, I mean we do have longer lead times 14 to 16 weeks, but we have made now, we don't think cell will be a constraint and we have lined up the right capacity that we need for the future once we solve these issues.
Joseph Osha: Okay, thank you. And then unrelated question, Kashy I think was kind of touching on this a little earlier. To what extent do you think V2H or maybe even further down the road V2G functionality might could become a part of your EV charging offering. And that's it for me. Thank you.
Raghu Belur: Absolutely, it has to be a core part of our offering because we see that it brings significant amount of value to the homeowner by doing that. So for example, in the case of V2H where you're in a situation where you may have a grid outage, not only will you have say 10 or 20 kilowatt hours of stationary storage to help you through that outage, you will have IQ8 on the roof that will also support you through that outage, you have an additional 80 to 100 kilowatt hours of storage available to significantly expand out the outage period that can be supported. So absolutely V2H is going to be a key -- is a key part of our strategy. We want to bring that vehicle on to our ensemble platform, so that we can effectively manage it. With regards to vehicle to grid, we are the guys who really understand very well how to connect our systems to grids. Things such as grid profiles, things such as dynamic requirements around how grid profiles are going to change, all of those things we are extremely good at. And so with vehicle to grid if we can, again, if the right structure business model and business structure is available, where the homeowner can be compensated for allowing the car to be discharged onto the grid in order to provide things like grid services and grid support absolutely that's a good business model. And we will support it with all the technology and like I said, we are absolutely the right guys to do it. Now, in order to get there eventually to make that car completely bi-directional, there has to be some standards development work not necessarily technology development, we feel like the technology is available, whether that is done through a DC to AC conversion that occurs externally or on board through by making the bi-directional -- by making the charger, the Level 2 charger with touch within the car. Bi-directional, we feel like we are very well positioned to do all of those in. And with regard to standards, we're actually actively participating in the standards body to drive standards to allow for bi-directionality. I think it's going to take some time but we are actively involved. We are also engaging very closely with a number of EV manufacturers, we are working on some developing some highlights with them. So we're very actively involved. That is part of our EV roadmap. What Badri mentioned, the connectivity part and the control part is just that smart EV charger. That's the only the very first step on a much broader roadmap that we have for EV chargers.
Joseph Osha: Okay, thank you very much.
Raghu Belur: Thank you.
Operator: And our next question will come from Gus Richard with Northland. Please go ahead.
Gus Richard: Yes, thanks for taking the question. I think the guide for battery this quarter was 130 megawatt hours to 145. And I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit about what would cause you to fall on the low end of that range and or the high end of that range? And that's it for me.
Badri Kothandaraman: Yes, I mean we are typically conservative in our guidance, we'd like to make sure that one of the things we look at is we look at channel, we look at inventory, we are hawks at monitoring that, we're extremely disciplined. So we gave ourselves a slightly wider range this time. But like what I said, we are incredibly bullish about our business, we -- the installers love using our product. We meet with 10 to 15 installers every week. We take down all of the issues that they have, and all of the things that Enphase needs to do in order to make sure their life becomes easier. We take those actions, we go execute them. So yes, I mean, we are quite happy with where we are. We have grown at a 28% rate, an average rate in the last two years, that's not too shabby. And we are forecasting continuous increase.
Gus Richard: Got it. Thanks so much.
Badri Kothandaraman: Thank you.
Operator: And our next question will come from Praneeth Satish with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Praneeth Satish: Thanks. Obviously very strong growth in Europe. I want to touch briefly on the Netherlands. I think there's some new net metering rules that are going to go into place there next year. Can you talk about how that will impact Enphase that good or bad? And will you see an acceleration due to more battery deployment? Where could attach rates go? Just curious for your thoughts on that?
Raghu Belur: Yes, so the struggle -- as a means of clarification, it was net metering was supposed to do. Those are glide path out of net metering starting at the end of next year. But right now, there are discussions that that net metering could be pushed out by an additional couple of years. So the good and the bad debt is of course, we will expect, of course solar continues to expand and our net metering is a fantastic incentive program. And solar is going to continue to expand into rate that's happening as we speak and for the reasons that Badri alluded to, which is a home electrification and the need for self-consumption. So the flip side to that, of course is that we were expecting battery deployment in Netherlands to increase starting in 2023 in preparation for the sunsetting of net metering, and I think that's going to get pushed out probably by another 12 to 24 months. But all in all Netherlands is growing at a -- and we are very strong in Netherland. And Netherlands are growing at a very, very good rate for us. It's solar centered to around solar. And Netherland, if you look at it it's one the subset of sector coupling in that it says EV adoption is extremely high in Netherlands. And so it's a combination of solar and EV and now there is a heat pump adoption also increasing there as the government is pushing to sunset, the use of natural gas. And of course, natural gas is obviously in shortage as well. So all in all, Netherlands is an excellent market for us with solar and then eventually EV and storage as well.
Praneeth Satish: Got it. And then just staying on Europe. I mean, it sounds like you're gaining share, partly because competitors don't have supply. So I guess what happens when competitors there rebuild supply? Do you think that'll impact your growth? Or do you think once an installer tries an Enphase product, they don't go back to competitors? Like it's just how durable is the growth? Thanks.
Badri Kothandaraman: Well, we cannot be arrogant. We need to create meaning. We need to provide value to the installers, which is high quality, which we think we are quite good there when compared to competition. So we are good there in terms of customer experience. We pride ourselves on net promoter score and answering the calls. We need to continue to do that. That's a big differentiator for Enphase. The last one is what -- yes, it's what I've said the sector coupling, making sure that we take care of the homeowner to not have disparate things in his home, which are unconnected. It is one experience, manage your energy. Ensure that things like EV chargers and heat pumps are connected seamlessly to the home energy management system. Do that flawlessly. Take care of customers. We need to learn that business. So I have no qualms that this business is here to stay. But we will focus on quality and customer experience. And usually if we get that right, the customers will stick.
Praneeth Satish: Thank you.
Operator: And our next question will come from Jeff Osborne with Cowen and Company. Please go ahead. Hello, Jeff, your line is open.
Jeff Osborne: Yes, sorry about that. Thanks for squeezing me in. I appreciate the commentary so far. I was wondering if you can comment on the IQ8 mix over time. Where do you think that can go? I know there's some customers like SunPower they're still using IQ7. Is there a possibility that that can go to 80% or 100% over time? Or what's the ultimate destination in terms of Mix?
Badri Kothandaraman: Yes, I mean, we're not going to comment on specific customers, but our target is to get to 90% by the second quarter of 2023.
Jeff Osborne: Got it. And then quick one for Raghu. Is there any progress that you can share on the gallium nitride development for IQ9?
Raghu Belur: Yes, I don't have any specific details to share. But in terms of technology, absolutely, we are continuing to develop the gallium nitride based microinverter. So you're probably at the next Analyst Day we may have more things to share, but right now the development is happening.
Badri Kothandaraman: Yes, I'll give you some color. Thing we understand whom to work with. We are -- the devices come in a similar form factor that we are used to for the high voltage fits today silicone fits, which is great. We need to do work on the transformers which we understand and it's well underway. We need to work on the gate drivers, which we understand that's well underway. So I think it is the matter of 12 to 18 months, and I think we are going to have the first gallium nitride product.
Jeff Osborne: [Indiscernible].
Badri Kothandaraman: Yes.
Operator: And our next question will come from Biju Perincheril with Susquehanna. Please go ahead.
Biju Perincheril: Hi, thanks for taking my question. Had a question on the U.S. micros, and so based on some of the texts that we've done, looks like the longtail installers are maybe able to control their costs a little better than some of the larger installers. So are you seeing any indications that the installers on EIN, are they gaining market share when you look at them as collectively. Just wondering if that's a tailwind for the domestic business?
Badri Kothandaraman: We don't see exactly what you said, we do see that the demand is very strong. We do see both installers doing well. The big installers as well as the small installers. The small installers, usually, they understand, they are local, they understand what the homeowners, they understand about the area, they can give more personalized service. And that that kind of business, the long tail of installers is where we add the most value, because they don't want to be on calls with reference to quality issues or service issues. So we had the most value there. But we aren't seeing, one category versus the other category changing much right now.
Biju Perincheril: Okay, got it. And I had a follow-up on battery shipments. I think in the past, you had some installers, maybe waiting on features like load control and things like that. So is there sort of a similar dynamic now with it seeing the 5P product as is still coming out second half of the year? And then you mentioned the next generation battery coming out in next year?
Badri Kothandaraman: Yes, the -- yes, just to say that, we already have load controllers that are available to our installers, first generation load controllers. We have generator compatibility available to our installers. So all of those are fully available today. The IQ battery 5P is our third generation battery that's going to be available in the early 2023, is what I said. And that's the first quarter of 2023 is what I said. And that the focus for that battery is high power, double the power, both continuous and peak power. And is to basically do some more improvements in overall commissioning. And go to a wired form of connectivity versus wireless. Just, you don't focus on removing any pain points for the installer and homeowner.
Operator: And our next question will come from Sophie Karp with KeyBanc. Please go ahead.
Sophie Karp: Hi, good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. Just wanted to follow-up on the mix of IQ7, right? How what is -- do you elaborate on the strategy of how you are shifting that mix in the U.S. and in Europe? In other words, is there more penetration of IQ8 in the U.S. versus Europe vice versa, and…
Badri Kothandaraman: All regions will move to IQ8 eventually, that's what I said. We will move to IQ8 and 90% of our microinverters will be IQ8 by the second quarter of 2023. We've gotten started with the U.S. 37% of our overall microinverter shipment this quarter was like where IQ8 and primarily into U.S., North America. But we are soon going to start introducing IQ8 microinverters into Europe. Later this year, we're going to start with Netherlands, France, and then move on to Germany and the other countries. So our plan is to get to 90% by Q2 '23.
Sophie Karp: So in the U.S. as you're rolling this out, have you seen any -- I don't know like pricing feedback on them from dealers. So maybe is there any risk at all that's the major losing share if you transition to IQ8 based on pricing to some cheaper alternative. So how should we think about that?
Badri Kothandaraman: Absolutely not. No share loss. It is that when we explain the value of IQ8 to people they do understand. And like what I said there's some like backup there is unlimited solar storage ratio and the concept of sunlight jumpstart when the battery is dead. The concept of sunlight jumpstart which are highly differentiated features from competition. So they do understand that now, when, if they have a short term problem in terms of conversion that we aren't able to ship IQ7 to them, for example, in the next few days, weeks, we do understand the situation and we work with them, so that the pricing is palatable for them for a short term until they then start paying the full price for IQ8. So yes.
Operator: And our next question will come from Cameron Lochridge with Stephens. Please go ahead.
Cameron Lochridge: Hey, good afternoon. I appreciate you taking my questions. I guess I want to start really just on European price cost dynamics budget. I think I heard you say earlier, Europe gross margins are at parity with the U.S. And so I was just kind of want to unpack that a little bit. Is that is -- are you able to comment on the pricing dynamics in Europe versus the U.S. that potentially allows you to maintain that gross margin parities or is there something on the cost side that maybe comes out in Europe, that that enables that gross margin parity?
Badri Kothandaraman: There's nothing on the cost side, it's basically we work with long tail installers in the -- in Europe, they care about a lot of things, they do care about price, but they care about quality and service even more. And we are able to get -- we are able to price them appropriately for the value we provide.
Cameron Lochridge: Got it. Thanks for that. Switching real quick to batteries. I think last quarter, you mentioned that your battery device is able to be paired with pretty much any inverter on the market. And correct me if I'm wrong there. But I guess if you could comment on what percentage of your battery sales right now go to third-party or paired with third-party inverter solutions versus your own. And how you see that developing over time?
Badri Kothandaraman: That was specific to Europe where we what we did was we released, we made our IQ batteries compatible to third-party string inverters. And we are just getting started there. We don't have much statistics right now to give you, but the name of the game was quite simple. Many of the homes in Germany and Belgium already had solar from string inverters. And they were installed quite some time ago, and they need batteries and they were not getting batteries. So it was a very popular. It was a popular demand from the installer, saying why don't you make your batteries interoperable with other string inverters and we did that.
Operator: And this will conclude our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Badri Kothandaraman for any closing remarks.
Badri Kothandaraman: Yes, thank you for joining us today and for your continued support of Enphase. We look forward to speaking with you again next quarter. Bye.
Operator: The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines at this time.

===== 2022 Q1  (2022-04-26 16:30:00) =====
Operator: Thank you for standing by and welcome to the Enphase Energy’s First Quarter 2022 Financial Results Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers’ presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today’s program is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today’s program, Karen Sagot. Please go ahead.
Karen Sagot: Good afternoon. Thank you for joining us on today’s conference call to discuss Enphase Energy’s first quarter 2022 results. On today’s call are Badri Kothandaraman, Enphase’s President and Chief Executive Officer; Mandy Yang, Chief Financial Officer, and Raghu Belur, Chief Products Officer. After the market closed today, Enphase issued a press release announcing the results for its first quarter ended March 31, 2022. During this conference call, Enphase management will make forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to statements related to our expected future financial performance, the capabilities of our current and future technology and products, and the benefits to homeowners and installers, our operations, including manufacturing and customer service and supply and demand, the anticipated growth in the market and in ourselves and regulatory matters. These forward-looking statements involve significant risks and uncertainties and our actual results and the timing of events could differ materially from these expectations. For a more complete discussion of the risks and uncertainties, please see our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021 on file with the SEC and our quarterly report Form on 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2022, which will be filed with the SEC in the second quarter of 2022. We caution you not to place any undue reliance on forward-looking statements and undertake no duty or obligation to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future events, or changes in expectations. Also, please note that financial measures used on this call are expressed on a non-GAAP basis, unless otherwise noted and have been adjusted to exclude certain charges. We’ve provided a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures in our earnings press release posted today, which can also be found in the Investor Relations section of our website. Now, I would like to introduce Badri Kothandaraman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Enphase Energy. Badri?
Badri Kothandaraman: Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today to discuss our first quarter 2022 financial results. We had a good quarter. We reported record quarterly revenue of $441.3 million, achieved non-GAAP gross margin of 41%, and generated free cash flow of $90.1 million. We ramped IQ8 Microinverters in the first quarter and started piloting IQ8D Microinverters to small commercial customers. We exited the first quarter at approximately 41, 15 26. This means 41% gross margin, 15% operating expenses and 26% operating income, all as a percentage of revenue on a non-GAAP basis. As a reminder, our baseline financial model is 35%, 15%, 20%. We will go into our financials later in the call. Let’s now discuss how we are servicing customers. Our Q1 Net Promoter Score worldwide was 68% and compared to 69% in Q4, and our North American Net Promoter Score was 74% compared to 73% in Q4. Our average call wait time decreased to 3.2 minutes in Q1 compared to 8.9 minutes in Q4. We reduced call wait times through staffing and training. During Q1, we added field service technicians in the U.S. and Europe to provide on-site help to our installers, particularly for batteries. Let’s talk about microinverter manufacturing. As we have discussed in the past calls, the global supply chain situation is still under stress, but our situation is stable due to supplier management and qualification of alternate suppliers. With the growing demand for our microinverters, we remain vigilant regarding the global supply chain and logistics challenges due to COVID disruption. I’m very proud of our teams who have worked hard to manage this difficult situation. Currently, our quarterly capacity across all contract manufacturing facilities is a little more than 5 million microinverters. Mexico has a quarterly capacity of 2.25 million microinverters, India with Salcomp has 1.5 million, and the rest is in China. To support the increased demand and to improve delivery times to customers in Europe, we are adding an automated line at FLEX’s factory in Romania. This line will have quarterly capacity of approximately 750,000 microinverters starting in Q1 of 2023 and will enable a global capacity of nearly 6 million microinverters per quarter. Let’s now talk about batteries. Our two sources for battery cell packs currently have a total capacity of 180-megawatt hours per quarter. Our existing cell pack suppliers can add more capacity as needed. We are also on track to add a third cell pack supplier in the second half of this year. Our lead times for batteries are still long at about 14 to 16 weeks, primarily due to global logistics challenges. The lead time should come down once shipping and port congestion conditions improve. Let’s move on to the regions. U.S. and international revenue mix for Q1 was 84% and 16%, respectively. In the U.S., revenue increased 9% sequentially and 49% year-on-year. We are pleased to report record sell-through for microinverters and record revenue for batteries in Q1. The channel inventory for both, microinverters and batteries, were at a healthy level at the end of Q1. In Europe, revenue decreased 6% sequentially while increasing 39% year-on-year. The sequential decrease was due to unforeseen shipment delays towards the end of Q1. Homeowners in Europe have a strong desire for energy independence. We recently teamed up with [indiscernible] a German installer group to deliver microinverters and batteries to customers in Europe. We are currently shipping IQ batteries to Germany and Belgium and plan to introduce them in other European countries throughout 2022. Our batteries are now compatible with most brands of third-party PV inverters. We continue to see strong growth in our existing markets in Europe, including Netherlands, France and Belgium and are also pleased with our growth in newer markets, including Italy, Spain and Portugal. We expect our momentum in Europe to continue with more than 40% sequential revenue growth expected in Q2 versus Q1. We are continuing to expand the team and are very excited about our growth in the region. In Latin America, revenue increased 13% sequentially and more than doubled year-on-year. We had steady growth in our solar plus storage business in Puerto Rico during the first quarter. Now, I’ll provide some color on Australia, Brazil and India. In Australia, we expect to introduce IQ batteries in the second half of 2022. We think regulatory changes designed to improve solar installation practices will favor our safe AC approach, as grids and utilities require more intelligent and safer solutions. As for Brazil, we have started shipping IQ7+ Microinverters to installers in Q1 and expect to ramp continuously. We also expect to introduce an IQ8D version into Brazil to optimize cost. In India, we are making steady progress in adding more installers into our network, ramping digital sales and planning to introduce IQ batteries in early 2023. Let’s now discuss the overall bookings for Q2. Our overall customer demand for Q2 is quite robust for both microinverters and batteries and exceeds the higher end of our guidance range. The component availability is better than what we have experienced in the last 18 months, but there are still global challenges, which are not specific to Enphase. We remain optimistic that the lead times will come down by the end of this year. Let’s talk about batteries. We shipped 120.4 megawatt hours of IQ batteries in the first quarter, a 20% increase from Q4 of 2021. We are working diligently on improving commissioning times for installers. While we have done various fixes to improve quality and homeowner experience of the batteries, we are still not where we would like to be on commissioning and installation experience. We are doubling down on this in this quarter and expect to make good progress. Our goal remains to get the commissioning time down to an hour and ensure installers have a seamless experience. We expect to ship between 130 and 140-megawatt hours of batteries in Q2. Due to the increase in logistics and component costs driven by inflation, we implemented a modest price increase on our batteries in March of 2022. Let’s now discuss the installer training and certification on batteries. By the end of the first quarter, we have certified more than 1,300 installers in the U.S. on a cumulative basis. Our hands-on storage training in the U.S. uses mobile vans located in the East and West Coast along with regional training centers. We started with an Enphase YouTube channel in Q1 for training, where installers can access videos to learn installation tips and tricks. Let’s talk about new products. In Q1, we ramped shipments on IQ8 Microinverters in North America and are receiving positive feedback about the product in general. As a reminder, IQ8 solar microinverters can form a micro grid during a power outage using only sunlight, providing backup power even without a battery. IQ8’s grid-forming technology eliminates traditional ratio requirements between solar system size and battery size. And with our Sunlight Jump Start feature, IQ8 Microinverters can start a home energy system using sunlight only after prolonged grid outages that may result in a fully depleted battery. We also expect to introduce IQ8 Microinverters internationally into Europe and Australia during the second half of this year. Let’s talk about IQ8D Microinverters for small commercial application. We started piloting IQ8D 640-watt AC microinverters to select installers in North America during the first quarter, and we expect production shipments in late Q2. The value proposition of IQ8D is the ease of installation, high-quality and rapid shutdown capability. On batteries, we plan to introduce our next new product, IQ Battery 5P later this year. This battery will deliver twice the power of our current battery at a lower manufacturing cost, enabling homeowners to start heavier loads. Also going forward, we will enhance our communication using control area network, which is a robust wired protocol for connectivity between the battery, the gateway and the system controller. We expect this to further streamline installations and simplify commission. Let’s now discuss ClipperCreek, an acquisition, which we completed in Q4 of 2021. The acquisition is performing in line with our expectations, with reasonable gross margins and profitability in Q1. We’re doing a few things to ramp the business. We are introducing EV chargers to our solar distributors and installers this quarter. We are also on track to begin manufacturing EV chargers at our Flex facility in Mexico in the fourth quarter of this year. We believe this will help us scale better and drive down costs. As for new products, we expect to introduce a smart EV charger to customers in the U.S. and Europe in early 2023. This will provide connectivity to the cloud through Wi-Fi as well as local connectivity into the Enphase home energy system. The increasing penetration of electric vehicles has significant implications for home energy management. The energy consumed by the home will significantly increase with an EV. This increase will drive adoption of more solar and storage, which will enable homeowners to save money and charge their vehicle in a green manner. The large EV battery could also be used for home backup called vehicle-to-home as well as helping the grid in the future called vehicle-to-grid. This acquisition plays extremely well to our strength in energy management, ultimately helping the homeowner manage solar, storage, EV and other home loads. We are in discussions with a few EV makers to enable proof-of-concept for V2H and V2G features. Let me cover grid services. During the first quarter, we announced that Vermont-based utility, Green Mountain Power will offer Enphase Energy systems to its customers in a cutting edge battery lease grid services pilot program. We have previously announced our participation in connected solutions covering 3 utilities in the Northeast U.S., Hawaiian Electric’s Battery Bonus Grid Services program and Arizona Public Service’s Residential Battery Grid Services Program. We also recently announced a partnership with Swell Energy to participate in VPP programs in California, New York and Hawaii. We also have many new grid services engagements in the pipeline and look forward to working with utilities and aggregators. Let’s discuss the installer platform. We are working on Solargraf Pro, a design and proposal tool with shading analysis, ability to detect obstructions on the roof and 3D modeling of homes. Approximately 900 installers use the Solargraf tool today. We expect to launch the Solargraf Pro, a higher version -- advanced version of the product in Q2 and already have a few installers piloting the software. In addition, we plan to expand the availability of Solargraf Pro internationally, starting with Germany. In March of 2022, we acquired SolarLeadFactory, which provides high quality leads to solar installers in the U.S. Our objective is to substantially increase lead volumes and conversion rates to help drive down customer acquisition costs for installers. We plan to expand the team, optimize lead management and offer this service broadly to our installer network. We have made four acquisitions in the last 15 months to strengthen our installer platform in the areas of lead generation, solars, design software, permitting services and O&M software. In addition, we have robust and homegrown mobile apps for commissioning and monitoring of solar and storage systems. We plan to integrate all of these seamlessly onto one platform and offer them to our installation network, simplifying their lives and reducing soft costs. Let me now give you a quick update on our Enphase Installer Network or EIN. We have now onboarded approximately 1,200 installers to our EIN worldwide through highly selective process focused on installation quality and an exceptional experience to homeowners across the globe. Next, I’d like to comment on some recent policy issues that are impacting the U.S. solar industry. As you’re aware, the U.S. Department of Commerce is investigating the circumvention of antidumping and countervailing duties on some PV modules. This is a time of great change in the energy market. Utility costs are rising, climate change is happening, geopolitical issues are driving energy security and EVs are taking off. At a time like this, when there needs to be full support for renewable, an AD/CVD investigation creates massive uncertainty in the marketplace which we believe will impact U.S. jobs, raise electricity prices for homeowners and increase import from China, all of which are counter to the goals of the current administration. We are hoping that the current administration takes this problem seriously and resolves it rapidly, well before the proposed August time frame. As it relates to Enphase, our products aren’t directly impacted by AD/CVD as we don’t make modules. But based on conversations with some of our partners, it is our opinion that the module supply for the residential segment will be less impacted than other segments. Many of our partners are currently working on securing module supply for the latter part of this year. Module pricing is expected to be higher in the interim, and we think the residential segment may be able to absorb higher prices. All of this further underscores the importance of supporting domestic manufacturing through a production-based tax credit, or PTC, so we can proactively increase domestic manufacturing rather than reacting to such a market disruption. The support of domestic manufacturing is well-aligned with the administration’s goals to promote renewables, increase U.S. jobs, reduce electricity pricing for homeowners and lessen the dependency on imports from China. We would like to see rapid resolution of both, AD/CVD as well as implementation of PTC as soon as possible. I would also now like to comment on the California NEM 3.0 proposed decision, or PD, which was announced in the December of 2021. We expect a modification to the current PD and an opportunity for stakeholders to participate and provide their feedback to the California PUC. We’ve been actively participating in the process and will continue to work diligently with various stakeholders to try and influence the best outcome. Let me wrap up. Full home electrification is slowly but surely coming. EVs are ramping up considerably for obvious reasons, so are heat pumps. Climate change, coupled with situations like the Ukraine, is forcing European countries and others to think hard about their reliance on oil, coal and natural gas. Countries like Germany are leading the way in adopting renewable technologies such as solar and batteries to support heat pumps, EVs and other home loads. Self-consumption is becoming the norm and consumers want energy independence. There is no doubt that other countries will follow suit. It is just a matter of time. Our strategy is pretty simple. We create best-in-class solar plus storage home energy systems. We sell them to homeowners through our installation and distribution partners, enabled by our installer platform. Our top most core value is customer first, and we are focused on providing a great experience to installers and homeowners. We are well-placed to capitalize on the trend towards full home electrification and look forward to ramping our presence in Europe in a significant manner over the coming months and years. With that, I will hand the call over to Mandy for her review of our financial results. Mandy?
Mandy Yang: Thanks, Badri, and good afternoon, everyone. I will provide more details related to our first quarter of 2022 financial results, as well as our business outlook for the second quarter of 2022. We have provided a reconciliation of these non-GAAP to GAAP financial results in our earnings release posted today, which can also be found in the IR section of our website. Total revenue for Q1 was $441.3 million, representing an increase of 7% sequentially and a quarterly record. We shipped approximately 1,029 megawatts DC of microinverters and 120.4 megawatt hours of IQ batteries in the quarter. Non-GAAP gross margin for Q1 was 41.0% compared to 40.2% in Q4. The increase was driven by favorable product mix and lower expedite costs. GAAP gross margin was 40.1% for Q1. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $66.3 million for Q1 compared to $68.2 million for Q4. The decrease was driven by lower marketing expenses, offset by continuous investment in R&D and customer service. GAAP operating expenses were $115.1 million for Q1 compared to $105.6 million for Q4. GAAP operating expenses for Q1 included $45.3 million of stock-based compensation expenses and $3.6 million of acquisition-related expenses and amortization for acquired intangible assets. On a non-GAAP basis, income from operations for Q1 was $114.5 million compared to $97.7 million for Q4. On a GAAP basis, income from operations was $61.8 million for Q1 compared to $57.7 million for Q4. On a non-GAPP basis, net income for Q1 was $109.7 million compared to $102.8 million for Q4. This resulted in non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.79 for Q1 compared to $0.73 for Q4. GAAP net income for Q1 was $51.8 million compared to GAAP net income of $52.6 million for Q4. This resulted in GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.37 for both Q1 and Q4. We exited Q1 with a total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balance of approximately $1.1 billion compared to approximately $1.0 billion at the end of Q4. In Q1, we generated $102.4 million in cash flow from operations and $90.1 million in free cash flow. Capital expenditure was $12.4 million for Q1 to increase manufacturing capacity as well as costs related to IT infrastructure, R&D equipment and international facilities. Now, let’s discuss our outlook for the second quarter of 2022. We expect our revenue for the second quarter of 2022 to be within a range of $490 million to $520 million, which includes shipments of 130 to 140-megawatt hours of IQ batteries. We expect GAAP gross margin to be within a range of 37% to 40% and non-GAAP gross margin to be within a range of 38% to 41%, which excludes stock-based compensation expenses and acquisition-related amortization. We expect our GAAP operating expenses to be within a range of $127.5 million to $130.5 million, including a total of approximately $57 million estimated for stock-based compensation expenses and acquisition-related expenses and amortization. The estimated stock-based compensation expenses include approximately $4.8 million accrual for the earnouts and are tied to certain performance targets to be paid in company stock for the acquisition. We expect our non-GAAP operating expenses to be within a range of $70.5 million to $73.5 million. With that, I will now open the line for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith from Bank of America.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Congratulations on the continued results and performance here. If I can, just kicking it off here, can you talk a little bit more about the European expansion that you guys just emphasized here a moment ago in the prepared remarks? Can you talk about what exactly you’re doing to infiltrate those markets, if you will? You obviously talked a lot about training. How should we expect that to filter through in terms of operating expenses and especially against your model on OpEx? And then, related to that, how should we expect that to filter through on top line as you think about your revenue mix here in Europe as well as gross margin impact?
Badri Kothandaraman: Right. So, just quick on the background for Europe. In general, we are quite strong in Netherlands, France, Belgium and those businesses or those regions continue to grow pretty well on the solar side. The new regions, if we talk about actually, our Germany, Italy, Spain and Portugal. So, let me talk about Germany. Germany, extremely interesting market. The residential solar is well north of 1 gigawatt a year, maybe even up to 2 gigawatts a year right now on residential. Battery attach 80%. Most of our installers say, for a given home when they mean solar, they mean solar, battery, EV charger and heat pump. So, they are much more advanced, probably the most advanced, I would say, in terms of full home electrification. So, there’s an incredible opportunity there for us. And the companies that will be successful are companies that can manage all of these resources, solar, storage, EVs and heat pumps. That’s what we do. We make best-in-class home energy systems. Now with ClipperCreek, we have an EV charger, we are quite strong in solar and storage. And so, we are working on expanding our sales force in Germany. We are working on business development. We are working with a lot of installers. We are ramping things there at a pretty nice clip. And our natural advantage is that we do things with very high quality that Germans care about. We care a lot about customer experience, customer service. So, that’s on our side. So, we are very optimistic about Germany. I was there late February to early March with our team and it’s really, really clear that the opportunity is big and now. When you compare to that, the next biggest is Netherlands. Netherlands is primarily a solar market today, but storage is coming according to all of the installers. And installers are all -- they like Enphase a lot, primarily due to the attributes I told you, quality, customer experience. If you go to Italy, Italy has been promoting the heck out of batteries, the Ecobonus and the Super Bonus program. The super bonus almost says that the batteries are virtually free. And there, we are going to participate with some of our partners. And these programs are -- will extend multiple years, may not be the Super Bonus, but at least the Ecobonus will be there. So Spain, for example, we have a natural advantage because of small systems in Spain. Each country is a diverse -- each country needs to be understood well. Because you go from Germany, you have a 12 kilowatt, 13 kilowatts of PV, you go to Spain, which is probably 4 kilowatts -- 3 or 4 kilowatts of PV. So, each market is different, requires in-depth understanding. We are going to be there. We are going to have sales force in each region. We are tripling down on Europe in terms of spending. So, there is no barriers there, and we’re doing well. In fact, this quarter, the second quarter, we expect our revenue to be 40% higher than the first quarter. And with regarding our OpEx, you should continue to think of our OpEx as right at the baseline. We are very-disciplined as a company. Our OpEx is -- our baseline numbers, financial numbers are OpEx equals 15% of sales. That’s the number that you need to be thinking about.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Just super quick, if I can ask you to elaborate here as well. Just the 15-megawatt hour increase quarter-over-quarter on the battery side. Just what are you seeing on margins today? Do you feel comfortable, just given the macro that you elaborated on in the prepared remarks, especially relative to raw material inflation? I.e., do you think about price inflation again just to pass it along, or how are you thinking about the battery part of the mix, both in terms of the trajectory and acceleration as well as the price points that you’re entering at?
Badri Kothandaraman: We don’t break out the individual products. We don’t break out what is the gross margin on microinverters and what the gross margin on batteries. But what we do is our baseline gross margin is 35%. We never launch a product that does not have the capability to hit 35%. And we are maniacal about costs. You see last quarter we guided 38% to 41%. We landed at 41%. So, with regarding your specific question on raw materials, yes, cell pack costs have been a little bit up because our suppliers are facing issues in their supply chain, too. And we already said we are doing a modest price increase effective March on batteries. So that will keep the gross margins in check. So, yes, we are quite healthy in overall gross margin as the company.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Mark Strouse from JP Morgan.
Mark Strouse: In the past, you have talked about how your order visibility into the coming quarter has either been in line or even exceeded at times what your guidance has been. I understand what you’re saying about your supply chain being stable at the moment. But just given AD/CVD, lockdowns in China that are happening, maybe in other areas of the value chain. Can you just talk about where your visibility into your 2Q guidance stands as of today?
Badri Kothandaraman: Yes. We got a lot of visibility into the second quarter, and we got visibility into the third quarter in terms of backlog, too. So, we only guide this quarter, meaning the second quarter, and we are very comfortable with these numbers. Like what I said in the prepared remarks, our demand is quite north of the higher end of the guidance range. Regarding COVID shutdowns in general, we are also seeing some shutdowns in China, but our factories remain open. The shipping lines remain open. There are hiccups in raw materials, getting into manufacturing in China from time to time, but we are managing it. The situation regarding component availability is obviously much better than what it was last year for us. We have made all of the necessary adjustments there. We have a number of suppliers for each part. So, we have learned how to mitigate our risks a lot. So, I cannot predict what’s going to happen tomorrow. But I can say right now, our situation is quite stable.
Mark Strouse: And then just a quick follow-up to Julien’s question on Europe. So, you mentioned the new markets you’re entering into, you’re obviously signing up new dealer partners. I mean, the 40% growth that you’re talking about in 2Q, how should we think about that as far as kind of market share gains versus just market expansion?
Badri Kothandaraman: I think it’s both. I mean, in places like Netherlands and Germany, I would say the market is growing so much. It’s part of market expansion. And, of course, we do take market share because of our quality and customer experience. I can’t quantify how much is each. But yes, I would say that it will be a healthy mix of both. Regarding new regions, like Spain, et cetera, they come to us because of our quality. Even in Netherlands, we continue to gain market share because of our service and quality. In Germany, we do gain market share from some string inverters because of -- one is we do supply all the components, we can do both solar plus storage, and we can manage the complete home energy system in the future, we can add an EV chargers in the future, we are able to work with heat pumps as well. So, they like our capability as energy management -- home energy management supplier, and sometimes we get the nod because of that. So, it’s a multitude of both.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Philip Shen from ROTH Capital Partners.
Philip Shen: Congrats on the strong quarter. As it relates to the lockdown in Shanghai, I was wondering if you could drill in a little bit deeper on the potential impact, if any, on the cell supply. And then, as another follow-up on batteries, with rising battery chemistry costs, can you talk through how much you can reduce your battery COGS ahead as you reduce the board count from 7 to 1 with the new chip? Can you keep margins flat, for example, without raising prices? Thanks.
Badri Kothandaraman: Yes. So, as far as the cell supply is concerned, right now, we have two sources of cell packs, both of them are situated in China. And we are adding a third cell pack supplier in the second half of the year. You talked about the lockdowns, I explained it. In terms of the lockdowns, our factories are still operating in China, our shipping is still active, the batteries are generally on the board with a lot of weeks in advance. Now we are planning for a long cycle time, 14 to 16 weeks. We are able to absorb any minor disruptions. We don’t see a big deal on the battery side. On the microinverter side, I was mentioning about some of the connectors, some raw materials. We see some hiccups from time to time due to COVID disruptions. But so far, so good. Like I said, I cannot predict tomorrow, but so far, it seems to be okay. On the battery costs, there are a couple of ways that we are working on battery costs. First is obviously the cell pack cost. And for that, we have multiple sources of cell packs. And therefore, we do all the standard price negotiation, but we are also sensitive to their increasing costs. And so there is limited things we can do in the time frame, but there’s a lot of things we can do. partnering with them over the long term in terms of optimizing the battery pack. In terms of what we can do is what I call is the overhead, meaning you have the cell pack and then you want to convert that cell pack from DC to AC. This involves battery management, power conversion and associated electronics. And that’s where I think we can add a lot of value, which we are. So, first thing we are doing is the battery that’s coming out in the second half goes to a slightly higher modularity, meaning instead of 3.3 kilowatt hours, we are going to 5 kilowatt hours, so we can amortize the overhead over the 5 kilowatt hours making the overhead less. And so, in addition, that battery has got double the continuous and peak power. So, that’s got a natural cost advantage due to the amortization, the higher modularity. In addition, it provides customers with a superior customer experience compared to our current generation batteries. Then, on top of that, we are going next year into our next -- what I call as the next-generation battery, where we are taking individual microinverters, the same microinverters that we use on the rooftop, plus extra battery management circuitry, plus a bunch of connector boards. We are taking overall 7 boards and collapsing them into one, which is integrating the battery management plus power conversion into a big microinverter as well as utilizing some advanced technologies and unique architecture, which we got as a full bridge architecture. So that one will help us do a very high-power microinverter and we basically will be able to cut the volume of the battery almost by 40%, because everything is consolidated into a single board versus 7 boards. So the energy density of the batteries is going to be up almost by 50%. The volume is going to be cut by 40%. And it’s going to be much easier to install. And along with this deep integration comes cost reduction. So, quite significant. We’re not ready to quantify yet, but definite reduction in manufacturing cost for us. So, all of these initiatives, basically blocking and tackling for the present going to the next-generation battery for the second half -- sorry, going to the high power battery for the second half and the next-generation battery for 2023 will continuously improve our gross margins and also enable us to do the appropriate thing for customers in terms of price.
Philip Shen: Next question here is on IQ8 versus 7, our work a couple months ago suggests that you were and are forcing top customers to IQ8 from IQ7 starting this quarter in Q2, due in part, I believe, to some chip issues for the IQ7. Can you talk through that a bit and also the mix of IQ8 and 7 by quarter this year? And then, what exactly caused the IQ7 shortage? When do you expect it to get resolved, if at all? And does this possibly mean that there could be pent-up demand later? Thanks.
Badri Kothandaraman: Yes. Just for the record, we never force customers. Customers have their own choices. They can make all these decisions. We are incredibly respectful of them. Sometimes, if the problem is entirely ours, we will be able to give them appropriate adjustments for the given time frame. For some customers, the movement to IQ8, they want it to be on the latest and greatest product, and they negotiate it for a good deal to transition faster. And each customer there is a story, each customer we -- is unique, and we don’t force anything wholesale on customers. That’s one. Then, number two, what caused the issue? IQ7 uses an ASIC, and that ASIC is made in a foundry in Taiwan, TSMC. And basically, in general, the foundries are on allocation. And so, we basically were short of that ASIC. But the beautiful thing is IQ8 uses another from another manufacturer, and there is plenty of supply there. So basically, we were able to mix and match IQ7s and IQ8s and were able to support customers. And we were happy that we supported customers for some customers. We gave them some concessions for that quarter where it -- in your language, it seems like we forced them. But in reality, we don’t. Then in terms of the customer conversion, I’ve always said, it takes us 4 to 6 quarters to convert from 7s to 8s. In the first quarter, our total shipment of overall microinverters, 20% of them was IQ8. This -- meaning, Q1 I’m talking about, so. And it’s just math, as I said. When you take 100% divide it by 5, that’s 20% a quarter. And so, next quarter, we roughly expect that. Sometimes it may take 5, sometimes it may take 6, sometimes it may take 4, it depends. So North America, we expect that transition. For Europe, we are going to introduce IQ8 in the second half of 2022. And so that will come with its own transition there. So bottom line, IQ8 is going quite healthy.
Philip Shen: One very quick follow-up on EU. You already talked a lot about it. But I want to see if there is potential for a new line beyond the one you’ve already talked about, which is 750,000 units per quarter by year-end. When do you think you might make a decision on yet another line in Europe?
Badri Kothandaraman: Well, I mean, it’s easy for. Now, once we have Flextronics, great partner, by the way, we have a great relationship. We started -- we are starting with an auto line, that’s 750,000 units. And if we think we need more, it only takes us three months. We are now very experienced. We know all the puts and takes it takes to order an extra auto line. So, if we need it, we’ll pull the plug on ordering it. So, we’re not worried about that. What’s interesting is and what’s exciting is our demand in Europe. I mean, this quarter, like what I said, I think we’ll ship more than 40% compared to last quarter. And we are very excited about Germany, Netherlands, like what I talked about.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Brian Lee from Goldman Sachs. [Operator Instructions]
Brian Lee: Badri, just on the new battery, I was curious. It sounds like it’s going to be higher gross margin in the current battery product you’re shipping into the market. But, it also sounds like lower cost. So, are you going to be in a position in 2023 when you’re shipping the new battery to be more aggressive on price? So, you’re driving both volume upside as well as margins on the new battery? And then, also similar to how you give us the progression of new generations, like IQ8 versus IQ7, any sense of how much of your mix you would target for the new battery in ‘23 versus the current generation?
Badri Kothandaraman: Yes. The good question on the next-gen battery, that’s a little bit out. So, it’s probably too early to give some numbers out. But the idea is generally that, meaning today, we have extraordinarily -- meaning the situation is extraordinary in terms of inflation, supply chain, et cetera. It’s not going to last forever. Eventually, batteries need to come down the cost reduction curve. And this provides us -- we are healthily placed there because we are reducing the fundamental cost structure of our product. And whenever you reduce cost structure, you basically integrate -- instead of 7 boards, you have 1 board, that’s all goodness. So, it depends upon the situation at that time. But you’re right, we may use it for market share gains while still retaining a healthy gross margin. And it will -- and once we come to that, we’ll make a decision. And with regarding the next-gen battery, I mean, there is no reason why that cannot follow a similar process like the microinverters. In fact, it can be accelerated. If it provides a lot of benefits for customers, like form factor is quite less and other things, we may be able to do the transition in 2 to 3 quarters instead of 4 to 5. So, we got to get there first. We’ve got to make sure our product is -- a new product is released. And then, I think our plans will get more firm.
Brian Lee: Okay. That’s super helpful. And then, just my follow-up on Europe. I know there’s a lot of questions on Europe. But, the 40% growth sequential here for 2Q is quite robust. Is some of that a function of -- I know that’s a VAR reseller market. Are you kind of filling in the channels that you’re lure to some of these markets, and that’s the big growth? And so, how does that translate to kind of what you think sequentially is sustainable through the back half? Like, can you keep growing in Europe at those rates, or is this kind of a big first quarter fill-in and then things start to moderate? Thank you.
Badri Kothandaraman: Yes. I mean, that’s a good question as well. Is it you’re feeling the channel for the first time is your question. That’s relevant for new markets. Usually, we are very-disciplined in filling the channel or not, and we always look at point of sales. Point of sales means regardless of what we ship from Enphase to a distributor, are the installers purchasing from the distributors? We have a very meticulous meeting, meaning review every week where we look at point of sales in Europe by country, by distributor. We look at that. So, there may be a little bit of creating a channel in some really regions where we have never shipped before, but that’s not the primary reason. The primary reason is, especially for countries like Netherlands, in general, booming solar, for countries like Germany is especially considering the Ukraine situation, everybody wants to go towards self consumption. And so, basically solar plus storage there. So, these two are the biggest markets by large, and of course, closely followed by utility, where the government is making it very easy. All of these three regions -- actually, Italy, you can argue that some of the channel thing is there. But at least in Netherlands and Germany, we are -- we’ve been present for some time. So I would say more robust growth. Of course, we cannot say whether we’re going to grow every quarter like that, but we’ll give you -- we’ll do the same thing next quarter. We’ll talk about the third quarter. We’ll take it one quarter at a time.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Colin Rusch from Oppenheimer.
Colin Rusch: Can you just give us a sense of where channel inventories are right now? I’m curious to understand a little bit better growth in the U.S. and Europe, how much of the guidance is really channel until at this point?
Badri Kothandaraman: Historically, I’ve always said that a reasonable channel inventory is 8 to 10 weeks, and we don’t usually quantify it every quarter, but that’s a healthy inventory. U.S., I would say, is quite healthy. Europe, I would say, is a little bit less in terms of channel inventory, and they need product, and that should be obvious because of the demand increase.
Colin Rusch: Great. And then the change in the battery volume. I guess I’m curious what’s driving that change. Is there some cost reduction driving that? Is there an issue at the installer level in terms of placement event? But just the logic and kind of the purpose of that change and how quickly we can see that shifting to all the product that’s out in the field.
Badri Kothandaraman: I mean, the logic is we release new products and new products get better and better over time. So, as simple as that, we -- today, our battery basically does 3.84 kilowatts of continuous power for 10-kilowatt hour battery and 5.76 kilowatts of peak power for a 10-kilowatt hour battery. And very often, when you have air conditioners and when you have pool pumps, et cetera, what you do is the tendency is to buy a lot more kilowatt hours to solve the kilowatt problem. Now, with this, we don’t need homeowners to buy kilowatt hours just for the heck of it -- for solving a power problem. Of course, if they need it for energy, they need it for energy. But at least what we take is right now, with the high-power battery, which is going to be released in the second half of this year, we will be able to support 7.68 kilowatts for a 10-kilowatt hour battery, continuous, and something like 11-point-something kilowatts peak power. So, we’ll be able to start some really nice loads with the 10-kilowatt hour battery, for example. And so, that’s a customer experience thing. And of course, when we did that design, what we said is, okay, our previous modularity -- our batteries that we are shipping today have a modularity of 3.3 kilowatt hour. These new batteries, if we have a modularity of 5-kilowatt hour, then you can amortize our overhead, what I call is anything other than the cell pack, over a higher kilowatt hour. So that gets better. The cost gets a little better, manufacturing cost. And then, you go to the next generation, which is in next year, 2023, is we talk about transforming the overhead to something that is -- was a lot to something that’s very less, 7 boards going to 1 board, which is integrate power conversion, integrate battery management all into one board, and making our microinverter a high-power microinverter. And that microinverter will be like approximately a 2,000-watt microinverter, single bolt. And that single word can be on the side of the cell pack. So, you can see a drastic volume reduction of 40%. So…
Colin Rusch: That’s incredibly -- yes, that’s super helpful. I’m sorry to cut you off there. But yes, I appreciate it.
Badri Kothandaraman: Yes.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Kashy Harrison from Piper Sandler.
Kashy Harrison: So, first one for me. There’s been just broader concern in the market about an economic deceleration entering Q2 and beyond just globally. You’ve already highlighted a meaningful 40% sequential revenue growth in Europe. So, we know demand is rocking and rolling over there. However, I was wondering if you could just give us a sense of what you’re hearing from your customers in the U.S., specifically in April? I’m trying to get a sense if you’re seeing any signs of deceleration in U.S. resi demand in April, or it seems like demand is still strong within the U.S., based on your most recent discussions?
Badri Kothandaraman: Okay. Yes, demand is very strong in the U.S., as simple as that. And we -- that’s why we told you that our -- demand is well north of our higher end of guidance. And it is broad-based. We work with a number of -- we work with a number of installers of all shapes and sizes. We work with long tail installers. We work with big installers. And everywhere, the demand is up. And we are continuing to take market share in the U.S. So, that’s good. And then, we talked about Europe. So, those two are the biggest for us.
Kashy Harrison: That’s good to hear. And then, maybe just switching gears to the battery side. You said you’re adding battery supplier in the second half of the year. Can you talk about how much capacity you are adding? And then, are you adding the third supplier because you anticipate demand up and beyond what your suppliers are -- currently capable of delivering? Or is this more so an attempt to get down to that 8- to 10-week target of lead times as opposed to where you are right now at 14 to 16 weeks? And that’s it. Thank you.
Badri Kothandaraman: Yes. I mean, we are adding a third supplier. And when we actually add it, I’ll provide more details on the capacity. But I have no doubt it will be comparable to the others. Then, in terms of the motivation to add, it’s all of the above. We have noticed -- I mean, we have realized that based upon the last couple of years on supply chain for the microinverter, there are some products that we need five suppliers. And they are critical components. So like that, the battery is very -- the cell pack -- if we don’t get cell pack, we are dead, right? So, more number of suppliers, it helps us in terms of -- yes, it helps us in everything. Price negotiation, it helps us in supply. It helps us on delivery. It helps us on volume. So, it helps us on upside. So, this is a long-term strategy. It’s got nothing to do with the short term. And we’ll continue to add -- this supplier is also based in China. And we will continue to look for diversification opportunities elsewhere outside China. That’s a top priority for me. But right now, all of our three cell pack suppliers are in China.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of James West from Evercore ISI.
James West: So, you’ve made several acquisitions that are going to strengthen your installer platform, including the SolarLeadFactory, I guess, was the most recent one. Is the acquisition phase here done? And then, could you talk about the integration of these businesses and how quickly you can get an integrated product after the installer base?
Badri Kothandaraman: Yes. The installer platform has got a few elements to it, lead generation and management, number one; design and proposal, number two, with the connectivity to the fintech partners. That’s number two. Number three is permitting. Number four is installation and commissioning. Number five is monitoring and number 6 is operations and maintenance. So, we have made acquisitions on lead management through SolarLeadFactory. They -- very healthy business, profitable business. They work with about 10 installers mostly, 90% of the revenue comes from 10 installers. They are very-competent in lead management. Those installers love them. The name of the game for us is to take that business, generate a lot more leads, increase the quality of leads, make sure those leads have a very high conversion rate into actual installs and kind of make sure we proliferate the long tail. So, that’s the name of the game on the first one, lead generation and management. Number two, design and proposal. We bought a company called Solargraf in January of 2021. The business is doing quite healthy. I would say, this quarter, that business will do 50% higher than one year ago. And essentially, the business service is 900-plus installers right now. But that design too, lacks shading capability, lacks 3D, lacks storage modeling, which we are all fixing. We are fixing right now -- we are piloting that. We are going to introduce it to many more of our installers. And all of them are waiting for it. And it’s an opportunity for them to utilize that platform there. Also, another important thing is Solargraf or Sofdesk, that software has got connectivity to various fintech partners. So, that’s important ease of access, fintech partners is very important for our installers. That’s true. So that business doing well. We have lots of plans for it. We are going to introduce these new features. We are going to become the best-in-class there. And we are patient. We don’t expect medicals. It’s steady progress. Now, number three, permitting services. We have a team in Noida, approximately 80 installers. We -- the volume that we do is a lot there. We almost do proposal and permitting services, meaning an installer says just generate this proposal for me. I don’t want to use this software. Just generate this proposal for me. Or here is the details of the proposal, I want to permit plan set from you in 24 hours. So, we have a large team there, 80 installers, doing very well. Again, that revenue is ramping quite nicely, very profitable. There the name of the game for us is automate the permit plan set, so that we can reduce the cycle time from hours to minutes, and we can service the long tail well with highest quality. That’s permitting services. Now, installation and commissioning is what we do for a living -- monitoring is what we do for a living. We have over hundreds of man years invested into the installer app and the monitoring app for homeowners. So, we are continuing to make that better and better and better. We’re still not happy with our commissioning on batteries, like what I indicated. And that’s the major goal for me. It’s got a lot of points for me. And we are going to make that better. But we don’t need to buy a company for that. We already have homegrown efforts for the last several years. The last one is the new one that we bought end of December. And that one is probably the most nascent of them is the concept being -- it’s like an Uber, Uber for an installer or Uber for an asset manager. Basically, if I have a problem with the particular asset and I’ve already charged the customer for an O&M contract and I’m short of labor, which happens all the time, we can -- the platform can basically find -- the platform is a labor market place for you. There are about 300 installation companies, which are logged into the platform. And when you as an asset owner or you are a service provider who want to service a particular asset, but you don’t have the manpower to do so because your crew is busy on new installs, you then log into the platform, submit a work order. It automatically gets routed to the next labor service provider who is free, and that is a match that happens, and Enphase gets paid for -- at both ends of the platform as a software fee. And that’s the newest of them all, which we need to basically -- we need to introduce that company to our installers. But, we will not do that unless they have a -- the software is high quality. The platform is high quality. We have enough number of service providers on the platform. So, those are the aspects we are working on in terms of O&M. So, I gave you a very long answer. But the way we think about it is all of these are coming together. We are stitching them all into a seamless loop. Some are basically less mature than the other. But all of them are geared to only one thing, making installer’s life simple.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Maheep Mandloi from Credit Suisse.
Maheep Mandloi: Badri, you have a very large installer network, right, in the U.S. and have access to most developers and installers, right? So, is that something you could do to help installers with procuring these solar modules in the short term to ease some of these issues in the supply chain we’re seeing in the short term?
Badri Kothandaraman: No, we are not in that business. No.
Maheep Mandloi: Got you. And just two other questions from me. Outside of Europe, how fast is the international business growing in Q2? And how should we think about the $1.1 billion of cash used this year in terms of M&A or buybacks? Thanks.
Badri Kothandaraman: Yes. I mean, we made 5 acquisitions in the last 15 months. All of them are small ones, but they add up. The next -- so what are our priorities for cash? We have $1.1 billion, as you noted. Our first priority is to obviously take care of the needs of the business, make sure we have plenty of cash for working capital, make sure that we make the necessary capital investments on the software side, make sure we invest in anything on batteries that we need. So, take care of the current needs of the business. That’s number one. Number two, we do have a lot of interesting ideas, interesting pipeline in terms of mergers and acquisitions. And obviously, we are rounding out the digital platform. We are looking at energy management. Like what I talked about in Germany is leading the way in every home having solar, storage, EV, heat pump and other home loads. And effectively managing that requires a lot of software talent, a lot of software, including buying companies. And because the market in Germany is reasonably mature, like, for example, not all systems may use Enphase -- Enphase actually solar. Some may only use Enphase storage, might have third-party solar, might have someone else’s EV charger and somebody else’s heat pump. But Enphase has come to the -- Enphase needs to come to the party by having the comprehensive energy management software. That aggregates all of these together and presents a single interface to the homeowner. That’s extremely important. That’s what I call interoperability. So, we are going to do that. So that requires heavy investments in home energy management, which we are prepared to do. So, including considering acquisitions. Of course, we got into EV charging. We think most of charging is going to be done at home. 80% of charging is going to be done at home. So, we’re always looking for networking opportunities on EV chargers that enable -- that basically enables dynamic access, which is both inside and outside the home. So, we are looking -- we’re always interested in software companies there. And new technologies, where we’re interested, batteries are something that we are always also looking for how can we reduce cost, increase performance? Those are the areas where we will double down. So, once we look at that, make sure we have enough cash for the M&A pipeline, then, we look at okay, if we still have cash left over, how is our -- what’s the current share price, how is the current share price? And is the share price below a conservatively calculated intrinsic value. And it’s nothing more than taking a page from Warren Buffett’s book. We do exactly what he recommends and it just makes sense for us. So, we did -- for example, last year, we bought back -- Mandy, we bought back 3.2 million shares?
Mandy Yang: Right.
Badri Kothandaraman: We bought back 3.2 million shares last year, bought back at $1.55 a share. And if the share price goes down, we will consider opportunistic scenarios like that to do more buyback, provided number 1 and number 2 are taken care of.
Maheep Mandloi: Just quickly on the other part on international business growth in Q2?
Badri Kothandaraman: International, the biggest is Europe. The other areas that we are working on, as I said, Brazil is something that we are very excited about. I haven’t talked about it too much, but we have an outstanding guy running Brazil. We have a very strong team. And I think it’s a matter of time before which we start seeing meaningful revenues from Brazil. And they are going to get the IQ8D variant of the product, which will help them on the cost structure, that’s pretty soon. Other than that, we are ramping up on Australia. We have not introduced our storage yet in Australia, which we are working on and they should have their storage in the second half of this year. So, that will provide them some growth. And in addition, we are focusing on other Southeast Asian countries as well. All of them are small efforts and when they become meaningful, I will talk more.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Joseph Osha from Guggenheim Partners.
Joseph Osha: Two questions for you. First, just looking at your installer network, been hearing from different sources that just simple labor availability for the install process has been a bit of a challenge. So, I’m just wondering if you can comment on feedback that you’re getting from your network.
Badri Kothandaraman: Yes, you’re right. I mean, the demand is quite high. Demand is very robust, like what I pointed out. So, installers are always looking for skilled labor. And when I say skilled, these electricians are very hot demand. Then there is a technician, which is slightly below electrician. So, labor is in hot demand.
Joseph Osha: Are you -- is that gating the ability of your dealers to get stuff done at this point, do you think?
Badri Kothandaraman: I mean, from our case, you saw our guidance, you saw our demand. I’m sure they can do even more. But right now, they are limited by their labor. That’s right.
Joseph Osha: Okay. Fair enough. And then, the other question, we’ve talked a lot about M&A, but in particular as regards grid services, right, aggregating and bidding assets into frequency regulation markets or what have you. That’s pretty challenging. I’m just wondering if you feel like the current skill set you have inside Enphase is sufficient or if that is perhaps one area that you’re inclined to do additional shopping? And that’s it for me. Thank you.
Badri Kothandaraman: Yes. Grid services really is focused on providing capacity, not necessarily frequency regulation at this time. That really is for front of the meter type application. So, we are focused on the residential market. And if you look at all of the grid services programs that we participate in are really focused around that, which means that during periods of stress typically around where the grid is stressed between 4 p.m. and 9 p.m., the batteries get a signal to discharge the batteries for the duration of that period. So, we really are focused on that market. We have a very strong team. They’re doing some very interesting work and how to enable utilities to provide this service very easily. We also have a very easy way for the homeowner to sign up for these programs through the app. So, we have a very strong team, both on the battery side to enable the battery to discharge the homeowner side for the homeowner to sign up simply as well as a platform or a grid services manager, as we call it, where the utilities are very clean, very simple access, one view access into all of the assets that are available to them. We, of course, work in some cases, with the utilities, but we also work with aggregators. And in that case, we provide them with API and API access for the entire fleet to allow them to discharge the battery. So, yes, a very strong team. As you can see, we have made a significant amount of progress with this team, and they’re developing very strong tools and products to meet the requirements.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Eric Stine from Craig-Hallum.
Eric Stine: Maybe just on the IQ8D, you talked about it a little bit, but maybe if you could expand on expectations for the ramp here throughout 2022? And then, just curious, I mean, what percentage do you think C&I can be of your business if you look out 3 to 5 years?
Badri Kothandaraman: Yes. I mean, so remember, this -- IQ8D only addresses the small commercial market. The small commercial market in the U.S. is -- we are talking about a TAM, maybe a little more than 1 gigawatt. And we are talking about small schools, churches, hospitals, small hospitals, gas stations. And when I say small commercial, it means 20 kilowatts to 200 kilowatts. So, we think our microinverters can be extended there with the use of IQ8D. Having said that, we just are getting started. We are piloting with about, I would say, 10-plus installers. And if the pilots go well, which we will find out in the next few weeks, we always make some changes. We always find issues invariably. We basically will do some tweaks, modifications, and then we will release the product to production. We expect that to happen in this quarter. And then, onwards, it is a business that will take some time to develop. But we are confident with our principles, quality, customer service, our wrap and shutdown capability, our easy-to-use product that this will get good adoption. And first, we’ll start off with North America. The market size I mentioned was primarily North America. And then, we will extend it to other regions as well. And if we are successful, and success means that we are like residential where we can capture significant share. And then, we will look at the next follow-on, which is the real commercial market. For that, we need a 480 [ph] product basically.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Sophie Karp from KeyBanc.
Sophie Karp: A couple of questions I have. So, you mentioned the whole home electrification. Obviously, you’ve been making acquisitions on the lines of -- you have an inverter product and storage and now you -- with ClipperCreek, you have EV chargers as well. And you mentioned heat pumps a bunch of times. So just kind of wondering if that is something that could make sense for you to add as the time progresses to your technology package. How should we think about that?
Raghu Belur: Yes. Hi. This is Raghu. So, the way we think about it is we have the technology -- energy management technology platform and its role is to manage a whole family or a disparate set of distributed energy resources. So, we obviously do solar today, storage. We manage the grid, we integrate generators. And now, we are integrating EV chargers as well. We are -- by making the EV charger very smart, so we can do green charging. But there are other elements also that we need to integrate, and that’s -- those are heat pumps. Obviously, we will not be selling heat pumps, but our goal is to develop -- either develop or buy companies that can -- that through software, integrate all of these other heat pumps, et cetera, and other loads as well and effectively bring them on to the platform. And when we bring them on to our energy management platform, we can then manage how the loads get serviced. What’s the most economical, what’s the most reliable and what’s the most green way of servicing the load. In the case of EV, for example, if the homeowner may choose I only want to charge my car from -- charge my car through green electrons, which is, obviously, the first choice would be your own solar system or if you get a signal from the grid says that the grid is green at this time, then you can charge from the grid as well. In general, it’s about managing all of these different type of resources, and we’ll do that with software primarily. And you’re seeing is a lot of standardization that’s starting to take place where all of these different kinds of loads, different types of heat pumps and different types of EV charges, et cetera, are starting to adopt certain standards, and those standards will make it easier for us to integrate them onto our platform.
Sophie Karp: And my other question was maybe taking another stab at the supply chain situation, right? You have managed the supply chain much better than your peers and competitors, right, not just your competitors, but other companies in other sectors, right, the large ones at that. What sets you apart? Like, what makes you more or less immune to these trends at this point? I guess, is that the fact that most of the components you use are more specialized and there’s less competition for them for maybe bigger industries? Is that just the relocation of where the manufacturing facilities are? Like, what should we think about here?
Badri Kothandaraman: I mean, to tell you, you’re giving us a lot of credit. Last year, we didn’t, and we had a supply problem last year in 2021. And what we learned from that, the learning is what can we do? For critical components, we need to have multiple sources. How can we plan better for critical components, how can we make sure that -- short-term disruptions? There are always going to be short-term disruptions. How can we smoothen all of those into what’s right for the customer? So, we have just learned to plan better. And I think planning better and executing on multiple factories, multiple sources, and it also helps that we don’t have a lot of SKUs. We -- the way we design it is one single piece of hardware with -- we try all our microinverters to have one single piece of hardware. And then, so that every region we can load the appropriate grid profile and software so that can get functioning. In that way, we don’t need to make one SKU for one country. We try. It’s hard to do. It’s hard to reduce the number of part count. Many companies bloat up on part counts. But again, I think with the software-defined architecture that we have, it helps us a lot. So, to answer your thing, it is upfront product architecture, diligent supplier management, qualification of multiple sources, planning better and some luck too. So, yes, hopefully, we have had our -- hopefully, luck is on our side. Yes. We don’t know what’s going to come tomorrow in terms of COVID disruptions. But I think it’s safe to say that we anticipate and we are prepared for it.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Cameron Lochridge from Stephens.
Cameron Lochridge: Well, I was hoping we could start just very quickly on this Department of Commerce investigation. I understand this is on modules, and this is not where you guys play. But you mentioned residential was likely a little bit more insulated from any effects of this. It sounds like your customers are working on module procurement for the second half. If you could just offer just any kind of framework for how you’re thinking about the potential impact, if any, to your business in the second half? And -- or even if you want to take stab at it this way, if you think about your outlook for 2022, how has it changed now versus what it may have been 3 months ago?
Raghu Belur: Really, we are not -- as we sit here today, based on all of the discussions that we have had with our customers, based on what we see out in the marketplace, we don’t see any impact on our business. Obviously, we are expecting and we have heard that module prices are going up. So, in our opinion, can those module prices increase and module prices be absorbed by the residential customer, and we believe that magnitude of module price increase that we are seeing an easily be absorbed by the customer. So, our opinion is that we won’t see any impact on our business. And also bear in mind that most residential systems are financed systems. So, what the homeowner actually sees is a small increase in their monthly payment. And we believe that those monthly payments are not going to be larger than what the utility rate increases that they’re experiencing. So, all of those things point to residential segment that is probably going to be much more resilient segment than any other segment.
Cameron Lochridge: And then just switching gears to your European strategy, I was hoping you could talk a little bit about your installer strategy there. I mean, you’ve had tremendous success in the U.S., obviously, with the long tail installers. Maybe just talk about does the same dynamic exist in Europe? Is it different? And basically, just do you think you can replicate your installer strategy that you’ve had success with in the U.S., can you replicate that in Europe?
Badri Kothandaraman: Yes. The same principles hold. If you say U.S. has got a lot of long tail installers, Europe is even more long tail. So, Germany, for example, has got 5,000 installers. And I think -- yes, I’m not sure about it, but I was told that the -- a top installer is an installer who does approximately 10 to 20 megawatts a year. So basically, it’s -- the same definition holds, the same principles hold for us. We think those installers will obviously care about quality, care about customer experience. So, as long as we do a good job there, good things will happen for us.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Pavel Molchanov from Raymond James.
Pavel Molchanov: Two quick ones also about Europe. Obviously, in the current geopolitical situation, all of the frontline states in the eastern portion of Europe are in the headlines. Do you see signs that rooftop solar in places like Poland, Czech Republic, Hungary is starting to develop? And if so, will you be playing in that geography?
Raghu Belur: Yes. Obviously, we do pay attention to the regions and pay attention to opportunities that lie, and we’ll continue to do that. At this time, we are very focused on the countries that we talked about. The market is really expanding very strongly and countries that we are already in, which is Netherlands, France, Belgium, Germany and the new markets, which include Spain, Italy and Portugal, and we need to bring all our products. We need to bring IQ8s there. We need to make sure we have batteries in all of those countries as well. And so, right now, we are focused on these, but we keep an eye out, right? We pay attention to what’s happening in the country that you referred to.
Pavel Molchanov: Okay. Last year, EV market share in Europe was 4 times higher than the United States, 19%. Is there room for ClipperCreek to get a slice of that infrastructure build-out?
Badri Kothandaraman: There is always room for ClipperCreek. And the angle is what I said, which is when an installer basically goes to a homeowner and who is even thinking about an EV, the -- there are so many incentives that an installer actually told us saying, even if the homeowner doesn’t have an EV, I still install an EV charger. So, what that means is this. When an installer is there selling the homeowner solar, storage, EV charger and heat pump, in that sale, if Enphase can make life better by having a comprehensive home energy management system, ClipperCreek definitely has its place. And so, we are planning to introduce an EV charger basically into Europe in Q1 of ‘23. But in the interim, we are working hard to make our system interoperable with other EV chargers, so that the homeowner still gets the right experience.
Operator: Thank you. This does conclude the question-and-answer session of today’s program. I’d like to hand the program back to Badri Kothandaraman for any further remarks.
Badri Kothandaraman: Yes. Thank you for joining us today and for your continued support of Enphase. We look forward to speaking with you again next quarter. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for your participation in today’s conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect. Good day.

===== 2021 Q4  (2022-02-08 16:30:00) =====
Operator: Thank you for standing by and welcome to the Enphase Energy Fourth Quarter 2021 Financial Results Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. After the speakers’ presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today’s program is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today’s program, Karen Sagot. Please go ahead.
Karen Sagot: Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us on today’s conference call to discuss Enphase Energy’s fourth quarter 2021 results. On today’s call are Badri Kothandaraman, Enphase’s President and Chief Executive Officer; Eric Branderiz, Chief Financial Officer; Mandy Yang, Chief Accounting Officer and Corporate Treasurer; and Raghu Belur, Chief Products Officer. After the market closed today, Enphase issued a press release announcing the results for its fourth quarter ended December 31, 2021. During this conference call, Enphase management will make forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to statements related to Enphase Energy’s expected future financial performance, the capability of our technology and products, including features, performance in our operations, including manufacturing and customer service, the anticipated growth in our sales and in the markets in which we operate and target, the benefits to homeowners and installers and regulatory issues. These forward-looking statements involve significant risks and uncertainties and Enphase Energy’s actual results and the timing of events could differ materially from these expectations. For a more complete discussion of the risks and uncertainties, please see the company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021, which will be filed with the SEC in the first quarter of 2022. Enphase Energy cautions you not to place any undue reliance on forward-looking statements and undertakes no duty or obligation to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future events, or changes in expectations. Also, please note that financial measures used on this call are expressed on a non-GAAP basis, unless otherwise noted and have been adjusted to exclude certain charges. The company has provided a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures in its earnings press release posted today, which can also be found in the Investor Relations section of its website. Now, I would like to introduce Badri Kothandaraman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Enphase Energy. Badri?
Badri Kothandaraman: Good afternoon and thanks for joining us today to discuss our fourth quarter 2021 financial results. We had a good quarter. We reported revenue of $412.7 million, shipped approximately 3 million microinverters, and 100.2 megawatt hours of IQ batteries, achieved non-GAAP gross margin of 40.2% and generated free cash flow of $84.1 million. We started production shipments of our IQ8 microinverters for customers in North America during Q4 and we have been very pleased with customer feedback so far. We exited the fourth quarter at approximately 40, 17, 24. This means 40% gross margin, 17% operating expenses, and 24% operating income, all as a percentage of revenue on a non-GAAP basis. As a reminder, our baseline financial model is 35, 15, 20. We will go into detail about our financials later in the call. Let’s now discuss how we are servicing customers. Our Q4 NPS worldwide was 69% compared to 67% in Q3. Our North American NPS was 73% compared to 71% in Q3. Our average call wait time increased to 8.9 minutes in Q4 compared to 5.5 minutes in Q3 as we on-boarded new installers and fielded more calls on our batteries. The ramp of our batteries has significantly increased call volumes as new installers learn how to commission the system and homeowners learn about the system’s features. We are not happy about the higher wait time and we are working on it to reduce it under a minute through staffing and training. During Q4, we also increased the number of field service technicians in the U.S. and Europe to provide onsite help to our installers, particularly on batteries. Let’s talk about manufacturing. Our operations team did a great job flexing manufacturing as 2021 played out. As we have discussed in the past earnings call, the global supply chain situation – the global supply chain is still under a little bit of stress, but our situation has been stable primarily due to diligent supplier management and qualification of alternate suppliers during the past year. Our supply of AC FET drivers is at a very healthy level. And we have five sources for AC FET drivers. For ASICs used in our microinverters, our supply was quite healthy in Q4 and we continue to manage it closely as we ramp IQ8 and we have two foundry sources for our ASICs. With the growing demand for our microinverters, we remained vigilant regarding the global supply chain and logistics. Given our strong demand, we added a fully automated line in Q4, bringing quarterly capacity to 2.25 million microinverters in Mexico. We had already added a second fully automated line earlier in 2021 at our contract manufacturer, Salcomp in India, bringing that quarterly capacity to about 1.5 million microinverters. Along with our existing capacity in China, we can now do a little more than 5 million microinverters per quarter in total for all microinverters worldwide. We are also planning to add a contract manufacturing facility for microinverters in Europe by the end of this year. We see rapid growth in the region and would like to service customers better. Let’s now talk about batteries. Our two sources for battery cell packs have increased their capacity to 180 megawatt hours per quarter from 120. Our existing cell pack suppliers are capable of adding even more capacity if needed and we are continuing discussions with additional cell pack suppliers as well. As always, there are a few components that we are managing to ensure we don’t have a supply disruption. There is never a dull day for our operations team in these times. Our lead times for batteries are still long today at approximately 14 to 16 weeks, primarily due to logistics challenges, which are global. The lead time should come down once global shipping and port congestion conditions improve. Let’s move on to the regions. Our U.S. and international revenue mix for Q4 was 82% and 18%, respectively. For 2021, we achieved record revenue across all regions with more than 78% growth year-on-year. Our U.S. and international revenue mix for the full year was 80% and 20%, respectively. In the U.S., the revenue increased 74% year-on-year. We reported record revenue and sell-through from our distribution partners to installers for both microinverters and batteries in Q4. Our microinverter channel inventory was at a healthy level at the end of Q4, but our storage channel inventory remained tight due to strong demand and logistic challenges. We expect microinverter channel inventory to remain healthy in Q1 and storage channel inventory to improve. In Europe, revenue more than doubled year-on-year. I am very pleased with our team’s performance and excited about the growth in 2022. During 2021, we expanded into Italy with solar microinverters and introduced batteries in Germany and Belgium. We do plan to introduce batteries in other countries in Europe steadily throughout 2022. In Asia-Pacific region, revenue increased 80% year-on-year. Heading into 2022, we look to capitalize on the industry’s recovery from COVID restrictions as well as recent regulatory changes that are favorable to our software-defined AC architecture. We plan to introduce batteries in Australia in the second half of 2022. In Latin America, revenue increased 77% year-on-year. We remain quite bullish about our solar storage business in Puerto Rico and expect steady growth there in the next few quarters. We are also very pleased with the progress we are making in Brazil as we started ramping IQ7+ microinverters installers in Q4. Now that we covered all the regions, let’s discuss the overall bookings for Q1. Our overall customer demand for Q1 is quite robust for both microinverters and batteries and exceeds the higher end of our guidance range. The component availability is certainly better than what we experienced last year. We are primarily left with logistics challenges, which are global in general and not very specific to MCs. We are quite optimistic that our supply will catch up to demand during the year. Let’s talk about our storage systems. We shipped 100.2 megawatt hours of ICU batteries, which was a significant 53% increase from Q3. As I mentioned, our lead times are a little long at around 14 to 16 weeks, mainly due to logistics challenges. We expect to ship between 110 and 120 megawatt hours of batteries in Q1. This represents a 15% growth from Q4. Due to the increase in logistics costs, which are significant and increase in component cost driven by inflation, we are implementing a modest price increase on our batteries beginning March of 2022. Let’s talk about installer training on batteries. By the end of Q4, we trained approximately 4,845 installer personnel, representing approximately 2000 plus installation companies. Our hands-on storage training continued through the use of mobile vans and regional training centers in the fourth quarter. We are continuing the work on commissioning times for installers while adding features such as load control and generator compatibility to our batteries. We expect to introduce batteries in North America and Australia, with the modularity of 5 kilowatt hours and double the continuous and peak power in the second half of 2022. We believe this will not only enhance the customer experience significantly, it will also bring down the cost. Let’s talk about new products. We started production shipments of IQ8 microinverters for customers in North America in Q4 – late Q4. The IQ8 fundamentally changes the paradigm for solar technology, which otherwise requires a grid connection to operate. IQ8 can farm a microgrid during a power outage using only sunlight, providing backup power even without a battery. For homeowners who want a battery, there are no sizing restrictions in pairing an Enphase battery, with an IQ8 solar system. We also expect to introduce IQ8 microinverters internationally in the second half of 2022. Let’s now talk about the IQ8D full system for small commercial solar applications. We have achieved compliance on the 640 watt AC microinverter for North America and we are now focused on getting the full system and installer platform ready. We expect pilot shipments or the full system to select installers in this quarter, Q1, with volume shipments beginning in Q2. Let’s go to ClipperCreek, an acquisition we completed in Q4. ClipperCreek offers EV charging solutions for residential and commercial customers in the U.S. They have been a pioneer in the EV charging market since 2006 and have sold more than 110,000 Level 2 charging stations – AC charging stations since inception. The business is very healthy and the gross margins are in line with Enphase. The ClipperCreek brand has a reputation for quality, high quality and great service, which we like a lot. Let me outline our plans for ClipperCreek. We plan to transfer manufacturing to our contract manufacturing facility in Mexico by the end of this year so that we can rapidly scale the business and support demand. We are also looking forward to introducing the products imminently to distribution and installation partners in the U.S. In addition, we plan to introduce connectivity in every charger we will be shipping to enable smart EV charging with the Enphase app. This will enable charging on a schedule, tariff optimization and charging with green electrons from an Enphase solar plus storage home energy system. For the long-term we plan to work on bidirectional charging and grid services integration for vehicle to home and vehicle to grid applications. Let me go to grid services. In December, we announced our participation in Arizona Public Service, APS residential battery grid services program. The program offers homeowners who install Enphase batteries in APS’ territory, the chance to participate and own money through one-time upfront incentives. We believe this new program from APS will help accelerate the adoption of Enphase systems in Arizona. We have previously discussed our participation in the connected solutions program in Hawaiian Electric Battery Bonus grid services programs. As a reminder connected solutions, is an incentive program implemented by three utilities in Connecticut, Massachusetts, and Rhode Island to reduce electrical demand during high use periods. The Hawaiian Electric Battery Bonus grid services program offers incentive for homeowners on the island of Oahu, who install a new home battery. We also have about a dozen new grid services engagements in the pipeline and we look forward to working with more utilities and aggregators in the months ahead. Let’s talk about the installer digital platform. We are working to release Solargraf Pro later this quarter to improve the installer experience with an all-in-one solar and storage design proposal tool that incorporates shading analysis, the ability to detect obstructions on the roof, and 3D modeling of homes are driven by AI. The product is currently being piloted by key installers. Yes, some of our top installers and will be released later this quarter. The former solar business of DIN Engineering, now Enphase Noida provides proposal and permitting services. There we have added significant resources to accelerate automation and we expect to offer enhanced permitting services in the second half of the year. As part of our efforts to further strengthen the installer digital platform, we acquired 365 Pronto in Q4. The company offers the predictive software platform dedicated to simplifying maintenance by matching clean tech asset owners to a local and on demand workforce of service providers. The software platform will provide our installers the ability to service their own or O&M contract. Let me now give you an update on our Enphase Installer Network, or EIN. We have now on-boarded approximately 1,130 installers to our EIN worldwide through a highly selective process focused on installation quality and an exceptional homeowner experience. Next, I would like to comment on the California NEM 3.0 proposed decision or PD, which was announced originally in December. In our opinion, the PD in its current form unfairly penalizes solar-only system by imposing six charges, significantly reducing export compensation and retroactively changing the length of the original NEM contract. The PD was meant to encourage the transition from solar-only to solar plus storage. While we believe this transition is a correct long-term goal to meet California’s energy targets, storage is not yet fully mature for 100% attach in terms of cost, in terms of supply, in terms of permitting, warranty, and training. We would like to see a modified PD where the fixed charges are removed, the original length of the existing NEM contracts are restored, and a multiyear glide path is established to gradually reduce the export compensation. We are working diligently with various stakeholders to try and influence a better outcome in order to eliminate any market disruptions and create a win-win for all ratepayers and utilities. In summary, we are pleased with our overall performance. As a reminder, our strategy is to build best-in-class home energy systems and deliver them to homeowners through our installation and distribution partners enabled by an installer digital platform. With our recent acquisitions, we are now able to offer more complete home energy systems to our partners comprising of solar, batteries, grid services, load control, EV chargers and even compatibility with most third-party generators. We can also now offer design and proposal software, permitting services, installation and commissioning software, fleet management and monitoring software, and finally, O&M services for our installers through the digital platform. I would like to thank our employees for their hard work towards strategy and continued dedication to advancing a sustainable future for all. Before I turn the call over to discuss our financials, I want to inform you that Eric is retiring from Enphase. His last day at Enphase will be February 14. He has been a great partner to me over the last 3.5 years and his financial leadership helped drive us sustained profitability and shareholder value. We would like to thank him for his service and wish him well as he takes time to spend with his family. I am pleased to announce that Mandy Yang, our Chief Accounting Officer and Corporate Treasurer, has accepted the role of CFO, effective February 15. With Mandy as our CFO, we will have a seamless transition as we continue to deliver growth and operational excellence. Eric will be in an advisory capacity with Enphase through June 30 to assist with this transition. With that, I will hand the call over to Eric for his review of our financial results. Eric?
Eric Branderiz: Thanks, Badri and good afternoon everyone. I would like to convey my deep gratitude for my experience at Enphase. I have had the pleasure to work with not only a very talented executive team, but also a remarkable group of professionals who have shown such a hard work and dedication to the company. I want to especially thank Badri for his partnership and leadership in driving Enphase success. I plan to remain a shareholder and I wish the company continued success. I will provide more details related to our fourth quarter of 2021 financial results and hand over the call over to Mandy to provide our business outlook for the first quarter of 2022. We have provided a reconciliation of these non-GAAP to GAAP financial measures in our earnings release posted today which can also be found in the IR section of our website. Total revenue for Q4 was $412.7 million represented an increase of 17% sequentially and a quarterly record. We shipped approximately 1,082 megawatts DC of microinverters and 100.2 megawatt hours of IQ batteries in the quarter. Non-GAAP gross margin for Q4 was 40.2% compared to 40.8% in Q3. Non-GAAP gross margin was impacted by product mix. GAAP gross margin was 39.6% for Q4. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $68.2 million for Q4 compared to $57.3 million for Q3. The sequential increase was primarily due to increased investment in product launches, R&D, and IT infrastructure. GAAP operating expenses were $105.6 million for Q4 compared to $103 million for Q3. GAAP operating expenses for Q4 included $35 million of stock-based compensation expenses and $2.7 million of acquisition-related expenses and amortization for acquiring intangible assets. On a non-GAAP basis, income from operations for Q4 was $97.7 million compared to $85.9 million for Q3. On a GAAP basis, income from operations was $57.7 million for Q4 compared to $37.4 million for Q3. On a non-GAAP basis, net income for Q4 was $102.8 million compared to $84.2 million for Q3. This resulted in non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.73 for Q4 compared to $0.60 per share for Q3. GAAP net income for Q4 was $52.6 million compared to GAAP net income of $21.8 million for Q3. GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.37 for Q4 compared to diluted earnings per share of $0.15 for Q3. We exited Q4 with total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balance of approximately $1 billion compared to approximately $1.4 billion at the end of q3. We have repurchased our common stock for a total amount of $300 million on the open market in December 2021. Against our previously announced $500 million share repurchase authorization together with a $200 million of share buyback in May 2021 we have repurchased approximately 3.2 million shares in 2021 for a total of $500 million, with an average price of $155 per share. This represents approximately 2.4% of our outstanding shares. In Q4, we generated $97.2 million in cash flow from operations and $84.1 million in free cash flow. For the year 2021, we generated a record $315.5 million of free cash flow. Capital expenditure was $13.2 million for Q4 to expand both microinverter and storage manufacturing capacity as well as cost related to new product development. I will now hand over the call to Mandy to discuss our Q1 outlook. There is no greater joy for me to see her accepting this role of the CFO of Enphase. I cannot think of anyone more capable or with higher integrity to take on the challenges of this function as the company continues to grow both organically and in complexity. Mandy is a remarkable professional, with the right combination of finance and accounting technical skills, coupled with a proven track record of building large global finance teams. Under her leadership, she will take this function to an even higher level of excellence. Mandy has been Chief Accounting Officer and Corporate Treasurer of Enphase for the past 3.5 years and has done an outstanding job leading the controllership, finance operations, internal audit and control, treasury and tax functions of Enphase. With this transition to her as a new CFO, we will not miss a beat and I am very pleased she has accepted this new role. Mandy?
Mandy Yang: Thanks, Eric. It’s been great for me to work with Eric at Enphase. Under his leadership, we have built an exceptional finance team and I look forward to building on that foundation. We expect our revenue for the first quarter of 2022 to be within the range of $420 million to $440 million, which includes shipments of 110 to 120 megawatt hours of IQ batteries. We expect GAAP gross margin to be within the range of 37% to 40% and non-GAAP gross margin to be within a range of 38% to 41%, which excludes stock-based compensation expenses and acquisition-related amortization. We expect our GAAP operating expenses to be within the range of $130.5 million to $133.5 million, including a total of approximately $63 million estimated for stock-based compensation expenses and acquisition-related expenses and amortization. The estimated stock-based compensation expenses include approximately $12.3 million across for the earn-outs and are tied to certain performance targets for prepaying the company’s stock for the acquisitions of ClipperCreek and 365 Pronto. We expect our non-GAAP operating expenses to be within a range of $67.5 million to $78.5 million. With that, I will now open the line for questions.
Operator: Certainly. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Philip Shen from ROTH Capital Partners. Your question, please.
Philip Shen: Hi, everyone. Congrats on the strong quarter. Our checks suggest demand for the battery product is very strong even in the face of the two recent price hikes. When do you expect your battery volumes to possibly hit 180 megawatt hours? And when could a third supplier or the capacity within the existing two suppliers be increased? Thanks.
Badri Kothandaraman: Yes, thank you, Phil. We are very happy with our demand on batteries. So I will give you some color on how we have done in the last year. First of all, our battery DC coupled its modular low voltage DC operation uses lithium ion phosphate, which is extremely safe chemistry, air cooled, no need of any fans. Additionally, we offer 15-year warranty, no single point of failure. Through the last year, we have offered load control. We have offered power start generator compatibility. And all of those are the bells and whistles that we have continuously added on top of our batteries, the basic functionality. In addition, the most important thing I am proud of, we have trained over 2,000 installers, long-tail installers, it’s no secret that long-tail installers is Enphase’s bread and butter. We have trained 2,000-plus installers, installation companies that and then out of that 2,000, there is 1,300-plus installers who are certified, which is they have done an installation, they took the training, they did an installation and recertified them, extremely difficult to do one installer at a time in the last year. And we believe that’s the reason why our business is very strong and diversified. At the same time, in the last year, almost on a weekly basis, we have done weekly roundtables with our installers, where in every meeting we have 10-plus installers around and they are not afraid to talk about issues. And I am not saying we are perfect. But what we promise installers is we take feedback, we work on it, we improve our product and we make our product better and better and better. That’s why you saw us growing 53% from Q3 to Q4. And those are nice numbers by the way. From a supply chain perspective, every quarter, we are doing better on batteries, but it is no secret that the logistics challenges are global. And that’s what is causing a 14 to 16-week lead time on batteries. When do I expect it to get better? I expect it to get better continuously throughout 2022. And it is global, nothing specific with Enphase. Of course, we have pockets of shortages here and there, but our team has become excellent at navigating all of those very well. So, I expect continuous growth on batteries throughout the year. I am not going to give you a number on when we will break the 180 megawatt hours. And if we break the 180 megawatt hours soon, our cell pack suppliers are willing to flex and they will take us to a little bit more. So we are not worried about that too much. Right now, we are focused on servicing customers properly, adding new installers and making sure we improve customer experience.
Philip Shen: Great. Thanks for that color, Badri. And in terms of my follow-up, I was wondering if you might be able to share where the margins on the storage product is - or are today. And with the price increases, does that correspond with the 7% I think expected for March 1st increased? Does that correspond directly to that margin and how do you expect that battery margin to trend through ‘22?
Badri Kothandaraman: We are not breaking out the battery gross margin. The overall company gross margin was 40.2% in Q4 and I will talk, I will give you guys some general color on gross margins. In the last year, the overall industry, almost all industries have seen lot of component shortages and logistics problems, which is from a component cost perspective, the costs have increased significantly and the same thing on logistics, a container before which was $3,000 is now $18,000 6x increase. So, our costs have gone up. But what our team has done is remarkable, which is both our microinverters and batteries, we are able to still take costs up. Yes, couple of examples, which I mentioned in the Analyst Day, was the bulkhead. The bulkhead on our microinverter, that’s the project we have been talking about for some time, it is a painful learning for us, but it’s a very important project, because it helps us to remove when adapter cables shipped with the microinverters. And if we ship, I mean if we remove that adapter cable, the cost of the microinverter obviously goes down. So with initiatives like that, our cost has actually gone down, but because of the component shortages, the suppliers have raised, yes, I know cost on that, which is understandable and due to inflation as well. So, similar on batteries. On batteries, the same dynamics with reference to suppliers, what are we doing about it? Everyday, we work on the tactical stuff, how can we optimize enclosures, how can we optimize the battery management circuit? And then we are going to introduce a product in second half of 2022, where because we are going to increase the modularity a little bit from a 3.3 kilowatt hours to 5 kilowatt hours, we gain economies of scale there. So, that’s going to help us improve the cost on batteries come the second half of 2022 structurally. In addition, on top of that I showed you in the Analyst Day that early 2023, we will have a radically new structure at least for power conversion and battery management, where we integrate both power conversion and battery management into a single board both hardware and software unified. And then there is only one board between the battery and AC line versus we have seven boards that we showed you in the Analyst Day. So, we are extremely excited by that product and that will help us to get even more click down on costs as customers expect the optimal pricing from us. So, hopefully, I gave you some color. And so we are quite confident of the gross margin trajectory. And we are going to make a lot of progress soon.
Philip Shen: Great. Thanks, Badri. I’ll pass it on. 
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of J.B. Lowe from Citi. Your question please.
J.B. Lowe: Hi, good afternoon, guys. Question was on 4Q margins, I know the costs are increasing, but the margins you said were down due to mix. Could you just walk through what the product mix was and how it affected margins in 4Q?
Badri Kothandaraman: Well, like what I said, the product mix, we are talking about a drop from 40.8%, I think in Q3 to 40.2%. So it’s kind of very small, we are talking about. We just broke it out saying that on storage, we basically exceeded the higher end of guidance, so slightly depressed. But all the comments I just talked about on margin are true and the margins have been understandably because of inflation, because of increasing component costs and because of increased logistics, which I pointed out, there is always pressure on gross margins, but we are able to counter it. That’s what we do. We have a world class cost taskforce on both microinverters and batteries. We are not starting to work on anything. We work on capacitors, we work on transformers, we work on semiconductors, we work on transistors, we work on parting and I told you the big stuff like the bulkhead, but we work on numerous things at the same time. So we don’t distinguish between microinverters or batteries. The company continues to get healthier all the time. So when the component shortages go away, the supply chain constraints go away, the logistics constraints go away, then we will have structurally better gross margin.
J.B. Lowe: Okay, great. And then on the 1Q guide, just wondering if you could breakdown the growth we are going to see in top line 1Q, can we break it down between volume improvement and I know we are seeing volume improvement on the storage side of 15%, but I guess break it down between volume improvement on the micro side versus the pricing increases rolling through?
Badri Kothandaraman: Well, the pricing increase is only from March. So, it’s not going to be for the full quarter. I would say, impact of pricing increase is not going to be much. In terms of microinverters you all know that Q1 is seasonally down, but yet our business is not down. Batteries is a 15% increase. So, if you assume $600 to $700 or $600 to $800 per kilowatt hour is the price range, you can calculate it yourself. So, you can see that there is steady growth on both businesses both microinverters and batteries.
J.B. Lowe: Okay, great. Thanks. Badri and congrats Eric.
Badri Kothandaraman: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Brian Lee from Goldman Sachs. Your question please.
Brian Lee: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. Congratulations, Eric, on the retirement, you’ve always been one of my favorite CFOs. So you will be missed. And I look forward to working with you going forward Mandy. Couple of questions I guess just there is a lot of moving parts here. So, can you – I mean demand is obviously great and you are fixing all the supply chain issues from last year. But can you give us also a sense of I guess first on the Q1 outlook, how much is ClipperCreek adding and then can you talk about their margins and what that does to your overall margin profile? And then with the price increase on the batteries, are you seeing or anticipating any demand pull forward in Q1 ahead of the price increase, is that imbedded in the outlook? Just wondering if there is anything into Q1 we should be aware of? And then I had a follow-up.
Badri Kothandaraman: Yes, we are not breaking ClipperCreek out right now. With regarding gross margins, I already said the gross margins of ClipperCreek are in line with Enphase, so you can assume that. With reference to battery price increase, the price increases are beginning in March. So, the contribution for Q1 is a little bit less. But do I think that will influence demand? I mean, I don’t think so. It is fairly inelastic right now. Our backlog is quite high. The customers do understand we are taking care of them wherever we are able to. They know that we don’t pass all of our cost increases. We try to absorb them. And we only pass whatever we feel like we have to – so and we are going to give them plenty of time and that’s why it is effective in month. We give them plenty of time to adjust very transparent to them. So, we are not worried about demand.
Brian Lee: Okay, that sounds great. So I guess, as a follow-up to that Badri, I know Q1 is seasonally a little bit weaker. You would anticipate battery demand and volumes kind of back to that 30% sequential growth that you have been seeing outside of the slightly slower Q1, is that a fair assumption into 2Q? And then another kind of question around pull forward, is your Q1 outlook, I don’t think it does, but do you anticipate having any pull forward demand from NEM 3.0 uncertainty in California in Q1 or is that something we might maybe see in 2Q, just wondering if you’ve either seen any of that or you are forecasting to have some of that in the next couple of months here? Thanks, guys.
Badri Kothandaraman: Right. So I will give you some numbers for context. We grew 53% from Q3 to Q4 and a 15% growth from 100 is not too shabby. That’s our comment. Yes, we would like to grow 30%, but I already told you the comment on our lead time is 14 to 16 weeks, our backlog is very strong. Our lead time is 14 to 16 weeks due to logistics. The logistics situation will ease up every quarter a little bit. So, we expect to continuously grow. If it is, whether it will be 30% or not, I cannot make a comment on but we are very happy with our performance on batteries. And Brian, the last portion of the question, can you please repeat so I can answer.
Brian Lee: Yes, Badri. Just you alluded to NEM 3.0 uncertainty and your opinion on what needs to change, but in terms of impact on your business, are you actually seeing any demand pull forward in the state of California due to that uncertainty in your Q1 outlook or is that something you maybe anticipate would start to show up in Q2 if that uncertainty around NEM 3.0 continues to persist? Thank you.
Badri Kothandaraman: Yes. If I were to see the situation before December and after December, I wouldn’t say, if I were to extrapolate to the situation, I would not say that has been called through. And I am not sure if I can predict Q2, but you saw that the PD decision is delayed. I don’t know when the new schedule is, but that’s good news in general. I guess the installers are taking a breather right now.
Brian Lee: Alright, thanks for the color. Appreciate it. Congrats, Eric. Bye.
Eric Branderiz: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin from Bank of America. Your question please.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Hey, good afternoon team. Congratulations, Eric, Mandy, here. Let me start with an easy one. And I’ll follow-up with a more complicated one here. Just on the share buyback, just can you guys talk a little bit more to the thought process and further authorization obviously just incredible year if you look past tense, prospectively, it looks like trends, as you’ve already articulated look pretty robust, shares obviously reacting. How do you think about that and further authorization?
Badri Kothandaraman: Yes. I mean, our general philosophy is anti-dilution. So we look at okay, saying, how do we compensate for that? And we decided to do share buyback. So, we first look at do we have enough capital for the needs of the business, the daily needs of the business? Do we know – if we want to invest in contract manufacturing lines, if we want to do something on batteries do we have capital for that? That’s what we see first. And then we basically look at okay, are there any M&As that are in the hopper, where we can truly increase the value of the enterprise. So we look at that next. And we have – we evaluate a lot of companies every quarter. And then if we find we have enough for number one, we have enough for number two then we go down to number three. And number three, what we say is okay, am I confident that the share price today is below the conservative intrinsic value for the company. So, I look at that and then I make decisions, I may not hit it, I may not get the lowest stock price, lowest stock price over a period, but I know I bought it, because I consider the stock price below the intrinsic value of the company and that to a conservative value. So, that’s our thought process. And so for the year, we did – we had roughly over 3 million shares which was about 2.4%, which is a pretty healthy number. And you should expect that philosophy from us going forward, we still have about $200 million left out of the $500 million authorized by the board and we will execute on it when we think the time is right.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it. Alright. Excellent. And then just I want to revisit the storage conversation just a bit more, just to tie a couple of things that you said back, I mean, given the lead times that you described, I mean, conceivably you have visibility into well into second quarter as you start to think about that 16 weeks out and what that means on your thought process here. I mean, you also said you are not going to comment on when you break that 180-megawatt hour threshold here. But can you elaborate a little bit more on how you are thinking about the year shaping up on them, especially given the potential before that could manifest once you get clarity on that policy as well as just the underlying demand? I mean, as you have already alluded to and as already been discussed, I mean demand seems strong you’ve posted good numbers for 4Q, 1Q. Conceivably, you have got some degree of visibility into the year. I mean, maybe further parameters on how you are thinking about even stalking and securing supply around what a number above 180 might look like as well?
Badri Kothandaraman: Yes. I mean, just to tell you, you are right, lead time is 14 to 16 weeks. So we have good visibility, good visibility on the situation in Q2. And because now we have time for Q2, we are getting things ready. And like what I said, our business is very strong. But we are not going to guide Q2 for now. I am going to have Raghu talk about the NEM situation and how he sees it that playing out.
Raghu Belur: Yes. With regards to NEM 3.0, the original decision, which was supposed to happen now had come into effect at least 4 to 5 months after the decision was made and then it also required additional time for the utilities to gear up for that change. So, realistically was late 2022 or even in 2023 is when it would take come into effect. So I think from a pull through in demand was what probably not be seen in at least for the next few quarters, it’s likely going to be if there is if NEM 3.0 holds in its current form, which is may not be likely, demand pull through is likely to happen end of the year or even sometime early next year.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it. Alright. It sounds like everything is good, but a little bit early to talk about exactly how that compares versus the earlier guidance, right?
Badri Kothandaraman: Yes.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Excellent. Alright. Wish you all the best of luck. See you soon.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Colin Rusch from Oppenheimer. Your question, please.
Colin Rusch: Thanks so much. Guys, as you start investing in some of the software applications and have the remote upgrade possibility, how are you thinking about the business model and the revenue model for some of those software upgrades? Is it still included in the functionality of the hardware? Is there another one that we would like to start thinking about in the next couple of years?
Badri Kothandaraman: It’s still included in the functionality of the hardware. The way we think about, of course, we have businesses like Solargraf Pro. We have businesses like Pronto now, which are software type businesses, but if you asked me in reference to upgrade features etcetera, the way we think about it is we want to offer more and more and more features utilizing machine learning and AI, but with a view to improve customer experience. And so the data that we collect, the consumption data, production data we have – we are not going to monetize it in the traditional sense and we are not going to aggregate the data and do strange things with it. Rather, what we are going to do is we are going to look at patterns in the data, we are going to basically develop algorithms, we are going to do regression, we are going to ensure that we improve the customer experience going forward. This is we can do production forecasting, we can do consumption forecasting, we can do grid services events properly. We can figure out if it is possible to predict the grid stability and provide customers an earlier warning before. So, all of those for us are belong to the customer experience bucket. And our belief is if we do that properly for customers proactively, they are going to choose this all the time every time.
Colin Rusch: Got it. That’s helpful. And then just with the – I’d love to get an update on the sale of the NOL and when you are going to start having to pay cash taxes and how should we think about the tax rate as we get into the outyears?
Mandy Yang: Sure. I can answer that one. So currently in U.S., we don’t pay material income taxes. We still have sensible NOL for the upcoming 10-K you will see on Friday, we are going to file we have more than $150 million of federal NOL and also we have federal and state R&D tax credits. So between this year and next year, we don’t expect to pay any significant taxes in the U.S.
Colin Rusch: Great. Thanks so much to you guys.
Badri Kothandaraman: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mark Strouse from JPMorgan. Your question please.
Mark Strouse: Yes, thanks very much for taking our questions and Eric congrats again very much. Well deserved. Badri, I wanted to go back to, you talked a lot about the supply situation on this call. Wanted to go back to the 3Q call though when you talked about specifically the IQ8 and the potential for supply constraints there for just the ASICs given your early read on demand, can you just give us an update specific to IQ8, do you still see that as something worth monitoring this year?
Badri Kothandaraman: Of course, it’s always worth monitoring, but the situation is a little bit better. So IQ8, we started ramping IQ8 in late December, so shift a little in Q4. IQ8 uses, I mean, the overlap between IQ8 and IQ7 is quite high except for the ASICs as you rightly pointed out. We don’t see any problems with respect to that ASIC supply right now. So we would be heavily ramping the mix of IQ8 versus IQ7, that’s our preference going forward.
Mark Strouse: Okay. And then with the facility you are looking at in Europe for microinverters later this year, anything you can share yet regarding the potential output of that on microinverters per quarter or per year type metric?
Badri Kothandaraman: We haven’t finalized the location or the contract manufacturer yet. We are well under negotiations there. But typically what we do is when we install a contract manufacturing facility we put something called as a complete auto line, one full auto line. One full auto line is fixed, that’s about 750,000 microinverters a quarter. So, you can model that thing. We will have likely a full auto line and we need to finalize the location. We are going to try our best to get it operational by the end of the year and it will be capable of producing 750,000 microinverters per quarter.
Mark Strouse: Okay, very helpful. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of James West from Evercore ISI.
James West: Hey, good afternoon guys and congrats on a nice strong finish to the year and also congrats to Eric and Mandy, look forward to working with you going forward. I wanted to continue on the path of Europe here. I mean, you are pretty excited, you talked about rapid growth, what do you see driving that growth the most in Europe for you and what made you kind of make this decision to build a facility in Europe?
Badri Kothandaraman: Yes. Europe, we are excited at the prospects of growth there. We grew double in 2021 compared to 2020. Europe has been a little bit more advanced than the U.S. in terms of solar. And basically, the adoption is quite nice there. And we are very strong in Netherlands. We are very strong in France. We are very strong in Belgium. We just introduced storage in addition to solar that’s nicely ramping. Germany is one of the very exciting markets in Europe, which is probably over a gigawatt, 1 gigawatt solar and 80% attach of that for storage. And the reason it is 80% attach is most people do self-consumption because of feed-in tariffs there. They don’t have net metering feed-in tariffs. So, storage is strong. And actually Italy, we are entering Italy. And through our partner, Maxeon is our partner as well and they, with the help of AC modules, we are going to be ramping on solar in Italy. And now, we are going to add storage in Italy. Spain is very strong too. Spain is strong. Poland is strong. UK is starting to ramp up. So we have pockets of actually not even pockets, I’d say in many countries, which are in the process of ramping both solar and storage and we have plans to introduce storage through the year, one or two countries every quarter this year. So in general, we are extremely excited in the Analyst Day if you have seen in 2019. In 2019, I told you we had a handful of people in Europe, like 5 or 6 people and now that team we have probably we have 35 to 40 people today.
James West: Great.
Badri Kothandaraman: We have increased those – we are going to continuously ramp that thing and they are doing well.
James West: Okay, great, great. And then on the IQ8, you talked about the lower supply issues that you are heavily ramping the mix of IQ8 you plan to does that suggest that perhaps you that normal 4 to 4 quarter adoption period could be on the shorter side?
Badri Kothandaraman: No, no, no, I said I plan to and not heavily ramping yet, right, because we have just started.
James West: Got it. Okay.
Badri Kothandaraman: Just started, we shipped it, we – late December is when we started ramping. And typically our profile, I would call a successful ramp four to six quarters, that’s what I call a successful ramp. And we expect IQ8 to fall within that range. Having said that, we do have installers, for example, like Semper Solaris. We did a press release, Semper Solaris switched to us, because of IQ8. And many installers love the sunlight backup feature. They love it. They may not use it as a significant fraction, but they love the fact that it’s got technology and that they can use it if they want. So they will buy IQ8 over IQ7.
James West: Right. Got it. Thanks, Badri.
Badri Kothandaraman: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kashy Harrison from Piper Sandler. Your question please.
Kashy Harrison: Good afternoon. Congrats on the quarter and Eric, congrats on the retirement.
Eric Branderiz: Thank you.
Kashy Harrison: It’s a fair question. But if there weren’t any logistic related challenges today, in that theoretical world, do you think that demand would be closing in on your 180 megawatt hours of cell supply capacity today or is that maybe a bit too optimistic?
Badri Kothandaraman: Well, I am not going to breakout numbers, but the demand is very strong.
Kashy Harrison: Okay. And then maybe a question for either Eric or Mandy, so I know margins – gross margins for batteries aren’t as high as the gross margin for the inverters, but I was wondering if you could maybe talk a little bit about the incremental OpEx associated with battery sales? And basically, I am wondering if since the channels for inverters and batteries are so intertwined, does the gross profit from batteries just go straight into the operating income line with no real impact to OpEx, or would you expect an increase in OpEx as you as you ramp batteries as well?
Eric Branderiz: Well, we don’t look at it like that. We basically regardless, the company is modeled on OpEx, our baseline is 35, 15 and 20. Time-to-time, it may be a little bit higher on the OpEx side, but we will always be well above the operating income. But we don’t think about OpEx like that. For us, we think about a full system. When we think about a full system, it is a microinverter, it is a battery, it is a gateway, it is system controller. And when you combine all of these together, okay, I have forgot load control, forgot EV charger, generator compatibility. When I combine all of those, the number of interactions explode. The number of interactions explode mean, our R&D has to scale up. And they – we cannot scale up R&D randomly. It will scale up as a fraction of revenue. We have been disciplined there. So, it’s a long way – have been long winded answer. But we invest at a system level. And it is not, batteries versus microinverters. Everything has to scale up in the company.
Kashy Harrison: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joseph Osha from Guggenheim Partners. Your question, please.
Joseph Osha: Hi there. And Eric, we look forward to hearing what your next venture is going to be. Two totally unrelated questions, first is regards grid services. And you have talked about the progress you are making there, or are you typically working with someone that aggregates and manages resources like Stem or an Enbala or an AutoGrid, or is this a situation where you are providing the functionality all the way to facing off to the utility?
Eric Branderiz: We know both business models. We work for example, in the Connected Solutions program, we work with an aggregator called Energy Hub. And they work with the three utilities I have talked about. And we work in that model. But having said that our relationships are getting better with the utilities and we are starting to work directly with the utilities. The APS program we saw that you are going to start seeing more announcements like what I said we have a dozen grid services and engagements in the pipe, and many of them are working directly with the utilities. And we do have all of the software capabilities. All of the VPP capabilities dispatching – and dispatching a fleet at an aggregate level, we can provide that software to the utility. And they can utilize that software to control an Enphase fleet.
Joseph Osha: Okay, so that’s interesting. You have got that whole stack. Thank you. That’s helpful. Totally, unrelated question. Looking at your success in Europe, obviously, that market is growing, if you had this sort of split up your growth there into market growth versus share gain vis-à-vis, still some of the fairly large legacy string inverter providers there. I am wondering how you might think about that.
Badri Kothandaraman: You are talking about with reference to Europe.
Joseph Osha: Yes. Sorry, that was a convoluted question. Let me try it again. How much is your growth, you think is coming from just the market growing in Europe and how much is coming from taking share?
Badri Kothandaraman: Yes. I would say mix of both. Obviously, the market is growing and therefore we get our fair share, especially in places like Netherlands and France. And primarily what moves competitors or what moves customers to us is our quality and our service is as long as we are able to maintain our target 500 dppm which is 0.05% annual failure rate as long as we are able to maintain it on microinverters, as long as we provide outstanding customer service 24/7 to customers, we think we have the upper edge there. And so that’s the big reason why customers move over to us.
Joseph Osha: Yes. But the reason I am asking and I will go in a minute here is that in the U.S., obviously, it’s just down to you and one competitor in Europe. In Europe, it definitely is not. So, I am just wondering if we could plausibly imagine a future in a couple of years, where really, it’s only you and your main competitor and some of these string inverter companies just go away?
Badri Kothandaraman: Well, I mean, look, we can’t predict the future, but the reasons are very similar. People are tired of enduring bad quality product. And that’s the single most reason they come to us. We are a little bit expensive, but you cannot be looking at expense, you cannot be looking at pricing in vacuum. You got to be looking at the entire cost of ownership. And as long as we maintain our quality, like what I said that that’s the most important thing, which we are committed to and the customer experience that cannot let us down, we will continue to gain share.
Joseph Osha: Thank you. Okay, thank you. Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ameet Thakkar from BMO Capital Markets. Your question, please.
Ameet Thakkar: Good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. Most of my questions have been asked. But I was just wondering if you guys had any sense or color on how much of the battery capacity you delivered today, it’s been for customers that are actually retrofitting existing systems versus kind of new solar PV plus storage installations. And was that included? The retrofit opportunity, was that included in your, I guess Analyst Day presentation when you guys talked about a serviceable addressable market of 1.5 gigawatt-hours?
Eric Branderiz: It was and it’s hard to track. But I would say that is a good healthy mix of both. That’s what I would say. And obviously, when they have Enphase microinverters, they will prefer Enphase batteries.
Ameet Thakkar: Great. Thank you for that. Congratulations on the quarter.
Badri Kothandaraman: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Praneeth Satish from Wells Fargo. Your question, please.
Praneeth Satish: Hi. Good afternoon. Can you talk about the IQ8D and how that rollout is progressing? And I guess with the small commercial market, is it enough to win over the installers that serve this market, or do you need to ultimately partner with someone like a developer to really accelerate deployments into the commercial market?
Badri Kothandaraman: I will do a deep dive a little bit late. As you know, I thought we would be in production in Q1, but we are a little late. And the reason why we are a little late is we would like to take the time and do the full system. When I say the full system, I mean it is not just a microinverter which is already qualified and pass compliance. It is the gateway, the cloud software, the fleet management, the design proposal software, the permitting software. And the reason why we like the small commercial market is because it is an extension of residential market. In residential we service up to 20 kilowatts. That goes from 20 small commercial goes from 20 kilowatts to 200 kilowatts. And why is that important is the same long tail installers are the ones who participate in the small commercial markets. And that’s our focus. That’s our focus. That’s where we think we add a lot of value because the pain points are the same. It is quality and service. And we do have to pay attention to those areas and the challenges will be a little bit different as we go from 20 kilowatts to 200 kilowatts. We have used VLC for communication and now when you are doing it with hundreds of microinverters, those will be stretched. But we look forward to ramping with those installers we already know and do business with and we can do rapid shutdown as well, easily. So, that’s the major driving force versus other competition. So, in short, it’s the similar install base as residential. We have the relationships already. They need rapid shutdown. They need very high quality. They need great service. And it’s a natural extension for us from residential.
Praneeth Satish: Thanks. And just to follow-up what then is your latest timing in terms of IQ8D?
Badri Kothandaraman: Yes. Like what I said, we are going to ship the select installers for a pilot ramp in Q1. So, we will have the smart revenue in Q1. But the real ramp will be over the next few quarters. This is not a – it’s not that when I am ready, I start ramping immediately from day one. It is – it will take some time for the market to develop there. So, you should expect over the next several quarters is when it will ramp to a healthy level. And we broke down those details in the Analyst Day.
Praneeth Satish: Got it. That’s it for me. And congrats, Eric on the retirement.
Eric Branderiz: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steve Fleishman from Wolfe Research.
Steve Fleishman: Just a question, maybe to put any 3.0 and some context, could you give us some sense of what percent of revenue is coming from California in your Q1 forecast or from 2021 actuals?
Badri Kothandaraman: Yes, I am not sure about the exact number. I would estimate something like 20% of the revenue, roughly, overall revenue.
Steve Fleishman: Great. And then separate question just in some of – I know, BBB has kind of disappeared from focus recently. But some of the versions, later versions included subsidies for domestic production inverters and including microinverters. If we were to ultimately get a bill that that had that in there, how quickly could you shift to domestic production?
Badri Kothandaraman: So, the BBB, the one in debate is $0.11 per watt credit for microinverters. And you know that we will never do manufacturing ourselves. We will enlist the help of our contract manufacturers. It’s quite attractive to have a made in America product with that kind of credit. And we do have contract manufacturers who are potentially lined up should this happen. Your question on how long it will take from when we select a contract manufacturer to when we can start ramping in the U.S. will take me six months to nine months.
Steve Fleishman: Great. Thank you. Appreciate it.
Badri Kothandaraman: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Your next question comes to the line of Sophie Karp from KeyBanc. Your question, please.
Sophie Karp: Hi, good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question and congratulation again on the great quarter. All questions have been answered, maybe just a couple for me. First, how do you envision your year shaping up sitting aside I guess, the unpredictable events such as the outcome of NAM, or any major disruptions, you grow so fast that this analogy almost doesn’t matter. But should we be expecting maybe some particle of relative softness somewhere throughout the year based on your seasonal patterns?
Badri Kothandaraman: I think our business has fairly diversified that between the different states in Europe, between not just shipping solar, sorry different states in the U.S. And not just that we are shipping solar only, but you are seeing that solar plus storage is also many different states are now, tax rates are continuing to grow up, well beyond California, California, Florida, Texas, Puerto Rico, Hawaii, East Coast, etcetera. Grid services is becoming – the business of grid service is also continuing to grow. We talked about how fast Europe is growing over the year, more storage. We will start shipping storage into newer countries in Europe as well. So, in general and as well as countries like Brazil is continuing to grow. So, what you are seeing is our business being more and more diversified, not only within the U.S. or not only within California, but outside of California, other states in U.S. and in Europe as well. So, while we may see these occasional road bumps like an issue here in California, I think the business is pretty robust anymore, that we will be able to absorb those bumps.
Sophie Karp: Thank you. And as a follow-up question, maybe if you can talk a little bit about what your views are now on M&A, you recently did an acquisition, but fairly small. Is there anything out there? I guess that’s potential attractive opportunities in some spaces or technologies that you may look into potentially doing modules this year?
Badri Kothandaraman: Well, I mean, we have a strategy. The strategy is basically, selling best-in-class, our products or home energy systems, to homeowners through our installers and distribution partners enabled by digital platform. So, components of the home energy system, if you see we have solar, we have storage, we have grid services, compatibility generators, we have load control. We didn’t have EV before we bought EV chargers. We think EV chargers is you have – they need to be managed. And we bought them for batteries. We have fuel cell partnerships. There is nothing much to talk about it yet. We will talk about it when we are ready there. That’s on the home energy system. So, we will continue to add more and more things at the product level there if it is aligned with our strategy. And I am not – I cannot talk about any specific companies right now. On the installed digital platform there are six pieces, which I mentioned in the Analyst Day, which is lead management, which is an interesting area for us and we will inform and we will keep you informed when our plans are finalized there. So, that’s the potential area. Design and proposal software, we bought a company Solargraf Pro and we are making it a soft desk and we are making it a lot better by introducing shading, by introducing storage 3D, all bells and whistles, so we are making that better. Then permitting services, our team in Noida services nearly 30% of the entire North American solar business, solar permitting business, they do that today. And we are going to make that better in terms of injecting more automation, etcetera. Then we will come to commissioning software. There it’s homegrown and there is no way we are going to buy company for that. It’s got hundreds of man years of work in it and we are going to make the continuously better we have a very large team there. Then comes the enlightened mobile app. Yes, this is the homeowner app monitoring fleet management, etcetera, which again enormous investments, hundreds of man years and we will grow organically there. O&M, you saw the investments that we made in 365 Pronto. These are software platform that so we like it. And we are not going to get into the – O&M itself, we are not going to have traction letters, but we are going to enable transactions with a two-sided marketplace. Customers on one hand, service providers on the other hand and we connect both of them, the two sided marketplace. So, the two components you have to be thinking of is best-in-class home energy systems, best-in-class digital installer, digital platform. And whatever acquisitions we need for that we will do. But those will likely be smart acquisitions. They will be tuck-ins. There is no silver bullet.
Sophie Karp: Got it. Thank you so much.
Badri Kothandaraman: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tristan Richardson from Truist. Your question, please.
Tristan Richardson: Hi, good evening guys. Really appreciate all the commentary. Just one for me on the EV charging products, now that you have that under the umbrella a few months, curious about the innovation pipeline there and whether it would be vehicle-to-grid or vehicle-to-home and the potential there to develop that product or – and if so, could that be margin accretive, or are you seeing more the EV charging product complementary to just your core Ensemble strategy?
Badri Kothandaraman: Yes. So, I am going to articulate a little bit on what we are doing tactically, maybe for the next few months and then Raghu will talk about the vision on V2H, V2G. So, we are very happy with the acquisition of ClipperCreek. They already make very high quality level two chargers. They have shipped 110,000 of them, healthy revenue growing and the market is growing at a 40% CAGR. Like what we told you at the Analyst Day, and very nice gross margins, profitable business. So, we are very happy there. All that we want there is, immediately we want to do three things, give them a lot of scale. Scale means, only contract manufacturers can do it properly. So, professionalize that, that’s number one. Number two, is introduce chargers to our installers and distributors. And obviously, we need to make sure that the supply chain is robust there and that’s why, I said that we need to transfer to contract manufacturing first. Number three which is important is I have laid like every ClipperCreek chargers shipped from the contract manufacturer, to have connectivity. And that connectivity is extremely important, because we need to make these chargers intelligent. They need to be able to support, optimize tariffs. They need to be able to support charging on a schedule. They should help, support green electrons. If a homeowner says I want to utilize solar for my EV charging, he should be able to take that preference immediately and make that happen. It should be able to work with that Ensemble system seamlessly. So, connectivity will help us on those fronts. So, those are the three actions that we are thinking immediately. And then comes, international expansion is another one, which I should have said that that’s our short-term focus, which is Europe is a very big market for EVs. So, it’s obvious that we need to be in Europe. So, we are going to be – we are going to be starting to ramp heavily on that front, ramp up plans there. The last one is bi-directionality. So, Raghu is going to talk about that.
Raghu Belur: Yes. I think as Badri mentioned integrating EV into Ensemble, where you are treating EV purely as a load brings a lot of value for the homeowner, because you can really control, you can decide on what the source of the electrons are, the duration, the rate, etcetera. So, a lot of value in energy management system. But beyond that, EV just as a – should not be looked at simply as a load, there is an opportunity to do reverse power flow there, which is fully bi-directional, where you can use the EV for both for things such as grid services, as well as for resiliency. So, the grid services part would be the vehicle-to-grid part. And then resiliency part would be the vehicle-to-home part. In the event of an outage, you have this extra significant amount of source there, which is about 100 kilowatt-hours can that participate and keep your home – keep the home microgrid sustained in the event of an outage. So, both of those, both vehicle-to-grid and vehicle-to-home requires some development and that development includes whether decisions have to be made whether you are going to deliver that energy DC or AC doesn’t end for us, it doesn’t matter. We are open to doing it with both AC or DC or IQ8 is capable of delivering of providing a DC interface into the car or an AC. In addition to that, there are a few other things – challenges that need to be solved like standards development still needs to complete. There are a couple of standards CCS and CHAdeMO today. But I think that IEEE standards are being developed to figure out how to do this bi-directional power flow. And finally, grid interaction is pretty complex, because now the EV has to be fully compliant to all the advanced grid function requirements. So, we are diving deep into it. We are laying out the full plan. But regardless of whether we do it through an AC-to-AC interface, or an AC-to-DC interface, or capable of providing both of those and I think bringing the EV on to the Ensemble platform and providing – and not just being a smart load, but also being a very intelligent source brings a lot of value for our customers.
Tristan Richardson: Of your battery. Thank you. And Eric all the best to you.
Eric Branderiz: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Eric Stine from Craig-Hallum. Your question, please.
Eric Stine: Hello, I am just sneaking one in here on ClipperCreek, I know you just touched on that. But just curious, I mean based on the nature of that product when you do install, roll that up to the install and network. I mean how do you see that play out maybe compared to the storage product? And then curious, how do you think of this, or how should we think of it in terms of attach rates or maybe capture rate of spend per home, just anything like that to guide us going forward.
Badri Kothandaraman: Yes. I mean, regarding the introduction of our installers, we think they will lap it up. They would love it, because solar plus storage plus EV charging, infrastructure setting up in your home, they would love that, because it isn’t that expensive. I mean with fully installed, maybe with all installation and EV charger installed will cost you $1,500. And if you couple it with solar plus storage, it might even be lower. And there is obviously tax credit, etcetera, that are in there. So, we think is a general positive. And that’s why we are excited to introduce it to our installers and distributors and globally as well.
Eric Stine: Got it. So, I mean, really, in terms of thinking about the growth, it’s more about, as you said, getting the contract manufacturer in place, getting the supply chain in place, rather than the limitations being, training installers and attach rates or educating the customer. I mean this is really about just getting the manufacturing site in place.
Badri Kothandaraman: That’s right. It’s relatively a simple product to get installer some education, but not terribly complicated. And of course, we got to get the secret sauce, right, which is to make sure that it is compatible to an Ensemble system and provides that intelligence to the homeowner. And in terms of thinking about the business, I don’t need to tell you, but you can correlate the business directly to the growth of EV. So, if the EVs grow at 40%, for example, CAGR, these will grow even faster than that. And so it’s – yes, it’s going to be, healthy CAGR and we need to get our manufacturing straight. That’s why we are moving to contract manufacturing house.
Eric Stine: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our final question for today comes from the line of Pavel Molchanov from Raymond James. Your question, please.
Pavel Molchanov: Thanks for taking the question. Just one for me, also about ClipperCreek. You mentioned that installer awareness and skill set is not constrained, but in practical terms, what portion of your existing kind of installation customers are – have any historical background in installing charging equipment in homes? Is there a number or a percentage that you can provide?
Badri Kothandaraman: Yes. I wouldn’t be able to provide it now. But I would say that there is probably a 20% to 30% overlap, that’s my guess.
Pavel Molchanov: Okay. Very good.
Badri Kothandaraman: And bear in mind that installing is the supply equipment. And so they already have the main panel open when they are installing solar plus storage. And so coming in and installing a piece of equipment on the wall and drilling a conduit on a 40 amps and landing it on a 40 amps circuit is going to be pretty straightforward. It’s what – it’s kind of work that they do already with solar and storage. So, I don’t see a huge jump in requirement of training or skill set to do that.
Pavel Molchanov: Okay. I appreciate it.
Badri Kothandaraman: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. This does conclude the question-and-answer session of today’s program. I would now like to hand the program back to Badri Kothandaraman for any further remarks.
Badri Kothandaraman: Thank you for joining us today and for your continued support of Enphase. We look forward to speaking with you again next quarter. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for your participation in today’s conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect. Good day.

===== 2021 Q3  (2021-10-26 22:11:05) =====
Operator: Good day and thank you for standing by. Welcome to Enphase Energy's Third Quarter 2021 Financial Results Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. After the speakerâs presentation there will be a question-and-answer session.  . Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your speaker today. Karen Sagot, please go ahead.
Karen Sagot: Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us on today's conference call to discuss Enphase Energy 's Third Quarter 2021 results. On today's call are A - Badri Kothandaraman, Enphase 's President and Chief Executive Officer, and A - Eric Branderiz, Chief Financial Officer.

The Company has provided a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures in its earnings press release posted today, which can also be found in the Investor Relations section of its website. Now, I'd like to introduce A - Badri Kothandaraman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Enphase Energy. Badri.
Badri Kothandaraman: Good afternoon, and thanks for joining us today to discuss our third quarter 2021 financial results. We had a good quarter. We reported record revenue of $351.5 million, shipped approximately 2.6 million microinverters, and 65 megawatt hours of Enphase Storage systems. achieved non-GAAP gross margin of 40.8% and generated strong free cash flow of $100.7 million.  We exited the third quarter at approximately 41, 16, 24. This means 41% gross margin, 16% operating expenses, and 24% operating income, all as a percentage of revenue on a non-GAAP basis.  As a reminder, our baseline financial model is 35, 15, 20. CFO Eric will go into detail about our financials later in the call. Let's now discuss how we are servicing customers. Our Q3 Net Promoter Score worldwide was 67% and our North American Net Promoter Score was 71%, both unchanged from Q2. Our average call wait time went up a little bit, and was at 5.5 minutes in Q3, compared to 3 minutes in Q2, primarily related to the growth in our business.  We're working on reducing call wait times to under a minute through additional staffing and training. We have increased the number of field service teams in the U.S. and Europe to provide on-site help to our installers, particularly for storage. We remain laser-focused on customer experience. Let's talk about manufacturing.  As we have discussed in the past earnings call, the global supply chain is under stress. Our situation is getting primarily better due to our hard work and qualifying alternate suppliers. For the AC FET drivers, we now have 5 suppliers qualified.  Our supply of AC FET drivers is much better in Q4 than the prior quarters. For the A6 yields in our microinverters, we are a little bit tight on supply, but we expect to manage the situation. While we are happy with the overall supply for Q4, the situation is quite dynamic worldwide for both supply chain as well as logistics.  We remain vigilant and Kashy Is given the growing demand. So, given our strong demand, we are adding a fully automated line in Mexico in Q4, bringing our quarterly capacity in Mexico to approximately 2.2 million microinverters.  We have already added a second fully automated line in Q2 at our contract manufacturing partner in India bringing that quarterly capacity to over 1.5 million microinverters in India. Along with our existing capacity in China, we expect to easily achieve our target global capacity of 5 million microinverters per quarter by the end of the year.  We have now geographically diversified two-thirds of our contract manufacturing capacity outside of China. Let's now talk about batteries. Our 2 sources for battery cell packs have increased the capacity to a total of approximately 180 megawatt hours per quarter from 120.  Our existing suppliers are capable of adding more capacity required. In the meantime, we are working on adding additional suppliers in 2022 to achieve global diversification. Our lead times for storage systems are long today at approximately 14 weeks due to the global logistic challenges.  These lead times will come down once the shipping constraint and port condition improve. Despite these headwinds, we expect to increase shipments of our entry storage systems by approximately 45% sequentially in Q4. Let's move on to the regions. Our U.S. and International revenue mix for Q3 was 76% and 24% respectively.  The U.S. market demand was quite strong in Q3 and we reported record revenue. We had record sell through from our distribution partners to installers or both, microinverters, and in storage. While our microinverter channels inventory was at a healthy level at the end of Q3, our storage channel inventory remained tight, due to strong demand and logistics issues.  We expect microinverter channel inventory to remain manageable in Q4, and expect storage channel inventory to get better. In Europe, we reported record revenue in Q3. We continue to have solid growth in Netherlands, France, Germany, and Spain. Our storage business in Germany is just getting started, and we are continuing to train a lot of installers.  In September, we announced our entry into Italy, where we are providing IQ7 family of microinverters to residential installers. Earlier this month in October, we began selling Enphase Storage systems to customers in Belgium, further expanding the products availability in Europe.  Overall, I'm very pleased with our growth in Europe. In Asia-Pacific region, revenue declined a little bit in Q3, primarily due to ongoing COVID lockdowns in Australia. Despite the disruptions, we are pleased with the growth of the Enphase Installer Network, the continued adoption of our high-power IQ7A product, and growing strength of our AC model  chips.  In Latin America, we reported record revenue in Q3, largely due to the increased sales of solar and storage systems in Puerto Rico. We are quite optimistic about our business in Puerto Rico, and expect steady growth the next few quarters especially in storage.  We also announced our entry into Brazil in September, and started shipping IQ7 + microinverters installers in early October. Now that we have covered the regions, let's discuss the overall bookings for Q4. Our overall customer demand for Q4 once again exceeded the high end of our guidance. The component availability is currently much better in Q4 compared to Q3, but not fully there yet.  We are optimistic that our supply will catch up to demand by early next year. Let's now move to an update on our storage systems. We shipped 65-megawatt hours of Enphase storage systems in Q3, which was a 51% increase from Q2. Let's discuss the training for Enphase storage systems.  By the end of Q3, we had trained 3,771 installer personnel, representing approximately 1700 unique installation Company. Our hands-on during installation training through our mobile vans and training centers, also started ramping in Q3 with electricians and lead installers attending training sessions and experiencing valuable hands-on time with real systems.  which will allow installer to visit the site, install and commission an Enphase storage system in less than a few hours. We recently introduced two new features for our Enphase storage system.  In late May, we introduced Load Control, which provides homeowners the ability to conserve their energy consumption by shedding non-essential loads during an outage and thereby extending the backup duration. We have full circuits for Load Control designed into our Smart Switch. These loads will be on when the grid is present, and shed automatically in the event of a grid failure.  This feature has configurable and controllable by the homeowner via our Enphase app. Last week, we announced that our home energy systems will soon integrate with most leading models of home standby AC generators providing enhanced performance and a glitch-free transition for homeowners during power outages.  Homeowners can monitor real time the power flow, start and stop their generator remotely, set quite hours to prevent their generator from operating until their batteries fall below a certain state of charge, and control it all with Enphase app. This new feature functions without a dedicated generator automatic transfer switch and eliminates the power glitches that reset home appliances when switching to generator power.  This new feature will be available to installers in the U.S. in November. With the addition of these new features plus our laser focus on customer experience, we continued to see -- we continue to see an acceleration in demand for our Enphase storage systems. As a result, we expect to ship between 90 and 100 megawatt hours of Enphase storage systems in Q4.  Let's talk about new products. Yesterday, we announced the all new all-in-one Enphase Energy system with IQ8 Solar microinverters for customers in North America. IQ8 is Enphase's smartest microinverter yet. Unlike competing devices, IQ8 can form a microgrid during a power outage using sunlight, providing backup power even without a battery.  Since the Company's inception, we have invested in custom applications. specific integrated chips for our microinverters, and today we see a big payoff with a software-defined microinverter smart enough to form a microgrid. Many homeowners often assume that their solar systems will function if the sun is shining, even during a power outage. This is unfortunately not being true until today.  Now with IQ8, homeowners can realize the true promise of solar, to make and use their own power. IQ8 solar microinverters can provide sunlight backup during an outage, even without a battery. The Enphase Energy system with IQ8 comes in 4 different configurations. The first is solar only, which is a standard grid-tied system that everybody is used to today.  The second is sunlight backup, which I just talked about, without a battery. The third is very interesting. It's Home Essentials backup with a small battery for glow power and nighttime backup. The fourth, the full energy independent. A solar system with IQ8 and a large battery.  While the first configuration, as I mentioned, is a standard grid tied system, the remaining three configurations are grid agnostic system which need an Enphase system controller or a Smart Switch, which islands the home during an outage.  For homeowners who want a battery, there are no sizing restrictions in pairing an Enphase battery with an IQ8 solar system. All the configurations can be customized for homeowners with the help of our valued Enphase Installer partners. We started piloting IQ8 to select installers in Q3. And we will be ramping shipments in Q4 beginning December. We expect the IQ8 ramp to take four to six quarters, much like the IQ7 ramp.  Let me also say a few words about IQ8D. So IQ8D is the high power 640-watt AC microinverter capable of supporting 2 DC panels, primarily for the small commercial solar business. We expect to start piloting IQ8D with select installers in Q4, and begin production shipments in Q1.  This product is very important to us, not only for the small commercial solar business, but also for our next-generation batteries as we increase the discharge power and improve our cost structure.  Let's turn to digital transformation. Both of our recent acquisitions achieved record revenue in Q3. Enphase Montreal, which provides design and proposal software, added a significant number of new installers. We plan to release several new software features early next year to improve the installer experience.  Enphase Noida, which provides proposal and permitting services for installers, also experienced a significant increase in customer demand, and it's focused on automating the creation of permit plans sets to further expand installer base.  Both teams will significantly leverage the Enphase Installer Network to grow and expand their business. Let me now give you an update on our Enphase Installer Network or EIN. We have now onboarded approximately a thousand installers to our Enphase Installer Network worldwide, through our highly selective process focused on quality and homeowner experience.  Our EIN in the U.S. has grown 57% since its introduction last year. We're very pleased with this initiative's progress and are thankful to our installers who act as our product demand , provide an exceptional experience to homeowners.  Let's talk about grid services. Last quarter, we discussed our participation in the Connected Solutions program which is an incentive program implemented by three utilities in the Northeast U.S. to reduce electrical demand during high yields period s.  Our storage customers in Connecticut, Massachusetts, and Rhode Island can sign-up, monitor, track money earned, and control participation in the program using the Enphase app. We are pleased to announce in Q3 our participation in the Hawaiian Electric 's battery bonus great services program.  This program offers a new incentive for homeowners on the Island of Oahu who installed a new home battery. The first customers accepted by Hawaiian Electric into the program will be eligible to receive $850 per kilowatt than they commit to make available during a fixed 2-hour period each day.  The program helps Hawaiian Electric realize the goal of 100% renewable power by 2045, and more homeowners than ever before  plus storage system. We expect to engage with more  and aggregators in our grid services program during the months ahead.  In summary, we are pleased with the overall progress we have made this year. We now have solar storage, load control, grid services, and generator compatibility as part of our Home Energy Management System.  We're making significant progress on the digital platform for installers in order to cut soft costs. We will remain laser-focused on both the products and the digital platform to deliver a superior customer experience for both our installers and homeowners.  I'd like to make one more important announcement. We will be hosting an Investor Day on November 16th to provide a deeper update on our business. More details will follow over the next few weeks. With that, I will hand the call over to Eric for the review of our finances. Eric.
Eric Branderiz: Thanks, Badri and good afternoon everyone. I will provide more details related to our third quarter of 2021 financial results, as well as our business outlook for the fourth quarter of 2021. We have provided a reconciliation of these non-GAAP to GAAP financial measures in our earnings release posted today, which can also be found in the Investor Relations section of our website.  Total revenue for Q3 was $351.5 million, representing an increase of 11% sequentially and a quarterly record. We shipped approximately 913 megawatts DC of microinverters and 65 megawatt hours of Enphase storage systems in the quarter.  Non-GAAP gross margin for Q3 was 40.8%, the same as compared to Q2. Non-GAAP gross margin was impacted by higher logistics and expedited costs, partially offset by a price increase on microinverters and continued cost management. GAAP gross margin was 39.9% for Q3.  Non-GAAP operating expenses was $57.3 million for Q3  $51.7 million for Q2. The sequential increase was primarily due to increased investments in R&D, IT infrastructure, and brand awareness marketing programs.  GAAP operating expenses were $103 million for Q3, compared to $68.4 million for Q2. GAAP operating expenses for Q3 included $44 million of stock-based compensation expenses and $1.6 million of acquisition-related expenses and amortization for acquiring intangible assets.  On a non-GAAP basis, income from operations for Q3 was $85.9 million compared to $77.2 million for Q2. On a GAAP basis, income from operations was $37.4 million for Q3 compared to $59.4 million for Q2. On a non-GAAP basis, net income for Q3 was $84.2 million compared to $74.7 million for Q2. This resulted in diluted earnings-per-share of $0.60 for Q3, compared to $0.53 per share for Q2. GAAP net income for Q3 was $21.8 million compared to GAAP net income of $39.4 million for Q2.  GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.15 for Q3, compared to diluted earnings per share of $0.28 for Q2. Now turning to the balance sheet and the working capital front. Inventory was $65.4 million at the end of Q3 compared to $37.8 million at the end of Q2.  The sequential increase was due to the expected higher demand for our Enphase solar and storage systems in Q4, as well as longer lead times due to growing -- grow our logistics and supply chain challenges. Days of inventory outstanding was 28 days at the end of Q3 compared to 18 days at the end of Q2 to support the growth in demand. Our target is 30 days.  Accounts receivable were $273 points -- million at the end of Q3, compared to $281.2 million at the end of Q2. DSO 54 days in Q3, decreased for 65 days in the prior quarter. We exited Q3 with a total cash and cash equivalent and marketable securities balance of approximately $1.4 billion compared to approximately $1.3 billion at the end of Q2.  We did not make any share repurchases against our recently approved $500 million share repurchase authorization. In Q3, we generated $113.4 million in cash flow from operations and $100.7 million on free cash flow.  Capital expenditures was $12.7 million for Q3 to expand both microinverters and historic manufacturing capacity as well costs related to help development website and IT. Now let's discuss our outlook for the fourth quarter of 2021.  We have picked our revenue for the quarter to be within a range of $390 million to $410 million, which includes shipments of 90 to 100 megawatt hours of Enphase storage systems. We expect GAAP gross margin to be within our range of 37% to 40% and non-GAAP gross margin to be within a range of 38% to 41%, which excludes stock-based compensation expense.  We expect our GAAP operating expenses to be within a range of $119 million to $122 million, including a total of approximately $52 million estimated for stock-based compensation expenses and acquisition related expenses and amortization. We expect our non-GAAP operating expenses to be within our range of $67 to $70 million. Let me provide some additional color on a few topics.  The revenue guidance assumes an increasing microinverter shipments including IQ8, as well as a storage systems shipment. We expect to ship 90 to 100 megawatt hours of Enphase storage systems in Q4, representing approximately 45% sequential growth at the midpoint of the guidance. We expect improved component availability for microinverter production in Q4, and continued momentum for the Enphase storage systems.  On the cost side, we are continuing to expedite components and finished goods in Q4 to ensure customers have an adequate supply of our products. We expect the quarterly expedited expenses to remain at similar levels as Q3.  Due to the steep increase in logistic costs and increase in component cost driven by inflation, we are implementing a modest price increase on all products starting in the second half of Q4. It is also prudent for us to maintain our baseline financial model as we continue to navigate the global component supply constraints and logistic challenges.  Finally, I would like to touch upon our OpEx guidance. Our guidance for non-GAAP operating expenses as a percentage of revenue is expected to increase in Q4. As we mentioned on the last earnings call, our OpEx, maybe slightly above our 15% targets at times, but we still expect to be comfortably above our baseline target of 20% operating income.  We continue to invest significantly in R&D to further our competitive advantage. Significantly, we are more focused on semiconductor integration in -- of our ASIC and software advancements, including cloud software to increase our system performance, reduce cost, and increase reliability.  We also ramp up our marketing expanse in the back-half of the year with new product launches and brand awareness. For Q4, accruals for post-combination expenses from prior acquisitions are expected to be approximately $3.6 million. With that, I will now open the line for questions.
Operator:  We ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up and then re-queue. Our first question comes from Brian Lee with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Brian Lee: Hey guys. Good afternoon, thanks for taking the questions. Kudos on the strong results here. First one I had was just around the storage business. Eric, Badri, you guys talked about 50% growth or close to 50% growth sequentially here again into 4Q based on the guides.  I'm just wondering, with all the supply chain headwinds and concerns that are out there, I know you talked a little bit about the expedite, but is this product that's already in the channel or can you talk about visibility into shipments? And if there are any supply chain or logistical constraints that you're embedding in that number or kind of how de -risked it is?
Badri Kothandaraman: Yeah. So, to just give a general color on the storage business so that you understand why our demand is picking up. We introduced the storage system in July of 2020. It's beautiful product, distributed architecture, modular AC coupled, lithium ion phosphate safe chemistry, air cooled.  And of course, we had interesting features like Power Start, which helped us to optimize starting an air conditioner . And of course, Enphase customer service, which my expectations are that we will get better and better and better with our NPS beyond 17 in the future.  We've learned a lot in the last year, especially when it comes to homeowner experience, the kind of notifications they need to get. And when it comes to installers, ease of use, ease of install, ease of commissioning. So, a lot of learning has gone into it.  We have made continuous hardware and software updates in the last year. and they told you in the last earnings call that we introduced Load Control in May of 2021. Load Control helped quite a bit in terms of customer experience. We are finding that's quite successful.  There's a lot of uptake. And simultaneously, along with the introduction of Load Control, we also optimized our pricing. Initially, we did start a little bit high, and then we thought it's the right time to optimize pricing.  So, we did that, and we improved -- with the improvement in commissioning with Load Control, with the drop-in pricing, we started seeing a lot of demand. So Q3, obviously, unleashed a lot of demand. And that's the number you saw 50% growth from Q2.  And that demand is continuing to stay healthy as we improve our product more and more and more. So, there is no demand limitation for Q4. For Q4, we said we will do anywhere between 90 and 100 megawatt hours. Primarily, that's gated by logistics.  As you know, the situation globally is quite dynamic. Containers are scarce to find; the container costs have increased 8X. Ocean freight has increased 8X. A typical container used to cost a couple of thousand dollars is now $16,000. So, there's a lot of stress on logistics, lot of stress on supply chain situation.  That's kind of limiting our supply in Q4. We're going to ship 90 to 100-megawatt hours. However, one thing which I didn't talk about is, we're really happy at the adoption of the product by our long tail. Long tail of installers is really, if you see the statistics, it's astounding.  We have trained 1,700 installation Companies through our Enphase University. And a 1000 -- over 1000 of them are certified. Certified means not only they have to complete the training, they have to complete a real install with Enphase on the line guiding them.  And there's over 1000 installers were certified right now. So, we expect that number to continuously increase. We expect the demand to be broad-based. We expect the demand to go up and up and up. And of course, the logistics situation needs to improve global. It's not situation specific to Enphase. We are covered from our contract manufacturers and our cell pack capacity, etc.  Like what I said, we are covered from that. It's purely a logistics issue, and we expect to therefore ship 90 to 100-megawatt hours. With regarding Q1, and I'm afraid I cannot talk much right now about Q1 because the situation is so dynamic that whatever I say will be wrong tomorrow.
Brian Lee: Yep, fair enough. Absolutely, it makes a ton of sense. Maybe just with that as a bit of Segway, I'd sort of zoom out the question around the margins as well. I mean, you guys have been navigating this environment as well as anyone out there. You've been tracking at this sort of 40% to 41% non-GAAP gross margin level despite all these elevated costs, despite all the supply chain issues.  And this year you have the two price increases. You've got the IQ8 coming in. And then presumably less or lessening supply chain and logistics cost as you head into 2022; I know you can't crystal ball that, but if you kind of take all of that into account, it seems like there's a setup here where you should be earning significantly higher gross margins at some point next year, assuming some of these things normalize.  So, can you speak to that a bit? Where you're at today and why you wouldn't be at a significantly higher gross margin at some point as you move through next year? Thanks guys.
Badri Kothandaraman: Right. The -- that is the following puts and takes. If you see our component suppliers, the folks who supply components to the microinverters and batteries, are in the same situation as us. They are increasing a lot of costs on us, and some of the component costs have gone up by over 100%. And because the supply chain is so tight, I have to airship many microinverters, which costs a lot of money.  Not only on top of that, ocean freight -- I just now told you, ocean freight is apex more expensive. So, you cannot hide here, right? Wherever I go, the costs are going up tremendously. What we did was we have made a lot of cost reductions over the last year. So, we were able to absorb some of the cost increases. And we tried to absorb a lot of them.  But we are in a situation where we have to pass some modest price increases to customers. That's what we exactly did. Now, I don't have a crystal ball with me. I do not know whether 2022 brings in better logistics anytime sooner and I'm not sure what's going to happen to the elevated component costs that the suppliers are charging.  But it's fair to say, the next two or three quarters the situation is probably not going to die down and so our gross margins are -- I cannot predict what's going to happen in Q1. Q4, we gave you a guidance and we are sticking with that guidance.
Brian Lee: All right. Fair enough. I will take the rest offline. Thanks, guys.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Aric Li with Bank of America. Your line is open.
Aric Li: Hey, good afternoon. Thanks for the questions and congrats on the quarter. First, I wanted to touch on factors impacting the storage lead times. I know you talked about an 8 to 10-week target before, relative to 12 to 14 weeks in Q2, and you mentioned 14 weeks just now.  How much of that is driven by the worsened freight and logistics constraints? And how much of that have you been able to offset by your directly controllable efforts if you can speak to progress on the latter as well?
Badri Kothandaraman: The situation is quite a bit different in Q4. We have no problems in our manufacturing. The constrain is all coming from the global logistics. It is -- transportation of dangerous goods is even more scrutinized, the costs are even more, a nd so the supply -- it's all about the global logistics and unfortunately, we cannot air ship batteries like microinverters. It just doesn't make sense economically to air ship batteries.  So therefore, we are at a place where we are stuck, where we transport these batteries through the ocean. And we are in the same game as everybody else. When the situation gets better in terms of all the port conditions improving down to the shipping constraints going away, then we'll start to see the lead times drop to their natural number, which is around eight weeks. But for now, the lead times are over 14 weeks.
Aric Li: Got it. So over 14 weeks is embedding, you already accomplished your directly control  on the manufacturing. Appreciate the clarification there. And on the 2Q update, you also talked about getting towards 120-megawatt hours.  And 1Q, the lead times were to drop towards 8 to 10 weeks. Given the higher -- the time outlook of over 14 weeks, can you just give us an update on how you think about that volumetric ramp against the upside of the higher quarterly cell capacity at 180 megawatt hours. Appreciate it.
Badri Kothandaraman: Like what I said, our two cell pack suppliers are capable of doing one AB megawatt hours a quarter. And right now, it is purely logistics constraint. It is not a demand limitation. So, it's too early for me to talk about Q1.  But if you look at our past history, especially in 2021, we have had healthy, reasonable growth every quarter, and we expect to do the same going into 2022. However, but the exact guidance for Q1 and the exact growth, etc., we would have to give it to you in Q1 guidance.
Aric Li: Thank you. I will take the rest offline.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Moses Sutton with Barclays. Your line is open.
Moses Sutton: Hi, thanks for taking my question. Congrats on the quarter. To confirm the modest inverter price increase. That starts in 4Q, mid-4Q, or already in 3Q, or was this another increase?
Badri Kothandaraman: This is another one. Starts in mid-4Q.
Moses Sutton: Great, great. And then how much of the two recent acquisitions, the Soft desk and DIN, are contributing, maybe on a percentage of run-rate revenue today, if we were to annualize it?
Badri Kothandaraman: We're not going to breakout that much. Let me give you some color. There are 2 companies that we acquired earlier this year. The first one was called Softest, and the design and proposals tool for installers that they have is called Solargraf.  Solargraf basically, the installers can go in there, they can drop the solar panels on the roof, they can get a proposal calculation, so that they can discuss at the kitchen table.  And what have we done. The team is a very smart team, Obviously, they were affected a little bit by COVID. They had some hiring limitations. But all of those are results.  Right now, the team is firing on all cylinders, they understand exactly the improvements that we have to do, which is we're working on shaving, we're working on 3D, we're working on adding storage, and we expect to all of those to be added and released by early next year. And so that will become a best-in-class tool for installers.  Now, the second one is that Company guard DIN. DIN does proposal and permitting services. This is an installer phase. Here is the address of the home. I want a proposal in 8 hours. Or, here are the details about the contract details. I want a permit plan set.  You are to create a permit plan set and give it to me in 24 hours. So, the Enphase Noida team -- Noida is a city northern India. And that team basically does proposal and permitting services. Very healthy growth in Q4 and they're servicing right now big installers.  They're the name of the game for us is our we going to get the automation of the permit plan sets, so that we can increase the quality and the turnaround time and keep the turnaround time to near zero. They're working on automation of those permit plan sets. And once that is done, then I will introduce that capability to all our long-tail installers.
Moses Sutton: Great. That's very exciting.
Badri Kothandaraman: Just to summarize, those 2 are doing exceptionally well. They hit records in Q2, they hit new records in Q3, and I expect them to perform well going forward.
Moses Sutton: Very great. Thank you. Just to squeeze one last one. By 4Q, how much of your storage as a percentage of shipments are outside the U.S.?
Badri Kothandaraman: We just started shipping into Germany. It's really not material at this point. As you know, when you start shipping into a country, you need to get installers trained.  Training of installers is not easy. But good thing about Europe is most of it -- most of the demand comes from long tail installers. We know how to survey long tail installers. It means a great product which is easy to install, great training, great customer support.  And it's not going to come just like that. It's a business we need to block and tackle and build steady. So, I would say it is not material at this stage -- the international business. Right now, U.S. is doing extraordinarily well in storage.
Moses Sutton: Great. Thank you. I'll take the rest offline.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark Strouse with J.P. Morgan. Your line is open.
Mark Strouse: Thanks very much for taking our questions. So just to the extent that supply chains are improving -- understand that, like you said, things are very fluid. But assuming that some of those improvements are sustained, just curious how you're thinking about potentially accelerating the roll-out of some of these products like IQ8 and the storage product more globally. Does that accelerate your plans at all? If this is sustained?
Badri Kothandaraman: There are some things in our control, there are some things not in our control. i already talked about the logistics situation which is not in our control. Whatever was in our control was the AC FET driver supply. What we did was we basically pivoted.  We had 2 suppliers early last -- early this year, which we -- which I think in Q2 it was 3. Now it's 5 suppliers. So really, we have solved the problem of the AC FET drivers simply by hard work and qualifying a lot more suppliers. Now, let's come to IQ8. IQ8 offers a lot of interesting possibility.  Why is IQ8 -- why we think the IQ8 is going to make a huge difference is until now, homeowners are under the assumption that their solar system will not produce power -- will produce power during the grid outage as long as the sun is shining.  We -- only a few of us know that that is not true. The standard solar system needs the grid, voltage and frequency as a reference. So therefore, during grid shutdown, you don't have that voltage and frequency as a reference, therefore there is no power from a standard solar system. We are changing that paradigm. IQ8 is a microgrid farming microinverter. So, we think this opens up very interesting possibilities.  And one other thing about IQ8 is it does not require any particular storage size to be paired with it. In other words, at the extreme case if there is no storage, the ratio of solar to storage is infinity. There is solar on the roof, there is no storage, you divide the two, there is infinity. So, our IQ8 is blazing fast and can adjust itself to any kind of grid conditions.  Having said that, use case 2 which I talked about, sunlight backup. It's backup using the sunlight without storage that fuels case 2 in the event of a grid outage. Now, we think our customers would mainly buy a small battery along with it because when a cloud cover comes, you don't want to lose power.  At that time, you want some immunity there. So, a small battery will be perfecting order to make sure you have enough resilience. Then, you don't need to buy a large battery, you can buy a small battery.  Some people might say, no, I'm just happy with solar, I only need -- I only lose power twice a year. I'm happy with solar and sunlight backup, which is use case 2 is perfectly fine. Now -- so homeowners have their own way of choosing what they want according to their needs.  But Enphase will provide the entire range of what they need with the help of our installers. Because installers are extremely important to educate the homeowners there. So that education process will take some time, and as normal with any new product, there will be ramp. But this product is going to be a game changer.  When you have a grid type product and when you have a grid agnostic product side by side, you have to question, who's going to buy a grid type product? I didn't give you specific numbers, but we are excited about IQ8. And we think it's going to make a huge difference for our business going forward.
Mark Strouse: Okay. I'll take the rest offline. Thank you very much, Badri.
Badri Kothandaraman: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Colin Rusch with Oppenheimer. Your line is open.
Colin Rusch: Thanks so much, guys. Can you speak to the potential of IQ8 enabling you to enter into the commercial rooftop market in a little bit more aggressive way, even before you introduce the IQ8D?
Badri Kothandaraman: We are imminently going to introduce a IQ8D. And yes, we are a little bit late there, but the beta installations, which I call pilot installations, are happening this quarter. And IQ8D is really a product with fantastic cost structure.  You have 640 watts of AC and they are all packed into a form factor that's only slightly bigger than IQ8. And it is perfect for the small commercial business. Maintaining very high qualities, still the Enphase quality. And the small commercial business folks can accept a two-panel one-micro solution.  So, to answer your question, we are going to be introducing IQ8. We are going to start ramping in the first quarter. Not only we are -- let me step back. We are actually thinking about IQ8 as a not a microinverter only, we are thinking about it as an entire system.  What do I mean by an entire system is an asset manager or an installer comes to our website and wants to design a product for a building, for a gas station, for a hotel, for a school, we will enable all possible tools. He will be able to go and draw what he wants on the roof. He'll be able to estimate and get a quick proposal. He'll be able to go and do permitting services that he needs.  And in short -- and one more important thing, fleet management. He will be able to manage his fleet and have enormous flexibility on doing what he wants. He will be to see on a given day whether it was profitable or not. On a given day, if you made money, he'll be able to get incredible resolution on which microinverters doesn't work, and with the touch of a button, he'll be able to call Enphase.  So, we're thinking about its end-to-end folding. And this is with a view towards the asset managers, with a view towards the installers with our end-to-end system. So that's where we have taken a little bit of time. Having said that, like what I said, we're going to pilot it in Q4 and start ramping in Q1.
Colin Rusch: That's helpful. And it's a nice segue into my second question. So, with the additional functionality and all the data that you collect on these systems, can you talk about your strategy for monetizing that data? It's been something that's lingered around the Company for a number of years. But I'm curious how you guys are approaching the potential to monetize a lot of that data. And also, the performance of these systems on a granular level.
Badri Kothandaraman: Well, right now, to tell you the truth -- tell you bluntly, we haven't monetized enough. But the places where it's helping us get better is by having information at our fingertips.  We are able to predict problems better than -- meaning, in other words, we don't need the customers to call us, we can call customers. So that's in terms of customer service, and in terms of monetization.
Eric Branderiz: I mean the -- yeah, I mean the only thing that I will say is extreme value to us, that the -- outside the monetization is incorporation of behavioral patterns of consumption and production to build algorithms using artificial intelligence for tertiary controls.  And that is super important in terms of the home energy management experience, on top of the cost of our service elements that Badri says to resolve issues like immediate  and so on.  And ultimately that information can be embedded in  trading platform to do microgrid trading. So, there are multiple layers on that. So, if you're thinking about packing that information and ultimately monetizing it into -- selling it to a third-party is not in the works right now, right Badri?
Badri Kothandaraman: No. What we think is in the small commercial business, what do people care about the most is they cannot even lose one day of savings. Extremely important for them. You cannot lose 1 day of savings.  Therefore, if we are able to be -- if we can proactively look at that, and if we can hyper analyze that with our Nakar network operation center and fix problems before they happen, that's the holy grail.
Eric Branderiz: For commercial projects, imagine asset manager having all this information of the power or the fleet performance, how differentiated will be a platform sold within the IQ8D solution, as a bundle solution for the asset manager is going to be -- is at the panel level, very transparent, and very easy to follow, very easy to use, update, upgrade, monitor all the performance metrics of our , and so on and so forth.  And finally, one area of the battery developed is the grid services platform, on understanding our ability to dispatch power in use. We call it the frequency regulation capabilities to allow the homeowner to monetize that asset at their will. Meaning having that formation available for forecasting and also for dispatching.  And doing voltage regulation, frequency regulation, and ultimately the power availability for . So those are the pieces of data right now that we have in line.
Badri Kothandaraman: Yeah. We'll talk a little bit more at the Analyst Day.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Philip Shen with ROTH Capital Partners. Your line is open.
Philip Shen: Hi, everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. Congrats on the quarter. Wanted to dig into the chip supply situation a bit more. I know you gave a bunch of color already. But in terms of the component availability catching up to demand, it seems like we're going to get a meaningful improvement in Q1. Is it fair to say that the bottleneck from chips might be limited by Q1, or is it maybe Q2, or perhaps the back-half of '22? Thanks.
Badri Kothandaraman: Q4 is a significant improvement from Q3. That's the first thing you should note The AC FET driver shortage. we have effectively mitigated by qualifying five suppliers. I also mentioned constraint on the ASIC's, the ASIC situation.  And I think we can reasonably navigate it for Q4. And what's the path going forward? Once again, it would be foolish for me to predict what's going to happen in one because it's dynamic. But knowing what I know situation in Q1 should get better than Q4.  I don't know how much, but the situation in Q1 should get better. And once the worldwide supply chain logistics situation gets solved, then we should be able to meet -- our supply should be able to meet demand. But right now, we live in a dynamic situation, that's why it's not good for us to predict what's going to happen in Q1.  Right now, this is what we're giving to you in Q4. Our Q4 supply is meaningfully higher for the AC FET drivers, because we have enough of the AC FET drivers and ASICs. And that's what the guidance is based.
Philip Shen: Great. Thanks for that color.
Eric Branderiz: To add one more thing Phil., Remember also, the Q1 fence should be a, seasonal quarter, right? So those are the kind of things as you model and you think about this, the demand is there, we supply, we'll mutually serve each other its typical seasonality.
Philip Shen: Great. Thank you both. As it relates to the next-generation products, you guys are just launching IQ8, congratulations on that. And you have a four to six quarter ramp. But if we can get any color on the next-generation products.  That might be interesting. Perhaps it's the IQ9 and what, what is perhaps talk through the feature set there and then perhaps the timing around when that could be released and what you're looking for with IQ9, thanks.
Badri Kothandaraman: We'll talk a little bit more about IQ9 in the Investor Day. The -- on IQ9, just a quick thing. It is basically, the power -- power is getting higher and higher and higher. And if you want to dissipate the higher power through a same form factor you need innovation. And when you start looking at innovation, there is innovation that needs to happen in the transistors, which are what I call the output AC transistors as well as the DC transistors.  The innovation needs to happen there. The innovation needs to happen in the ASIC. That's relatively easy, needs to run at a higher-frequency. Innovation needs to happen at the transformer level because now the transformer can be a lot lesser if you run the AC transistors at a higher-frequency. It needs all three of these to work in tandem.  We need a transistor that's capable of tolerating much higher current in much smaller form factor. The second is an ASIC that's capable of driving to that frequency. The third is a transformer that can be many  to gain advantage from the increased frequency.  All three of them are going to be worked on in IQ9, so that we can deliver even more higher power with smaller farm . So, I'll stop at that. Bottom line, it's innovation. You'll hear it, and -- but in the meantime, we've got IQ8. IQ8 is the innovation, and the IQ8 ASIC enables the response tying to grid events to be significantly faster, orders of magnitude faster than IQ7.  That's so we can get away with any storage size. So IQ8 is -- and like what I said, I've already said it and we couldn't be more excited. And there is a lot of innovation in IQ8 that's still going to come as incremental products. For example, IQ8H. IQ8H is the highest power version that we have today.  That's the highest power version we have made at Enphase. It's 384 watts of ASIC. In IQ7, we had an IQ7 A, in which was 366 watts. So, we continuously tweak the power as we  incremental products. But IQ8 is a great product.
Philip Shen: Just a quick follow-up. Is the IQ9, do you think it's two years away or do you think it's further out?
Badri Kothandaraman: We'll talk more on the Analyst Day. I mean, we want to have to have a particular cadence on our microinverter s going forward and we'll talk a little bit more about it in the Analyst Day.
Philip Shen: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Connor Mcmahon with Wolfe Research, your line is open.
Connor Mc Mahon: Hey guys, good afternoon. On competition, I have two questions here. So first, obviously one of your peers gave more on their new micro solution at their Investor Day, a month or so ago. Just curious of any thoughts on how the Enphase offering compares here, or just more broadly, how you expect the competitive environment to evolve over the next couple of years. And then secondly. are you seeing any risk of losing share due to the price increases you've push ed through next -- so far this year? Thanks.
Badri Kothandaraman: Yeah. You're talking about the competitor that introduced a microinverter. Now, we have seen a lot of competition in microinverters over the years. We don't neglect any of them. We take all of them seriously. In desk is the competitor. It's a formidable Company. We have a lot of respect for them. They have a big balance sheet. We're not sure what they're going to do, but we are focused on what we can do. We have made eight generations of microinverter.  We have very strong IP, 300 plus veterans. All of these microinverters that are based on the ASIC chip. Semiconductor architecture that has gotten ASIC custom designed by Enphase. And that custom design by Enphase enables us to do a single-stage architecture. Because we do a single-stage architecture versus the standard dual stage architecture.  What happens is we use reduced number of components Because we have reduced number of components, our heat dissipation is a lot lesser. Because our heat dissipation is a lot lesser, our quality is high. As I always have said, my target DPPM is 500. 500 parts per million for microinverter.  That's 0.05% we are talking about, and that kind of outstanding quality comes due to our custom ASIC architecture and high level of semiconductor integration. So that's what we have done over time. And now to add icing on the cake, it is IQ8 -- is good for me. It is -- can, it can do sunlight backup in the absence of a power grid without a battery. So that's where we're going.  And when you asked me about next, I did talk a little bit on IQ-9 and IQ-10. Right now, IQ-8 has got single phase , soon we will have three-phase . So That's the direction we're going. It's all about innovation for us. Innovation will drive high-quality. High-quality will drive great customer experience. That's what we are all about.
Connor Mc Mahon: Great. If I could Just ask the second --
Badri Kothandaraman: Right?
Connor Mc Mahon: Just if you're seeing any risk of losing share due to the price increases you put through?
Badri Kothandaraman: No, we're not really seeing a risk and the customers understand if a container last year was $2,000 -- an ocean container -- now it is $16,000. It is component costs have risen rapidly. For us, sometimes more than 100% in coming component cost.  And because of the constraint, we are forced to put inverters on planes to answer them. Imagine the container cost, make the overall situation tough. You're seeing inflation in the U.S. exactly plus 5.4% compared to this September is 5.4% compared to last year in the US.  So, both times we did a single-digit price increase, low-single-digits, by the way, and we are incredibly sensitive to installers. Actually, we are incredibly sensitive to distributors, installers and homeowners so that when we try to take as much heat as possible.  And when it comes to, okay, let's make sure we are pragmatic. We decided to pass single-digit percentage price increase. So, we think -- no one likes price increases, but we think our customers will understand and they will appreciate, and I'm not worried about it.
Connor Mc Mahon: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from James West with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.
James West: Good afternoon, Badri.
Badri Kothandaraman: Hi.
James West: Quick question on the margin guidance here. I know you're using your typical baseline guidance, but given you brought up freight, a number of times, we know inflation is going through the system.  Should we be concerned that as this continues as logistics problems continue that we will be closer to the lower end of your guidance or do you feel like that was already all baked into what you had in 3Q, and so that we should we should be comfortable.
Eric Branderiz: Yes. Well, thank you for the question. This is Eric. So, James, I -- one of the things that Badri and I, we always are very cautious is making sure that whatever we guide is a number that we can come behind it, to the best of our knowledge as we stand today in front of you guys.  And so, the range is a range, and it still remains a range. If you look at our past track record on the way we deliver every quarter, we tend to be doing pretty well based on that range.
James West: Right. Right.
Eric Branderiz: So, you can track our past record on that front, right? In terms of the moving parts, we feel in many ways that our  bottoms-up forecasting process and the way we manage our costs and the opportunities that we have based on our technology that Badri had described provided -- provide us unique visibility over perhaps a few quarters ahead of us.  But right now, based on the reality of the logistics, another example, just to give you the spot pricing on components, right? And in many cases t, the availability of those components you need to be an additional price.  And so, some of them can be short-term, some of them they may stay with us. In the meantime, we continue very disciplined on our cost reduction roadmaps . So, within the visibility that we have, within the guidance that we provided, that hopefully is pretty consistent.  And the way we've been conducting ourselves in the past, even under extreme supply constraint challenges, we know how to manage fairly well within the quarter. So, I hope with that I answer your question and give you comfort that when we put something in front of you guys, it's the best that we can with a lot of analytics.
James West: Yeah, Eric, that was very helpful. Thank you. And then maybe Badri on IQ8, you're excited, we're excited -- the technology is really excited and I look forward to seeing it at the Analyst Day. I'm curious if you could roll it out faster than that 4-6 quarters, maybe speed up the rollout of the technology.
Badri Kothandaraman: We've had experiences with the rollouts. We did with IQ 6 that took a lot of time we did with I Q7. This product requires a little bit of education, but it's obvious to most people. We think it could be faster.  But it's difficult for us to predict. Transitions are always hard, transitions are complex. Lots of puts and takes. It is the installers -- we are educating the installers. We were educating distributors actually, we did that.  Now we have been educated installers and we need to make sure that we helped them to put their best foot forward with the homeowners. And that process does take a little bit of time. That's why we thought, success for us is 4 to 6, so obviously 4, I would be thrilled with 6.
James West: Right.
Badri Kothandaraman: I would look for lot more improvements we can do in the future, but I think it's reasonable number right now.
James West: Okay. Got it. Thanks, guys.
Badri Kothandaraman: Thank you.
Eric Branderiz: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And we have a question from J.B. I'm sorry, we have a question from Amit Zecher with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.
Amit: Hi. Thanks for squeezing me in, guys. And congratulations on the quarter. It looked like your international revenues were up. I think about 5% sequentially. I was just wondering if you'd give us a little bit of color on what kind of regions or specific countries are kind of driving that.
Badri Kothandaraman: Yeah, actually it's pretty simple. Europe is growing. They're doing very well. And in Europe, the countries that we are doing well, Netherlands, France, Belgium, Spain. We're just starting to ramp in Germany.  We introduced IQ7 the into retailing. So that's going to start ramping very soon. We introduced Enphase storage systems into both Germany and Belgium, we're going to see those effects but it's really all about Europe.  Latin America is a region that we are excited about, especially Puerto Rico. Puerto Rico is very strong for us in terms of storage. We expect continued growth in Puerto Rico also other storage in the next few quarters. Brazil is another one you should be looking at, that you should be watching closely.  And in Brazil, it's too early to talk about numbers, but it is a big market on 0.6 gigawatts of solar. Of course, it is a cutthroat market, but I think with some intelligence -- with some intelligent way to sell the product, and with products like the IQ8D, along with our products like IQ7 A, which is the highest power products, we should be able to make a serious dent coupled with innovative financing.  We'll be working on that a lot, but we're excited about Brazil; it's a huge opportunity for us. So that's the color on international, mainly Europe for now.
Amit: Great. Thank you, guys.
Badri Kothandaraman: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from J.B. Lowe with Citi. Your line is open.
J.B. Lowe: All right. Hey, Badri, Aric, Karen. How is everybody doing? Question was on what kind of pricing and margins on the storage products are embedded in the 4Q guidance?
Badri Kothandaraman: Yeah. We have not broken out the margins individually by our product line. And -- but yeah, I get that question a lot. Is storage -- What's the margin on storage? What are we confident about, etc. I want to mention the following.  We just started shipping storage last year. We are ramping. It took us some time to ramp. We were in the early stages before â our cost is usually it's common knowledge that the cost is high relatively at an earlier stage of Ramp, and that situation is changing.  We are streamlining everything as far as the product is concerned, the supply chain, the manufacturing, the cost structure, etc. We are also working on new products, which I will share with you at the Analyst Day.  Very often in storage, the two metrics to focus on, are basically, kilowatt hours per liter. And actually, watt-hours per liter and watt-hours per kilogram. Those are the two metrics to focus on. And for us, the way we can maximize watt-hours per liter -- if you maximize that, obviously your cost comes down -- manufacturing costs, product cost comes down.  And how do you maximize that is by building best-in-class power electronics because things that -- cell pack is pretty decent. But if you take the cell pack on one hand and if you take power electronics, those are the two things
Eric Branderiz: that you need to work on. Cell pack is already pretty decent. So, we're working on power electronics to do best-in-class integration. And we'll share more of our thoughts on the Analyst Day, but we are working on those furiously, and those will help us to achieve best-in-class cost structure on storage.  And remember, we will not enter any business until we are confident unless we are confident that they will meet our target baseline. That's why we set to target basically, and we wonât enter businesses where we cannot achieve that.
J.B. Lowe: 
Eric Branderiz: Yes, at a minimum.
J.B. Lowe: Okay. That's helpful. Another question I had was just on the rollout of IQ8D -- as you're talking to potentially a new set of customers. I mean, I know there's long - guys that do  and small-scale commercial.  But what are some of the new partnerships? Or are there a lot of new partnerships that you guys are going to need to forge to really expand into that business and how is that process going?
Eric Branderiz: Yeah. So, to give you some color, it is right now -- we think the long tail installers are neglected in this segment, which is specifically -- and I won't call it as a niche segment. It's a small commercial segment.  That means 20 kilowatts to 200 kilowatts. And very often these installers are the same installers who do residential. And we are talking about motels, hospitals, churches.
Badri Kothandaraman: gas stations. We're talking about relatively small instance here. And so, the name of the game for us is the same. Provide great customer experience to our installers. Provide highest quality to our installers. The installers do have a pain point. A lot of the solutions they have today are not high quality. That's were Enphase can add value, and that's what we're going to do with IQ8D products.  Address that 20 to 200-kilowatt segment, and try to win over that segment, win over the installers who serve with that segment. And one of the ways we think we can know it is by offering a complete solution. It's not just micros, it is -- you talk about the design soft in solar -- design software, and then proposals, then permits, then fleet management, then operations and maintenance.  With best-in-class quality microinverter. Now of course, I mean, one of the other things which again, we will share our thoughts on the Analyst Day, is the small commercial controller also begs the question of small commercial storage.  So, we'll share a little bit of a thoughts there too. But for now, it is just transited in one line. It's a very similar dynamics of installers. They all want high-quality and great service. We're going to do exactly that.
J.B. Lowe: Okay. Great. Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. We have a question from Maheep Mandloi with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
Maheep Mandloi: Thanks for  questions and congrats on the quarter. Badri you've been talking about strong demand but at the same time, there's a lot of supply chain challenges. I Just wanted to understand that better.  Is the issue or the challenge across the whole supply chain from sourcing manufacturing to shipping? Or is there any specific pin for any of your value chain right now? I just have a follow up on it.
Badri Kothandaraman: Simply put, if you segment the business into microinverters and batteries, microinverters, we have largely solved the supply constraints. On the batteries, you have a logistics issue, that's huge.  And the microinverters, honestly, you will have logistics issues, but on the batteries it's bigger because we have a flexibility of air shipping microinverters, which we do not on batteries. And that logistics issues are nothing specific to Enphase.
Maheep Mandloi: Got it. Thanks for the clarifications. And the Philip just won the third battery supplier and I know you were talking about getting someone, or signing someone outside of Asia to resolve some of these challenges on the battery supply chain. Just curious on that  of when we could hear more on that?
Badri Kothandaraman: Right now, we have two battery cell pack suppliers. Both of them are in China. Originally, we set that together, they will have a capacity -- they can give us the capacity of 120 megawatt outs a quarter.  Now, because of our relationships, that capacity has increased to 180 megawatt hours a quarter. We can probably get a little bit more from them, even more than 180 per quarter if we want. However, the point you raised is right, which is global diversification, which is, what are you doing in the event that it's a disruption in the supply chain in China.  So, we have a lot of interesting opportunities that we're working on. I'm not prepared to share about any specifics yet, but that's the focus area for us, and we are working on it. And when we have something concrete to announce, I'll I share with you.
Maheep Mandloi: All right. Thanks, answering my questions.
Operator: Our next question comes from Tristan Richardson with Credit Suisse Securities. Your line is open.
Tristan Richardson: Hey. Good evening, guys. I appreciate all the commentary on IQ8. Very helpful. Just going back to that 4 to 6 quarter ramp. You noted that you hope to be successful by the end of that period. Just curious what success looks like.  Can you frame that for us? Is it for IQ8 becomes prevalent amongst the EIN, or that you're at that -- at a place of critical mass where you can start pursuing the long-tail with this new product, or -- just curious kind of what success looks like at the end of that ramp phase.
Badri Kothandaraman: Yeah, success, I've thought about this too. Success is a few areas. Like one is educating new homeowners about the innovation from Enphase. I'm hoping that will happen here. And so that's one that's a success.  The second one is we are able to able to enable -- I mean, we are able to have or realize cost effective toted system sizes for the market. In other words, let's say I have 6 kilowatts solar system. I don't need a 16 kilowatts of storage system. How about I only get 6 kilowatts storage system just for the essential backup by me.  How about an enormous flexibility in that choice? I should be able to get a 3 if I need, to 3 kilowatt hours. Because all I care, let's say my requirement as a homeowner, let us say is only to keep but the light on. I should be able to do that with many minimal costs, with 0 constraints.  So, it's going to enable all kinds of use cases with the range of batteries. And hopefully it's going to make the overall system affordable for a lot more people, right? And in the extreme case, the case with no storage, which is sunlight backup only. There may be some population will say, you know what? I am okay.  I lose power only, like what I said earlier in the call, the two times a year, maybe five times a year. And at that time, I'm perfectly happy. If I have backup power only during the day. Right. So, success for me is the batteries.  They come -- batteries become a lot more common, which is the , which is IQ 8 Solar Systems with Small Phase batteries just start sprouting at every home. But that's me. With all due respect, the homeowners have their own way of choosing things and that installers that are going to help them to make the correct choice for them. And all I can do is to speculate, nothing more.
Tristan Richardson: That's helpful. And then just going back on the pricing side, does the pricing dynamic including IQ8 or is pricing on this product it's completely unique and it just reflects out differentiated this is versus the remainder of the product portfolio.
Badri Kothandaraman: Yes, so we're not breaking out the exact specifics of IQ8 rising in this call, but I IQ8 as a microinverter adds a lot more value than IQ7, so we priced it based on that value.  Obviously the IQ8 ramp that is -- right now in Q3, there was no IQ8 shipments, so none of the financials until Q3 into IQ8. But we do plan to start shipping IQ8 from Q4, expected in December, and it will be higher price compared to IQ7.
Tristan Richardson: Appreciate it. Thanks, Badri.
Badri Kothandaraman: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Joseph Osha with Guggenheim Securities. Your line is open.
Joseph Osha: Wow, I made it. Hello everybody.
Badri Kothandaraman: Hi.
Joseph Osha: Two questions for you, one financial, one technological. It sounds to me like you're saying that IQ9 is probably going to be the first product that steps away from IGBT's and uses some kind of wide band  is that fair to say?
Badri Kothandaraman: Yes, we have not been secretive about it. IQ9 will likely use GAN devices.
Joseph Osha: Okay. All right. So, you have said that. Fair enough. And then the second question just to stand Brian's question on its head earlier. You've done a great job of protecting margins even in this kind of input cost environment.  Going forward, given what you've said about long-term margin targets, is it going to be the strategy more to recoup that margin or maybe take lower input costs when they do arrive and use that to lower prices and take more share. Just curious how you think about that philosophically.
Eric Branderiz: I mean, we definitely always think about innovation and differentiation. So, the numbers that we normally profile as part of the guidance and the framework that we use as a baseline are predicated towards not compromising growth. So that's the way we think about.  And as we continue innovating, improving our quality in delivering products that are superior, potentially even bring groundbreaking like IQ8 right. We seem to believe that those are not necessarily a compromise at least in the mean short-term. As you think in the long term, new product introductions, more acquisitions, more activity.  The Company that you are looking today is a very different Company than the Company that I joined almost 4 years ago. And will continue to transform itself into the energy Company that the market deserves. And we will continue delighting customers, continue discipline our model pricing strategies, cost reduction.  Again, using the best innovation available in negotiating with our vendors on a fair pricing based on volume discounts. Providing the homeowner full visibility over the experiences, so therefore, they understand what they're gaining. So, I think that that's what it made us, what it is today.
Joseph Osha: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Eric Stine with Craig-Hallum. Your line is open.
Eric Stine: Hi everyone, just wanted to quickly touch on the capacity. I know that you're on track to get 5 million microinverters per quarter by the end of but as we think a little bit longer term, it gets out beyond some of the supply chain issues. I don't know if you're willing to discuss, when you think you might need to take that number higher again?
Badri Kothandaraman: Well, I mean Q3, we shipped 2.6 million microinverters and we already gave you a plan on 5 million microinverters capacity. That of course is a supply capacity, it's a manufacturing capacity of our contract manufacturers. However, the components need to come into those plans. And that's the enormously stressed supply chain.  So, we don't know when that will get alleviated. But once that gets alleviated, we should not be having any capacity issues or any supply issues until the capacity that we indicated. And beyond that, all of these, if I look at our Guad factory for example. If we want more capacity, we need to put more auto lines there.  If we look at our Chennai factory in India, same deal. If we look at our China factory, same deal. And that is only manufacturing capacity. But on the other hand, we deal with many hundreds of suppliers. Each of them will need to up their game.  And we will need to qualify multiple suppliers. For example, for the -- for a PCB today, printed circuit board, today we have a couple of suppliers, we may need to take that up to 4 suppliers. if we're going to service extraordinarily higher demand beyond 5 million. So, there is some structural changes we'll do, but it's something that we are used to doing.  It requires to -- a couple of quarters of notice in order to put an auto line, we can have it. It requires a couple of qualifications to be done with adding two express suppliers, like what we did on the AC , we can have it. Take a few quarters, but we're not afraid of -- the number 5 or 10 doesn't daunt us.
Eric Stine: Okay. Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. And that's all the time we have for questions. I would like to turn it back to A - Badri Kothandaraman for any closing remarks.
Badri Kothandaraman: Thank you for joining us today and for your continued support of Enphase. We look forward to speaking with you again during our Investor Day on November 16th. Thank you.
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

===== 2021 Q2  (2021-07-28 04:30:00) =====
Operator: Good day and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Enphase Energy Second Quarter 2021 Financial Results Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions].  I would now like to hand the conference over to our speaker today, Adam Hinkley. Please go ahead.
Adam Hinckley: Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us on today's conference call to discuss Enphase Energy's second quarter 2021 results.  On today's call are Badri Kothandaraman, Enphase's President and Chief Executive Officer; Eric Branderiz, Chief Financial Officer; and Raghu Belur, Chief Products Officer.  After the market closed today, Enphase issued a press release announcing the results for its second quarter ended June 30, 2021.  During this conference call, Enphase management will make forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, statements related to Enphase Energy's expected future financial performance; the capability of our technology and products, including availability and features; our operations, including in manufacturing and customer service; the anticipated growth in our sales and in the markets in which we operate and target; and the capabilities of our installation partners. These forward-looking statements involve significant risks and uncertainties, and Enphase Energy's actual results and the timing of events could differ materially from these expectations. For a more complete discussion of these risks and uncertainties, please see the company's annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020, which is on file with the SEC, and quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2021, which will be filed during the third quarter of 2021. Enphase Energy cautions you not to place any undue reliance on forward-looking statements and undertakes no duty or obligation to update any forward-looking statement as a result of new information, future events or changes in its expectations.  Also, please note that financial measures used on this call are expressed on a non-GAAP basis unless otherwise noted and have been adjusted to exclude certain charges. The company has provided a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures in its earnings release posted today, which can also be found in the Investor Relations section of its Web site. Now, I'd like to introduce Badri Kothandaraman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Enphase Energy. Badri?
Badri Kothandaraman: Good afternoon, and thanks for joining us today to discuss our second quarter 2021 financial results. We had a good quarter. We reported revenue of $316.1 million, shipped approximately 2.36 million micro inverters, and 43 megawatt hours of Enphase Storage systems, achieved non-GAAP gross margin of 40.8%, and generated strong free cash flow of $49.2 million.  We exited the second quarter at approximately 41/16/24. That means 41% gross margin, 16% operating expenses and 24% operating income all as a percentage of revenue on a non-GAAP basis. As a reminder, our baseline financial model is 35/15/20. Eric will go into details about our finances later in the call.  Let's now discuss how we are servicing customers. Our Q2 Net Promoter Score worldwide was 67% compared to 63% in Q1, and our North American Net Promoter Score was 71% compared to 69% in Q1. Our average call wait time decreased to approximately 3 minutes in Q2 from more than 5 minutes in Q1. Our 24/7 global customer support helped to reduce the wait times.  In addition, we are building field service teams in the US and Europe to provide onsite help to our installers. We also expect to add a team in Australia during Q4. We remain laser focused on customer service and making sure that we are the easiest company to do business with.  Let's now talk about manufacturing. As we have discussed in the past earnings calls, the demand for our microinverter systems continues to be well ahead of supply. In Q2, we experienced component constraints on the supply of AC FET drivers, which resulted in our microinverter shipment volumes slightly lower as compared to Q1. We had three AC FET driver suppliers qualified by the end of the second quarter compared to two in the first quarter.  For the third quarter, we continue to remain constrained on microinverters. But the supply situation is better than what it was in the second quarter. We expect to have four suppliers qualified by the end of the third quarter.  Regarding the fourth quarter, we are cautiously optimistic that the situation will be significantly better compared to the third quarter. On the ASIC used in our microinverters, we have sufficient supply. So that has not been a big constraint so far. As previously discussed, we are expanding our microinverter manufacturing capacity in Mexico and India. At our facility in India, we installed a second fully automated line in Q2 with production beginning at the end of the quarter. This brings our quarterly capacity to 1.5 million microinverters from India. In Mexico, we expect to add a fully automated manufacturing line in Q4. This will bring quarterly capacity to approximately 2.2 million microinverters in Mexico. With our existing capacity in China, we expect to easily achieve our target capacity of 5 million microinverters per quarter by the end of 2021.  Let's talk about batteries. We have two sources for battery cell packs, with a total capacity of 120 megawatt hours per pod. I previously mentioned we are going to add a third source in 2022 to increase our overall capacity.  Talking about our lead times. Our lead times for storage systems are a little high today, between 12 and 14 weeks, and we are working on streamlining our engineering and manufacturing to bring them down below 10 weeks by the end of 2021.  Let's move on to the regions. Our US and international revenue mix for Q2 was 81% and 19% respectively. The US market demand was very strong in Q2, but we were supply constraint. Therefore, revenue was only up 3% sequentially. Our teams worked hard to ensure customers had continuous supply of products.  The sell through from our distribution partners to installers remained very strong, keeping channel inventory tight, but at manageable levels. Our teams ensured that all customers add product that they needed to complete jobs and were not forced to seek alternatives, although the constrained supply prevented customers from building buffer inventory. In Europe, we reported record revenue in Q2. The revenue increased 16% sequential. The channel inventory was much tighter in Europe than the US, but we expect it to improve in Q3 and Q4. We had solid growth in Netherlands, France and Germany and continued strong microinverter sales to Maxion for its ACM product during the second quarter.  We also began selling our Enphase Storage systems in Germany during late Q2, representing the product's first international expansion outside US. We launched our solar plus storage system estimator sizing tool in Germany that showcases panel placement on the roof along with storage sizing and a comprehensive financial analysis. Germany represents the largest residential storage market in Europe with high attach rates.  The market response to the introduction of the Enphase Storage system in Germany has been positive. And we expect this to also drive the microinverter business in the country. Overall, I'm very pleased with our growth in Europe.  In the Asia Pacific region, revenue declined 3% sequentially in Q2, primarily due to COVID disruptions in Australia, along with normal seasonality. Despite these headwinds, we are quite happy with microinverter sales during the second quarter from the continued adoption of our highest power IQ7A product and our AC module partnerships. We expect to pilot Enphase Storage systems in Australia in the fourth quarter.  In Latin America, Q2 revenue was up 38% sequentially, largely due to increased sales of both Enphase solar and storage systems in Puerto Rico. As I discussed last quarter, we are expanding into Brazil. We have hired a team there to enter the Brazilian market, and we expect first revenue from this region in Q3.  Now that we have covered the regions, let's discuss the overall bookings for Q3. Our overall customer demand for Q3 once again significantly exceeds the higher end of our guidance range. We continue to remain supply constrained in Q3. Our component availability is improving in Q3 compared to Q2, but not at the rate of growth in demand.  Let's now move to our storage systems rollout. We shipped 43 megawatt hours of Enphase Storage systems in the second quarter. During the quarter, we released load control, a new feature that provides Enphase Storage systems with the capability to automatically shed non-essential loads during an outage. With load control, homeowners have the option to conserve their energy consumption and extend their backup duration simply via a one-time setting of the Enlighten app.  Let's now turn to training for our Enphase Storage systems. By the end of Q2, we trained 2,592 installers cumulatively, representing more than 1,500 unique installation companies. This represents a significant jump compared to Q1 as we were able to resume some in-person training in Q2. We also continued to make steady progress on the commissioning of our Enphase Storage systems and made numerous updates to our software app. Our goal remains a sub 60 minute commissioning time, which will allow installers visit the site, install and commission an Enphase Storage system in less than a few hours. I'm very pleased with the progress we have made on that front. The introduction of load control in late May, along with some pricing adjustments we did for our installers, plus the improvements in the commissioning process, has resulted in an acceleration of demand for Enphase Storage since June. As a result, we expect to ship between 60 and 70 megawatt hours of Enphase Storage systems in the third quarter.  We are already fully booked for Q3 on storage. And our current lead times, as I said before, are 12 to 14 weeks. We are working hard to bring the lead times down to under 10 weeks.  Let's talk about our new product, specifically the IQ8 microinverter and the IQ8D microinverter product launches. IQ8 is the world's first grid-independent microinverter for residential solar. And IQ8 is a high power 640 watt AC microinverter, capable of supporting two panels for small commercial solar. We are making good progress on the compliance reliability and system testing of these products. We expect first shipment of the IQ8 PV microinverters in Q3 and first shipment of the IQ8D product in Q4. Given our component supply challenges, we are going to ramp these products quite cautiously.  On the last earnings call, we discussed the generator compatibility feature for our Enphase Storage systems last quarter. We are a little bit behind here as we took more time to complete the system testing. We are currently piloting generator compatibility with a handful of real homes and are seeing great results. We expect to introduce this feature in production by the end of the third quarter. Homeowners will then have the ability to add generators to their Enphase Storage systems and will be able to configure the generator behavior from the Enphase app. The Enphase Home Energy Management System provides a seamless transition from on grid to off-grid, ensuring a superior installer and homeowner experience. This generator functionality, as I said, will be integrated into our mobile app, so the homeowners have full visibility and control from one app.  Let's now turn to digital transformation. Both our recent acquisitions, Sofdesk and the solar business of DIN Engineering, are fully integrated and exceeded our expectations with record revenue and installer counts in Q2. The 850 plus installers using the Solargraf software tool will soon have access to new features, such as shading and storage system sizing.  Our permitting services are also undergoing significant improvements towards automation to drive mass adoption amongst the long tail of installers. Our digital transformation initiatives, focused on reducing soft costs while improving profitability and efficiency for our installers, resulting in clean and affordable energy for all.  Let me now give you an update on our Enphase Installer Network, or EIN. We have now on boarded 500 installers in North America, 146 installers in Australia and 169 installers in Europe to our Enphase Installer Network through a highly selective process focused on quality and homeowner experience.  We also introduced EIN networks in India and Mexico during the second quarter. This has been a highly successful initiative as we are adding trusted installers who will act as product evangelists on our behalf and are expected to provide an exceptional experience to homeowners.  Let's talk about our entry into grid services for the first time. We have started participating in the ConnectedSolutions program, which are an incentive program implemented by two utilities in the Northeast region of the United States to reduce electrical demand during the high use periods. Enphase Storage customers in Connecticut, Massachusetts and Rhode Island can sign up, monitor, track money earned and control participation in the program using our Enlighten mobile app.  These grid services programs enable utilities to leverage Enphase Storage systems instead of turning on polluting peaker plants, while generating an income stream for the battery owner. Enphase customers participating in the ConnectedSolutions program can receive up to $1,500 a year for our 10 kilowatt hour battery once they share the battery when called upon by the utility.  Facilitating grid services participation for our customers will reduce the lifetime cost of Enphase storage systems and help drive increased demand. We plan to participate in more such programs in the future.  Enphase is laser focused on building best-in-class home energy management systems and delivering them to homeowners through our digital platform along with our Enphase Installer Network and distribution partners. We now have solar storage, node control, grid services and generator compatibility as part of our home energy management system. We plan on adding other distributed energy resources down the line.  Our digital platform captures both installer and homeowner journeys, providing tools and services such as design, proposal and permitting with the goal of reducing soft costs and accelerating the adoption of clean energy.  In summary, we're very happy with the performance in the first half of 2021 and the ongoing strong demand for our solar and storage products. We look forward to the ramping up of our storage systems, introducing new products, accelerating digital transformation and enhancing customer experience.  We plan to host an Analyst Day in the fourth quarter and will provide more details on our next quarter's earnings call.  With that, I will hand the call over to Eric for his review of our finances. Eric?
Eric Branderiz : Thanks, Badri. And good afternoon, everyone. I will provide more details related to our second quarter of 2021 financial results as well as our business outlook for the third quarter of 2021. We have provided a reconciliation of these non-GAAP to GAAP financial measures in our earnings release posted today, which can also be found in the Investor Relations section of our website. Total revenue for Q2 was $316.1 million, representing an increase of 5% sequentially. We shipped approximately 796 megawatts DC of microinverters and 43 megawatt hours of Enphase Storage systems in the quarter. Microinverter unit shipments declined slightly relative to Q1, but favorable product mix led to the sequential revenue growth. Non-GAAP gross margins for Q2 was 40.8% compared to 41.1% for Q1. The decrease was primarily as a result of higher logistics and expedite costs, partially offset by disciplined pricing and favorable mix. GAAP gross margin was 40.4% for Q2. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $51.7 million for Q2 compared to $43.7 million for Q1. The sequential increase was primarily due to increased investment in R&D and sales and marketing programs and increased hiring. In addition, Q2 was the first full quarter of consolidation of the recent acquisitions of Sofdesk and DIN.  GAAP operating expenses were $68.4 million for Q2 compared to $61.6 million for Q1. GAAP operating expenses for Q2 included $14.3 million of stock-based compensation expenses and $2.5 million of acquisition-related expenses and amortization for acquiring tangible assets.  On a non-GAAP basis, income from operation was $77.2 million for Q2 compared to $80.2 million for Q1. On a GAAP basis, income from operations was $59.4 million for Q2 compared to $61.4 million for Q1.  On a non-GAAP basis, net income for Q2 was $74.7 million compared to $78.7 million for Q1. This resulted in diluted earnings per share of $0.53 for Q2 compared to $0.56 per share for Q1. GAAP net income for Q2 was $39.4 million compared to GAAP net income of $31.7 million for Q1. GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.28 for Q2 compared to diluted earnings per share of $0.22 for Q1.  Now turning to the balance sheet and the working capital front. Inventory was $37.9 million at the end of Q2 compared to $34.9 million at the end of Q1. The sequential increase was driven by higher battery cell pack inventory to support the expected growth of Enphase Energy Storage system shipments.  Days of inventory outstanding was unchanged compared to Q1 and it stood at 18 days, reflecting the current supply constrained environment as well as longer lead times.  Accounts receivable were $281.2 million at the end of Q2 compared to $236.1 million at the end of Q1. The sequential increase was due to the higher revenue in Q2 and shipments being weighted to the second half of the quarter.  DSO of 55 days increased from 56 days in the prior quarter due to the timing of shipments.  We exited Q2 with a total cash balance of approximately $1.3 billion compared to approximately $1.5 billion for Q1. We fully utilized our $200 million share repurchase authorization and bought approximately 1.7 million shares at an average share price of approximately $117 in Q2. In addition, our Board of Directors authorized a new share repurchase program of up to $500 million over the next three years.  In Q2, we generated $65.6 million in cash flow from operations and $49.2 million in free cash flow. Capital expenditure was $16.4 million for Q2 to expand microinverter manufacturing capacity in Mexico and India, as well for costs related to Enlighten software app development, corporate website development and investing in IT and cloud infrastructure.  Now let's discuss our outlook for the third quarter of 2021. We expect our revenues for the quarter to be within a range of $335 million to $355 million, which includes shipments of 60 to 70 megawatt hours of Enphase Storage systems.  We expect GAAP gross margin to be within a range of 37% to 40% and non-GAAP gross margin to be within a range of 38% to 41%, which exclude stock-based compensation expenses. We expect our GAAP operating expenses to be within a range of $105 million to $109 million, including a total of approximately $46.4 million estimated for stock-based compensation expenses and $1.6 million estimated for acquisition-related expenses and amorphization. We expect non-GAAP operating expenses to be within a range of $57 million to 60 million  Let me provide some additional color on a few topics. As Badri mentioned earlier, we will be constrained by component availability in Q3. Our revenue guidance assumes a modest increase in microinverter shipments, but the primary driver of growth will come from increased storage systems.  We expect to ship 60 to 70 megawatt hours of our Enphase Storage systems in Q3, representing approximately 50% sequential growth at the midpoint. We expect improved component availability for microinverter production in Q4 and continued momentum for Enphase Storage systems.  On the cost side, we are continuing to expedite components and finished goods in Q3 to ensure customers have an adequate supply of our product. To put in the magnitude of expedite cost into perspective, the expense in Q2 was larger than for all of 2020. We expect the quarterly expedite expenses to remain at similar levels for the remainder of 2021.  Due to the elevated logistics costs and increase in some component costs, we implemented a modest price increase for microinverters starting in Q3.  Next, I would like to touch upon our OpEx guidance. Our guidance for non-GAAP operating expenses as a percentage of revenue is expected to increase in Q3. As we mentioned in the last earnings call, our OpEx may be slightly above our 15% target at times, but we will still expect to be comfortably above our baseline financial model target of 20% operating income.  As we accelerate towards our vision of providing best-in-class home energy management systems, we are investing significantly in R&D, particularly in areas that further our competitive advantage such as ASIC and software. Semiconductor integration and cloud software are core differentiation that increase our system performance, reduce costs and increase reliability. We are also ramping up our marketing expense in the back half of the year to increase homeowner awareness of our solution.  For Q3, accruals for post combination expenses from prior acquisitions are expected to be approximately $3.4 million.  Finally, I will touch on the increase of the stock-based compensation expensing in Q3. The sequential increase is due to the higher number of employees globally as we continue to accelerate our growth plans, as well as the need to retain top level employees as an S&P 500 company.  With that, I will now open the lines for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Mark Strouse with J.P. Morgan.
Mark Strouse: Badri, appreciate your comments about supply looking significantly better in 4Q, but I understand things are fluid, obviously. But can you just talk about your expectations today? Assuming that that fourth supplier ramp goes to plan, at what point do you feel that you'll be able to fully meet demand?
Badri Kothandaraman: Actually, let me give you some color. The microinverter has got 300 components. A critical component is what is called as an AC FET driver. This is made by a few semiconductor suppliers. And in the first quarter of this year, we had two such suppliers qualified. The market on the semiconductor supply chain today is a mess. And so, we worked hard, we qualified a third supplier in the second quarter. We were living hand to mouth in the second quarter, and you saw the results. The situation is getting better day by day. So, in the third quarter, I expect to do more number of microinverters. I expect to qualify one more supplier. Still, the semiconductor supply chain is stretched, though, which is why I cannot meet all my demand.  In the fourth quarter, I see better visibility right now. But, look, I predicted that in the first quarter we are going to be out of the woods soon, that was not the case. So, I remain cautiously optimistic that the situation is going to get better. And we can meet most of our demand.  Maybe difficult to meet all of our demand right now because with IQ8 ramp, I can never say what's going to happen. We are rapidly getting ready. It's too early for me to talk about the fourth quarter, but I am getting ready in terms of manufacturing capacity. I want to exit the fourth quarter at at least 5 million units of manufacturing capacity, not demand. And we'll continue to work on the suppliers on qualifying additional – I may qualify one more supplier if I need to. But at this point, visibility is better than what I told you the last time. However, I still remain cautiously optimistic about Q4. 
Mark Strouse: I just wanted to ask a follow-up about storage. It's been a bit over a year since you introduced your storage solution. Can you just kind of walk us through the past year? What have you been surprised by as far as feedback or applications that you would have thought would have had more interest? What have you been surprised at as far as homeowner demands that you were not prepared for? And then, can you touch on pricing? Just the pricing that you implemented at this time last year, does that now hold? Do you see any reasons to increase that or necessarily decrease that?
Badri Kothandaraman: If I tell you a story there, we introduced our Enphase Storage systems in July of 2020. We had a very clear idea on our value proposition and that has largely not changed. It has only gotten better. Our value proposition is all-in-one solar plus storage solution. We do not deal with high voltages even for DC batteries. We only deal with low voltage DC. Our battery solution, 3.3 kilowatt hour, is a modular solution, creating a lot of flexibility for our installers. Our chemistry is a lithium iron phosphate chemistry that is excellent in fire safety.  In addition, we focused on power. When you start air conditioners, you don't need a soft starter. But with our feature called power start, we are able to provide extra power for that surge when the air conditioners turn on. Those value propositions have largely remained intact.  Then you asked about market feedback, our customers gave us a lot of feedback. Our initial commissioning times were not that good. The commissioning times were of the order of several hours. And customers did not like that. Installers did not like that. They gave us a lot of feedback. We took all of that feedback into perspective. And we improved our commissioning process a lot. We have learned a lot in the last year. Homeowners also gave us valuable feedback in terms of microgrid failures. Like, for example, how do we provide the right notification to the homeowner so that they know that, okay, now I am in off-grid mode, in an outage more and I need to take extra steps to conserve my battery life.  So, we learned a lot from homeowners. We updated our software multiple, multiple times during the last year. And you know, recently in May, we introduced load control. Load control was extremely important because, for the people who have, let's say, a lot of air conditioners, they don't want to screw around with doing a partial home backup. You can do a whole home backup and you can leave out the air conditioners by default, you can shed the loads automatically. So, we provide now – as of late May, we introduced full circuit load control. So, heavy loads can be automatically shed through a one-time app setting.  Now you've heard me talking about generator compatibility. Pretty soon, by the end of the end of the quarter, we will be introducing – again through software, our home energy management system will incorporate generators to plug into them, giving homeowners unprecedented visibility and control from one app. Additional things, we did. We introduced 24/7 customer support. We now have a field service team which will help the installers – which the installers find it invaluable. We have round tables, weekly round tables. I personally meet with 10 to 15 installers every week, get their feedback and make continuous corrections to the product.  Now, let's talk about pricing. The introduction in the last one year was by design. I wouldn't have changed much. We learned a lot. Our costs initially were high, as typical in a ramp. Our pricing was, therefore, a little bit high. And now, I have learned a lot from the field. We have improved the commissioning process and we introduced load control. So, we felt it was the time to make the right pricing adjustment while being very disciplined and doing value-based pricing. So, we did exactly that in late May, along with load control, along with the latest commissioning improvements. We even introduced 15-year warranty plan. We felt it at the right time to make a pricing adjustment, which we did. And we have seen, since June, enormous acceleration in storage demand, which is why we are guiding 50% from Q2 shipments. Q3 guidance, midpoint of guidance will be up 50% from Q2 shipments. Now, we've got to do one thing. We need to improve our lead times on batteries. When I mean 12 to 14 weeks, if somebody orders the battery today from me, they can only get the battery in 12 to 14 weeks, which is not acceptable. I need to go work on streamlining both engineering, manufacturing cycle time in order to push that down to under 10 weeks, ideally 8 weeks. So, that's something that I have to do. And I do need to get a third supplier because I see that – I see us doing well. And I've become more optimistic on batteries. We do need a third supplier. So, that's what we're going to do.
Operator: Our next question comes from Aric Li with Bank of America.
Aric Li: Just as a follow-up to the prior around the AC FET driver constraints, can you talk about the timeline for the newly qualified suppliers to ramp on their supply contributions? And as well as – in the discussions with those new suppliers, is higher firm ASP a key part of that to get supply prioritization? We heard that in some of our channel tracks in the semi industry. So curious to hear as well.
Badri Kothandaraman: Well, in general, the component costs, our suppliers have increased prices to us because of the constrained supply chain. That's a given in general. And our guidance, our results, everything incorporates that. To answer your question on the fourth supplier, we expect the fourth supplier to turn on in the third quarter. We expect to at least get a couple of hundred thousand microinverters using that supplier.
Aric Li: Just as a follow-up question. On storage, you mentioned that the 60 to 70-megawatt hours in 3Q is already fully booked. Can you just talk about what's needed to ramp to get closer to that 120-megawatt hours? It seems like demand is not an issue if you're fully booked, and we're only halfway through or plus halfway through the third quarter at this time. If you could just talk through the bottlenecks there on getting closer to that 120. 
Badri Kothandaraman: Today, that 12 to 14 weeks is kind of excess – it's kind of made worse by a couple of things. One is our internal manufacturing time is a little long. And the logistics situation in this environment is quite stressed as well. So, in order to improve those and get the 12 to 14 weeks down to under 10 weeks, I'm going to work on engineering issues which are basically test time and manufacturing related. Those are well under my control and we'll be able to get that fixed within a quarter.  In terms of logistics, we'll see. The problem exists for the industry, and it's not practical for me to ship batteries – air ship batteries. That's not going to happen because the cost of air shipping batteries will not make sense, no matter whatever way you cut it. I can air ship a microinverter by paying a little bit of money, but that is not true for batteries. It's too much of money and it won't be economically sensible.  So, what I think is – the optimistic guy in me says within 8 to 10 weeks, I should have all of this problem resolved, I should be able to get back to my capacity of 120 megawatt hours per quarter. And from then onwards, look for a third supplier to increase that capacity.
Operator: Our next question comes from Brian Lee with Goldman Sachs.
Brian Lee: I wanted to start off with a few on pricing, if I could. Maybe on the micro side, if we assume battery revenue was fairly flattish in the quarter, it implies ASPs for microinverters was up close to 10% in 2Q versus the first quarter. Is that about the right ballpark?  And then, I know you mentioned mix a number of times. What exactly in the mix? Can you elaborate a bit as to what helped pricing in the quarter since IQ8, I think, as you mentioned, hasn't shipped? It's shipping in Q3. And you announced a price increase on micros, but that doesn't go into effect until Q3. So, just kind of wondering what drove the better pricing mix in the quarter.  And then related to that, since ASPs are up again in Q3, given the price increase, just wondering, is it a similar range? Is it low-single digits, mid-single digits? How should we be thinking about the price trend on microinverters versus Q2?
Badri Kothandaraman: You got it right. So, basically, the pricing on accessories – or the volumes on accessories is a little bit higher. And because of that, the pricing for microinverter appear size – high to you. When you take the same revenue, you divide by the number of microinverters, it appears high to you because we shipped a lot more accessories. That's number one. Number two is you asked about the price increase, it was low single digits.
Brian Lee: Just similarly, on pricing, you mentioned adjustment a number of times on the battery side. That went into effect in May. Can you give us some quantification? Is that a double-digit pricing adjustment? Is it something more modest than that? Just trying to sort of square up the pricing strategy in batteries as well.
Badri Kothandaraman: I'm not going to talk about the exact number, but I would tell you this, it is a meaningful price adjustment there.
Brian Lee: Last one here and I'll pass it on. Badri, you mentioned lead times 12 to 14 weeks, obviously, not ideal on energy storage. You want to get down to 8 to 10 weeks. But if you do have lead times of 12 to 14 weeks today, it would imply you've already got some visibility into probably the first month, maybe first month-and-a-half of Q4 deliveries, just given the bookings cycle here. So, wondering what you're seeing in the backlog relative to same period heading into Q2? Should we be expecting sort of a similar acceleration in demand from 3Q to 4Q? Just wondering what the sort of trends you're expecting on Q4 energy storage given the bookings run rates you're seeing now.
Badri Kothandaraman: It's too early to talk about Q4, but I'm very happy at the fill rate. I'm very happy at the trends. The customers have – they're ordering a lot of product on storage. So, that's all I can say right now because it's going to be too early to talk about Q4.
Eric Branderiz: I just want to make one clarification [indiscernible]. The question from Aric implies that by solving the lead times on storage will immediately unleash the fulfillment of the capacity at 120 megawatt hours. We also have commissioning and activation that we are watching very, very closely. So, I wouldn't assume necessarily by the compression of the 12 to 14 weeks into something like 10 or 8 that Badri is targeting, it will automatically unleash that fulfillment of the capacity. So, that's a clarification. So, the ramp is not as steep as you may think.
Operator: Our next question comes from Colin Rusch with Oppenheimer.
Colin Rusch: Given that you're supply constrained and you're looking at entering into some new markets, including the commercial market in a more robust way, how are you allocating products to really set yourself up with a strong foundation for growth through the balance of this year and into next year?
Badri Kothandaraman: Which is exactly why we are going to be quite cautious. That's why I haven't ramped the product in Q3. It will be a very cautious ramp, which is piloting to a few installers in our Enphase Installer Network. We'll be doing that first. We'll look at that experience. We may make some course corrections, and then we'll do a steady ramp because we understand component shortages are there. Q4 is going to look a lot better, like what I said, but we'll start piloting in Q3.  And on the small commercial product, we'll start piloting that in Q4. So, that will be even better than the IQ8 microinverter.
Colin Rusch: In terms of the installation process for the batteries, can you give us a sense of how many of your customers, what percentage of your customers are fully trained? And how much of the staff are fully trained on the new expedited process for installing those systems?
Badri Kothandaraman: As I mentioned, we have about 2,500 installer personnel fully trained. And of that, we have about 1,500 installation companies. They basically are trained. And in addition to training, usually, when we call them as certified is when they finish the first installation, where we basically handhold them for the first installation, which is where we go through the complex or we go through the – complex today, but will be simple tomorrow, simple process of commissioning. And that number, the number of certified installers is usually half of the number of trained installation companies. So, that will give you an idea that – we're talking about a significant number of longtail installers that we have trained in the last four quarters. And that's the name of the game. Once we make it so easy to commission, so easy for them to install, we believe the ramp will come automatically.
Operator: Our next question comes from Philip Shen with ROTH Capital Partners.
Philip Shen: Badri, I think you just mentioned that the pricing for the battery is lower, or you've made some meaningful price adjustments there. I was wondering if you could comment on the margins for storage. Are they in line with corporate average? Are they perhaps a little bit below? And what the margin outlook in general might be for storage?
Badri Kothandaraman: Like what I said, when we introduced the product in July, at that time of introduction, as typical with a new product, the product costs will be slightly higher. And so, at that time, we started off with a slightly higher pricing. And then, as typical in a new product, it takes some time for the new product to be streamlined. So, we had commissioning issues. And now, we have learned in the last year, we have reduced. We have streamlined commissioning. I think it's pretty decent right now. I still want it to be a lot better. So, now we are ready, meaning we felt we were ready. Therefore, we made the adjustment to the pricing. And that doesn't mean we compromise any of our guiding principles. We will always price on value. We will never enter a business until we are sure that it can support the corporate gross margin of 35%. So, all of those are still intact.
Philip Shen: As it relates to the mix of micros, can you comment on, in Q2, what the mix was between IQ7 versus 7+ and then what do you expect that trend to be in Q3 and Q4? Because my sense is the IQ 7+ has a better price profile. And then, perhaps if you can also comment on the margin outlook or profile for each of those items as well. Thanks.
Badri Kothandaraman: Well, just for the people on the call, IQ7+ is a higher power microinverter compared to IQ7. IQ7+ has got a 290 watt AC output, while IQ7 has got a 250 watt AC output. And because of that, IQ7+ is usually used for higher-end modules. Higher-end modules may be around 340, 350 watts. You start using IQ7+, so you don't compromise on what is called as the DC/AC ratio.  Historically, we haven't broken out the mix between 7 and 7+. We're not going to do it even now. But we are definitely seeing a trend toward the higher power, and that's not a surprising trend in the industry. That's what the industry does. So, the power of the DC module keeps going up. Therefore, the microinverters have to go up. So IQ7+ is here to stay, is here to ramp.  And in terms of the pricing, the way we do pricing is in terms of dollar per watt. And so, if you provide increased wattage, meaning if I provide increased wattage, the price of that microinverter is automatically higher. In addition, other things are also contributing to pricing in addition to just wattage. It's quality, et cetera. Customer experience matters, too. They're all variables in pricing. But IQ7+ is definitely more.  But coming to the reverse side of the equation is IQ7+ requires us to make some small tweaks compared to the IQ7 microinverter in terms of hardware. So, the transformer may be a little bit different, some of the input transistors may be a little different. So, the cost is not the same of the microinverter. However, again, like what I said, we price products on value and make sure our corporate gross margin is always met. And we, obviously, like higher power products because they give us a little bit extra margin compared to lower power, as you can imagine. 
Philip Shen: When do you think you might be able to hit – are you majority 7+ in Q2? Or were you? Or if not, do you expect to be majority of 7+ in Q4? It seems like a lot of the channel is already converting – has converted already to 7+. It's really the safe harbor inventory, that 7.
Badri Kothandaraman: I don't have numbers for you, but it will be up and to the right every quarter. That's all I can say.
Operator: Our next question comes from James West with Evercore ISI.
James West: Badri, I know you're rolling out storage or you're intending to roll out storage in Europe. You went into Germany this quarter. In Australia, I believe in the second half. Does the fact that you have some constraints, you have some lead time issues that you're working on, does that slow that international rollout or you're continuing on pace?
Badri Kothandaraman: No, it's not going to slow my Australia rollout. Like what I said, we'll do methodically in all markets, right? Like how we had a nice ramp in North America. I would say the ramp in North America lasted for four quarters where we learned from the installers, where we learn from the homeowners, we course corrected, we did a lot of work. Like that, every country is going to be different.  Germany may be a little bit easier for us, may not be four quarters, maybe one to two quarters. Australia could be different because they usually have a little bit more – meaning the power grid in Australia may not be as stable as Germany. So, they will use backup more than Germany. So, that will be a little bit different. And they're all different grid voltages in frequency. So, we learned there for some time. And by that time, all our manufacturing issues will be resolved.
James West: I know you noted a big acceleration in demand in June, and you've gone through a lot of feedback cycles and feedback loops on storage. Was this the culmination of kind of all of that feedback? Or was there some specific component of that that all of a sudden kicked in, maybe the installation time, or something like that, that led to that big jump in June?
Badri Kothandaraman: I would say, the way I said it, right, the introduction of load control, that's helped. Reduced commissioning times that we really achieved in Q2, that helped. The adjustment of pricing, that helped. We also introduced a 15-year warranty for customers, so that if you do storage-only financing, you have to pay less dollars a month. So, we introduced kind of these four. Now, we are introducing grid services for certain regions. So, that will help. And the last one is generator compatibility, although we haven't released it, it's coming. So, that will also help. So, I think all put together, you can see that the ramp has started.
Operator: Our next question comes from J.B. Lowe with Citi.
J.B. Lowe: Question is on capital allocation. You guys still have a lot of cash on the balance sheet. You timed your share repurchase very well earlier this year. And I saw that you also did another $20 million investment on the private side. I'm just wondering what kind of targets you're seeing out there in the marketplace? And how do you juxtapose that against the share repurchase potential that you guys have, now that you have another $500 million authorization?
Eric Branderiz: We have a big appetite for M&A. But we are not willing to pay sometimes the prices as well there, especially over the last few quarters. Now there is a little bit of a more – the market is opening a little bit better. Some of [indiscernible] pulling back, pricing appears to be more palatable in the way we are doing the analysis in terms of IRR, payback and so on on all these acquisitions. As a communication record here, we are very diligent on making sure that all the acquisitions that we do meet a high bar of payback IRR in all of those things that are very important to us. So, when we think about capital allocation, the amount that we have reserved for M&A is pretty important. So, that's something important to us to convey and which we'll be opening over the next few quarters.  In terms of the $500 million over three-year share buyback program that the board approved, I think this phenomenal, right, because it allows us to redeploy that capital into share buybacks as the opportunity comes with the volatility on the stock throughout that period. So, meaning we are not using that one more than strategically positioning the company to rebuy the shares, for example, that we issue as part of the converts. In this case, we have 4 million shares issued. We bought 1.7 million of our shares back at a very reasonably low price. So, that kind of gives you a sense of how we are thinking in terms of the utilization of that approval by the board of $500 million over three years.  And finally, we know how to run the company with very little cash. So my cash – floating cash that I need on the balance sheet to run the company has been about between $300 million, $400 million. So, that tells you that, as we continue generating cash, we're going to replenish that over the years, right? So, that's kind of the program that we have. A lot of M&A in sight, the opportunistic share buyback on the $500 million approved by the board over three years, and quite a bit of internal growth. That's why we commented on the OpEx as well, right? As we see going forward, sometimes we decide to build that capability in-house. That means hiring more people, increasing our OpEx. But we're still committed to be comfortably above the 20% operating income for the company as a whole. So, hopefully, that answer long, but detailed answer give you a sense of how we are managing cash.
J.B. Lowe: Follow-up question is just – as you're kind of – you're being cautious on the IQ8, IQ8D rollout. Kind of a higher-level question, like how should we think about – let's say, going into – by the end of 2022, let's say, what percentage of your sales would you expect IQ8 to be, just given the kind of changing nature of the rollout next year?
Badri Kothandaraman: Look, our experience from IQ6 to 7, that took about four to five quarters. And will IQ8 be different? I think everybody has been waiting for IQ8. And they are going to move to IQ8. IQ8 offers exceptional value. For the first time, you can run on sunshine without the grid. So, I think it should ideally be faster, but let me put on my cautious hat and say we have – we are in the middle of component supply issues. So, we cannot get ahead of ourselves. I would say, at least four quarters. At least four quarters is what I think, could be plus, minus one or two.
Operator: Our next question comes from Kashy Harrison with Piper Sandler.
Kashy Harrison: A few weeks ago, Generac announced they were entering the inverter space via the Chilicon acquisition. You guys invented the microinverter 15-or-so years ago and you know the product better than anyone and the go-to-market strategy better than anyone else. So, just curious how you think about maybe some of the challenges you think new entrants may face in trying to enter the space and compete with you? And maybe even just broadly, how you think about the competitive landscape of the inverter, resi inverter market moving forward?
Raghu Belur: Yes, there have been numerous entrants over the last 15 or so years. The bottom line is that business is very, very hard. And micros is even harder. That's why there were even more microinverter entrants and hardly any left. And it's because you have to achieve a level of reliability, cost and performance that's – and to do that with the micro is extremely difficult. Look, we have eight generations of innovation under our belt. So we have an incredible amount of experience and we have had our arrows in our back actually.  So, the bottom line is that, again, we are relentless when it comes to innovation. And when you think about innovation, for us, it's about innovation around semiconductors and software, our ASIC is kind of the key to what we do with our micro. So we are continuing to innovate in that area. We're also looking at kind of next generation materials. Like, gallium nitride is an example of that. And we are making sure that we continue down that path of adding more value, driving more performance, lower cost, and not compromising reliability in any way. So, this is a hard business, and we are really continuing down that innovation path.
Badri Kothandaraman: To double down on what he said, no matter what the other guys do, our strategy is to innovate. We have the eighth generation today. We will soon have the ninth and tenth. Because of that innovation, we have 300-plus patents right now, and that's a lot of IP. And we'll create more IP to fortify this position. So, we'll do what we have done in the last few years.
Kashy Harrison: Just as my follow-up, Badri, in the prepared remarks, you made some commentary on grid services. And as you mentioned, this is the first time you've talked about it. Can you just give us a sense of the revenue opportunity? How you guys are thinking about the revenue opportunity associated with grid services to Enphase? And then, maybe even just more broadly with software in general because you've done DIN and Sofdesk and now you're talking grid services. So, how do you think about software revenues over time? 
Badri Kothandaraman: We are entering grid services. It's a little bit early to talk about revenue and revenue models. But the name of the game is this. This helps the homeowner. At the end of the day, if I can reduce the payback period for the homeowner, I will, along with our installers. So, if we do that by offsetting, meaning the homeowners can help the utilities for many times during the summer and a few times during the winter, they get paid for it. For example, the ConnectedSolutions program is a lucrative program. With a 10-kilowatt hour Enphase Encharge battery, you can get up to $1,500 a year in Rhode Island. And you can get up to $1,000 a year in Massachusetts, extremely lucrative program. Of course, the dollars, et cetera – since these are still in pilot stage, dollars, et cetera, are questionable, might come down, when they are in full ramp or when thousands such programs are there among the United States, but it is starting. It is starting. It is going to help us sell solar plus storage, and we are solving a real problem for the utility. So, the utilities are going to be participating in with us.  And there are some interesting business models that emerge. A few times, we will work with the aggregators – like in the case of ConnectedSolutions, there are two utilities in the Northeast – National Grid and Eversource. And they have partnered with an aggregator, and we work with that aggregator.  That's not necessarily the case. We could potentially start working with the utilities. We are exploring such partnerships on how that will work, what are the puts and takes. It's still in the infancy stage. So, which is why I don't think it's the right time to talk about revenue. But we are going to understand this market a lot more in the next few quarters. And coming back to the ConnectedSolutions, where do we differentiate? Because our differentiation is we make it so easy for a homeowner to go to his app and he can pick grid services and he can enroll on to grid services program easily with a touch of a button. And once he is enrolled, he can actually monitor how much he's saving. He can basically opt out of the event. Like, for example, if you have an event tomorrow where the utility wants your battery to discharge, you can opt out today. That option is also through the app. You can set your reserve in the battery. Normally, the utility will set it. It will recommend 10% in order to give you the full grid services benefit, but you can adjust that in the app too. So the app makes it seamless. And of course, that's where we come in. We want to make sure we take care of the homeowner and our installers and our partners there. And we want to provide an exceptional experience for the homeowner.
Operator: Our next question comes from Moses Sutton with Barclays.
Moses Sutton: A bit of an out there question. I saw some competition of bidirectional EV charging. How do you see competing with yours and other more holistic energy storage offerings over time? Is it a threat in any way? It's, of course, a limited product in what it can do, but just thinking how you think of that evolving as the storage and backup market itself evolves over time?
Raghu Belur: Our goal, our aim if you look at it from a strategy point of view is to deliver best-in-class home energy management solutions and systems. And we consider all the available resources in the home that starts with solar, stationary storage, load control, generators, fuel, et cetera. And bidirectionally, we will play a key role in providing a great homeowner experience, meaning that in the event of an outage, for example, now you have that – another resource available in order to ensure that your home stays up and you can drive through any outage. We do not consider this to be competitive in any way at all. We consider that to be an integral part of the overall solution that we are offering. And we have a unique role to play in that because we do the power electronics, the communications, the software, the entire brain of that home energy management system is what we offer. I think bringing a bidirectional EV system on to our platform is going to just make the whole solution that much more resilient. And I think that's a good homeowner experience. And like I said, we play a very unique role there.
Moses Sutton: Just one more. I may have actually missed this. Are any logistics constraints further downstream on the AC module supplier side from those module companies holding back reorders of micros and enabling you to shift that supply to direct micro sales to distributors and installers?
Badri Kothandaraman: No, that's not an issue.
Operator: Our next question comes from Maheep Mandloi with Credit Suisse.
Maheep Mandloi: Maybe one thing just on the software and the permitting businesses, which we recently acquired and ramping up pretty well. Could you just talk about like the revenue contribution from those businesses or how should we think about that either in the near term or in the longer term in the US or other markets?
Badri Kothandaraman: I'm not going to break out the revenue, but let me give you some color. We bought solar – we bought Sofdesk. Sofdesk is a software company that makes design and proposal software for installers and licenses to them. The license fee, in general, is well understood by the industry. And you can do some work on it. We also said that we have 850 installers right now utilizing that platform. So, that'll give you a rough idea of the contribution.  Then more important thing we are excited about there is, both these companies, the software company and the permitting services, which I will talk about next, both of them achieved record revenues. This is the highest revenue. And why? Because Enphase today sells our products, microinverters and storage to a lot of longtail installers. Our installer count is – meaning installers we have served, out of the 5,000 longtail installers in the US, we probably interact with at least 1,500 of them. And so, it's a huge opportunity on understanding the overlap between the installers who utilize the Solargraf tool and understanding the overlap on who actually buys the products. So, therefore, there is enormous scope for us to introduce our longtail installers who buy products to Solargraf platform. And that's what we are going to do. We are going to make that platform a lot better, investing a lot more there. We are going to have shading. We are going to have storage and we are going to make that a best-in-class software tool. That's on the Sofdesk. That's the acquisition based in Montreal that we completed early in the year.  The next one is even more interesting. This is the permitting services company that we closed the acquisition in April. That company does permitting services for a significant fraction of the North American business, the North American solar business. And there, again, so far, the permitting services has been restricted to a few big customers simply because it is – today, although we provide a service, it's a 24-hour service. And we think there can be a lot of efficiency that can be taken out by automating that permitting service to make it almost like a self-service. It takes a couple of hours versus 24 hours. So, again, the name of the game there is to take that installer count from a handful today, which is mainly big installers to thousand-plus installers that we have. Once again, that's what we are going to do by automation. And I gave you some color. But the short story is both businesses are exceeding their targets that were promised to us before. They both have good leadership, and we are thinking of interesting ways the two companies can work together. And I think the name of the game is to introduce both services to our installers.
Maheep Mandloi: Maybe just on the – just going back to one of the questions on the competition in the microinverter space. Could you maybe talk about, like, if it would make sense to use IQ8D kind of a product for the residential market? Because that seems to, like, be the MO for a couple of our competitors to offer two-for-one or four-for-one in the residential space. So, do you expect any of those applications for the IQ8D in residential? Or do you think a one-for-one makes more sense from a technical point of view, from a customer point of view?
Badri Kothandaraman: We think one-for-one makes the most sense. That's our bread and butter business. Why? Because quality. Once again, when you put a lot of electronics there, you have two panels that are connected, four panels that are connected. We cannot provide that kind of exceptional quality to the homeowner. It's difficult. However, there are some regions and some businesses like the commercial business that don't have the same stringent requirements. And so, for those businesses, it may be economical to use a two-panel, one microinverter IQ8D product. And we'll be looking at that hard. It's not an easy question for us to answer. We'll be looking at that hard, but we are never going to deviate from our core product being like – like, when we go to IQ9, when we go to IQ10, we want to make that single microinverter a lot better. That is the core for us. We are going to be making that a lot better. But in markets like Australia, for example, where our market share – we want to improve our market share, we may try some experiments. We may. But they will be done methodically without deviating from our core platform.
Operator: Our next question comes from Joe Osha with Guggenheim Partners.
Joseph Osha: Two completely unrelated questions. First is with regards to all of the conversation about grid services. I'm trying to understand how this works vis-a-vis the plan to some of the big developers like Sunrun, for example. Is this a cooperative relationship? Or are you going to begin competing with some of the initiatives that the large developers have on their own?
Raghu Belur: It is cooperative because we are the ones who provide the actual – we are the developers of the equipment, right? So we have a deep understanding of how the whole system within the home interact plus all of the software platform that allows – gives you access into the system itself. So, we feel that the whole relationship is positive.  In general, I want to make a comment about grid services. If you look ahead, it will be a requirement. You need coordination amongst all of the systems that are deployed because as you think about the world evolving into a world of EV, et cetera, and home electrification, this coordination will become more and more important. So, having a system that's extremely intelligent, that's behind the meter, that is coupled to a very intelligent platform that's in the cloud is critical. And that's a big competitive advantage for us because we have built that system. We have architected that system from the bottoms up that allows very clean and effective communication and control from the cloud to all of these DERs that are deployed behind the meter.
Badri Kothandaraman: To add a few things more, we know how markets evolve. So, right now, the solar market, if you see, it is 60% loan, 30% lease, 10% cash. And probably the storage market will go in the same way.  The advantage we have is we work with all customers. We work with partners like Sunrun who have leasing. We work with many number of longtail installers who are basically providing help, working with the fintech partners, they offer loans to the homeowners. So, where we come in is we can provide any kind of solution. For the loan market, what we can do, where the homeowner actually owns the asset – the homeowner owns the battery. When the homeowner owns the battery and he sees significant savings, his decision on buying the battery is easy. And whether it's loan, whether it's lease, we are going to be there. It is our platform. And we are going to make it so easy for the homeowner to save money. And our app gives unprecedented visibility. So, we'll service everybody.
Joseph Osha: Again, totally unrelated question. You've, obviously, been very successful with your decision to embrace LFP chemistry. It seems like other parts of the industry, including even parts of auto, are starting to maybe take a look at toggling to that chemistry. As you look out, does that potentially create any availability challenges for you?
Badri Kothandaraman: It's a tough question on predicting the future. But we love LFP. We like the fire resistant aspect of it. We have quite reputable battery suppliers. And the LFP market is going to become big. Like, what you said, the auto guys now want to come in. For the auto guys, they will go back and forth between LFP and other chemistries because LFP comes with more weight. More weight is okay for ESS, which is the stationary storage. More weight is questionable. Although some of them are moving, more weight is questionable for EVs. And I'm sure innovation is going to happen on that front. But for us, we made the right decision before. I think we are happy that other people are moving to it. We have good partners. We are going to get a few more good partners to increase our capacity, and our strategy is unchanged there.
Operator: Our next question comes from Eric Stine with Craig-Hallum.
Eric Stine: Just sneak one in here at the end. I know that the portable power systems, I guess, called Ensemble in a Box, something that you've been optimistic about, I think you were targeting a 4Q launch on that. Maybe an updated timeline. Is that still the plan? And how do the component shortages play into that?
Badri Kothandaraman: Although I didn't talk about it, we are furiously working on it and we are planning to pilot the portable power station in the fourth quarter to our homeowners and installers, actually.
Eric Branderiz: We're going to have more on Analyst Day. So, in Q4, sorry.
Eric Stine: So, it's still basically on plan?
Badri Kothandaraman: Yeah.
Operator: Your next question comes from Pavel Molchanov with Raymond James.
Pavel Molchanov: Just one question from my end. We're hearing a lot of conversations from Washington about building out solar and other clean tech manufacturing capacity within the United States and your existing footprint, India and Mexico, as you talked about. Any interest in developing some type of supply chain footprint within the US specifically?
Badri Kothandaraman: Well, we're not ruling anything out. If the economics are right, we may do it. The economics need to be right, the incentives need to be right. It's possible.
Eric Branderiz: And if there is anybody capable to put something up and running pretty quickly, it's probably going to be us, right? And we know how to establish contract manufacturing very quickly in partnership with our contract manufacturer. We know how to transfer without compromising our reliability lines from place to place. We've proven that with Mexico, and we know how to do that very quickly. So, in the event the battery decides to go that path and the economics are there, we probably are the best suited to do it.
Operator: I'm not showing any further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the call back over to Mr. Kothandaraman for closing remarks.
Badri Kothandaraman: Thank you for joining us today and for your continued support of Enphase. We look forward to speaking with you again next quarter.
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

===== 2021 Q1  (2021-04-27 16:30:00) =====
Operator: Thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Enphase Energy First Quarter 2021 Financial Results Conference Call [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, today's conference call is being recorded. And now I'd like to hand the conference call over to Adam Hinckley. Please go ahead, sir.
Adam Hinckley: Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us on today's conference call to discuss Enphase Energy's first quarter 2021 results. On today's call are Badri Kothandaraman, Enphase's President and Chief Executive Officer; Eric Branderiz, Chief Financial Officer; and Raghu Belur, Chief Products Officer. After the market closed today, Enphase issued a press release announcing the results for its first quarter ended March 31, 2021. During this conference call, Enphase management will make forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, statements related to Enphase Energy's expected future financial performance; the capability of our technology and products, including availability and features; our operations, including in manufacturing and customer service; the anticipated growth in our sales and in the markets in which we operate and target; and the capabilities of our installation partners. These forward-looking statements involve significant risks and uncertainties, and Enphase Energy's actual results and the timing of events could differ materially from these expectations. For a more complete discussion of the risks and uncertainties, please see the company's annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020, which is on file with the SEC, and quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2021, which will be filed during the second quarter of 2021. Enphase Energy cautions you not to place any undue reliance on forward-looking statements and undertakes no duty or obligation to update any forward-looking statement as a result of new information, future events or changes in its expectations. Also, please note that the financial measures used on this call are expressed on a non-GAAP basis unless otherwise noted and have been adjusted to exclude certain charges. The company has provided a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures in its earnings release posted today, which can also be found in the Investor Relations section of its Web site. Now I'd like to introduce Badri Kothandaraman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Enphase Energy. Badri?
Badri Kothandaraman: Good afternoon, and thanks for joining us today to discuss our first quarter 2021 financial results. We had a good quarter. We reported revenue of $301.8 million, shipped approximately 2.45 million microinverters, achieved non-GAAP gross margin of 41.1% and generated strong free cash flow of $81.5 million. We exited the first quarter at approximately 41, 14, 27. This means 41% gross margin, 14% operating expenses and 27% operating income, all as a percentage of revenue on a non-GAAP basis. As a reminder, our baseline financial model is 35, 15, 20. Eric will go into details about our financials later in the call. Let's discuss how we are servicing customers. Our Q1 Net Promoter Score worldwide was 63% compared to 62% in Q4 and our North America Net Promoter Score was 69% compared to 68% in Q4. Our average call wait time in Q1 was more than 5 minutes as we onboarded new installers and fielded calls related to our storage systems. We are working diligently to bring wait times down under a minute. We also expect our 24/7 global customer support to help reduce wait times. The round the clock support is another step forward towards delivering an outstanding customer experience and will supplement the Enphase Community and training platforms. Let's talk about manufacturing. As we discussed in the last call, the semiconductor supply chain is under stress. In Q1, we experienced constraints on the supply of ASICs and AC FET drivers, which limited shipments. Our contract manufacturing facility in Mexico shipped more than 900,000 microinverters. Our contract manufacturing facility at Salcomp, India shipped nearly 500,000 microinverters. We are very pleased with the production ramp, product quality and manufacturing cost of this fully automated facility in India. Given our strong demand, we are expanding manufacturing capacity in Mexico and India further. In Mexico, we are improving operational efficiency and expect to reach quarterly capacity of 1.5 million microinverters. At our facility in Chennai, India, production is around the clock, bringing quarterly capacity to 700,000 microinverters from one manufacturing line. We have already purchased equipment for the second manufacturing line and expect to begin ramping in Q3. Looking to Q2, our shipment volumes will be constrained by semiconductor component availability. We have qualified new suppliers for our ASIC and AC FET drivers, which will result in increased shipments for Q2 compared to Q1. But the ramp from these new suppliers is slower than what we had anticipated before. We expect these component constraints to remain for the rest of the year. In terms of our Enphase Storage Systems, we shipped 42 megawatt hours in Q1, representing a sequential increase of 30% and in line with our expectations. Let's now move to the regions. The US and international revenue mix for Q1 was 82% and 18%, respectively. The US market was quite strong in Q1 despite typical seasonality. US revenue was up 14% sequentially. We achieved very good microinverter sell through from our distribution partners. I am proud of our operations team for navigating the supply constraints and ensuring customers had continuous supply of product. With higher microinverters shipments in Q1, our channel inventory is better but still tight. With Q2 through Q4 being seasonally robust quarters, we expect the channel tightness for microinverters to continue. In Europe, we reported record Q1 revenue. Revenue increased 17% sequentially. We saw strength in Netherlands and France while building on new markets such as Germany, Poland and Austria. Our AC module strategy is also gaining momentum in Europe. We expect to introduce Enphase Storage Systems for the European market in the second half of 2021, first in Germany and then in Italy, adding yet another growth driver. I'm very pleased with our performance in Europe. In Australia, we had record revenue and record installer count. Q1 revenue was up 58% sequentially. The strong growth of the Enphase Installer Network or EIN and rapid market penetration of our IQ 7A product contributed to our success. In addition, we are focusing both on installer and homeowner experience, launching 24/7 customer support, conducting technical training and collaborating on branding initiatives with installers in Australia. We expect to introduce Enphase Storage Systems to Australia also in the second half of 2021. In Latin America, Q1 revenue was down a little 33% from the prior quarter, which had benefited from large storage orders. Puerto Rico continues to be a solid market in terms of both microinverters and storage. We are also making plans to enter the Brazilian residential solar market, which is expected to be over 1 gigawatt this year. We have already hired [Marco Krapels], an experienced sales leader to accelerate our entry into Brazil. Now that we have covered the region, let's discuss the overall bookings for Q2. Now once again, our customer demand for Q2 significantly exceeds the higher end of our guidance range. We remain supply constrained for Q2, as I said before. The component availability is improving but not at the rate of growth in demand. While it is very early to talk about Q3, our customer bookings are quite higher than what they would normally be at this time of the quarter. We are planning for much higher capacity in Q3 for both microinverters and storage. We're obviously pleased with the overall demand but we are cautious about the supply situation, which is not very predictable today. Let's now move to our storage system rollout. We shipped 42 megawatt hours of storage systems in Q1, representing sequential growth of approximately 30%. Cumulatively, 623 unique installers commissioned at least one Enphase Storage System by the end of Q1. We're also making good progress with the Tier 1 and 2 installers. We previously announced solar plus storage partnerships with Sunnova, Momentum Solar, Solar Optimum and Power. We expect to announce more partnerships soon. Let's now turn to training for our Enphase Storage Systems. By the end of Q1, we trained 1,776 installers cumulatively online, representing 1,035 unique companies. We plan to resume in person training soon, beginning with our mobile van training in Texas. Other states will follow shortly. In addition, we are resuming the build out of training centers at various distributor locations. As you're aware, we are laser focused on customer service and making sure we are the easiest company to do business with. With these principles in mind, we started weekly installer round tables in Q1 to understand how we can improve the Enphase storage product. The findings are clear, improving the commissioning experience for installers and making life easier for homeowners. By leveraging the feedback, we have made a number of updates to our software and commissioning process. Our engineering teams have been working hard to reduce commissioning times on our storage systems from many hours to approximately two hours through software improvements and training initiatives. Our goal is a 60 minute commissioning time, which will allow our installers to visit the site, install and commission an Enphase Storage System in a few hours. We expect to release a couple of new features for our Enphase storage system, as discussed in our last earnings call and these include load control and generator support. Load control is the ability to turn loads on and off. We envision that most homeowners will opt for a full backup of their entire home rather than a partial backup with the capability to shed loads when needed. We have four circuits for load control designed into our Enpower smart switch. Homeowners can choose up four loads they want to control. For example, an air conditioner can be controlled through one circuit and a pool pump can be controlled through another circuit. These loads will be on during the grid tight mode and can be shared instantaneously during the off grid mode simply via the app. In addition, excess solar can also be configured to be shared through one of these four circuits. This enables the homeowners to save money by not oversizing their battery storage systems. The next feature is generator compatibility. Unlike some of the others, there is no need to install a generator ATS when used with Enphase Storage Systems. The generator can plug in to our smart switch called Enpower, which has built in safeguards that ensure generator is only connected to the home when the home is off grid. When the home is disconnected from the utility, Enphase microinverters in the battery seamlessly form a micro grid to ensure there is no disruption. The lights will not flicker. The clocks will not reset. Next, our smart switch starts the standby generator. Once the generator is stable, the system synchronizes the microgrid to the generator's voltage and frequency. Our smart switch then seamlessly connects the home to the generator. The Enphase solution provides increased resilience in the off grid mode by enabling solar, storage and the generators to run together. The generator control will also be integrated into our mobile app so that homeowners have full visibility and control from one app. There are two modes of operation. One is the basic mode, where the generator simply turns on during an outage. And the other is that the generator can be configured to turn on depending on the state of charge of the battery during an outage. For example, when the battery charge goes below 20% in an outage, the generator turns on, charges the battery, supports the home loads. And once the battery reaches 90%, the generator returns off. These are two powerful features and we expect to release them this quarter after beta testing with customers, which is underway. We are seeing a good amount of interest from customers. And these features can be enabled simply by over the air software upgrades for existing storage systems, along with some additional minimal work to be done by the installers. In summary, we are happy with our Q1 storage shipments reaching 42 megawatt hours. And as I said, we expect to introduce a couple of differentiated new features to improve the homeowner experience. We expect to reduce the commissioning times to improve the installer experience, and we expect to make significant go to market changes to improve the brand experience. We expect our storage shipment volumes between 40 and 50 megawatt hours in Q2. Let's talk more on upcoming new products. First, I'd like to cover more details on what else is new for storage. In addition to the new features we talked about, we are partnering with aggregators and utilities to enable grid services. This will enable utilities to leverage home battery storage systems instead of turning on peaker plants. And in doing so, the homeowners can get paid for providing that service. We have formed a 20% grid services team at Enphase now, consisting of software, product management, business development and policy experts. This team has already made tremendous progress on technical and business fronts and we plan to expand the team significantly to engage with more utilities and aggregators. Final point on storage. We are working hard to introduce the Enphase Storage Systems internationally, as I said before. We want to ensure that all learning from North America is captured and that we are fully staffed to support customers. We expect to introduce Enphase Storage Systems first into Europe and then into Australia in the second half of 2021. Let's cover our upcoming IQ 8 and IQ 8D product launches. IQ 8 is the world's first grid agnostic microinverter for residential solar, and IQ 8D is a high power microinverter capable of supporting two panels for small commercial installer. We are making good progress on the compliance, reliability and system testing on these products. However, with the microinverter supply chain constraints due to semiconductor component shortages, we expect a slower ramp beginning in Q3. We also plan to introduce the Enphase portable power station consumer products in Q4, assuming component shortages are under control. Let's now turn to digital transformation. I'm excited about our two completed acquisitions, Sofdesk and the solar business of DIN Engineering. The former Sofdesk team, now known as Enphase Montreal, provide design and proposal software for solar and roofing companies. The team acquired from DIN Engineering, now known as Enphase Noida, provides proposal and permitting services to the installers. By providing these services to installers, we aim to simplify the sales process while reducing [soft’s] costs and providing an enhanced buying experience for homeowners. The obvious opportunity for Enphase is to expand both these offerings to our network of long tail installers. This is an important initiative for us and we will be integrating these two company operations into our digital platform. We have now onboarded 476 installers in North America and 138 installers in Australia to our Enphase Installer Network, EIN, through a highly selective process focused on quality and homeowner experience. We recently launched our EIN in Europe and India. Our EIN installers enjoy a variety of benefits, including branding, promotion and tools and services on the digital platform to help make sales and installation process faster and easier. In summary, we are happy with our performance, and we are pleased with the increased demand for our products. We look forward to introducing our new products, ramping our storage systems, supporting our customers better and accelerating our digital transformation. As always, the health and safety of our employees, the customers and partners remain our top priority as the world continues to be impacted by COVID-19. With that, I will hand the call over to Eric for his review of our finances. Eric?
Eric Branderiz: Thanks, Badri, and good afternoon, everyone. I will provide more details related to our first quarter of 2021 financial results, as well as our business outlook for the second quarter of 2021. We have provided a reconciliation of these non-GAAP to GAAP financial measures in our earnings release posted today, which can also be found in the IR section of our Web site. Total revenue for Q1 was $301.8 million, representing an increase of 14% sequentially. We shipped approximately 830 megawatts DC of microinverter and 42 megawatt hours of storage systems in the first quarter, equivalent to 16.1 megawatts of power. Non-GAAP gross margin for Q1 was 41.1% compared to 40.2% for Q4. The increase was driven by disciplined pricing and cost management. GAAP gross margin was 40.7% for Q1. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $43.7 million for Q1 compared to $34.2 million for Q4. The sequential increase was primarily due to R&D investments, increased hiring, payroll tax associated with employee stock vesting and first time consolidation of Sofdesk operations in late January. GAAP operating expenses were $61.6 million for Q1 compared to $42.8 million for Q4. GAAP operating expenses for Q1 including $13.9 million of stock based compensation expenses and $4 million of acquisition expenses and amortization for acquired intangible assets. On a non-GAAP basis, income from operations was $80.2 million for Q1 compared to $72.4 million for Q4. On a GAAP basis, income from operations was $61.4 million for Q1 compared to $79.1 million for Q4. On a non-GAAP basis, net income for Q1 was $78.7 million compared to $71.3 million for Q4. This resulted in diluted earnings per share of $0.56 for Q1 compared to $0.51 per share for Q4. GAAP net income for Q1 was $31.7 million compared to GAAP net income of $73 million for Q4. GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.22 for Q1 compared to diluted earnings per share of $0.50 for Q4. The GAAP results in the first quarter included a noncash loss of $56.4 million on the partial settlement of convertible notes due 2024 and 2025 or approximately $0.40 on a per share basis. Now turning to the balance sheet and the working capital front. Inventory was $34.9 million at the end of Q1 compared to $41.8 million at the end of Q4. The sequential decrease in inventory was driven by an increase in customer demand coupled with supply constraints. Days of inventory outstanding decreased to 18 days compared to 27 days in Q4. This sequential decrease was driven by the lower average inventory balance and higher shipment volumes. Our target is 30 days, but we were hampered by supply cost trends. Accounts receivable were $236.1 million at the end of Q1 compared to $182.2 million at the end of Q4. The sequential increase was due to the higher revenue in Q1 and shipments being weighted to the second half of the quarter. DSO of 56 days increased from 50 days in the prior quarter due to the timing of shipments. We exited Q1 with a total cash balance of approximately $1.5 billion compared to $679.4 million for Q4. The cash balance includes net proceeds of approximately $1.2 billion for the comparable notes issuance in May 2021, which are partially offset by $304.8 million paid in principal amounts for the partial repurchase and conversions of the convertible notes due 2024 and 2025 and $65.4 million paid for the call spread on the new convertible notes issuance. We did not make any share repurchases against our $200 million share repurchase authorization. In March, we issued green convertible notes in two tranches for total gross proceeds of approximately $1.2 billion. Both tranches have zero coupon. The five year tranche due 2026 raised gross proceeds of $632.5 million. With a 70% conversion premium, these notes are in the money at the share price of approximately $307. The seven year tranche due 2028 raised gross proceeds of $575 million with 57.5% conversion premium. This tranche is in the money at the share price of $285. Concurrent with the notes offering, we entered into a call spread overlay, which effectively increased the overall conversion price to about $398 per share. The terms of this capital raise were some of the most favorable to an issuer in history. We have a very strong cash position on a business that generate healthy free cash flow. We will invest in the business through organic and inorganic activities. We have a CapEx light business model, which provides for continued investment in new product development, new market entry and marketing to build our brand awareness with homeowners. On the acquisition front, we have an active pipeline and we are careful to only pursue deals with the right strategic and cultural fit, while meeting our return hurdles. In Q1, we generated $75.8 million in cash flow from operations and $81.5 million in free cash flow. Capital expenditures was $9.9 million for Q1 to increase manufacturing capacity for both microinverters and storage and costs related to enlighten software app development, corporate Web site development and office space expansion. Now let's discuss our outlook for the second quarter of 2021. We expect our revenue for the quarter to be within a range of $300 million to $320 million. We expect GAAP gross margin to be within a range of 37% to 40% and non-GAAP gross margin to be within a range of 38% to 41%, which excludes stock based compensation expenses. We expect our GAAP operating expenses to be within a range of $70 million to $73 million, including a total of approximately $17 million estimated for stock based compensation expenses and acquisition related expenses and amortization. We expect non-GAAP operating expenses to be within a range of $53 million to $56 million. All guidance estimates include the contribution from both Sofdesk and DIN for the entire quarter. Let me provide some additional color on a few topics. First, given the component supply constraints, we are expediting components and finished goods in Q2 to ensure customers have an adequate supply of our products. Even as component availability starts to improve this quarter, we must rush to get those components into final products into our customers’ hands. As a result, our GAAP and non-GAAP gross margin guidance incorporates a material sequential increase in expedite expense. While we expect Q2 to be the peak, logistics costs will likely remain elevated for the rest of 2021 due to the semiconductor supply chain constraints. Next, I would like to touch upon our OpEx guidance. Our non-GAAP operating expenses are increasing from Q1 to Q2 due to hiring to support our growth plans, the consolidation of acquisitions and necessary investments in software, branding and the development of IQ 9 and IQ 10 microinverters. It is possible that our OpEx may be slightly above our 15% target at times, but we'll still expect to comfortably exceed our baseline financial model target of 20% operating income. Regarding the two acquisitions [not only] do have the operating expenses of those business, but we also include accruals for the payment of deferred cash consideration. These are cash expenses, which is why we included them in non-GAAP guidance, but there are nonrecurring in nature beyond the specific earn out periods for each acquisition. For Q2, accruals for deferred consideration are expected to be approximately $3.5 million. With that, I will now open the line for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Aric Li from Bank of America.
Aric Li: I have question, first and foremost, around the component and [Technical Difficulty]. So you talked about improving channel inventory in 1Q, but the constraints remain. And it seems like that's weighing on shipments for both solar and storage. Can you talk about when you expect those new suppliers to really help ease the component constraints, would that be more into the back half or would that not really be until 2022? And just how much lower is that going to drive channel inventory relative to the 8 week target?
Badri Kothandaraman: So let me first make a couple of things clear. First of all, the constraints are only on the solar side, which is solar microinverters. And although, we are increasing the capacity of solar microinverters every quarter and the demand is increasing every quarter, the supply is unable to keep up with demand because of semiconductor component constraints. The semiconductor component constraints are mainly because of two specific components. One is the ASIC chip that we have. The other is an AC FET driver that drives the gate of the 600 volt transistors. And what we have done is, on both of them, we have bought on multiple suppliers. For example, on the AC FET drivers, we had two suppliers before. Now we are going to have three suppliers. On the ASIC, we were producing it in one foundry before. Now we are going to qualify an additional foundry. However, our demand is so high for Q2 and we expect a similar demand situation for Q3 that even though our available supply is higher than the prior quarter, it is still not sufficient to meet our demand. This is on the solar side. On the storage side, it's pretty simple. We shipped 32 megawatt hours in Q4. We shipped 42 megawatt hours in Q1 that is 30% higher, and we are making tremendous progress there. Our strength in storage is taking care, meaning introduced storage to our long tail installers. And we have trained 1,776 installers, representing 1,035 unique installation companies. That's our bread and butter. These are the folks who are engaged with us on the solar side and they have started buying storage. We are also engaged with the Tier 1 and 2 customers on storage, and we expect more progress here. In addition, like what I said, we have started roundtables every week with our long tail installers to understand all their pain points. And if I look at it, what are the installer pain points? The storage is still immature as a business for the installers. They have to make multiple trips per home because it is so new. The system sizing tools aren't up to speed yet, which is something we are going to be working on with our Sofdesk acquisition. Every job is a custom job. We are trying to standardize that with load control, having whole home backup instead of partial home backup. The homeowners are demanding because all of a sudden you're now in the path of power. And so the sales, meaning the customer service that the installers have to do, is much higher than the solar side. On top of it, we have permitting delays from the countries because, again, it's a new product and not everybody is used to it. And Enphase can help in all of the above. We are going to provide exceptional customer service. We are going to have field service teams to help installers. We bought a company to do solar and storage design software. We bought a company to enable permitting services. And so we have all of the tools to help the installers. However, this is going to take time. And that's why you see our growth is steady growth that we are talking about. We grew 35% from Q3 to Q4. We grew 30% from Q4 to Q1. We are growing modestly from Q1 to Q2, but we have no doubt that we are doing the right thing. And in addition, the other thing that would spur demand is international locations. It's got to be similar. We are going to take care of long tail installers internationally. We are going to introduce product imminently second half of the year early into Europe and then into Australia in the latter part of 2021. And in addition, I talked about the things we are doing on the homeowner side is introduce load control, which is the ability to turn on and turn off loads. The turning off loads is critical when you're in an off grid situation so that the homeowner experience is pristine. So we are focused on those. And we are also going to up our game on the marketing side. I recently -- yes, last quarter, I announced our CMO. And we are going to go all out on that front in terms of promotions, branding, looking at multiple channels, looking at the way we go to market, partnering with loan providers and 24/7 support, field service. We believe all of these tools are necessary, and it will help us make steady progress on storage every quarter. A long answer but I hope I answered the question.
Aric Li: Just as a follow-up question, specifically on storage. I believe you provided the guidance of 40 to 50 megawatt hours in 2Q, is that right, relative to 42 megawatt hours in 1Q. Can you just talk about expectations into the back half? Seemingly, I wasn't sure if there was some sort of chip constraint for the microinverters that would be using the storage, too, given the same product there. But could you just talk about expectations at the back half and perhaps bring additional suppliers and what that means for capacity into 2022?
Badri Kothandaraman: Well, like what I said, we expect to make steady progress on storage every quarter. We gave you guidance for Q2. Q3 will be steady progress on top of that. In terms of constraints on the storage systems, it's really, yes, microinverters are also included, yes, in the storage system. Every 10 kilowatt hour battery has got 12 microinverters. But in the big scheme of things, it's a small number relative to our overall demand. So we don't expect that to play a big deal there. And we are comfortable with the capacity that we have on the storage side. And like what I always said, we will bring in additional suppliers in 2023. And we have two suppliers today.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Brian Lee from Goldman Sachs.
Brian Lee: Maybe just big picture. Last quarter, Badri, Eric, you guys said that you sort of had visibility that the supply chain constraints, which everybody has been experiencing through the year, for you, you felt like April, you called out the month of April as being a potential having line of sight that things would start to ease around then. Now you're saying you're expecting the supply constraints on the solar side to persist through the year. So just a simple question, kind of what's changed between then and now, did you misread the market? Or what's kind of changed between the April view and now seeing this impact through the year? And then I had a follow up.
Badri Kothandaraman: It's pretty simple. The supply is not very predictable. Our demand is going higher and higher. We are increasing our supply every quarter. We are putting in much higher capacity in place for Q3 and Q4. But if you ask me today how confident our view on the supply, and it's tough because the situation is unpredictable. And the decommits are -- there are often decommits that we have to dance around. I am working with the CEOs of all three companies directly. And for example, on the AC FET drivers, but the situation is stressed globally and I don't think it is unique to us. Our architecture uses semiconductors. So the supply is -- yes, it's what it is. The good news is the -- yes, the demand has increased a lot for Q2 and Q3, stressing the supply situation even more. And that's what changed from the previous call. Yes, that's the truth.
Brian Lee: And so, I mean, it sounds like what you're saying is supply continues to be unpredictable, which makes sense, and then demand has actually probably gotten better. So follow up I had you is just maybe a little bit of numbers or quantification. This is the second quarter in a row where you're saying that you have bookings in excess of your guidance. You're basically undershipping demand. So maybe just a two part question here on the quantification. Can you give us some sense how much you are undershipping demand? Would guidance have been $10 million, $20 million, 10% higher? Just any sense on that? And then Eric also made some mention around margins. Q2, you're going to have some peak pressure from a freight cost perspective, but it doesn't get worse. What sort of margin impact is that in the quarter, 100 bps, 200 bps? It doesn't sound like it eases right away, but just trying to get a sense of what that is. And then just lastly, if you're seeing some of these cost increases, the tightness, are you raising prices? Are you having those negotiations or discussions with customers? And if not, given your market share position and how critical you are to your customers, why not potentially start to raise prices?
Badri Kothandaraman: You asked me for some numbers. I'm not going to say exact numbers, but I'm going to say one thing, that the demand is higher than all the numbers that you quoted, which is the good news. The second question, what is the second question? The third question, pricing. I'm not changing pricing. The second question on gross margin. Our gross margin guidance, non-GAAP is 38 to 41. We are not going to exactly break out what we did for expedite, but it's a big number. And you expect that because when you have supply chain problems, the factories are running hand to mouth. The factories are running hand to mouth, there is no time to put product on a boat. The only way we can get product to customers is air ships. Air ships per unit pricing to put a microinverter on the plane is enormous. It's usually 10 times or 15 times the price that it takes to ship on the ocean as expected. And these are all not new. They are standard. So hopefully, I gave those numbers.
Eric Branderiz: On the margins, Brian, I think that the comment about operation, meaning we need to live with expedites for a while. But we are pretty predictable in the way we manage our margins. On that front, on the cost reduction schedules and the way we negotiated prices, short and long term, I don't see a problem there. And I think you're seeing -- we look at a midpoint of the guidance that it's been pretty consistent, and we just need a little bit of time to get the supply challenges in the industry figured it out. And from the comment about April to today, adding to what Badri said, things changed. It changed quite a bit. I mean, the predictability on the level of inventories at the contract manufacturing level and even at the supplier level, it got depleted because of the V-shaped recovery. So that created a little bit more variations on the predictability, now relying on purely what is on the line. So that created a difficulty for even them to forecast their commitments. So that's kind of where we are on that. But I think that the -- I feel okay with the margins, so I think we got a profitable business, and we keep the eye on the ball here.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Philip Shen from ROTH Capital Partners.
Philip Shen: Just as a follow-up on the chip shortage. I know this was partially asked earlier, but just to put a finer point on it. Of the three companies that you're working with, Badri, are they giving you a sense for, hey, we think we can resolve this by Q1 of '22, for example, or is the situation even for them very unclear? So is this potentially a problem that could persist, for example, through a bunch of 2022?
Badri Kothandaraman: Yes, I mean, like what I said, I don't have that much visibility right now, but I do expect the supply situation to get better every quarter, especially because we have bought on a third supplier and that third supplier will eventually start ramping. So I do expect Q3 to get better. I expect Q4 to get even more better. But will that match our demand? I cannot predict it now.
Philip Shen: So shifting gears back to storage. You shared the megawatt hours for Q1 and the guide for Q2. Can you share revenue by chance? And also, what do you think the margin profile of the sales in Q1 and what you expect in Q2 is? Are you close to corporate average or is it meaningfully different?
Badri Kothandaraman: We are not going to break out revenue. Now with regarding gross margin, we will not enter any business unless we have a view to achieving our corporate gross margin.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Colin Rusch from Oppenheimer.
Colin Rusch: We just talked about the pricing in the energy storage and the movement around that, so as you layer in these additional functionalities. Are you able to charge higher prices or is that really just about maintaining your current price levels? And does it ultimately expand the market short term or is this really a longer term play around functionality that you think is important in the market?
Badri Kothandaraman: It's a longer term play, load control, generator functionality, grid services. These are all functions that we progressively want to introduce to existing homes. At this point, at least for load control and generator functionality, we are not charging for it. Grid services is a separate story because there is clear financial component there. So once we get ramped up there, we'll figure out how to properly do value based pricing there. But in terms of storage, overall, our pricing strategy has always been value based. Our pricing will be next best alternative plus the value we add on top of that. Yes, for example -- in micro inverters, for example, is we compare to the competition, that's the next best alternative. And then we say, what do we do better? We do quality. Our PPM defects -- defective parts per million, that's much lower and our customer services is much better. So similar things apply to storage as well. Of course, it's a maturing market and so we need to be competitive, but we will always follow our value based pricing story. And if we don't add value, then it's pretty clear, right? We are going to be competing against competition. There's going to be price competition, and we never want to be like that. So that's why we are adding these features. And these features are the differentiated features, which is load control, generation functionality, grid services and a lot more soon.
Colin Rusch: And then just shifting gears on the commercial solar business as you enter into that with IQ 8D. Can you talk a little bit about the maturity of the finance partners that you're working with, who have qualified you and are ready to work with the solution, are comfortable with you? And how wide the geographic footprint will be as you start to roll out that product later this year?
Badri Kothandaraman: I mean, there the story is we're making a lot of progress there, both in terms of the business as well as the product features and compliance. The problem there is mainly with the supply situation uncertain, I don't want to ramp yet another new product with the same components, while I'm not servicing my current customers proper. So that's why I made a decision on, let's make sure that we cautiously ramp that product. But it's a fantastic product. We are working with design tool partners. In our design and proposal partners, we are working with -- we are beginning to work with financials. We haven't made too much progress there, but we are beginning to work there. And most of our business right now is focused on North America. That's the first product. And then in six months, we will introduce it in Europe as well as Australia where there's even bigger time for small commercial.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Mark Strouse from JPMorgan.
Mark Strouse: I wanted to go back to your comments about expanding capacity in Mexico and India. I believe on the last call, you mentioned having between 4 million and 5 million unit production capability per quarter by year end. Are the comments today incremental to that number?
Badri Kothandaraman: No, the comments are consistent with that number. You can break down the 5 million the following way. Mexico capacity is roughly -- we'll get to 1.5 million units a quarter. Salcomp, India capacity will get to 1.5 million units a quarter, at least minimum quantities. China is already a couple of million units a quarter. So 1.5 plus 1.5 plus 2, 5 million units a quarter, all by the end of 2021. So that's completely consistent with what I said. Now that capacity, that's the capacity of the factory, that's got nothing to do with supply. The supply of the semiconductor components needs to improve, needs to become consistent, need to become predictable for me to cater to such a big demand. And that, today, I do not have visibility into those numbers.
Mark Strouse: And then just a quick follow up on the plans to enter the Brazilian market. Will that require any kind of new manufacturing capacity, local manufacturing capacity? And then can you just remind us what you've said as far as what the product road map within Brazil will be as far as solar and then solar plus storage and then potentially the commercial sales?
Badri Kothandaraman: We are not going to manufacture something locally yet in Brazil unless the demand builds up to a significant number. So for now we would still manufacture remote, meaning not in Brazil. And first, we will start off with solar. [Marco Krapels], whom we hired in order to enter in Brazil, he is the GM of that business. He believes that there is a substantial differentiation with IQ 8 entering into Brazil. Of course, in the short term, we are going to be supply constrained but we are talking about long term here. So first, I would start with solar and then I would add on storage to that market. Yes, basically. Raghu, do you want to say anything?
Raghu Belur: Just a couple of things is that from a product point of view, again, it's leveraging the platform. So we don't have to build a new hardware necessary to service the Brazilian market. It's a software change for us. It's a former change for us to meet their grid requirements. In fact, today, IQ 7 is already certified as a unique specific certification requirement called in [metro], and we're already certified for the Brazilian market. So we are going to leverage our platform, which is what we've been doing for every new geography and playing very well.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Osborne from Cowen and Company.
Jeff Osborne: I was wondering if you could rank order between the AC FETs and the ASICs. Which of the two is more acute in terms of the problem?
Badri Kothandaraman: The AC FET by far.
Jeff Osborne: And then the ASIC I always view as sort of the brain of your product. You're a fabless company that uses a third party today as you flagged one. To do that, typically, it's multiple quarters to qualify a new ASIC producer. Do you anticipate that to take multiple quarters or have you been working on this for some time?
Badri Kothandaraman: We have been working on this for some time. And our current foundry is -- I mean, we have talked about this before. This is not new. Our current foundry is TSMC and we are qualifying an additional foundry.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Kashy Harrison from Simmons Energy.
Kashy Harrison: So my first question is around just the rollout of IQ 8. I was just wondering how long do you think it would take or it could take to completely transition from selling majority IQ 7 to selling majority IQ 8, a year or two years? Just some rough numbers would be great.
Badri Kothandaraman: Yes, IQ 7 took four quarters. So IQ 8 will take a similar time. And with the supply constraints, maybe you can add one or two quarters more, four to six quarters.
Kashy Harrison: And then my second question. So I was reading your letter to the shareholders, and you talked about gallium nitride as you think about IQ 9 and IQ 10. I know that's a long ways away, probably still early in development. But when you think about the opportunity there, as you think about your product over the next several years. Should we be anticipating step shift reductions in costs from the transition to gallium or do you think maybe we're getting close to the limit on your ability to take costs out of the manufacturing system?
Badri Kothandaraman: The reason why we are doing it is to reduce the footprint, to increase power, to increase efficiency and drop costs. And I'll give you a quick example. Today, we have 4 AC high voltage FETs. They are the 600 volt FETs, 4 600 volt FETs. And then we have two AC FET gate drivers, which is ahead all the shortages. Those two AC FET gate drivers are driving the four 600 volt FETs. So we have four plus two, six components there. With gallium nitride, what we could do is to collapse two of those 600-volt FETs into one and we could integrate that AC gate driver also into the same package. So six discrete components will go to two discrete components. Of course, cost of gallium nitride will be a little bit higher, but the integration capability is very powerful. And what does that mean is I can run my AC FETs now at a higher frequency. Today, I run them at 100 kilohertz. I can run them at a much higher frequency. If I run those if I run those FETs at a higher frequency, then all of a sudden, I can drop my transformer size. My big transformer, which is there in the microinverter, can drop in phase drastically, dropping the footprint. So we are working concurrently on planar transformers in addition to gallium nitride FETs. That's the name of the game. If we're able to optimize that properly, there is huge wins for us. And it will help us to increase the power of the microinverter while keeping the cost down, while keeping the footprint down, while keeping the economics intact. So that's what we are working with multiple companies, and it is R&D. It's going to take us 2022 or 2023 to get an IQ 10 product, but IQ 9 will be a little bit before that, but it's R&D.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Tristan Richardson from Truist.
Tristan Richardson: Just one from me. I think we heard from a market participant yesterday in moving to almost an exclusively bundled model for solar and storage. I think the dynamics there sound somewhat company specific, but just wanted to ask. Are you guys seeing any signs of that in your installer network? And do you guys see it as an opportunity for Enphase on the market share side for either a stand alone storage product or otherwise?
Badri Kothandaraman: I mean, that's the name of the game. Storage by itself, some people say it makes sense. But in order to have a regenerative system that can function off grid, you want solar as well. So solar plus storage is a big deal. And that is precisely why we are focused on our long tail installers because they already sell in phase microinverters for a living. And now if they start selling Enphase storage systems and more actually home energy management systems, which are solar plus storage systems that would be a big win. So all of our efforts are taking our Enphase Installer Network and even bigger than that, taking our long tail installers, which is much more than the Enphase Installer Network, work really closely with them, train them properly, remove their installer pain points, help them with 24/7 support, help them with field service so that they can ramp solar plus storage with us, that's the opportunity.
Tristan Richardson: But you're not necessarily seeing any installers kind of go from mandatory bundled model, are you?
Badri Kothandaraman: Mandatory bundles, not yet. But I'm sure it's coming.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line now of Jim Ricchiuti from Needham & Company.
Jim Ricchiuti: Just a question on the expediting costs that you're incurring. And Eric, I may have misheard it, but you seem to suggest that's going to improve in the back half. And I guess, I know you're bringing on production, but by the same token, it looks like you're going to continue to be facing these supply constraints. So how confident are you that you're going to see those costs come down in the back half?
Eric Branderiz: Yes, I mean, the expedite is going to be around with us as long as we get these challenges associated with supply constraint. So we should kind of get used to the concept that those are going to be embedded. What I'm saying is that, that is not going to get the margin worse. What I'm saying is we got a very credible, predictable cost reduction road map in the near term that gives me confidence that we can continue honoring our financial operating model and my comments associated with operating income, which all is driven when you're thinking about OpEx may go up a little bit, right, because we need to make the investments. That's what I said on my script. And then the question is, okay, so you have this expedite. What's going to happen with your operating income? Well, we feel confident that the cost road map will be there to deliver their goods. As we continue ramping complicated products like storage and the new products that Badri has in time for Q3 and Q4, IQ 8 on the roof and IQ 8D. So there is one area that we should feel comfortable is that margins continue to be fairly predictable in the short term. And in the long term, you can always use the financial operating model that we publicize size already. So that's the context within my comments.
Jim Ricchiuti: And I wonder if you would just comment with respect to, is there a point at which you might begin to calibrate your operating expense, the investments you're making in the business over the next couple of quarters depending on whether this supply constraint issue potentially doesn't improve in the back half?
Eric Branderiz: I mean, I'm not quite sure I cannot follow your question. But if I understand correctly, you're saying, Eric, you're planning to continue spending money on doing acquisitions and potentially your OpEx is going to go up. And then your…
Jim Ricchiuti: What I'm suggesting is if it looks like we're in for a period of a couple of quarters of pretty acute component shortage issues. Is there a point at which you say we may dial back certain investments that we're making until the situation improves more markedly? And you may not because you feel like it's worth investing just as you think about the outlook for 2022 and presumably, it's going to be behind us.
Eric Branderiz: So let me clarify. We are in growth mode. And my message, hopefully, comes across very clear that we are not going to stop making the right investments at the right time either by processing our pipeline of deals that we have as we continue evaluating M&A or made the right OpEx investments, as I discussed on the script, on the prepared remarks, which are specific to go to market with products, including sales and marketing activities globally and so on. We did really well internationally because we never compromise on making the right investments. The good news on that is despite of this and despite of the expedites, I have my margins there to deliver the goods. So I can continue generating cash according to my model as I try to catch up with my revenue profile to fulfill my demand that right now is being hampered by the component supply constraint challenges that we have. I hope that answers your question.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of James West from Evercore ISI.
James West: So Badri, if I hear you correctly, the installer experience, the customer experience are getting better. You've got this product cycle that's underway. You're not meeting demand of your customers, and you're rapidly expanding into new geographies. So when we get past this period of equipment shortage, you're going to have a lot more capacity because, as you mentioned earlier, you're going to keep investing. Will you, at that point -- let's say, we're into 2022. Will you at that point finally manage to catch up with demand? Do you think demand will still outrun you?
Badri Kothandaraman: But, it's the same answer. I hope by the end of 2021, these problems go away. But right now, I'm living from day to day. Supply is unpredictable. The semiconductor -- it's not a situation only for me, it's a situation where every company who use the semiconductors. I don't have a crystal ball to predict the future.
James West: And then, I guess, one other question, follow up from me. With the situation in India right now with the pandemic, is that having any impact? I know you're pretty automated in that facility. Does that have any impact in your operations this quarter?
Badri Kothandaraman: Yes. I mean, it does. Many of the folks in our teams are affected by it, either their families are affected or they are affected. They're all working from home, following all safety protocols. I mean, India, if you know, it is not in such a great shape today, in general, as a country. I mean, we are heartbroken by it. It's 300,000 plus new cases a day. So yes, I mean, some employees are affected, but they are also -- it lasts for about 10, 15 days. And during that time, they have full freedom to take care of themselves, and we will do all it takes to support them. But usually, they are back after two week break. And they are in the process of getting vaccinated. And I'm hoping within a quarter, the situation will come back to normalcy, but we are taking care of all of our employees absolutely.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of George O'Leary from TPH & Co.
George O'Leary: Just curious, you guys have built up an impressive cash war chest and the free cash flow generation continues. You don't have much need from an organic CapEx spend. Clearly, there's a big R&D budget that's ongoing. But just curious if there are some larger bites at the apple from an inorganic standpoint that you might be contemplating. You've done some M&A here recently but smaller stuff. So just curious what you're thinking about on the M&A front, if there's anything on that medium or larger size front that piques your interest at this point?
Eric Branderiz: I mean, I'm not going to comment on details, but I'm telling you, Raghu, right now and Adam, both are in the call, have very ambitious plans, and they have great ideas. And they bring all sorts of very interesting stuff in for Badri and myself that we are evaluating carefully. The beauty about the having -- think about it. They have $1.5 billion of cash, of which I need probably to run the company only $300 million flowing cash, that's what maybe a little bit more now that we are getting bigger. So the rest is available for us to take advantage of the best opportunities that are available in the market. When you see things like what's happening right now with these packs kind of contracting a little bit that reopens the conversations very quickly. And certainly, the pricing on those conversations become much more reasonable to digest, I guess. And so we are aggressively looking at every opportunity. And on software, maybe selectively some hardware R&D houses, ongoing businesses completely that we can buy. And we demonstrated that we can absorb them, integrate them, culturally fit and then we run them fairly well. And it's going well, for example, with the two we just did in Q1. So I think that everything is on the table.
George O'Leary: And then just one more on an unrelated note, but you mentioned improving the installer and the customer experience is a goal, which makes a lot of sense. Just wondering if there were any analogues from a geographic standpoint outside of your core markets today where that customer and installer experience is better where you can take lessons learned from those installers and translate them to the US or other geographies. I know Germany has much lower soft cost than the US, for example. Just curious if there's any pathway that's already laid out from any geographic analogues out there in the market?
Badri Kothandaraman: Well, not really. Our 82% of our revenue comes from here. Yes, we need to diversify but most of our product experience comes from here. But having said that, it is true that, for example, places like Europe, Australia, even India, they do have an outstanding cost structure in general. And we need to really take costs out of all aspects, not just products but things like permitting, things like design and proposal, look at all inefficiencies in the chain. That's something that we've just started doing with the acquisitions. We'll do a lot more. And the name of the game, once again, is to collapse and consolidate all of those services for the installers onto the digital platform, so we can help them reduce the soft costs.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Maheep Mandloi from Crédit Suisse.
Maheep Mandloi: Just quick on the battery supplier, I think you previously talked about the third supplier in the second half. Can you talk about the status of that? And just had a follow-up on grid services.
Badri Kothandaraman: We have two suppliers today, the second supplier is ramping just now, the first supplier is what we are using right now. Second supplier is just ramping. The third supplier, we do have good plans. However, I think it will turn on only in 2022.
Maheep Mandloi: And just on grid services, I know you said it's early in early stages and you're ramping up the software and hardware capabilities for it. But when do you expect it to contribute any material revenues? And would that kind of a grid service optionality work with third party batteries or would it be predominantly for the Enphase storage product?
Badri Kothandaraman: It will be predominantly 100% for Enphase storage. And we're already tightly engaged with a few aggregators in the East Coast. We are going to enable selling, meaning we're already enabling selling of storage systems there and we will turn on grid services within the next three months for them. Additionally, we are working with a couple of utilities as well who have directly approached us ad we are working with them, both in the East Coast and elsewhere here in the US. It does require a lot of software effort and the name of the game for us is, we have a long tail installer network that can help sell grid services properly to the homeowner. We can integrate grid services to the Ensemble home energy management system so that we take care of customer experience properly. And at the end of the day, if we enable homeowners to save a certain dollars, $500 a year while giving them this peace of mind that will be a big deal. So when we have an Enphase storage population that becomes tens of thousands, then VPP, meaning virtual power plant, will be very meaningful at that time. We are probably a year or two away from that but we are making a lot of progress in the interim with aggregators, with utilities. And we expect a lot more engagements with them.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Eric Stine from Craig-Hallum.
Eric Stine: Just a quick question, most have been taken. But I know it's a little bit longer play but on the grid services side, is that something that you potentially can get a portion of those revenues as the enabler of that, or is that something that, as you said, you price based on value that you would potentially just try to capture on the front end?
Badri Kothandaraman: Yes, we can get a portion of it. The primary thing here is, in the model where we work with a few aggregators who work with the utility there, the homeowner reaps the benefit and we provide a service for a fee. And where we directly work with the utilities, financially, there may be more opportunities for us there. And like what I said, we are right now scratching the surface. We are working with aggregators who are working with the utilities. We are in some deep engagement. So we first understand the business properly and develop our home energy management APIs and micro services for the same, but it's not going to be that far off. In a few months, we would be able to work directly with the utilities.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Sean Milligan from Williams Trading.
Sean Milligan: I wanted to talk a little bit more about storage, I guess. Before, you mentioned that storage, there were financing problems with storage. And so I wanted to just get your thoughts on where that market was in terms of being able to finance storage, which might drive additional growth for you?
Badri Kothandaraman: I mean, solar is very mature. The industry has got 25 years of warranty. So extended loans really helps the homeowner. And I think the rough breakdown in the industry between cash, loans and lease is about 10%, 60% and 30%, respectively, which means loans are roughly about 30% -- I mean, about 60% of the business. Now we need to enable storage to also have attractive loans. In order for them to have attractive loans, solar bundling with storage is one option. Having the right warranty structure on storage is another option, and we need to do both. And Enphase can help a lot here because this is what we are good at, power electronics, quality and customer experience. So we are thinking hard on working with partners. We have a lot of partners we're working with. And we can change the -- we have to work on the product quality to increase the warranty from 10 years to whatever we can. And once we do that, we will unleash loans to become more economical for the homeowners. It will increase the demand that's required for the long tail installers. So it's a long range. Eventually, this has to be done. But we are taking proactive steps to ensure product quality is right.
Sean Milligan: And then just the competitive landscape in storage, like there's been new entrants, and people are giving performance guarantees. And I would expect storage to become even more competitive as additional battery cell manufacturing comes online over the next kind of three years or three to four years. So just to get your sense on kind of the competitive landscape within storage and how you're competing against people that are giving performance guarantees or competing on price?
Badri Kothandaraman: We believe we must add value. We are not seeing a major problem on cell packs. I think we will be competitive and we have the right procurement organization to drive those costs down. The name of the game in storage is how can we provide outstanding quality and customer experience. It's the same thing which I told you. The long tail installers need not look storage as a drag on their margins. The storage needs to be a highly profitable business for them. Instead of going to the home multiple trips multiple times for an installation, it should be one and done. The sizing needs to be clear. Installations need to be a cookie cutter model. The permitting needs to be streamlined. The expectations for the homeowners need to be met. So things like load control are extremely critical. So we are going to be working on all of those things. And we believe that quality and customer experience will ultimately win, and that's what we do for a living. It's a model that has worked well for microinverters with our long tail installers, and now we are going to ramp storage with our long tail installers. And yes, it is tough. It takes time. It's slow and steady progress. And those are the kinds of businesses we like, healthy, profitable businesses.
Operator: Our final question for today comes from the line of Pavel Molchanov from Raymond James.
Pavel Molchanov: When you expanded the installer network into Europe, which as one of the other questions asked about has much lower soft costs. What's the main selling point of joining that network for an installer in, for example, the Netherlands or Belgium?
Badri Kothandaraman: First of all, the installer networks, in Europe, there are going to be multiple of them, because Europe, you cannot generalize Europe. I think like what you said, Netherlands, our installer network there, they need something else versus installer network in Germany versus the installer network in the UK versus the network in Spain versus the network in Poland. That's the first thing to recognize. The second thing to recognize is what do they want? What is the rate for them, right? What is the rate for them? The important thing is if they can have one platform on which they can get all kinds of services, that's extremely important for them. New product availability, extremely important for them. They want to differentiate themselves from other installers. So they want nothing but the best. Like that, I could go on. There are multiple services that they need. So depending upon the tier of the installer, we have three tiers, platinum installers, gold installers, silver. And the way we categorize those three tiers is pretty simple, based upon their quality and based upon how they rate on customer experience that's measured, not by us, by the homeowners. So we rate it like that and then we make it attractive for platinum installers to be with us in terms of pricing, in terms of services we do. And we make sure there's healthy competition there. It's a much broader strategy and we are very cautious in introducing installer networks to every region without adequate planning. So last year, we spent the entire last year introducing installer network for the US and Australia. This year, we just started in Europe and we will introduce in India as well, but a lot more to come in Europe.
Pavel Molchanov: My second question is about one more about component sourcing. Historically, there has never been a need for you to sign truly longterm supply contracts, let's say, five, seven year type of supply contracts with your key component players. Do you envision going out to that long term time frame, given what we're experiencing right now?
Badri Kothandaraman: No. I mean, I'm wary of such deals. I usually not do such deals. I don't envision doing those. I hope and pray, this will be with us for a couple of more quarters and will be gone. And we'll be a better company because we have three suppliers instead of two, or we might even add one more. So we can always have supply diversification. We'll learn best practices from it. We'll institute our business processes within the company, and we will become better.
Operator: Thank you. This does conclude the question and answer session of today's conference call. I'd now like to hand the program back to Badri Kothandaraman.
Badri Kothandaraman: All right. So thank you for joining us today and for your continued support of Enphase. We look forward to speaking with you again next quarter. Bye.
Operator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect. Good day.

===== 2020 Q4  (2021-02-10 16:30:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Enphase Energy's Fourth Quarter 2020 Financial Results Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speaker presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session.  Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. 
Adam Hinckley: Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us on today's conference call to discuss Enphase Energy's fourth quarter 2020 results. On today's call are Badri Kothandaraman, Enphase's President and Chief Executive Officer; Eric Branderiz, Chief Financial Officer and Raghu Belur, Chief Products Officer. After the market closed today, Enphase issued a press release announcing the results for its fourth quarter ended December 31, 2020. During this conference call, Enphase management will make forward-looking statements, including but not limited to, statements related to Enphase Energy's expected future financial performance, the capability of our technology and products, our operations, including in the manufacturing and customer service, the anticipated growth in our sales and in the markets in which we operate and target, the performance of the tools we make available to and the capabilities of our installation partners and expected regulatory changes. These forward-looking statements involve significant risks and uncertainties and the Enphase Energy's actual results and the timing of events could differ materially from these expectations. For a more complete discussion of the risks and uncertainties, please see the Company's annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019, which is on file with the SEC and the annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020 which will be filed with the SEC in the first quarter of 2021. Enphase Energy cautions you not to place any undue reliance on forward-looking statements and undertakes no duty or obligation to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future events or changes in its expectations. Also, please note that financial measures used on this call are expressed on a non-GAAP basis unless otherwise noted and have been adjusted to exclude certain charges. The Company has provided a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures in its earnings release posted today, which can also be found in the Investor Relations section of its website. Now I'd like to introduce Badri Kothandaraman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Enphase Energy. Badri?
Badrinarayanan Kothandaraman: Good afternoon, and thanks for joining us today to discuss our fourth quarter 2020 financial results. We had a good quarter. We reported revenue of $264.8 million, shipped approximately 2.3 million microinverters, achieved non-GAAP gross margin of 40.2% and generated strong free cash flow of $78.5 million. We exited the fourth quarter at approximately 40%, 13%, 27%. This means, 40% gross margin, 13% operating expense and 27% operating income, all as a percentage of revenue on a non-GAAP basis. As a reminder, our baseline financial model is 35%, 15%, 20%. Eric will go into greater details about our finances later in the call.
Eric Branderiz: Thanks, Badri, and good afternoon, everyone. I will provide more details related to our fourth quarter of 2020 financial results as well as our business outlook for the first quarter of 2021. We have provided reconciliation of these non-GAAP to GAAP financial measures in our earnings release posted today, which can also be found in the IR section of our website. We are very pleased with the significant increase in demand for our microinverter systems in Q4 2020 despite the pandemic. Total revenue for Q4 2020 was $264.8 million which did not include any revenue from safe harbor shipments during the quarter. Total revenue increased 48% sequentially and we shipped approximately 762 megawatts DC of microinverters and 32 megawatt-hours of the storage systems in Q4 2020. The 32 megawatt-hours is equivalent to 12.2 megawatt-hours of power. As we previously discussed, some of our microinverter units met certain size and weight criteria, qualifying them for an exclusion to the Section 301 tariffs on prior shipments. We requested refunds totaling approximately $39 million plus accrued interest of which $23 million were approved in Q3 2020 and $16 million were approved in Q4 2020. This refunds have been accounted for as a reduction of cost of goods sold in the respective quarters where they were approved and the associated accrued interest was recorded in other expenses. We have excluded trust tariff refunds from non-GAAP financial results to present a more accurate picture of ongoing business performance. We don't expect any further refunds in 2021. Non-GAAP gross margin for Q4 2020, which excluded the $16 million tariff approved refunds, was 40.2% compared to $0.41 -- 41% for Q3 2020. The sequential decline was due to higher shipping and logistics cost compare -- logistics cost related to component supply constraint. GAAP gross margin was 46% for Q4 2020. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $34.2 million for Q4 2020 compared to $29.6 million for Q3 2020. The sequential increase was primarily due to the hiring of 85 employees during the quarter, mainly focused on engineering, cost of experience and innovation. GAAP operating expenses were $42.8 million for Q4 2020 compared to $43.2 million for Q3 2020. GAAP operating expenses for Q4 2020 including $7.8 million of stock-based compensation expenses and $684,000 of acquisition-related expenses and amortization for acquired intangible assets. On a non-GAAP basis, income from operations was $72.4 million for Q4 2020 compared to $43.7 million for Q3 2020. On a GAAP basis, income from operations was $79.1 million for Q4 2020 compared to $51.8 million for Q3 2020. On a non-GAAP basis, net income for Q4 2020 was $71.3 million compared to $41.8 million for Q3 2020. This resulted in diluted earnings per share of $0.51 for Q4 2020 compared to $0.30 per share for Q3 2020. On an annual basis, we are pleased to report our record non-GAAP net income of $188.5 million. GAAP net income for Q4 2020 was $73 million compared to GAAP net income of $39.4 million for Q3 2020. GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.50 for Q4 2020 compared to diluted earnings per share of $0.28 in Q3 2020. Now turning to the balance sheet and the working capital front. Inventory was $48. -- $41.8 million at the end of Q4 2020 compared to $37.5 million at the end of Q3 2020. The sequential increase in inventory was driven by the planned increase of raw materials for our Enphase Storage systems in anticipation of the production ramp in 2021. Although the dollar value of inventory increased sequentially, days of inventory outstanding decreased to 27 days, compared to 41 days in Q3. This sequential decrease in days of inventory was driven by the higher shipment volumes in Q4. Our target is 30 days nominally and we will always do what is right for customers. Accounts receivables were $182.2 million at the end of Q4 2020 compared to $122.4 million at the end of Q3 2020. The sequential increase was due to the higher revenue in Q4. DSO of 50 days decreased slightly from 52 days in prior quarter due to our collection management. We remain committed to efficient working capital management and driving down our cash conversion cycle. We exited Q4 2020 with a full cash balance of $679.4 million, compared to $661.8 million for Q3 2020. We did not make any share repurchases against our $200 million share repurchase authorization. However, we spent $16.3 million on withhold to cover tax transactions on employee stock vesting that prevented the issuance of approximately 132,000 shares in Q4. For the calendar year 2020, we spent $68.3 million at an average price of $50 per share on withhold to cover transactions and prevented the issuance of approximately 1.4 million shares. In Q4, we also spent $43.9 million on the partial repurchase of convertible notes due 2024. Since the end of Q4, we have received additional conversion request of $61.5 million as the notes are deep in the money compared to the commercial price. We expect to repay the principal amount of this conversion requesting cash and in the money amount in shares. Settlement will occur in Q1 2021. In Q4 2020, we generated $84.2 million in cash flow from operations and $78.5 million in free cash flow. For calendar year 2020, we generated our record 188 -- $198.9 million of free cash flow. Capital expenditure was $8.9 million for Q4, mainly for the Enphase Storage manufacturing capacity increase, IT enhancements, Enlighten software app development costs, and the production ramp with our second contract manufacturing partner. Capital expenditure for 2020 was $20.6 million. Now let's discuss our outlook for the first quarter of 2021. We expect our revenue for the quarter to be within a range of $280 million to $300 million. We expect GAAP gross margin to be within a range of 37% to 40% and non-GAAP gross margin to be within a range of 38% to 41%, which excludes stock-based compensation expenses. The gross margin guidance includes a further increase in shipping and logistics cost to ensure we are best service our customers and getting them as many units as possible. We expect our GAAP operating expenses to be within a range of $64 million to $67 million, including a total of approximately $22 million estimated for stock-based compensation expenses and acquisition-related expenses and amortization. We expect non-GAAP operating expenses to be within a range of $42 million to $45 million. All guidance estimates include the Sofdesk acquisition, but do not include the DIN's Solar Design Services business. I would like to touch upon our OpEx guidance. Our non-GAAP operating expenses are increasing quite a bit from Q4 to Q1. The increase is due to two reasons. Hire to support our growth plans and consolidation of acquisition, plus we lead in incentive accruals. The hiring is related to the new product development and investment in innovation to create best-in-class home energy management system. The Sofdesk and DIN Solar Design Services Business acquisition are building blocks that enable us to build a world-class digital platform for homeowners and installers. At the same time, we are not taking our eyes off the baseline financial model and plan to maintain operating expenses at 15% of revenue. Before turning the call back to the operator for questions, I would like to mention a couple of things. First, we publish our inaugural ESG report a few weeks ago. Sustainability is at the core of what we do at Enphase, and we are proud of our team as we continue to enable clean energy and energy-independence through innovation. Second, Enphase has recently added -- has been recently added to the S&P 500 Index and we are very proud of this accomplishment. I want to acknowledge the hard work and dedication of the entire Enphase team. With that, I will now open the line for questions.
Operator: Thank you.  Our first question comes from Brian Lee with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.
Brian Lee: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the questions and congrats on a great quarter. Maybe first if we could sort of dig into the guidance a little bit. I know there is some shortages here on the micro side, I'm assuming there's some on the battery side as well. But can you give us a sense of sort of supply demand for both the micro side as well as the Encharge system, it sounds like you're leaving some business on the table here. Can you kind of quantify what impact that's having on Q1 and is that expected to also persist into Q2? And then related to that, I guess on gross margins, what percent hit did you see? Is it a 100 bps, is it more than that on Q4, given the additional freight and logistics costs you had to incur?
Badrinarayanan Kothandaraman: Yeah. So let me start with the microinverters. Demand is quite high, customer demand is quite high there, and I once again go back and attribute it to our high quality and high customer experience. So basically, while I'm not going to quantify how much the demand is higher compared to the high-end of the guidance I already said, it is significantly high. And our constraints basically are coming from the semiconductor components, that's an industry-wide issue right now. There are two specific components that we are constrained on, one is our ASIC that goes into the micro and the other is the AC FET drivers that actually drive the high-voltage FET. There the name of the game is, we are qualifying multiple more sources, so that we have more supply as well as expediting product, and I am in direct touch with the CEOs of those companies and they are helping as much as they can. We expect to get all caught up basically by -- yeah by early April. Our top priority through all of this is to ensure that we take care of customers. So we will do whatever it takes in order to ensure their lines are running and that they have not affected. So that's on the microinverter side. On the storage side, we have enough capacity. We already said that we will -- we have about -- as of last quarter, we had about 50 megawatt-hours of capacity and then as of Q3 of '21, we will have 120 megawatt-hours of capacity. We have enough capacity of the storage side. And on the storage side, once again reflecting back on how we did, we started shipping storage in the third quarter. I'm pretty happy with the ramp. Compared to the third quarter, I did about, or we did about 35% more megawatt hours in Q4 compared to Q3. And for Q1, we do expect to do a similar amount higher than Q4. So let me come to some more statistics on storage, so that you get a flavor for it. Essentially, like what I said, about 360 plus installation install a -- unique installation companies have installed at least one Enphase Storage system. We have trained over 650 unique installation companies. We have trained overall more than 1,200 installation personnel. We -- what we are seeing -- we've learnt a lot in the process, mainly from installers as well as a lot of homeowners, and we are improving them one by one. So although -- yeah, I said in the prepared remarks, I wish we achieved a little bit more, but I think we are doing the right things by fixing these problems. For example, our commissioning time needs work, and we are in the process of improving the commissioning time to sub-24 hours and it is all about -- for us, it is all about taking care of the installer, making sure that the installer's experience is seamless. Ease of doing business is what we are all about. Therefore we will never compromise on the short-term in order to achieve that. So more examples is, very often the installers usually struggle on storage with main panel rewriting and replacement. So that's a big pain point for the installers and we are working on steps to solve that. Ease of doing -- when it comes to other ease of doing business, the homeowners are still in their infancy on learning how to use storage systems. So while the transition from on-grid to off-grid is seamless, the fact it is seamless means that the homeowners do not change their behavior and Enphase needs to do a lot more there to educate the homeowner in the seamless way. This is intelligent notification, intelligent text messaging, intelligent load control, which we are actually working on. And to -- one more thing is to also go back and do the storage design right in the first place. Very often people miss that storage is all about taking care of power property and most of the people miss that. Once again it is we, Enphase needs to take responsibility to do whatever it takes to simplify the installer's ease of doing business. And of course, now I'm coming to the industry changes that are needed, which are permitting needs to be a little bit faster on storage, that's an industry-wide problem, which I'm sure many of our peers and us are going to be working on. And the last one is financing for storage. We need some kind of innovative financing schemes and storage, so that that also starts accelerating overall. And I hope I gave you some flavor, but if I were to summarize, we are growing at a very nice clip, 35% from -- in Q4 compared to Q3. We'll do similar rate in Q1 compared to Q4, and our focus is on the long-term. We will take care of our installers, training and making our storage system easiest to install, that's our focus.
Brian Lee: Thanks Badri, that's super helpful color. Maybe just -- I had a second question on batteries and you touched upon some of this. But if I kind of back into the numbers, it seems like you did maybe $25 million, $30 million of Encharge revenue in Q4, and then that will be well into the $30 million plus range in Q1 based on the guidance. So first question on batteries is, fair to assume those are the right revenue ranges and there is no change to pricing in the near-term? And then second question is just on -- I know given it's a new product and the installation rates are not as sort of swift as what you're used to on the solar side, your shipments are not keeping up necessary with capacity. You've talked about 120 megawatt hours by Q2, kind of 35% surge capacity you want to have in place, so maybe 85, 90 megawatt hours really being the shippable capacity you're targeting. When do you think we'd get closer to shipments lining up with kind of your applicable capacity? Thanks guys.
Badrinarayanan Kothandaraman: Your ballpark for the revenue is right. The second one is, like what I said, I mean it's a long-term gain. So once we fix the ease of doing business for the installers, we expect to ramp. As you see, we are making significant progress with both the long tail installers as well as the Tier 1 and 2 installers. You saw all of the press releases, you will see a lot more going forward. So we continue to grow at a nice clip. You can do the math. If we continue to grow at this 30%, soon we will need a third supplier that might happen in 2022, and we are already talking to those people.
Brian Lee: All right, thanks guys. I'll pass it on.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Moses Sutton with Barclays. Your line is now open.
Moses Sutton: Hi, thanks for taking our questions and congrats on the quarter. So you say you'll start shipping IQ 8 in 2Q. How should we think about IQ 8 standalone pricing versus IQ 7? What's -- what might be the range on the premium? And might you expect over time, a majority of installers shifting more toward IQ 8 versus IQ 7 or is the jury out on that question still?
Badrinarayanan Kothandaraman: Yeah, I mean, we're not going to talk about the exact pricing right now, but we are within a few months of going to market, so that will happen very soon. With regarding whether people are willing to adopt IQ 8 over IQ 7, we think the answer is a no-brainer, it's going to be yes. It's -- IQ 8 is a grid independent microinverter system. So therefore, I expect the adoption to be high when it is released. And there are obviously a lot of combinations with IQ 8. And in some cases people might prefer to buy IQ 8 with a smaller storage system and we will be promoting the heck out of it.
Moses Sutton: Great. Looking forward. What percent of U.S. installers using your products now still need to be trained on Encharge? I know you gave the number of installers trained already or  system. How much is left in the U.S. training process?
Badrinarayanan Kothandaraman: Look, I mean, we work with a couple of thousand installers in the U.S. usually and we reported numbers of 650 unique installation companies. That number we are catching up on those numbers, very fast. So we expect within a couple of quarters to basically train everyone that matters.
Moses Sutton: Got it, got it. And just one more for me and I'll jump back in the queue. What's the annualized contribution from these two recent bolt-on M&As that you -- maybe on revenue and even gross profit, if possible?
Badrinarayanan Kothandaraman: We're not going to break out those numbers right now.
Moses Sutton: Got it. Understood. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark Strouse with J.P. Morgan. Your line is now open.
Mark Strouse: Yeah, good evening. Thank you very much for taking our questions. So quite a bit has changed in a macro environment since your 3Q call. Can you just talk about how your customer conversations have changed, if at all since the ITC was extended? And then kind of a follow-up to that is -- who knows what's going to happen going forward, but if energy storage stand-alone is included in some kind of future revision to the ITC, what do you think that impact would be for Enphase? Specifically looking for retrofit activity. Thanks.
Raghu Belur: Yeah, hi, this is Raghu. Clearly change in administration is something that's very positive for us. Obviously, the first thing that happened was the ITC extension. As a result, you see all our numbers have no safe harbor in them. So that was a -- probably a very significant change that took place. With regards to some bills that are in Congress that are being worked on right now, the one that is really interesting is the one around standalone storage. And the nice thing about our architecture is the fact that we are AC coupled means that it lends itself very well to a standalone system. So the combination of a standalone storage device plus a safety device, the microgrid interconnect can now add substantial value to the homeowner both in terms of providing resiliency in the event of an outage plus -- as well as participating in value-added services such as grid services for example. One could even extend your thinking into our portable power station, but also someday we participate in that as well in terms of providing both resiliency as well as participating in value-added services. So we really are excited about the storage standalone discussions that are going on right now.
Mark Strouse: Okay.
Eric Branderiz: In terms of ITC, I think that the idea that the ITC could be extended into a storage, potentially even a cash refund, that is very appealing, right. Because think about it -- I mean homeowners, they look at payments and Badri mentioned financing. All of those things help to create adoption and as cost keeps reducing and the cost per kilowatt hour and cost per watt keeps on going down, that ramp can we accelerated, right. So we welcome those things.
Mark Strouse: Okay, thank you. And then just a follow-up to Moses's question on Sofdesk in particular. Is the idea with an acquisition -- I mean financially anyway to create stickier relationship with your customers? Or is there financial rationale for these acquisitions as well in that, kind of standalone they would meet kind of your corporate target margin profile?
Badrinarayanan Kothandaraman: Yeah. So, you got it right. We love our long tail installers, we want to give them -- we want to make it easy to do business for them. Therefore, we would like to give them -- we'd like them to stay on our platform, buy our product, buy our software, buy our permitting services and a lot more that's coming.
Mark Strouse: Okay, thank you very much.
Eric Branderiz: In terms of financially, we look at those transactions and they stand on their own feet. So rest assured that that is there.
Mark Strouse: Got it, thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Aric Li with Bank of America. Your line is now open.
Aric Li: Hey, guys. Congrats on the quarter. Just a quick question on storage  trend for revenue storage across the industry...
Eric Branderiz: Aric you got a really bad connection there.
Aric Li: Can you hear me better now?
Badrinarayanan Kothandaraman: We cannot hear you well.
Aric Li: Can you hear me better now?
Eric Branderiz: Yeah. Just keep it up top.
Badrinarayanan Kothandaraman: Slightly better.
Aric Li: Okay. First on storage. With the supply constraints across the industry right now, can you talk about your ongoing supplier discussions there? And is there any color you can provide around amount of storage capacity you would expect to expand to near-term with your third supplier beyond the two existing suppliers? And a follow-up question after that.
Badrinarayanan Kothandaraman: Okay. Yeah, so right now we have two qualified suppliers. The first one we have already ramped well with. The second one is in the process of ramping, they started shipping to us in the fourth quarter. And we said that basically in Q4, meaning the quarter that just passed, we had a supply of 50 megawatt hours. In Q3 of '21, we expect that supply between these two suppliers to go up to 120 megawatt hours. And if we find that we are short maybe by the time we get into 2022, we are already talking to a third supplier, rather multiple suppliers. And then it takes us usually anywhere from 6 to 12 months to qualify the product. We are starting those discussions right now.
Aric Li: Got it. And just to clarify, would you still expect to bring on a third supplier this year or are you saying that that's more going to contribute into 2022?
Badrinarayanan Kothandaraman: We will have a third supplier ready if we need it. So yes, we are starting those activities, that's correct.
Aric Li: Okay, thank you. And then just on the R&D cycle, are there any updates you can provide on the development of IQ 9, where that currently stands at this time? Is it still being developed or is it in testing phase? If you can provide any color there? Thank you.
Badrinarayanan Kothandaraman: Yeah, we are actually working on IQ 9 at this time. In IQ 19 our vision is basically obviously smaller, cheaper, faster, producing a lot more power than IQ 8. Right now we are focused on a few areas. One is, we'd like to see how to reduce the footprint of the transformers, the ECAPS, the 600 volt AC FET devices through some semiconductor process innovation. GaN transistors are becoming widespread, GaN on GaN, GaN on silicon, they are becoming widespread. The advantage that GaN gives is I can now run my AC FETs at a higher frequency. Because I can run it at a higher frequency, I can reduce my transformer sizes. And because I can reduce my transformer sizes the entire footprint can get a lot smaller. Of course, this is me speaking theoretically and we need to demonstrate that with both prototype vehicles as well as qualifying reliability, et cetera. I expect that to take the next 12 to 18 months. And we will also be working on the next-generation as well to think about maybe sophisticated cooling themes, alternatives to porting etc. Alternatives to meaning -- so today we have -- between our gate drivers and our AC FETs, and our DC FETs, we have a lot of components there. Using semiconductor packaging and GaN, I may be able to collapse all of those to substantially less number of components. We'll be looking at those as well. So lot of R&D is going on. We hired our CTO a year-ago, his name is Hans, he is an outstanding guy. And we have started all of those discussions and there is a team actually behind it. Whenever Eric Branderiz our CFO says innovation, he mean -- he means that investment in the CTO team. We're investing a lot more than before.
Aric Li: Got it. And one last question and I'll pass it on here. Could you just talk about any data points you can give us on traction or progress with the long tail installers in Europe? How is that training process going?
Badrinarayanan Kothandaraman: Long tail installers actually -- I mean, Europe is a great story. If you remember in the 2019 Analyst Day, I had reported that we only had five salespeople at that time in Europe. And now we have, I would say, increased, maybe quadrupled or even more, the number of sales folks. We have a great team there. That team is ramping in Netherlands, in Belgium, in France. We have recently opened up offices in Poland, Spain. We have sales and SAE teams there. We've also launched massive effort in Germany, where we are in the process of training a lot of installers and getting more and more and more installers onboard there. We will also introduce our storage solution into Europe in the third quarter. As you know, Germany is -- it's a big market, it's 1 gigawatt of PV with 80% attach rate because of the feed-in tariffs being so small. So we're very excited about that market, but having said that, it's -- say it's a matured market almost. There are a bunch of suppliers, and we have clear differentiation. It will take us a little bit of time but with our relentless focus on quality, customer experience supporting the long tail of installers, I'm sure we'll start making significant progress in that region.
Aric Li: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Colin Rusch with Oppenheimer. Your line is now open.
Colin Rusch: Thanks so much, guys. Can you give us a sense of the progress that you're making in pre-selling the IQ 8D? And the activity you've got going in the commercial market right now?
Badrinarayanan Kothandaraman: Yeah. So clearly, as we talked about IQ 8D brings lot of value into the commercial segment. Just to remind everybody the IQ 8D -- two things, one, it's got 50 -- the inverted itself has 50% higher power density and it connects to two panels into one device. And the second thing is, we are not looking at this as a -- just as a stand-alone device itself. We're looking at it as a complete end-to-end solution and we want to leverage our digital platform, everything from the design services -- the design and proposal services that come with it along with permitting package, a very sophisticated O&M system fleet management, performance tracking etc. So we're looking at bringing a complete solution set to the market. We are in alpha right now, we have alpha installs happening. We are -- the installation process is much simpler. We were doing small commercial -- we are doing small commercials with IQ 7 as well, but it's a significant improvement from IQ 7 to the IQ 8D. So lot of progress there, more to come and we will report more as we make progress.
Colin Rusch: Great. And then just in terms of thinking about the integration of generators with the storage and solar. As you guys look at the competitive landscape, can you speak to the differentiation for the grid formation functionality that you have and how long you think it will take before anyone else has a similar sort of capability out in the marketplace?
Badrinarayanan Kothandaraman: So, yeah, the generator is your question, right. So I think the generator integration is a low unique to us. We are -- for instance, so we have the microgrid interconnect device or smart switch, because of that we don't need an automatic transfers switch, which is what you typically require with a generator integration. So that function is effectively done in software for us. So just by simply the act of connecting the generator into the device, the entire system is now managed by that device and managed by the energy management system. There are a few other advantages. As a result of the way we integrate everything into the AC domain is that the generator can now run in parallel to the storage system. So what that means is, the homeowner can configure up their system and the system will automatically make decisions such as, turn on -- for example, turn on when the grid fails instantly, turn the generator on instantly as soon as a grid fails. Or for example, once a grid fails, you only turn the generator on at -- when the state of charge is at a certain level and then it turns back off when the state of charge has reached another level. Another functionality there is for example a quiet period, right. You can configure it up all that in software, you can configure it all up saying, during this time of the night, don't start generators so you can reduce noise pollution. So it's a very rich experience. You can get to see exactly how the power flow is in real-time on your app. So much, much more well-integrated one-stop-shop solution with our integrating generator into a common platform.
Colin Rusch: All right. Thanks so much, guys.
Badrinarayanan Kothandaraman: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Philip Shen with ROTH Capital Partners. Your line is now open.
Philip Shen: Hi, everyone, congrats on the strong results. My first question is on when you think you might add the second line in India. So given how low channel inventory is in the overwhelming demand, have you already made the decision to ramp up the second line? And if not, why not and what else do you need to see?
Badrinarayanan Kothandaraman: No, we have already made the decision to add a second line. To remind everybody, we have half a million microinverter capacity. We are going to invest in adding another line, which is another half a million microinverters. Basically, that will take about six months to come on board, We have -- in the meantime, we have interim sources. We have China, which is -- we have a lot of capacity there in our Fuyong plant. Then we have Guard. Guard just reached a million microinverters and we are going to be investing in Guard as well in order for us to create a lot more capacity. Because what we see is, with IQ 8 going to come very soon in one to two quarters, we do see the necessity to increase our capacity. We are going to be working on it.
Philip Shen: Okay. Thanks, Badri. So when do you expect the second line in India to come online, maybe fully, and by the end of the year, if you add up all the capacity, China, Mexico, India, what is the quarterly run rate you think we're at, maybe in Q4?
Badrinarayanan Kothandaraman: Well, on the India specific question, I would say, six months. On a number for your overall capacity by the end of the year, I -- this is not about demand, this is about purely capacity and so I would say between 4 million and 5 million units per quarter is what we'll be prepared for.
Philip Shen: Okay, great. And then as relates to international, I think on the last quarter you talked about and by the end of this year, getting to 70%-30% U.S. international mix would be reasonable and you'd be perhaps even disappointed if you weren't there. What's your latest view on that mix, and what do you think it ends up being by the end of the year?
Badrinarayanan Kothandaraman: Right. We threw a curve ball in it by shipping the storage systems, which are entirely U.S. Now we have to ship the international system -- storage systems. In addition to ramping on the solar systems, we'll be doing exactly that. So 70%-30% maybe by the end of this year may be tough. But definitely, middle of next year, I see it as a possibility.
Philip Shen: Okay, great. Thanks, Badri. I'll pass it on.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Eric Stine with Craig Hallum. Your line is now open.
Eric Stine: Hi, everyone. Maybe just on -- given the really strong free cash flow, I mean your cash balance will soon be pushing $1 billion. I mean just on capital allocation, are there any areas on the acquisition front? And I know you've made a few seem like they're more strategic on the small side. Any acquisitions or areas in your business that might make sense from that perspective or is this more about just sticking with product development and organic growth?
Eric Branderiz: I mean, both are going to be critical. The challenge with organic growth is that we also generate cash way more because our framework that we have. So the acquisition approach is going to be very active. We have a lot of things that we need to complement our digital platform. Actually Raghu and Adam, both of them are working around the clock. With our pipeline very healthy, the pipeline of M&A acquisitions, Badri is also -- has his own set of rules in which we need to find the right candidates or targets. So, we -- that's going to be a very active area, so you should see more throughout the year.
Eric Stine: Yeah, Eric, okay. Any other details on, maybe not, but any details on areas that you think -- I mean I guess you mentioned the digital platform, but I mean anything, whether it's new geographies or just thinking about potential pass you may take.
Raghu Belur: Yeah, so I think internally we have a -- we have very clear view on what our long-term strategy is for how we're going to continue growing our business, right. We are talking about -- we've talked about this in the past, where we think about every home as being a micro-grid and then interconnecting microgrids and forming pools of microgrids and transacting energy across them. We talk about the significant electrification of homes that are going to happen, which will further increase the demand in electrification between all the appliances getting electrified, EV etc. So while we can't provide you specifics, we have an -- we have had, as Eric mentioned, a healthy pipeline of area that we are looking at, but that should give you some context about how we are thinking about our M&A plans. It's both a digital -- the digital transformation piece as well as product in order to meet our -- what we have with our strategic vision.
Eric Branderiz: And there are no confines on companies within the space, right. So we are thinking now is expanding that into other sectors, software and other areas. So it's a very, very diversified pipeline from multiple sources, right.
Raghu Belur: And it's international as well. So just as he's saying, the two of the -- two acquisitions we have done, neither of those are actually in the U.S., but we are looking across the world, yeah.
Eric Branderiz: And the other one is the ability of the company to absorb and integrate those acquisitions is going to be very important. So I feel very confident on Jeff McNeil's organization, in the finance organization, we are used to deal with acquisitions integration so it will be a very active place in 2021.
Eric Stine: Yeah, no, that's very helpful. Maybe just last one from me. Just thoughts on updating the target operating model. I'm trying to think how many quarters it took for you to go from 30%, 20%,10% to the new 35%, 15%, 20%, I mean you're now at the 40%, 15%, 25%, I mean, any thoughts on how long you'd like to see that sustained before you officially update that?
Eric Branderiz: Yeah, I mean we want to make sure that we conservatively provide a baseline and that's what we did, with the frame -- the existing framework. When you're launching new products and you are entering new markets, a lot of things happen. And when you are planning on the long-term, that's the right framework, right. In the short-term, the midpoint of the guidance of the current quarter that we are guiding is the responsible thing in the short -- mid-short term. But for the long-term, I think that framework is cash generating. Remember, we've got an OpEx to CapEx and other call slide business model in the company, right. We don't have manufacturing plans, our CapEx is going to be higher this year, but at the same time, we can continue operating with the control manufacturing approach. So this framework should stay like that until you can afford to get an update when we do Analyst Day, if there is an update.
Eric Stine: Okay, thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jim Ricchiuti with Needham & Company. Your line is now open.
James Ricchiuti: Hi, thank you. Good afternoon. I know it's early days for storage, but I'm just wondering -- given what you're seeing in terms of demand trends in the competitive landscape and I guess, potentially a more supportive government policy initiatives. I'm just wondering how you -- is this changing your view of how pricing might be trending in the market looking out over the next year or so?
Raghu Belur: I think our view is -- when it comes to things like particularly around pricing etc. and the trend, our view is, we have to continually add value, right. So what that means is that, it's not just thinking about storage as a widget or a storage as a battery, right. it has to be and it is an integral part of a complete solution -- an energy management solution that includes a solar, that includes storage, how does the whole thing -- entire system integrate, load management, generator integration. You saw we have -- you have seen the announcement where we are working with the fuel cell company, etc. So for us it's not about a specific widget and a specific widgets pricing, that's really not how we think about it. We think about it in terms of how can we do the complete solution and add value for our installer partners and the homeowner.
James Ricchiuti: Okay. Fair enough. And is -- should we anticipate any change as we think about the mix with respect to storage long tail installers and your Tier 1, Tier 2 installers over the next one year or so?
Raghu Belur: No.
Badrinarayanan Kothandaraman: I think what we have today is right.
James Ricchiuti: Okay. Thanks very much.
Raghu Belur: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Maheep Mandloi with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.
Maheep Mandloi: Hi, thanks for taking the questions. Badri, maybe this question's for you. On the storage product you did say that there's some delays in installation as you -- it's taking time to train the installers. That seems to be more applicable to also with your other competitors, so just wanted to understand if you are seeing that for other products launched by your competitors in the market as well, or is there something specific to Encharge solution, which is impacting those delays?
Badrinarayanan Kothandaraman: I'm not going to comment on the other competitors, but our -- we take pride in supporting our long tail installers. Many of them may not even have done storage once, but they have a lot of demand as you can expect. And our job is to train them so that they can start doing storage installs seamlessly. Right now, we introduced this product in July. As of the end of December, 360 plus long tail installers, unique installation companies have installed one Enphase Storage system, that's a major win for us. We continue to add 10 to 15 installers every week, there. We have trained over 650 plus unique installation companies again. That's also a win, but I'm sure we can amp our game up there, because there are thousands of installers and I'm sure we can do a better job there, which we will be focused on. In terms of the people, assuming every installer has got at least two people to train, we have trained roughly over 1,200 folks. So I would say it's -- we do things -- we have a unique business model. We focus on the long tail. Our job is to make that installation smooth and seamless, that's what we will do, it's a long-term game. And we're not going to take away off the ball there.
Maheep Mandloi: Got you. Thanks for the explanation. And just on the new acquisitions and the digital strategy. Could you maybe talk about like what's the goal here in terms of reducing that soft cost? I think couple in the solar developers have talked about $7,000, $8,000 per customer of soft costs. So is the idea here to kind of like bring it down similar to probably what the soft cost is in Europe and Australia, or what's your thinking process here? And have just a quick follow-up after that as well. Thanks.
Raghu Belur: Yeah. So, soft cost is an outcome of what our goal is, our goal is to provide our installers partners with the best service possible. And so it's our partners actually, as well as the homeowner. So we have mapped out a very detailed journey of both how the entire installation process as well for both the installers as well as our homeowners, starting with leads all the way through design proposal, permitting, procurement, commissioning, installation commissioning, permission to operate O&M, etc. And so if we do an amazing job on that where we create a very powerful platform and these acquisitions that we're talking about are important elements of that journey, then I think the natural outcome of that is going to be reduction in the soft cost. But we are starting with a very clear focus that this is about bringing great value for our long-tail installer partners.
Eric Branderiz: So Maheep this has been a focus of the industry for quite a long time. And everybody here it takes back into the easiest part of the value chain, which is reduce the cost of the panel, reduce the cost of the hardware, things that there are easy or tangible. When you're thinking about, for example simplifying and streamlining, permitting, you are talking about multiple counties, multiple different approaches, different timing, different locations. So is a much more complex problem to tackle and that's the problem that we are tackling. And as Raghu said it, we are tackling by understanding the problem from the standard point of view and solving that individual problem. And that incorporates pretty much every aspect of lead-gen all the way through commission and post that, the O&M process right, which we are digitizing in many fronts, right. And these acquisitions basically fill those gaps.
Raghu Belur: Yeah.
Maheep Mandloi: Got it. No, that's helpful. And then just last one, just housekeeping. So the megawatts shipped in the quarter, does that include microinverters shipped to the storage product as well, or that's just for the solar shipments?
Raghu Belur: We will have to get back to you on that. I think right now, my off-the-cuff answer is, it basically only includes the microinverters that are pure solar and it does not include the microinverters inside the batteries. But we will have to get back to you on that.
Maheep Mandloi: All right. Thanks for taking questions.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Joseph Osha with JMP Securities. Your line is now open.
Joseph Osha: Hi, there. Thanks for taking my question. I've got two completely unrelated questions. The first relates to dorms management as regards your storage business, you've kind of alluded to this a little bit Badri. We've seen Enbala get sold, AMS get sold then go out. Might we see you make an investment in sort of the software infrastructure to really offer a fully integrated dorms capability to your customers with the utilities?
Raghu Belur: So obviously we won't talk specifics, but in general here's our view. Clearly, we see that with a value added service any time with every single storage system that you sell. So given that and given that we already have a pretty powerful platform, I think our first step is ensure that at least that we have partnerships with -- that we can fit into existing platforms that are out there. There are number of people who are out there will fit into those platforms. There are number of programs, whether that's in the East Coast or even here in California that we can participate in those programs as we continue our ramp on storage. And I think for us it's a pretty natural extension on weather -- on how to incorporate what's called coordination of these DERs and management of these coordinated DERs onto our platform. I think that's a pretty natural extension for us.
Joseph Osha: Okay. And so that's interesting. You would not have a problem say, making sure that you operate well with AutoGrid or somebody like that?
Badrinarayanan Kothandaraman: Absolutely, if there are existing programs we would do it. Yes.
Joseph Osha: Okay.
Badrinarayanan Kothandaraman: There are -- in fact -- in cases etc. is getting standardized anyway.
Joseph Osha: And then the second completely unrelated question is, it's interesting hearing you talk about wide bandgap FETs, can we imagine a world where all of the high energy MOSFETs in your device or GaN or I was kind of surprised you didn't mentioned silicon carbide, is that the way this is headed?
Badrinarayanan Kothandaraman: No, I did not mention silicon carbide. GaN is -- I think we think GaN is the way to go, but obviously we are only scratching the surface. We're working with a few companies. GaN on GaN, and GaN on silicon are two interesting technologies. They will help us reduce our footprint, support high-power. I mean, everything that we want.
Joseph Osha: So I guess -- just overtime we -- and I assume obviously, at the moment you're probably silicon overtime, we can reasonably expect to see those individual little high-power sockets probably go wide bandgap over the next couple of years. Is that the idea?
Badrinarayanan Kothandaraman: Yeah.
Raghu Belur: Yeah.
Joseph Osha: All right, thank you so much.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Sameer Joshi with HC Wainwright, your line is now open.
Sameer Joshi: Thanks. Thanks for taking my questions. Just a couple, digging into the storage. In terms of sort of bottlenecks or headwinds, do you see it more from like a slow draining of installations -- installers or is it because the customers are not educated enough, or maybe pricing is not right. And a corollary question is, do you find the Encharge 3 versus Encharge 10 demand different? And do you see any change in sizing of the products going forward?
Badrinarayanan Kothandaraman: No, like what I told earlier maybe even I answered Brian Lee's question, I went through the details. So let me cover them once again. Basically, there are several things that can go wrong for the installers on storage. There are some things that we are squarely responsible for Enphase. Like the installers want to come on to a job site and they want to finish their install and they want to leave within 12 hours. And if our commissioning time is excessive, we are going to place burden on installers, and we understand that. We are working with them to rapidly reduce that commissioning time, as an example. The second one is, very often installers have to come in and rewire the main panel and that is often several thousands of dollars. If we can help them create a solution, which does not need that, that's ease of doing business for the installers. That's number two. Number three, as homeowners start to experience these storage systems, they are going to be calling installers often. For example, when you switch from on-grid to off-grid if you haven't made any adjustments in your lifestyle, and your grid is out -- your external grid is out, utility grid is out, then you're going to quickly run out of storage in three or four hours because your air conditioner is going to be on. So therefore, people who do not even know that they are off-grid run out of storage they are out of power and they call installers and the installers have to go and help them. It's another -- a truck rule for them that means lost profit for them. So how can Enphase help there in order to eliminate all of those problems for installers? Make it so easy that and an Enphase system seamlessly provides intelligent notification for homeowners. How can an Enphase system seamlessly provide load control such that the homeowner can automatically set in the app saying, when I switch to off-grid do not turn on my AC? So you maximize your storage system's life, right. And then going back to it all is even when the storage system is being designed in the first place as a consultative sale between the homeowner and the installer, what can Enphase do is to make sure that complete transparency to the homeowner, so that it's simple, yet complete. And I think those are things that are entirely in Enphase's control and it would be remiss if we don't take responsibility there, that's one. Then I talked about the industry, overall industry. Overall industry there are problems with permitting cycle times are too long. It's not acceptable. And we all need to -- our peers all need to fight that battle. And the last one is the -- just as financing for solar is getting a lot more mature, financing for storage needs to attain that maturity. And then what happens is you start -- more people will start to -- they're comfortable with monthly payments, than cash -- yeah, cash upfront -- lot of cash upfront. So those two are industry problems that we'll be working on. So it's a combo of Enphase specific stuff which we are going to put a lot of energy on, and industry changes that we are going to try to influence. Those are the things we need to do in order to any -- in order to ensure we start ramping much more than our already nice ramp round -- now.
Sameer Joshi: Understood. Thanks for that.
Eric Branderiz: So Sameer. These are the -- many of the comments made by Badri are not unique to Enphase. We are approaching this like we are training installers that they never done an installation before, storage and they're doing really well with microinverter so, for them to say initial component or might salvage a new product convince the homeowner that in the -- this a great product. And then when they do that, after that, we get everything lined up with the crews, with the commissioning and do installation, completed training, and everything, it takes time, right. And right now, they are basically hand-to-mouth with the microinverter systems, right. So, we decided to launch with the long tail, that's an investment that we are making. Once they made the investment using our system, we believe they will have a hard time switching to a potential alternative, because they are all trained, they know our technologies, they know our pitch. And then -- with that, concurrently, we have interest from Tier 2s and in Tier 1s that they are sophisticated, they've done installs before. They've kind of completed the process with competitive products and they feel our product will be an easy trade, right. So, all of those things are being affected at the same time.
Sameer Joshi: Yeah, no, it's certainly commendable actually that you have identified the exact problems that you're facing, sort of the teething troubles, and are actively addressing those. That's encouraging. Just switching gears a little bit, you mentioned that in your Q1 outlook the DNI  revenues are not included. I thought that DNI was some sort of a back-office kind of a support for your -- improving your operational performance as against revenue-generating source. Am I looking at it wrong?
Badrinarayanan Kothandaraman: Yes, you're not right. DIN basically provides permitting services to installers, for revenue. In addition to permitting services, they also provide design and proposal services. The whole point is how can installers get the right paperwork, permit plan sets in 24 hours. Once again, it is -- for us the fit is obvious because that's what we care about. Anything that our long tail installers care about, we care about even more.
Sameer Joshi: Right, right. And then last one, over the last several years you have -- had several instances of these supply constraints. And now that you are sitting on 700 -- approximately $700 million, is there any effort towards going upstream?
Badrinarayanan Kothandaraman: No, I mean, we're very clear. We're going to be CapEx light, OpEx light. In this case, this was because we never expected such a massive increase in demand coming out of the pandemic. Now, maybe we should have, but we didn't, and obviously it's because our product is well received. The high quality -- I've always told you to target is 500 DPPM and great customer experience. Those are our mantras. And we didn't anticipate the -- such a big increase. And so we are somewhat constrained because of that. But having said that, it's not as severe as what we had in the past and I think we are looking at adjustments in the way we run the company going forward on how to not allow situations like this to happen. That's what we do. We learn from our mistakes, and we are going to put in the right business processes. But there's no need to change our approach, it's a capital-light approach.
Sameer Joshi: Thanks for taking the question.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Biju Perincheril with Susquehanna. Your line is now open.
Biju Perincheril: Thank you. Thanks for taking my question. Obviously, very early in the rollout of the storage product, but from the initial trend -- demand trends that you're seeing, any thoughts on what level of attachment rates we can see looking out a few years, three or five years to?
Badrinarayanan Kothandaraman: When we refrained talking about attached rate, we actually gave you megawatt-hours, which is a lot better than attached rate, so you can calculate the attach rate. Because it's a complex function of the states you are in. For example, the storage may be more popular in California than in some other state. So the metrics are different. So we cannot just talk about attach rate without any context, which is why we gave you megawatt-hours. So I would not like to talk about attach rates, I'd like to talk about megawatt-hours. And like what we talked about, we are growing at a steady clip Q3 to Q4, 35%, Q4 to Q1 expect a similar rate and that -- that's what -- that's the progress we are making on megawatt hours.
Biju Perincheril: On megawatt-hours, is there a number that we can sort of target looking out a few years or do you have that when you just lend -- low mid-term guidance?
Badrinarayanan Kothandaraman: It's hard for us. Right now this product is in the early stages of brand. It's hard for us to give a number right now. It'll take us a few more quarters.
Biju Perincheril: That's fair. Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. I'm not showing any further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the call back over to Badri Kothandaraman for closing remarks.
Badrinarayanan Kothandaraman: Thank you for joining us today and for your continued support of Enphase. We look forward to speaking with you again in the next quarter. Thank you.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

===== 2020 Q3  (2020-10-28 16:30:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Enphase Energy Third Quarter 2020 Financial Results Conference Call. . I'd now like to hand the conference over to your host today, Mr. Adam Hinckley. Please go ahead, sir.
Adam Hinckley: Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us on today's conference call to discuss Enphase Energy's third quarter 2020 results. On today's call are Badri Kothandaraman, Enphase's President and Chief Executive Officer; Eric Branderiz, Chief Financial Officer; and Raghu Belur, Chief Products Officer.  After the market closed today, Enphase issued a press release announcing the results for its third quarter ended September 30, 2020. During this conference call, Enphase management will make forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, statements related to Enphase Energy's expected future financial performance, the availability of components and manufacturing capacity, the availability and market adoption of our products, the performance of the tools we make available to and the capabilities of our installation partners, safe harbor shipments, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and expected regulatory changes.  These forward-looking statements involve significant risks and uncertainties and Enphase Energy's actual results and the timing of events could differ materially from these expectations. For a more complete discussion of the risks and uncertainties, please see the company's annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019, which is on file with the SEC and quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the third quarter ended September 30, 2020, which will be filed during the fourth quarter of 2020. Enphase Energy cautions you not to place any undue reliance on forward-looking statements and undertakes no duty or obligation to update any forward-looking statement as a result of new information, future events or changes in its expectations. Also, please note that financial measures used on this call are expressed on a non-GAAP basis unless otherwise noted and have been adjusted to exclude certain charges. The company has provided a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures in its earnings release posted today, which can also be found in the Investor Relations section of its website. Now I'd like to introduce Badri Kothandaraman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Enphase Energy. Badri?
Badrinarayanan Kothandaraman: Good afternoon, and thanks for joining us today to discuss our third quarter 2020 financial results. I hope all of you are staying safe and healthy. Our team continues to do a great job managing the impact of COVID on our business. We reported revenue of $178.5 million, shipped approximately 1.4 million microinverters, achieved record non-GAAP gross margin of 41% and generated strong free cash flow of $63.6 million. Our non-GAAP gross margin excluded a $23 million refund on tariffs, which we previously paid on microinverters imported to the U.S. from China.  In addition, we began volume shipments of our Encharge storage system to customers in North America. We exited the third quarter at approximately 41%, 17%, 24%. This means 41% gross margin, 17% operating expenses and 24% operating income, all as a percentage of revenue on a non-GAAP basis. As a reminder, our baseline financial model is 35%, 15%, 20%. I'm happy to report that our worldwide demand significantly improved in Q3. I'm proud that our employees continue to do an excellent job during the pandemic while working from home.  I'm also thankful for the strong support from our suppliers, customers and partners worldwide. Due to these combined efforts, we were able to increase our Q3 revenue by 42%, sequentially. Let's talk about how we are servicing customers. Our customer experience personnel in all 4 worldwide locations: U.S., Europe, India and Australia are still working from home, supporting installers and homeowners. We have not missed a beat as our systems are cloud-based. Our Q3 NPS was 67%, and our North America NPS was 71%. Our average call wait time increased in Q3 to more than 3 minutes as the steep growth in installations resulted in more calls from installers and homeowners. In addition, the launch of Encharge storage system during Q3 created more calls as our installers were learning how to install the product.  We are working hard this quarter to bring back the call wait times under a minute by hiring additional customer support personnel and improving self-help services through enhanced installer toolkit, chat functionality on the Enlighten app and the online Enphase community.  Let's now discuss manufacturing. With the increased demand, we ramped production back up in Q3 and expect higher levels of production in Q4. Our factory in Mexico is doing well, producing more than 75,000 microinverters per week, putting us on track to achieve our target of 1 million units from Mexico in the fourth quarter of 2020. As I discussed on last quarter's call, we have completed the qualification of Salcomp, our second contract manufacturing partner for microinverters based in India. We began microinverter production at Salcomp earlier this month, and we are expecting to start shipping to customers later in the quarter. We have a high-quality state of the art automated line with quarterly production capacity of 0.5 million units and have the space to add a second line with the same capacity. This is our second tariff free manufacturing location for microinverters after Flex, Mexico.  In terms of battery capacity, we qualified our second supplier, ATL, a leading global supplier of lithium-ion batteries based in China. ATL provides the cells and their subsidiary, Poweramp Technology Limited, provides the cell pack. We will be taking first deliveries from ATL late this quarter. And when A123, our first qualified cell pack supplier and ATL are fully ramped up in the first half of 2021, it will bring our available capacity to 480-megawatt hours a year.  Moving on to the regions. Our U.S. and international revenue mix for Q3 was 78% and 22%, respectively. We saw sequential revenue growth in all regions during the quarter despite COVID-19. the U.S. market rebounded pretty nicely in the third quarter. Revenue was up 39% sequentially, partially aided by Encharge storage system shipments. In addition, sell-through from our distribution partners were particular -- was particularly strong for microinverters, reaching new records. The sell-through in the month of September was 49% higher than in the month of June. Due to the record sell-through, we ended our -- we ended Q3 with our microinverter channel inventory slightly lesser than our target range of 8 to 10 weeks. We started production shipments of Encharge storage systems to installers in the U.S. during Q3. 528 installer personnel have completed online courses to achieve provisional certification in Q3. The demand for the product is strong and feedback from the installers and homeowners is positive as they appreciate its modularity, reliability and safety.  It is important to note that Encharge storage systems contributed about 10% of our overall revenue in Q3. We were constrained by new product introduction ramp in Q3 and are looking forward to easing this constraint as our suppliers ramp up their deliveries. In Europe, our revenue increased nicely by 67%, sequentially. We added several new installers and distributors during the quarter, including top distributors in Belgium and Netherlands. We are well staffed in Europe and are continuing to hire as we see opportunities.  We launched the IQ 7A microinverter, our highest power product in Europe during Q3. We announced a strategic partnership with Sonnenstromfabrik to develop a high-efficiency, Enphase energized AC module with IQ 7+ microinverters. In addition, we expect to ship our IQ 7A microinverters for Maxeon's AC modules this quarter. I'm pleased with our team's performance in Europe, and I'm excited about the region's projected growth.  In Australia, we achieved record quarterly sell-through and installer found despite COVID restrictions in Metropolitan Melbourne. We introduced the IQ 7A microinverter similar to Europe. And this IQ 7A microinverter's ideal and cost-effective for high-power panels up to 450 watts. We also expect to ship IQ 7A microinverters to Maxeon starting this quarter. On the policy front, the South Australian government's, new rooftop solar installation rules, present a favorable competitive environment and hint to the future regulatory landscape for solar nationwide. Not only we are fully compliant with South Australia's new regulations, but we also remain one of the few inverter manufacturers who have submitted test reports as evidence.  Revenue from Latin America increased sequentially quarter-on-quarter. In Latin America, Puerto Rico witnessed a strong rebound in activity during Q3. We expect continued growth in this region due to our Encharge storage systems. Activity in Mexico also started to rebound well. In September, we were honored to welcome the U.S. ambassador to Mexico, Christophe Orlando to our Made In Mexico event, where he received the tour of the Flex manufacturing facility in Guadalajara, along with an overview of Enphase as an investment in Mexico. Now that we covered the regions, let's discuss the overall bookings for the quarter.  At this point, we are already 100% booked to the midpoint of Q4 revenue guidance. We cannot predict how COVID-19 is going to play out in November or December, so that's always a risk. However, we feel very good about the progress we are making and the demand that we are seeing for both microinverters and Encharge. Resiliency is top of mind for people working from home.  Let's talk a little bit about our Encharge system rollout. We started shipping the product in July after extensive alpha and beta testing. We introduced online training and certification in July for our long tail installers. We had our engineering -- field application engineers and customer service teams working around the clock to support the installations. We had a few issues early on, which were solved relatively quickly. But in general, the rollout has been pretty smooth. We have developed metrics and dashboards to track problems reported by installers and homeowners and are making them highly visible across the company.  We are treating every issue that a homeowner or installer reports as a defect. I'm really proud of the tremendous progress our teams have made in a very short amount of time. We have always been very clear that long tail installers are our #1 priority. We see them acting as consultants to homeowners and influence their buying decisions. Many of these installers are doing their first storage installations. Therefore, the cycle of learning is understandably high. Our job is to make the entire process seamless and quick in the installation for the installer. Within the first few weeks of the product rollout, we have identified a few things to iron out in the installation process and are laser-focused on leaning out the process to maximize the installers' productivity.  We expect to get this activity done in the fourth quarter through software upgrades to our Enlighten platform, both on the installer as well as homeowner apps. I would now like to provide some color on our battery cell pack supply. In Q4, this quarter, we have approximately 50-megawatt hours coming from A123 Systems, and we have customer orders for most of that capacity. We expect to start shipping Encharge storage systems with ATL battery packs only in the first quarter of 2021. We expect A123 to be fully ramped in Q1 '21 and ATL at to be fully ramped by the end of Q2 '21, positioning us with full capacity in the back half of 2021.  The reception from our long tail installers has been very encouraging. However, these customers are going to take some time to scale as more and more of them get trained and finish their first few installations. We are receiving a lot of interest for Encharge storage systems from Tier 1 and Tier 2 installers and have been working very closely with these important customers. Our philosophy on value-based pricing is unchanged here. And we are confident that larger installers will see a benefit that our product and platform brings. We will share updates on these developments as and when appropriate. Let's talk about our upcoming products and features.  Our Encharge storage system is compatible to the installed base of IQ 6 and IQ 7 microinverters on the roof. This corresponds to more than 300,000 homes. On our last earnings call, we discussed making the Encharge storage system compatible with the installed base of M-Series microinverters on the roof. This adds another 300,000 homes to our third available market. We expect to release a software upgrade in Q4 this quarter to make this happen and already have alpha systems running today.  The other feature is generator integration, once again made possible through the power of Ensemble. We expect to allow various generators to be plugged into our Enpower smart switch, obviating the need for a separate generator ATS. Our Enlighten mobile app will seamlessly integrate the generator functionality, providing a single comprehensive view of all distributed energy resources to the homeowner. We expect this feature to be released through Enlighten in Q1 '21.  We are making great progress on launching IQ 8, our grid agnostic solar microinverter. We already have IQ 8 alpha systems with and without Encharge storage systems installed at various sites. As a reminder, IQ 8 is the world's first grid independent microinverter. We expect to complete beta installations on this system in the first quarter of 2021. Our small commercial product, the 640 Watts, AC IQ 8D microinverter is also making good progress. The design and reliability testing of the microinverter is already complete. The focus is now shifting on full system testing and performing diligent alpha and beta testing.  Similar to IQ 8, we expect beta installations on the IQ 8D system in Q1 of 2021. Let's now briefly cover digital transformation.  Our approach here is pretty simple, to provide a great experience for homeowners and installers through a comprehensive digital platform. Installers can leverage the platform to accelerate the installation process and improve the homeowner experience. We have onboarded more than 400 installers in North America to our Enphase installer network through a highly selective process focused on installation quality and homeowner experience. These installers can benefit from Enphase lead generation, priority access to new products, and a variety of tools on the digital platform to make the installation more efficient. Regarding tools, we are currently piloting permitting services for installers and has shipped application services for homeowners.  We are working on introducing more tools in the near future, namely for solar and storage design, financing as well as grid services. In summary, we are pleased with our results for the third quarter. We are excited about the rebound of customer demand worldwide. As we look to close the year, we are focused on ramping Encharge storage systems while providing a superior customer experience, introducing the new products, which I talked about and accelerating our digital transformation.  As always, the health and safety of our employees, customers, suppliers and partners remains our topmost priority. With that, I will hand the call over to Eric for his review of our finances. Eric?
Eric Branderiz: Thanks, Badri, and good afternoon, everyone. I will provide more details related to our third quarter of 2020 financial results as well as our business outlook for the fourth quarter of 2020. We have provided a reconciliation of these non-GAAP to GAAP financial measures in our earnings release posted today, which also can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website.  During the third quarter of 2020, we had our first significant revenue and margin contribution from Encharge storage system sales. This reflects the beginning of a new era in Enphase history, which allows homeowners to begin in their journey towards full home electrification and energy independence. Nothing is more exciting that successfully introducing an industry-leading software-defined product to the market while continuing to support our profitable growth. We are also very pleased with the rebound in microinverter demand and our distribution charged channel management, despite the impact of the pandemic in the third quarter of 2020. As I will discuss later in our fourth quarter guidance, we remain focused and on track for continued profitability.  Total revenue for the third quarter of 2020 was $178.5 million, which did not include any revenue from safe harbor shipments during the quarter. Total revenue increased 42% sequentially, and we shipped approximately 478 megawatts DC in the third quarter of 2020. We are very pleased to have returned to year-over-year revenue growth after excluding safe harbor revenue from the prior year despite the challenging microeconomic environment resulting from the bad pandemic. As we discussed on our last earnings call, certain of our microinverter products met an exclusion to the Section 301 tariffs that we have been paying on imports to the U.S. from our China contract manufacturing since September 24, 2018. The fact that our microinverter met certain size and weight conditions for exclusion is a testament to our product innovation. We requested refunds totaling approximately $39 million plus accruing interest, of which $23 million were approved so far and have been accounted for as a reduction in cost of goods sold in the third quarter of 2020.  We have already collected $60 million to date and have excluded tariff refunds from non-GAAP financial results to present a more accurate picture of ongoing business performance. The Section 301 tariffs exclusion expired on August 7, 2020, once again, making those microinverter products subject to tariffs.  Non-GAAP gross margin for the third quarter of 2020, which included our first significant contribution from Encharge storage system sales and excluded the $23 million tariff refund was a record 41% compared to 39.6% for the second quarter of 2020. The record gross margin was achieved despite ramping production of the Encharge storage systems. We're generating a healthy gross margin for the quarter. The sequential improvement was driven by stable pricing on microinverters and continued cost reduction efforts. GAAP gross margin was 53.2% for the third quarter of 2020. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $29.6 million for the third quarter of 2020 compared to $26 million for the second quarter of 2020. The sequential increase was primarily due to engineering and regional staff headcount additions to support our innovation and growth.  Overall, we hired 113 new employees during the third quarter. GAAP operating expenses were $43.2 million for the third quarter of 2020 compared to $37.5 million for the second quarter of 2020. GAAP operating expenses for the third quarter of 2020 included $13.1 million of stock-based compensation expenses due to higher head count and $546,000 of amortization expenses for acquired intangible assets. Our non-GAAP basis -- on a longer basis, income from operations was $43.7 million for the third quarter of 2020 compared to $23.7 million for the second quarter of 2020. On a GAAP basis, income from operations was $51.8 million for the third quarter of 2020. On a non-GAAP basis, net income for the third quarter of 2020 was $41.8 million compared to $23.5 million for the second quarter of 2020. This resulted in diluted earnings per share of $0.30 for the third quarter of 2020 compared to $0.17 for the second quarter of 2020.  GAAP net income for the third quarter of 2020 was $39.4 million compared to GAAP net loss of $47.3 million for the second quarter of 2020. Just to remind everybody, due to GAAP -- Q2 GAAP's net loss was driven by a noncash charge in fair value of derivatives related to our convertible notes due 2025. The derivatives where we measured at fair value, and we classified to additional paying capital on the balance sheet in the second quarter of 2020, resulting in no income statement impact in Q3 '20 or future periods. GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.28 for the third quarter of 2020 compared to diluted loss per share of $0.38 for the second quarter of 2020. Now turning to the balance sheet and the working capital front.  Inventory was $37.5 million at the end of Q3 2020 compared to $31.2 million at the end of Q2 2020. Base of inventory outstanding, excluding the $23 million tariff credit decreased to 32 days compared to 37 days in Q2. The sequential dollar increase in inventory was driven by the purchase of battery sales for the projected increased shipments of Encharge in Q4 '20 to support our new product ramp as well as, to a lesser extent, a higher level of microinverter shipments. Accounts receivable were $122.4 million at the end of Q3 '20 compared to $89.5 million at the end of Q2 '20. The sequential increase was due to the higher revenue in Q3. DSO of 52 days increased slightly from 50 days in the prior quarter. We exited the third quarter of 2020 with a total cash balance $661.8 million compared to $607.3 million for the second quarter of 2020. We did not make any share repurchase against our $200 million share repurchase authorization.  However, we spent $52 million on withhold to cover past transactions year-to-date through September 30 on employee stock vesting that prevented the issuance of approximately 1.2 million shares. We generated $67.5 million in cash flow from operations and $63.6 million of adjusted free cash flow for the third quarter of 2020. Capital expenditure was $3.9 million for Q3 '20, mainly for the Encharge battery manufacturing capacity in Greece, IT enhancements, Enlighten software app development costs and production ramp with our second contract manufacturing partner.  Now let's discuss our outlook for the fourth quarter of 2020. We expect our revenue for the fourth quarter of 2020 to be within a range of $245 million to $260 million. Our revenue guidance does not include any safe harbor shipments. Turning to margins, an additional $16 million of tariff refunds has been requested, but not yet approved. As a result, both our GAAP and non-GAAP guidance for the fourth quarter excludes any tariff refunds. We expect GAAP gross margin to be within a range of 37% to 40% and non-GAAP gross margin within a range of 38% to 41%, which excludes the stock-based compensation expenses. We expect our GAAP operating expenses to be within a range of $51 million to $54 million, including a total of approximately $16 million estimated for stock-based compensation expenses and acquisition-related amortization. We expect non-GAAP operating expenses to be within a range of $35 million to $38 million. The sequential increase in operating expenses is due to continuous hire to support our growth plans and the expectation of resuming bonus accruals and payments, which have not occurred during the past two quarters.  Before opening the call to questions, I would like to discuss the potential for safe harbor shipments. Discussions around safe harbor shipments have picked up recently, and there may be some modest tech hardware sales in the first quarter of 2021. Exact magnitude is still uncertain, but it will be a fraction of the $44.5 million safe harbor revenue in the first quarter of 2020. Recall that to satisfy the safe harbor provisions, customers will have to pay deliver before the year-end or prepay for this product before year-end.  With that, I will now open the line for questions.
Operator: . Our first question comes from Aric Li with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Aric Li: Congrats on the quarter. So first off here, maybe to touch upon Encharge a bit more. You mentioned that this was about 10% of third quarter revenue. Could you talk about how much volume on a megawatt hour basis was ship for Encharge? And perhaps what the gross margin associated with that segment might be tracking at?
Badrinarayanan Kothandaraman: Yes. We have been very clear that Encharge will fall in line with our corporate gross margin target, which is 35%, 15%, 20%. And then we are not breaking out the mega -- the exact megawatt hours but what we have done for you is I told you that it is about 10% of revenue. And also, we have given Q4 capacity, saying that we have Q4 capacity of 50-megawatt hours, and we are mostly booked to it.
Aric Li: Okay. Got you. No worries if you can't provide further granularity there yet at this time. Could you talk about what your expectations for battery capacity on a forward basis might be? I know you talked about the 480-megawatt hours, but I believe you have mentioned a third supplier in mid-2021. How should we think about the potential capacity increase associated with that? Or is that something still up for determination based on how demand trends into that decision?
Badrinarayanan Kothandaraman: We obviously need to look at how demand is going to come, but to simply answer your question, we -- from Q3 onwards, we will be at a capacity of 120-megawatt hours a quarter with our current 2 suppliers, which is A123 and ATL. Then from then onwards, we are talking to a third supplier of batteries. And right now, the plans are in solid, we will share those plans with you when they are finalized, but we expect to have somebody on board by the end of 2021, a third supplier.
Eric Branderiz: Remember that the supplier information that we are providing is contextualizing our capacity availability in the event of demand being available, right? So it's not a statement of demand, it's a statement of supply. Also, remember that we are CapEx and OpEx flex because we use contract manufacturing. So we are in a great position here to flex that capacity up and down as we consider the demand into the future. And finally, I don't know if you remember, we always talk about having a 36% surge capacity available that has -- also is including in the number that Badri just mentioned that we need to have in case the demand remains very strong, right? So all of those things are baked into the number that you just heard from Badri as we ramp our capacity exiting this quarter.
Aric Li: Okay. And one last question for me, and I'll jump back into the queue here. Could you just talk about where attach rates are currently standing? I know you have provided the 8% to 10% attach rate guidance for fourth quarter, but what was that number for third quarter, if you may?
Badrinarayanan Kothandaraman: A lot of the folks in our industry talk about the attach rate. We talked about the attach rate last quarter, but then it started to get confusing because we ship product for every -- I mean, to all the states in the U.S., many of these states are still ramping up on storage. So we have to really give you much more granular data. And an overall attach rate is almost meaningless. That's why what we did was we provided even more visibility to you in terms of megawatt hours. That's why for Q4, we said "Look, we have a capacity of 50-megawatt hours. We're almost full to that capacity, and that will give you easier modeling." But having said that, we've always been clear that long tail installers are the number one priority and our attach rate is extremely healthy with the long tail installers.  And now what we have going for us is we're having talks with several Tier 1s and 2s who basically want to get onboard because Ensemble is an extensible platform. When you have a platform which is capable of giving you a long life cycle, which is, you can start with solar and our what is called then, Enpower smart switch. You can start with IQ 8 solar and Enpower smart switch, then you can add batteries. You can come back after a year, you can add generators. You come back after some more time and say, "Okay. I don't want to generate, I want to add a fuel cell," fine, then you can add EV chargers soon. So we are thinking about an extensible architecture capable of load control. And so when we share our product road map with all of these Tier 1s and 2s, there is enormous interest. And so we are working closely with them, we're not going to compromise on our value-based pricing, like what I said, and we'll inform you if there are significant developments on that front.
Operator: Next question comes from Mark Strouse with JPMorgan.
Mark Strouse: Badri, I hope I'm not splitting hairs here, but just wanted to go back to your comments about the IQ 8D. I think you said shipments or revenues starting in 1Q of '21. I think previous comments were kind of testing that product out later in 2020. Just wondering if there's any change in the timing of that product? And if not, how we should take your comments about 1Q, should we just expect that to be kind of testing revenue? Or could there be kind of more material volume shipments?
Badrinarayanan Kothandaraman: Well, look, I mean, we've always been very clear even on our storage product, I refuse to go to the mark -- to go-to-market until we are absolutely ready. Quality and customer experience is our #1 priority. That's how we go to market, that's how we win market share. And that has been our success story on the microinverters. It's going to be no different on IQ 8D. In IQ 8D, the great news is that treating it like a microinverter, the work is almost done. Which is the design and reliability, but it is no longer a microinverter, it is a complete full system and it is a cultural change for us in the company in order to make sure everybody thinks about it like a full system. So therefore, what we are doing this quarter is there are alpha systems, which are pretty big alpha systems. We expect anywhere from 50 kilowatts to 200 kilowatts. Real alpha system installed, we are going to be hammering on those. Based upon the learning of our Encharge storage systems, we think applying the same best practices, we will be able to start beta installations in the first quarter of 2021. And that's why I gave you that number. I mean, that date. And that's -- yes, that's our expectation. If there is a change, we will let you know.
Eric Branderiz: I just want to add one more thing on this. Back last year when we did Analyst Day, I actually mentioned that there will be some beta revenues potentially in Q4, very small. So you're right, we said that. Normally, beta revenue is very small. Will not make a mark. I think that what Badri is doing now is spending more time on the software element of the rat and looking at this as a system and is taking more time on the testing side of the beta revenue coming in Q1 instead of Q4. But it was never meant to be materially important, more symbolically important for the company about having the new product introduction in the quarter, right. But I just want to clarify that because that's correct. You said some revenue in Q4, and that is slipping into Q1.
Mark Strouse: Yes. Grand scheme of things is not that big a deal. Just want to make sure my model is right. And then just, Eric, real quick, and I apologize if I missed this. Did you give the split of U.S. versus international, either for megawatts or revenue?
Eric Branderiz: Yes. We did it for both, I think, right? We provided the international. We didn't do it by region. We -- 78% is domestic, which is actually pretty impressive if you think for because we were over 80% or 90% actually last quarter. And now the presence of Europe and Asia Pacific, especially Europe, becoming very prominent. Even though we also have Ensemble shipments in Q3. So that's the -- providing the growth in Europe is helping on the regional diversification of revenue.
Badrinarayanan Kothandaraman: Right. So the answer is 78%, 22%. 78% revenue in the U.S. and 22% international.
Operator: Our next question comes from Brian Lee with Goldman Sachs.
Brian Lee: I hopped on a little bit late, so apologies if you've already covered this. But did I hear that 10% of revenues were from battery storage in Q3 and that you're switching over from the 8% to 10% attach rate guidance for Q4, and you're just talking about it in capacity terms. Maybe asking it in a different way, are you basically saying you had a little less than $20 million of revenue from batteries in Q3 and based on 50-megawatt hours of capacity being sold out in Q4, that seems to imply more than doubling the $40 million of revenue in Q4, if my math right -- is right? Is that the right ballpark?
Badrinarayanan Kothandaraman: Well, you're obviously good in math, you're approximately right. And yes, we did a little bit more than 10% of our overall revenue in storage, which is fantastic for a new product in the first quarter.
Brian Lee: Okay. That's great. I appreciate that additional clarity. Maybe 2 more questions, and I'll pass it on. But the gross margin bump for the guidance in Q4. I know it's subtle, but you guys continue to kind of move it up into the right. How much is that from the mix of Encharge revenues in the quarter increasing sequentially? And how much of that is just organic margin expansion on the micros? And then secondly, now that you're talking about this sort of in capacity terms, can you remind us sort of from the 50-megawatt hours in Q4 where the interim targets are for maybe early '21? And then as we move through the back half, where you'd be in the back half of '21?
Badrinarayanan Kothandaraman: Right. Right. Okay. Thank you for the question. So first is the gross margin question. Gross margin depends upon pricing and cost. And we are extremely disciplined in both. Pricing is value-based pricing, cost as we hammer on costs on microinverters, accessories, storage accessories, Encharge storage system. So all of that, we've just started hammering on the storage costs because we just introduced the product, pretty recently. So most of our cost reduction so far has been coming from the microinverters, which is fantastic, and we believe we have long legs there because we've already started to focus on IQ 9, which will probably come out in 2022, early 2022.  But there, in IQ 9, we are focusing on a very advanced materials plus an AC architecture that will substantially reduce both the footprint as well as the cost and the efficiency. So we're working on that. It's a lot of innovation there. So we're going to take some time there. With regard to the question on capacity of batteries. So we said Q4 is roughly 50-megawatt hours, we think like what I said in the script, by the end of Q2 '21, our capacity will be around 120-megawatt hours per quarter with our existing two suppliers. That's the answer.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jeff Osborne with Cowen & Company.
Jeffrey Osborne: Congratulations on the results. Just two questions on my end. I was curious, Eric, on the safe harbor comments around the early visibility there. Is there any dependency on the outcome of the election? For example, if Trump wins, do you anticipate more safe harboring as opposed to less?
Eric Branderiz: Yes, I think there is, and there is also an element of, I've done it before. I know how to do it, and I wait and see so there is less complication on figuring out the mechanics and the realities, right. Remember, there were -- these were specific contracts with a lot of special language, a lot of logistics over the fulfillment, the warehousing requirements, labeling requirements. All of those are learnings from the past. So now these guys are probably waiting probably until the last possible time in order to make a decision.  We don't see a lot of activity for Q4 this time, if there is some, we will probably see it in Q1. And it will be probably not as big as it was last year, right, or this year, actually, early in Q1 this year. So we should expect to see some, but maybe not as many.
Jeffrey Osborne: Then speaking of Q1, what visibility do you have lined up to that, just given the ramp in recovery in the market and some projects seem to be pushed for a variety of reasons, labor shortages, et cetera. Are you hearing from your distributors or customers that projects are being pushed to Q1 at this point or no?
Eric Branderiz: No. No. I mean, we normally don't comment about Q1 beyond the quarter, right, Jeff. And frankly, on the safe harbor, what I told you is all I know, right, at this point.
Jeffrey Osborne: Okay. Maybe one that you will answer, you certainly have ample cash. Can you just talk about what your thoughts are on M&A, either in software or other adjacent areas, just given there's been some activity in your space?
Eric Branderiz: Yes. We have actually deep thoughts on that area. And Raghu is actually working with Adam around the clock with a very healthy pipeline of M&A opportunities, so we are evaluating. And you know how we are, right? We look at every detail, we look at every angle. We see the multiples that some of these opportunities are commanding, and we want to make sure that we do the right thing for the company at the right time, right. So yes, it's very active, very visible and is part of the development of the digital strategy of the platform that Badri mentioned earlier. So yes.
Operator: Our next question comes from Colin Rusch with Oppenheimer.
Colin Rusch: I just wanted to dig a little bit into the customer awareness and understanding of the value of the grid formation capability that you guys have. You talked about the pricing strategy, but where are you at in terms of really educating the customers in terms of that functionality and the flexibility that you have over time with it?
Raghuveer Belur: Yes. Hi, this is Raghu. So as we mentioned, installers still have a pretty big influence in -- their -- in selling the product to the homeowners. So they do a lot of the education. And for us, we do extensive amount of training with the installers as well and educate them on the importance of grid forming, not only with -- obviously with energy storage, but also with the IQ 8 PV that's coming soon after. And to a great extent, as we mentioned, right, today, people working from home, resiliency is top of mind. So they want to have systems that are backup systems and, of course, all the challenges that we are seeing here in California, it is on everybody's mind is that, how do I provide a backup solution and the conversation naturally leads into, "Okay. Can I do that with solar and storage." So it's a lot of training, a lot of education that happens. And then, of course, the environment itself is such that people are quite aware anymore.
Colin Rusch: And then just talking about the OpEx spend, specifically in R&D, I mean, as you guys start to scale up revenue in a more substantial way and you've got some financial flexibility in terms of the target model. I mean, how should we think about R&D spend and target areas? Obviously, it stands to the question about M&A, but thinking about the internal team and where you're focused -- focusing the resources, how should we think about scale of that spend and where you're focusing in terms of the development of the technology platform?
Badrinarayanan Kothandaraman: Yes. Like what we have told you before, 35%, 15%, 20% is our model. The OpEx model is about 15% of sales. So we have to grow -- if sales grows faster, we have a little bit more room on OpEx. Having said that, we live and die by innovation. We basically -- the stuff I told you on IQ 9, we are working on. It requires a lot of engineers trying go to various things. So our R&D centers of excellence are in India and are in New Zealand, with management oversight from the U.S. We are investing very heavily. That's why Eric said this, 113 new hires in 1 quarter. These 65 people are from the top universities in India. That's called Indian Institute of Technology, outstanding engineers, software engineers, hardware engineers, power conversion engineers. And we expect to be hiring more such people. In fact, I can't -- yes, I don't have enough engineers in the company. And we are going to hire in a hurry there. But we're going to be disciplined, making sure our -- we are going to be around that model at all times.
Operator: Our next question comes from Amit Dayal with H.C. Wainwright.
Amit Dayal: Badri, could you talk about some of the deployment challenges you may be facing? Just any examples to help us visualize what are the issues and how you're addressing those?
Badrinarayanan Kothandaraman: When you said the deployment challenges, do you mean with respect to storage?
Amit Dayal: Yes, yes, yes. With the new product. Yes, the storage product.
Badrinarayanan Kothandaraman: Yes. With respect to storage, many, many times, people, for example, they switch -- when they switch to off-grid product and let's say it happens, and they don't even know because their products seamlessly switches from on grid to off grid, if they don't change their user patterns, then what happens is the batteries can deplete quickly. And so by the time the night is over, the battery is deplete and the house may not have power. And so in those cases, obviously, our next-generation product will take care of those cases because it is going to have load control. And when it has load control, when you switch from on-grid to off-grid, we will make sure the critical loads are on first. Right now, the product that we introduced doesn't yet have that feature.  So therefore, we have to educate people that sometimes this happens. And that education cannot come manually, it has to be some form of push notification that comes on their devices, phones, iPads, et cetera, saying that you're now off grid, start to reduce your consumption -- conserve your consumption. So that, in the morning, sun comes up and your batteries again -- your batteries are automatically charged.  So education like that, you would -- I mean, you might think about it as pretty simple. But remember, the people we are selling this product to, they are -- they belong to various demographics, various in the 20s to in their 70s. And so we have to make sure this product works seamlessly. While we are on that product development cadence, the -- in the short term, we have to educate people. And we have to educate people with our customer service team, our engineering team needs to do some quick containment, which we are actually working on. I gave you an example, but those are the types of things we are doing right.
Amit Dayal: Understood. And just maybe one more question on the guidance for the fourth quarter. With 50-megawatt hours coming from potentially the storage side, is microinverter roughly flat year-over-year than for the fourth quarter?
Badrinarayanan Kothandaraman: No, microinverter, we said, if you take a look at it, the -- I mean, think about it like this, my revenue in Q2 was in the 120 . Q3 is $178 million, Q4 is 200 -- midpoint is $253 million. This cannot happen with the microinverter revenue flat. The microinverter point of sales has gone up by 49% in the last 3 months. Our sell-through for microinverters in September is 49% higher than in June. There is a record point of sales for microinverters. We are continuing to take share, I believe, on microinverters. And especially -- and I talked about the long tail of installers before. It's the quality of the customer experience. As long as we are leading on that front, and we believe this will continue to happen.
Eric Branderiz: I mean, remember that we have 50-megawatt hours of capacity. And if you are, let's say, hypothetically fully booked, that based on the dollar per kilowatt hour assumption, gives you a number minus the $252.5 million midpoint of the guidance, that shows you a growth from $178.5 million, that is pretty...
Badrinarayanan Kothandaraman: Already very high growth.
Eric Branderiz: Pretty, pretty big, right? So if you do it that way, the math, whatever number you use per kilowatt on ASP. So it's a good year for micros, right.
Amit Dayal: I was comparing it to 4Q '19.
Badrinarayanan Kothandaraman: Well, I mean, think about it, 4Q '19, we have had the pandemic. We had the pandemic. So what we are looking is, if you look at the revenue, in approximately in 4Q, we had a lot of safe harbor...
Eric Branderiz: Exactly.
Badrinarayanan Kothandaraman: At that point in time. And if we had excluded safe harbor in 4Q '19, that number is roughly in the 160s million for Q4 '19. Now we take that number, now we compare with our midpoint of guidance, which is $252.5 million, minus the 40-megawatt hours. And if you apply or minus the 50-megawatt hours, you apply the model, you will see that there is still very significant growth even in microinverters year-on-year.
Eric Branderiz: Right.
Amit Dayal: Yes. I wasn't factoring the safe harbor for 4Q '19. 
Badrinarayanan Kothandaraman: And that's critical for you to track because safe harbor is like, you guys know it better than me, it is a lot of forward pulling.
Raghuveer Belur: And we made a special mention on safe harbor on our guidance. We actually, were the first ones that came up with safe harbor carving out the numbers to make a feel for you guys. So I mean, any time.
Operator: Our next question comes from Eric Stine with Craig-Hallum.
Eric Stine: So I guess, asking this question in the context of the resurgence we're seeing in COVID right now and thinking back to the second quarter, really a tough quarter for the industry, but there are also a number of positive steps taken, installers and other industry participants, just starting to do business differently. So I mean, when you think about going forward and if things do trend, to where things get worse. I mean, how do you think the industry or does it give you comfort that you think that the impact to your business would not be severe as it was -- as severe as it was in the second quarter?
Eric Branderiz: I think one of the things that we have seen is the -- how quickly the industry adapted to the environment, right. One of the things is that they went -- a lot of I went online. And the second thing is, again, resiliency has become such a big -- such a key and important top of mind issue for a lot of the homeowners. So in some sense, as it fortunate as COVID has been, it's been actually a really big advantage for resiliency products such as energy storage. Second thing also is if you look at what we are doing with our digital transformation, we are building out a comprehensive platform that is helping our installer partners have a very efficient journey all the way from leads through design, to permitting, to contract, commissioning, interconnection, et cetera, so I think even if a situation like what you're saying occurs, the resurgence, the combination of the adaptability of our installation -- installer partners plus all the tools that we are bringing to bear I think the industry will be pretty -- will be pretty resolute in getting through it.
Eric Stine: Got it. Good to hear. Yes, I mean, obviously, hoping that is not the case, but good perspective. Maybe last one for me. Just on the upgrade program. I know that in the past, you've talked about this as a pretty substantial opportunity and the thought that you would upgrade the M-Series or see if homeowners wanted to upgrade to M-Series to the IQ series. What you talked about earlier, I just want to confirm, I mean, how should we think about that upgrade program if you are targeting software that would make the M-Series compatible to Encharge? Is there any change to that? Or have things -- is a little different when we think about it going forward?
Badrinarayanan Kothandaraman: It's a massive opportunity for us. I mean, when do you get 300,000 homes additional, when you've already served them once, this one is an opportunity to seamlessly add storage to their existing solar installations. But having said that, we got to make sure we get our capacity issues solved. And then we are going to -- I mean, the beautiful thing is we know exactly where they are located, we know their consumption patterns. We also know that there are -- we can specifically target those people for whom resiliency is top of mind, which is places like California, Florida, we can target those very easily, when we have the right capacity. So it's very much in our mind, and it is applicable for IQ also, M-Series also. And like what I said, we are planning to release that software upgrade in the fourth quarter. And we'll start the promotions.
Eric Stine: Yes. So is it fair to -- then to think about -- it's just more -- it's better for Enphase if you are deploying Encharge systems on those houses where they're M-Series microinverters, but they've gotten the software upgrade rather than going to IQ 6 and IQ 7.
Badrinarayanan Kothandaraman: Exactly.
Eric Stine: Okay. Very helpful.
Eric Branderiz: It depends also on the strength of the warranty. Remember that some of the M-Series, people bought it long time ago. So some of them, they may say, "I may as well change and switch." Many homeowners actually, to our surprise, they actually use the opportunity for doing a reassessment of their energy requirements. How many people are getting PV. So the opportunity to upgrade to IQ base system, with ACMs, in many cases, is still there, right.
Badrinarayanan Kothandaraman: But I mean, the short answer is we don't need them to do it. That's a huge barrier that it's gone. And some people, like what Eric pointed out, M190, their warranty -- original warranty was only 15 years. So basically, they're almost running out. But there'll -- but there are some folks with M250 whose warranty is -- they're only 4 years into their warranty, 5 years into their warranty. For them, many of them will not want to move to IQ. And so even for them, it is no problem. You can buy Encharge. It is seamless. No issue.
Operator: Our next question comes from Philip Shen with Roth Capital Partners.
Philip Shen: So the mix of U.S., international was 78%, 22% in the quarter. As you think through 2021, how could this mix evolve, do you think Europe and other international markets could grow faster, could we see 70-30 next year? Or do you think it stays similar to this 80-20?
Badrinarayanan Kothandaraman: We are making huge progress in Europe. So Europe grew 67% compared -- I mean, in Q3 compared to Q2. And the areas of growth are the obvious ones, Netherlands, France, we are starting to make some serious inroads into Germany. We have hired sales folks in many countries. We are going to introduce our product in Italy very soon. We have engaged. I mean, we have partnerships with Sonnenstromfabrik, which is an ACM partner. We have not yet talked about a second ACM partner, we will soon. And then we have our third ACM partner with Maxion, so that's good. And again, it is -- the foundation here is quality and customer experience. That's why people -- that's why we are expanding rapidly. One big thing which will come, we will introduce by Q3 of 2021, will be basically storage systems in Germany and Italy. We are going to be introducing Encharge in Germany and Italy and the other countries that need it in Europe. And that's going to happen. We are also -- I mean, we are working on that product as well. So I think I'll be disappointed if we don't get to 70-30, at least as we exit 2021.
Philip Shen: Interesting. Do you think the supplier for Germany and Italy would be the same 2 that you have now? Or could it be third? I know you talked about earlier -- or possibly even a fourth that supplies Europe?
Badrinarayanan Kothandaraman: Yes, let's walk before we run first. So we -- the current two supplies, the design would be comparable to the current two suppliers. And then if we are demand constrained, we will obviously recognize that fast and make sure we add a third supply quickly. And we do -- we have plans to do that by the end of the year anyway.
Philip Shen: Okay. Fantastic. In some of our checks, we picked up that there might be some components that may be short for you guys. I just want to see if you might be able to talk through this. It's not the microinverter or Encharge -- well, Encharge certainly is short and there's a lot of demand there. But just kind of peripheral components. Do you expect this to sustain? Do you think you can catch up? Do you think -- or is this not really an issue? Any thoughts on that would be great.
Badrinarayanan Kothandaraman: Yes. I mean, look, the nice thing is the channel is very lean right now. We talked about our normal gel inventory of 8 to 10 weeks, but we are much tighter than that. Yes, you're right. The channel is running light. And -- but now we have the capacity to catch up very quickly. Like right now, I have 3 sources right now. I have Flextronics, Mexico, which produces tariff free product up to 1 million units a quarter, and I can expand that easily. I have Salcomp, Chennai that produces tariff free product 250,000 units. 200,000, 250,000 units for Q1 of '21 and probably 0.5 million units per quarter, Q2 of '21. And then I always have China, which can go more than 1.5 million to 2 million units. And of course, they are the downside as we pay tariffs.  So we have enough capacity, microinverter capacity, we are systematically -- we have systematically built the company such that we don't -- I mean, we are not limited by demand for microinverters. And so there may be some short-term constraints here and there, but we are working furiously, our long tail installers and all our installers are top priority for us, and we are operationally excellent. Our Chief Operating Officer, his job is to make sure no customer is unsatisfied, especially in these times. We will continue to work with them, and we're going to solve these issues.
Operator: Our next question comes from Mike Cikos with Needham & Company.
Michael Cikos: Just one for you on this digital transformation initiative that you guys are talking through with the Enphase installer network. I think I heard that you guys have now 400 installers onboarded. And I'm just going through my notes here, I think you work with, call it, about 1,500 of these long tail installers in the U.S. per year. So I wanted to get a sense of, first, how big do you plan on growing that network? And then secondly, can you kind of walk us through, how you guys are putting together these leads and packaging these tools for that network? Just curious from a competitive dynamic what the response is? And then can you guys actually get visibility on your end then as far as how close rates and other items like that are tracking?
Eric Branderiz: Yes. So we have a much -- we view it very strategically when we think about this comprehensive digital platform that we were talking about, right? Historically, the involvement of Enphase and Enlighten, specifically, the tools started at the time of commissioning and then commissioning an interconnection position to operate and then operations. What we have done now is extend that to the beginning of the process, which is starting with leads and lead management. That's one. It also interweaves both the installer journey, if you may, which includes proposal -- which includes design, proposal, contract, permitting and so on and so forth, as well as full visibility into how the interaction occurs between the homeowner as well as the installers.  So we have mapped out that journey. The goal being to provide an excellent customer experience, both for the homeowner as well as the installer and the journey begins very -- right from the beginning. As far as the -- and of course, the need of -- what enables this is the Enphase installer network, and that's a worldwide network. It's U.S. as well in all the regions that we are in. And we qualify, they have to go through a pretty stringent selection process. So even though we start with 1,500 installers, based on the quality of their installation and most important, the customer experience, we have -- in the U.S., as an example, we have now installers in our EIN. So we'll continue to provide -- as we continue developing additional tools for them, et cetera, there will be metrics that we're going to attract and of course, at the appropriate time, we'll share some of those metrics similar to what we have done as we track NPS as an example, we'll do something similarly appropriate.
Raghuveer Belur: Just to clarify, we do business with more than 2,500 installers at any given year, right? So this EIN or Enphase installer network is a very exclusive, unique group of installers that there are -- meet a particular defined criteria of excellence with customer experience, installation designs and they get access to the full suite of the digital platform tools, including leads and other benefits, right? So -- and they are classified into three categories. We have a very, very clear way to define that. And that's what we are doing, but we continue doing business with pretty much -- that kind of -- all of these in targets.
Badrinarayanan Kothandaraman: Right. And if you actually go to our website and if you go look at a particular zip code and if you type that in, you can see the platinum, gold and silver installers in that area. You can actually see how they're sorted. You can see the ratings, public ratings, that they have. Now your question was how is it embedded into the platform. We are in the process of releasing the platform. We haven't released it yet. It's going to take us a little bit more time. But the way we are thinking about is, for example, if a homeowner from a particular zip code, he approaches Enphase, Enphase will give him -- would show the Enphase installer network in that area. The Enphase installer network, the way we will prioritize this, obviously, by the people who service the homeowners with the highest Net Promoter Score. Highest customer experience. So therefore, what we would do is we would have an algorithm, which picks the right installers, a few of them, maybe 3 or 4 to show the homeowner, so that the homeowner makes the right decision on what is good for him, but it will be based upon the Enphase installer network. It's also important to know that these installers have actually given all of the details that a homeowner would like to see when they are making a decision. And the detail means for example, which zip codes they service, what is their pricing, upper end and the lower end of pricing per watt for solar. What is their pricing for storage? What are their preferences? Are they -- is the installer okay to utilize AC modules? What -- if we do upgrade programs, what are the rates that he's going to charge the homeowner?  So we are building a comprehensive database, the 400 installer database is going to be very comprehensive because that will be the basis of the digital platform. When a lead comes, the data will be automatically taken from the platform from those installers and that installer data will be directly shown to the homeowner without interference from Enphase. All we choose is the best homeowner experience. Nothing else. So that's our philosophy, and we don't need to do more. I mean, we don't need to do more work before we release it. And we need to add several tools, our installers, our EIN, Enphase installer network. They get priority to tools that we have. For example, if we have a solar and storage design software, they will receive special priority depending upon their tier, whether it's platinum, gold or silver. Similarly, if we introduce a permitting service, they will get special priority. That's the whole point. We want to build a very high-quality network that services -- their job is to service their homeowner with the best customer experience.
Michael Cikos: Sounds like a compelling opportunity there. And then one more, if I may. Just thinking through the baseline financial model that you guys laid out, that 35%, 15%, 20%. Given how you guys have been outperforming that model, maybe talk us through how you think about that model moving forward or the opportunity to increase those margins over time?
Raghuveer Belur: I think that what we normally say to investors is think about the immediate midpoint of the guidance as a very short-term view of our performance and forecast the immediate quarters thinking on those lines. We also need to think through that we are -- the concept of growth requires significant amount of flexibility, and we want that flexibility. We need that flexibility. And as we continue ramping up new products or the introductions of new products or continue to increase the volume on existing products like in Ensemble, we like you folks to focus on that, the baseline model is the right model for the long term, right. When we feel comfortable to improve on that model, we will communicate that one as we did it before, right? But in the short term, midpoint of the next quarter guidance, sounds about right, in the, I would say, midterm, midpoint, midterm scenarios, I think you should think through the 35% gross margin as a good baseline. It's cash-generating with a very flexible operating model. So in terms of the business, right. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Sean Milligan with Williams Trading.
Unidentified Analyst: If we think about where you're exiting this year at 50-megawatt hours on the battery on the storage side from capacity and where you're heading midyear next year. What are kind of the biggest gating factors to hitting sales that are equivalent to that 120-megawatt hours mid next year. Is it bringing on additional installers? Is it just a matter of having the capacity because the demand is there? Just trying to understand if there's some kind of gating factor in the first part of next year?
Badrinarayanan Kothandaraman: Yes, thank you for the question. So basically, like what I talked about, we focus on long tail installers. And we have been clear, long tail installers is #1 priority. And that business does not happen overnight. It is hard for us to build it installer by installer. The installers have to go through online training because right now, that's the way to do things. They have to do their first installation. We have to be patient with them. We have to make sure that installation experiences a seamless experience. We lean out all efficiencies in the process. We need to get that install to less than 1-day install. And then the -- and make sure that we are on top of those long tail installers, that's one. That is a multi-quarter process. Like how we built the microinverters over microinverter business, it took us a long time to build, 1 brick at a time.  Storage business, especially with the long tail, is -- will take time to build. However, once built, it is an extremely healthy business to have because our foundation is based upon outstanding quality, outstanding customer experience. Therefore, they -- our desire is they look nowhere else for buying products. Now having said that, we also want to work with the Tier 1 and 2 installers who like Ensemble, who like the fact that IQ 8 is going to be the first grid independent microinverter in the world. They want to engage on our platform. And so we like to work with the Tier 1 and 2 installers. And like what we said in the script, the prepared remarks, we are working with several of them and getting them on board with Encharge and Ensemble. And that is -- may take the same time to -- as the long tail, expect that to happen relatively quickly, but still that's a time-consuming activity.  So those are the two things that need to happen. We are -- so far, within 3 months, we are extremely happy at the number of people who have gone through training at the way we have manage the installation so far. We are not perfect, but when we had problems, we jumped on them right away. We treated every homeowner, every issue as a defect. I look at it. My entire executive staff looks at it, we start the executive staff meetings with the focus on homeowners for Ensemble. so I'm very happy with the progress we have made. There's more to be done on both fronts, getting more long tail installers and getting Tier 1 and 2 installers.
Operator: Our next question comes from Maheep Mandloi with CrÃ©dit Suisse.
Maheep Mandloi: And just on Encharge. Could you talk about like are these installations for new solar installations? Or are you getting any retrofit demand for older solar installations either from your M-Series or other IQ 7, 6 series customers or -- from the customers?
Badrinarayanan Kothandaraman: I'll say it is a pretty healthy mix, I would say, many are new installations, I would say, many are retrofits. It's -- our statistics is limited so far. I think it will be meaningful if we give something to you next quarter. Right now, our statistics aren't meaningful enough to give you, I mean, to draw a conclusion. But I see healthy trends on both sides.
Eric Branderiz: Yes. And just to be clear, M-Series is -- will -- the M-Series attach will be -- that product will be launched at the end of this year, that's a software upgrade for our system to enable it to work with the M-Series product.
Badrinarayanan Kothandaraman: Right.
Maheep Mandloi: Got it. Got it. Very helpful about that. And just on the Enphase installer network, just quick thoughts on how does that compete with the Tier 1, Tier 2 installers who probably are also offering their own services, similar to what you have out there. And last, just like what could we expect at the Analyst Day later this year?
Badrinarayanan Kothandaraman: Yes. I mean, we've always been clear on our strategy, right. We -- while we -- we'll go absolutely all out to take care of our Tier 1 and 2 customers. Our bread and butter has always been the long tail installers. The long tail installers do not have a clear, comprehensive platform to work today. And our objective, while not being arrogant, is if we can create such a platform where we generate leads, we transfer to the installers. We track the entire installation or we even manage the lease that the installers actually bring, and we give them several tools during that process. We think we will make these installers. We will have a sticky experience long-term. And that's our philosophy to build in highest quality, to take care of both homeowners and to keep installers, homeowners and Enphase continuously connected at all times. That's the digital platform. So yes, you're going to hear more in the Analyst Day, which will probably be sometime soon. And we'll keep you informed.
Operator: Our next question comes from Joseph Osha with JMP Group.
Joseph Osha: Two questions for you. One sort of easy one and one more complicated one. On the easy side, wondering if you can share with us on Encharge, what -- sort of where your typical customer configuration is ending up in terms of size? That's the first question. And then the second question is, as IQ 8 starts to show up and these grid capabilities start to show up. How do you think about the potential for working with installers on grid services. That's -- and obviously, that might inform the type of installers that you're going to work with. How do you think about that once IQ 8 is out there?
Badrinarayanan Kothandaraman: The first part of the question, I think it is anywhere between 10- and 15-kilowatt hours.
Joseph Osha: Okay.
Badrinarayanan Kothandaraman: Then the second...
Eric Branderiz: On grid services, as storage becomes more prevalent out there, especially we are particularly behind meter storage, which is what we service. The coordinations of -- Coordinating all these DERs is going to become more and more critical, and that's the opportunity. And what we are doing, what our plan is to offer bridge services as an integral part of the solution that we are providing. So it will be available to any installer, that -- anyone in our EIN and any one of our installers to offer it to their homeowner customers. So they can sign up or if you -- or opt-in to taking advantage of because they have their storage solution. And if there's a program available for good services, then they can update and sign up for it. So we are going to make it a -- appropriate and broadly available.
Joseph Osha: Okay. And as a follow-up to that, I'm just wondering in this kind of follows on one of the questions about M&A earlier, you will have seen that Generac has bought Enbala, Fluence bought AMS. I'm wondering, as you look at this, do you feel that there are any sort of terms, management skill sets you need to acquire? Or do you have what you need at this point?
Badrinarayanan Kothandaraman: Obviously, we don't get into any such details at this time. But in general, we have a very powerful platform in -- with Enlighten. And so whether that's done through -- there are multiple opportunities available, provide APIs to provide grid services at all our -- the entire Ensemble system is always on, which means it's fully connected. Coordination of all of these DERs is going to be launched off of the existing Enlighten platform itself. So how we go about doing it, the details of it, we won't share it this time. But suffice it to say that we see that DER coordination is extremely important, and we'll offer that to all of our installer partners.
Operator: Our next question comes from Marshall Carver with Heikkinen Energy Advisors.
Marshall Carver: You saw really impressive sequential growth internationally, particularly in Europe in 3Q. Any comments on 4Q '20 growth rates, U.S. versus international or give us the anticipated approximate revenue split U.S. versus international?
Badrinarayanan Kothandaraman: Usually don't break that out, but our team is doing a really nice job in all the regions. We are very strong in basically, Netherlands, we are continuing to grow. We just added distributors, top distributors in Netherlands and Belgium as indication. We are making a lot of progress in Germany. As I said, we will introduce IQ 7, hopefully, in Italy, very, very soon in Q1. Then there are several other countries in Europe that we have actually hired salespeople. Before, we only had five salespeople last year at this time, Q4 of '19, we only had five people. I think now we have north of 15 or 20. So we have increased by 4x, and we plan to increase even more going forward.  So in general, I think things look good there. The one big market there is storage, especially Germany and Italy. And I think we'll be ready for that, like what I said in the third quarter of 2021.
Operator: Our next question comes from Pavel Molchanov with Raymond James.
Pavel Molchanov: You mentioned the safe harbor playing a much less noticeable role versus a year ago. I'm curious, if the ITC were to be extended as part of a post-election stimulus package in Congress, which the trade groups, of course, have been lobbying for. How would that impact kind of the trajectory of the business into next year vis-Ã -vis safe harbor?
Badrinarayanan Kothandaraman: I think -- yes. So obviously, if ITC gets extended, then there's been no real need to safe harbor anything. So you will obviously see that at least the safe harbor contribution will not -- will be de minimis or non-exist -- and actually are expected to be nonexistent. In general, our view on safe harbor is that there's a lot of learning from last year, and so I think people now know what to do and how to go about to go about executing on safe harbor and if somebody does own it, we'll be ready for it.
Pavel Molchanov: Okay. One more question about M&A, if I may. A lot of interesting comments from you guys about software, which is fascinating. Is there a target in your mind, whether dollar value or percentage of the revenue mix that you would like to have recurring over time? So SaaS, managed services, et cetera?
Badrinarayanan Kothandaraman: That's not how we think about it. We think about it as, hey, what is the right -- is it a good strategic fit for what we do, is it very complementary with what we are providing and are we bringing real value to our homeowners in order to provide the best homeowner experience. So that's kind of the criteria that we use. Of course, we do incredible amount of diligence in terms of how much we are paying for it, the valuations and so on and so forth. But at the end of the day, it's all about making sure we deliver the best homeowner experience and a good strategic fit for us.
Raghuveer Belur: We are in a good position. We get an incredible architecture with Ensemble. So we got plenty of optionality there on how we want to play that out. If the event that we want to play it out, right? No matter what, we need to think about this from the homeowners' point of view. That's what we are thinking. So that backwards into us, right? And through our healthy relationship with our partners, distributors and installers, right, in -- so everybody wins. In the process, especially the home one, which buys our products, right. So -- but we have not -- discarding any possibility, right, on how we're going to approach our go-to-market strategy on providing different services through our platform, either Enlighten or our digital platform outside Enlighten as well.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Amit Dayal with H.C. Wainwright.
Amit Dayal: Badri, sorry. I just had 1 follow-up. The 120-megawatt hours per quarter by the second half of next year for the storage side, are you going to rely on the long tail network to deploy this? Or should we expect maybe some partnerships to come through between now and then to help support that deployment?
Badrinarayanan Kothandaraman: It's too early to tell, but I'll just go back to the microinverter business. Microinverter business today is a nice, healthy mix of long tail as well as Tier 1 and 2 installers because everyone wants to work with us due to high-quality and high customer experience. So if we do a good job on the storage side, then all of this capacity can be -- can turn out to be positive for us, but we need to execute.
Operator: That concludes today's question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the call back to Badri Kothandaraman for closing remarks.
Badrinarayanan Kothandaraman: Thank you for joining us today and for your continued support of Enphase. We look forward to speaking with you again, early next year. Bye.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You, may now disconnect.

===== 2020 Q2  (2020-08-05 18:48:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to the Enphase Energy's Second Quarter 2020 Financial Results Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speaker presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Please be advised that today’s conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker, Mr. Adam Hinckley. Please go ahead, sir.
Adam Hinckley: Good afternoon and thank you for joining us on today's conference call to discuss Enphase Energy's second quarter 2020 results. On today's call are Badri Kothandaraman, Enphase's President and Chief Executive Officer; Eric Branderiz, Chief Financial Officer; and Raghu Belur, Chief Products Officer. After the market close today, Enphase issued a press release announcing the results for its second quarter ended June 30, 2020. During this conference call, Enphase management will make forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, statements related to Enphase Energy's expected future financial performance; the capabilities, availability and market adoption of our current and future technology and products, our performance and the performance of our installation partners in sales and operations, and our expectations as to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. These forward-looking statements involve significant risks and uncertainties, and Enphase Energy's actual results and the timing of events could differ materially from these expectations. For a more complete discussion of the risks and uncertainties, please see the company's annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019, which is on file with the SEC, and quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the second quarter ended June 30, 2020, which will be filed during the third quarter of 2020. Enphase Energy cautions you not to place any undue reliance on forward-looking statements and undertakes no duty or obligation to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future events or changes in its expectations. Also, please note that financial measures used on this call are expressed on a non-GAAP basis, unless otherwise noted, and have been adjusted to exclude certain charges. The company has provided a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures in its earnings release posted today, which can also be found in the Investor Relations section of its Web site. Now, I’d like to introduce Badri Kothandaraman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Enphase Energy. Badri?
Badri Kothandaraman: Good afternoon, and thanks for joining us today to discuss our second quarter 2020 financial results. I hope all of you are staying safe and healthy. Our team did a good job of navigating a difficult macro environment caused by COVID-19. We reported revenue of $125.5 million, shipped approximately 1.1 million microinverters while driving channel inventory back to healthy levels, achieved record non-GAAP gross margin of 39.6% and generated strong free cash flow of $21 million. In addition, we began shipping our Encharge storage system featuring Ensemble energy management technology. This is an important product release for Enphase. More on this shortly. We exited the second quarter at approximately 40, 21, 19. This means 40% gross margin, 21% operating expenses and 19% operating income, all as a percentage of revenue on a non-GAAP basis. As a reminder, our baseline financial model is 35, 15, 20. COVID-19 created a significant downward pressure on demand during the second quarter of 2020. With many countries implementing shelter-in-place restrictions, all aspects of daily life were impacted. Although solar installers were considered essential service providers in some locations, their business processes had to be reinvented. For an industry that relies largely on in-person sales meetings with homeowners a few months ago, the speed with which installers have migrated to virtual selling has been impressive. Our employees have been remarkably resilient too, not skipping a beat during the pandemic. Releasing Ensemble to the market with most of the engineers working from home was an amazing accomplishment. Our sales operations and finance teams did an incredible job navigating a tough quarter by working closely with customers, focusing on linearity and inventory management and ensuring tight cash management. I'm very proud of them. Let’s now talk about how we are servicing customers. Our customer experienced personnel in all four worldwide locations - U.S., Europe, India and Australia are fully supporting installers and homeowners while working from home. Our worldwide Q2 Net Promoter Score was 66% and our North America Net Promoter Score was 73%. The ability to show consistent results with employees working from home during the quarter was no easy feat and is a testament to the business processes we implemented. Our average call wait time decreased slightly in Q2 to approximately 1 minute. We continue to enhance self-service and chat capabilities to reduce call volumes and lower our wait time. Specifically, we launched the online Enphase Community during Q2 which gives installers and homeowners the ability to communicate directly about Enphase products. In addition to the Enphase online store we launched in the U.S. during Q4 '19, we also added online stores in Europe and Australia during Q2 to better service our installers and homeowners with quick cycle times. Let’s quickly cover manufacturing. Given the reduced demand situation in Q2, we worked very closely with our contract manufacturing partners to optimize overall inventory builds in both China and Mexico. Maintaining a tight lid on inventory is critical for us especially during these tough times. We were pretty successful as we reduced inventory levels by nearly $3.4 million compared to Q1. Our factory in Mexico is very important for us and we feel confident we’ll be able to produce 1 million microinverters by Q4 '20, if justified by product demand. We currently manufacture in both China and Mexico with our existing contract manufacturing partner and we have an excellent relationship with them. On our previous earnings call, I have discussed qualifying a second contact manufacturing partner for microinverters. We are doing this to create further flexibility as we grow our business. The contract manufacturer is Salcomp and that factory is in Chennai, India. We are setting up a fully automated line with them. The qualification is going well. We are very happy with the progress and we expect to start producing microinverters from the Salcomp Chennai factory in the fourth quarter of 2020. In terms of battery storage, we have one qualified supplier for our cell pack and we are in the final stages of qualifying an additional supplier. This will bring up our capacity to a total of 480 megawatt hours a year once the two supplier factories are fully ramped in the first half of 2021. We also expect to qualify a third source next year so that we have a fully flexible supply chain for batteries going forward, much like our microinverter supply chain. We are still using lithium iron phosphate batteries as they provide differentiation in terms of fire safety and thermal stability, which is very critical to homeowners. Let’s now move to the regions. Our U.S. and international mix for Q2 was 80% and 20%, respectively. Europe stood out during the quarter demonstrating sequential revenue growth from Q1, despite COVID-19. The U.S. market was the hardest hit region due to COVID-19. With solar installations shutdown in the areas of California and several Northeastern states, April witnessed a dramatic slowdown. As installers became more proficient in closing online sales and as building departments accelerated online permits, we started to see activity picking up towards June. Our average weekly sell-through from distribution to installers was 26% higher in June versus April. We worked very closely with our distributors and installers throughout Q2 to optimize channel inventory. Weeks on hand at the end of Q2 was above our typical level but still within a healthy range. In addition, our installer count increased sequentially in Q2, despite the lower overall sell-through. This highlights our success at continuing to win new installers. We also announced a strategic partnership in Q2 with Q CELLS to develop AC Modules based on our seventh-generation IQ 7+ microinverters. For the third quarter, we are seeing a nice pickup in sell-through during July. Our weekly sell-through in July was 14% better than in June. We expect to be at our target inventory range of 8 to 10 weeks at the end of Q3. In addition, we started shipping the Encharge storage systems in the U.S. We are ramping the battery supply chain and have more demand than what we can support in Q3. As I have said, we are rapidly bringing on additional capacity with our second battery supplier for Q4. Another important subject is the Encharge training for installers. In early July, we pivoted to online training for installers through the Enphase University. Nearly 134 installers have completed the online courses to achieve provisional certification and another 531 installers are in the process of completing the training. In summary, we are confident of resolving supply and training challenges and are targeting an 8% to 10% average storage attach rate for the U.S. in Q4, which is higher than what we said at our Analyst Day in December of 2019. As a reminder, the storage attach rates vary depending on geography and we expect attach rates to be significantly higher in California and Florida. In Europe, we are expanding our sales force in all key regions even more than what we originally planned before. Our Q2 revenue in Europe increased sequentially by 8% from Q1. Installer attendance at sales webinars during Q2 more than doubled relative to in-person attendance in Q1. As a result, our installer count increased by more than 20% sequentially. Distributor gains were made both in new markets, such as Germany, Poland and Spain as well as existing markets of Netherlands and Belgium. We expect to grow significantly in Europe during Q3, although our target of doubling revenue on an annual basis is unlikely due to COVID. We anticipate adding several new installers and distributors during Q3. We recently announced a strategic partnership with SunPower to produce the new Enphase Energized Maxeon AC Module based on our seventh-generation IQ microinverters. Overall, I’m very happy with our team’s performance in Europe. Revenue from both Asia Pacific and Latin America decreased sequentially at a rate consistent with the U.S. when excluding safe harbor revenue from Q1. In Latin America, Puerto Rico witnessed the strong rebound activity during the second half of Q2 in anticipation of the hurricane season after being shutdown in the first half of the quarter. Storage attach rates in Puerto Rico were high, so this could be an interesting market as we ramp shipments of our Encharge storage systems. In Australia, we’ve been focused on winning new distributor and installer partners and our installer count in Q2 reached a multiyear high. The Australian market suffers from an abundance of low-quality products. With our differentiation on safe AC, reliability and customer service are allowing us to gain share. During Q3, we plan to introduce in Australia our highest power product, IQ 7A, which can pair with high power DC Modules up to 450 watts. This will help installers optimize their overall system cost and performance. In addition, we expect to ship microinverters for Maxeon AC Modules starting in Q4 '20. We expect sequential revenue growth from these initiatives through 2020 and beyond. Now that we covered the regions, let’s now talk about the overall bookings worldwide for the third quarter. At this point, we are 100% through the midpoint of Q3 revenue guidance. We cannot predict how COVID-19 is going to play out in August or September, so that’s always a risk. However, we feel very good about the progress we are making and the demand that we are seeing. Let’s now turn to new products. The feedback that we have received on our Encharge storage system has been quite good. Installers like the modularity, ease of installation and the all-in-one energy system, in addition to our trademark quality and service. Homeowners like the product’s functionality safe chemistry, one company to call, transparency of its inner workings, and the ability to go operate through the mobile app. Just to recap, I’d like to go through the features and benefits of the Encharge storage systems in detail. First, an all-in-one AC coupled system for distributed solar and storage; second, intelligent brownout with the built-in Enphase Power Start technology, which uses a software-based approach to mitigate initial demand spike from motor-driven appliances such as air conditioners and pumps. Third, there’s modular architecture along with UL 9540A fire certification based upon very safe lithium iron phosphate chemistry along with air cooling. And fourth is no single point of failure due to redundant microinverters in every Encharge 3.3 kilowatt hour battery. Fifth one is the standard easy-to-install performance of Enphase that all our long-tail installers are used to and come to expect now. The next one is unprecedented insight into solar and storage performance with the ability to go off grid simply through the mobile app. The last one is plug-and-play compatibility with existing and new Enphase solar systems with IQ microinverters. And one thing that is new is we are going to make the Encharge compatible with M-series PV systems, microinverter systems and we are going to introduce that in the fourth quarter of 2020. This is a big deal as it’s going to enable easier upgrades for 300,000 homeowners who have the M-series based solar system on their roofs. Let me quickly elaborate a little bit about the Power Start technology which helps to start motor-driven appliances like AC and pumps. We all know that there is an initial surge in power demand when you start an AC or a pump and that can collapse the home’s microgrid. Our Power Start technology uses a software-based approach to flatten that demand spike without impacting the user experience. I would like to provide a quick story to highlight this advantage. Our Chief Operating Officer recently installed Encharge on his home and his home runs the whole home pressure pump to supply well water. By the way, 13 million American homes rely on well water. Prior to joining Enphase, he was told by competition that he would need 40 kilowatt hours to start this pump. Enphase solved the challenge with only 23.3 kilowatt hours of Encharge battery. Let me caution that this system size reduction is dependent on the load profile of each home, but it does demonstrate the power of Ensemble. Enphase can create a better user experience despite a smaller battery size and that’s one of our key advantages. Not every kilowatt hour is the same as we like to say. Beyond Encharge, we have an exciting lineup of new products. We are making good progress on launching our IQ 8 PV, our grid-agnostic microinverter on the roof. With IQ 8, solar can power the home even when the grid is down without a battery. We are also moving quickly on our small commercial offering IQ 8D as well as the portable Ensemble-in-a-Box solution. Preliminary information on the IQ 8D is already on our website. Now that we have the base Ensemble platform in good shape, getting these products out will become more predictable. Let me briefly touch upon digital transformation. I talked about it during the prior earnings call. Our approach here is pretty simple -provide a great experience for both installers and homeowners through a comprehensive digital platform. Once installers and homeowners get on the platform, they should never ever leave it. In early July, we launched our Enphase Installer Network in the U.S., a network of trusted installers who deliver exceptional homeowner experiences using Enphase products. The Enphase Installer Network, or EIN as we like to call it, is the backbone of our digital platform. We have on-boarded more than 300 installers who will benefit from access to our digital platform that delivers homeowner leads, an array of tools for design proposal, financing, scheduling, and services such as permitting, labor, and incentive processing in order to improve their business efficiency. We plan to deliver these tools and services to the installers over the next few quarters. By providing our installers with best-in-class tools and services and by continuously being connected to them and homeowners digitally, we hope to take customer experience to a new level worldwide. In summary, we are pleased with the results for the second quarter considering the COVID-19 pandemic. The health and safety of our employees, customers and partners remain our top most priority. We are optimistic about the resurgence in market demand for the third quarter and excited about the ramp of our Encharge battery storage systems. We look forward to accelerating both our new products and digital transformation efforts over the next 18 months. Before I turn the call over to Eric to discuss our financials, I would like to briefly address a baseless short report that came out in June. Like the report issued by the same entity in 2018, this report is blatantly false and misleading. We operate with the highest standards of ethics and integrity. We run the company based upon our core values and will not compromise them come what may. We take great pride in the products that we create and operational excellence we have achieved till date. We will continue to focus on delivering the best customer experience, building great products with the highest quality standards and driving exceptional shareholder value. With that, I will hand the call over to Eric for his review of our finances. Eric?
Eric Branderiz: Thanks, Badri. I will provide more details related to our second quarter of 2020 financial results, as well as our business outlook for the third quarter of 2020. We have provided a reconciliation of these non-GAAP to GAAP financial measures in our earnings release posted today, which can also be found in the Investor Relations section of our website. Total revenue for the second quarter of 2020 was $125.5 million and did not include any revenue from safe harbor shipments during the quarter. Total revenue for the second quarter of 2020 decreased 39% sequentially and 6% year-over-year. Excluding the impact of $44.5 million of safe harbor revenue from the first quarter of 2020, second quarter revenue decreased 22% sequentially. We worked with our distribution and installer partners to cancel and push out orders as the industry adjusted to the new realities of operating during the COVID-19 pandemic. While this resulted in a material sequential decline in revenue, it was the correct action to bring channel inventory down to healthy levels and position Enphase well for the second half of 2020. We shipped approximately 355 megawatts DC in the second quarter of 2020. Non-GAAP gross margin for the second quarter of 2020 was 39.6%, a record, compared to 39.5% in the first quarter of 2020. I am extremely proud of the entire team for setting a record for non-GAAP gross margin when revenue declined on a sequential basis. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $26 million for the second quarter of 2020 compared to $28.5 million for the first quarter of 2020. The sequential decrease was primarily driven by lower bonuses, travel and entertainment expense and payroll taxes on vested equity. GAAP operating expenses were $37.5 million for the second quarter of 2020 compared to $36 million for the first quarter of 2020. GAAP operating expenses for the second quarter of 2020 included $11 million of stock-based compensation expenses and $546,000 of amortization expenses for acquired intangible assets. Stock-based compensation expenses for the second quarter were higher than forecast due to the timing difference of estimating the expense and receiving a third-party stock price forecast. We expect the stock-based compensation expenses to remain at this level for the next several quarters. On a non-GAAP basis, income from operations was $23.7 million for the second quarter of 2020 compared to $52.8 million for the first quarter of 2020. On a GAAP basis, income from operations was $10.9 million for the second quarter of 2020. On a non-GAAP basis, net income for the second quarter of 2020 was $23.5 million, compared to $51.9 million for the first quarter of 2020. This resulted in diluted earnings per share of $0.17 for the second quarter of 2020 compared to $0.38 for the first quarter of 2020. GAAP net loss for the second quarter of 2020 was $47.3 million, compared to net income of $68.9 million for the first quarter of 2020. GAAP net loss in the second quarter of 2020 included a non-cash charge of $59.7 million for the change in fair value of derivatives, partially offset by a $6.6 million income tax benefit. These non-cash charges relate to the convertible notes due 2025 that were issued in March 2020 and the hedging transaction to increase the effective commercial premium. At the time of issuance of the notes, we did not have enough authorized shares to sell the notes in anything but cash. As a result, the conversion option, convertible note hedge and warrant transactions which are referred to as derivative transactions require mark-to-market accounting. The mark-to-market loss of $59.7 million was mainly driven by our stock price doubling from $32 on March 31 to $64 on May 20, when our stockholders approved an increase in authorized common shares at our Annual Meeting. The approved increase in authorized shares enables us to settle the derivative transactions in cash, shares of common stock or a combination of the two at our discretion. Accordingly, the derivatives were remeasured at fair value and reclassified to additional paid-in-capital on the balance sheet in the second quarter of 2020. We no longer expect to report a change in fair value of derivatives in the income statement going forward. Let me also remind you that the GAAP net income in the first quarter of 2020 included a $15.3 million benefit from changes in fair value of derivatives related to the convertible notes due 2025 and an $11.9 million income tax benefit. The non-cash benefit of $15.3 million from changes in fair values of derivatives was primarily due to the decline in our share price from $43 on March 9 when we closed our 2025 convertible notes to $32 on March 31 of this year. GAAP diluted loss per share was $0.38 for the second quarter of 2020 compared to diluted earnings per share of $0.50 for the first quarter of 2020. GAAP diluted loss per share for the second quarter of 2020 included a $0.48 loss from the change in the fair value of derivatives and a $0.06 income tax benefit. Now turning to the balance sheet. Inventory was $31.2 million at the end of Q2 2020 compared to $34.6 million at the end of Q1 2020. The operations team did a great job of reducing inventory levels, despite the build-up required for the Encharge ramp. Accounts receivable were $89.5 million at the end of Q2 2020 compared to $95.5 million at the end of Q1 '20. The reduction was primarily due to lower shipment volume in Q2 '20 and enhanced collections efforts, offset by weaker shipment linearity in the quarter. Our finance team did an exceptional job managing customer credit risk and collections during the second quarter, resulting in a substantial improvement in accounts receivable quality compared to the prior quarters, despite the weaker economic, macroeconomic environment. We exited the second quarter of 2020 with a total cash balance of $607.3 million compared to $593.8 million in the first quarter of 2020. The cash balance in the quarter was reduced by $9.4 million for employees' withholding taxes to net settle stock compensation grants that vested in the second quarter of 2020. This prevented the issuance of approximately 177,000 shares. We did not make any share repurchases against our $200 million share repurchase authorization. We generated $25.4 million in cash flow from operations and $21 million in adjusted free cash flow for the second quarter of 2020. Capital expenditure was $4.4 million for Q2 '20, mainly to increase our Encharge battery capacity manufacturing improvements and the launch of our second contract manufacturing partner. As you know, the company has been paying Section 301 tariffs since late September 2018 on its microinverter products manufactured in China. As part of our tariff mitigation plans, we migrated a portion of our manufacturing to Mexico. We discovered that certain of our microinverter products met an exclusion to the Section 301 tariffs. This exclusion has strict limits on an inverter’s dimension and weight. Our relentless focus on driving down the component count on our microinverter through semiconductor integration enabled us to meet these limits. We, therefore, sought refunds from U.S. Customs and Border Protection for the tariffs we previously paid for these microinverters. We expect to have a positive material impact on our financial statements if all of the requested refunds are approved in the future. This totals approximately $39 million plus accrued interest. This has no material impact on our financial results for Q2 '20. This tariff exclusion will expire on August 7, 2020 and the company has already filed a comment supporting an extension of the tariff exclusion with the U.S. Trade Representative. We continue to pay Section 301 tariffs on our storage and communication products, as well as other accessories manufactured in China. Now let’s discuss our outlook for the third quarter of 2020. We expect our revenue for the third quarter of 2020 to be within a range of $160 million to $175 million. Our revenue guidance does not include any safe harbor shipment. Turning to margins, we expect GAAP gross margin to be within a range of 36% to 39% and for the non-GAAP gross margin to be within a range of 37% to 40%, which excludes stock-based compensation expense. We expect our GAAP operating expenses to be within a range of $41 million to $43 million, including a total of approximately $13 million estimated for stock-based compensation expenses and acquisition-related amortization. We expect non-GAAP operating expenses to be within a range of $28 million to $30 million. Please note that the Q3 guidance does not include any benefit from the tariff refunds or other nonrecurring items. With that, I will now open the line for questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question will come from Brian Lee from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Brian Lee: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. Maybe just to start on the 3Q revenue guide. How much battery storage revenue is embedded in the outlook? And then separately, I have a follow up on the cash run rate for Q4.
Badri Kothandaraman: Right. So, Brian, at this point we are not breaking out exactly the battery storage revenue. But we already told you, we expect 8% to 10% average storage attach rate in Q4 of '20. So you can calculate that number and do some extra provision for yourself. But it is a significant amount in Q3.
Brian Lee: Okay, fair enough. I guess, Badri, on the 8% to 10% attach rate for Q4, pretty basic question but can you remind you how you calculate that? I guess if you’re expecting lower shipments in Q4 versus what you had originally expected last year when you gave the 5% attach rate target at the Analyst Day prior to COVID, then is the 8% to 10% being driven by lower shipments or I guess how much of this is higher battery shipments versus just a lower denominator with microinverter shipments being lower as a result of COVID? So maybe if you can clarify that a bit?
Badri Kothandaraman: I’ll just tell you a general formula for calculating. Demand for microinverters is going to be the demand, whatever it is in the fourth quarter. At this time we have a general feeling that the market is picking up, so we expect that. So now you take with reference to the megawatts that we ship in the United States or North America, you take and you do an 8% to 10% attach of that. That gives you the rough number of megawatts attached storage. And that multiply by 2 hours will give you megawatt hours and that will give you a very reasonable number and that number is Q4 and you can interpolate what Q3 will be. And by the way, we are – like what I said, Q4 right now is demand limited – sorry, supply limited. We have – at this time, we are maxed out on our battery capacity in Q3 and we are bringing in capacities rapidly for Q4 and we are qualifying our second battery supplier in Q4. So we got a good story here on batteries.
Brian Lee: Okay. So just to be clear. I don’t want to put words in your mouth, but it sounds like it’s higher battery shipment volumes relative to your original targets, correct?
Badri Kothandaraman: Actually you’re right. Absolutely, yes.
Brian Lee: Okay. And then last one if I could squeeze it in and then I’ll pass it on is you mentioned 100% booked to the midpoint of the revenue guidance for Q3. Is that typical for this point in the quarter to be that fully booked or just kind of give us some context for that performance relative to what you’re historically used to seeing at this point in the quarter with respect to the visibility? Thanks, guys.
Badri Kothandaraman: Well, it depends. For example, in 2019 when we had the power set [ph] or capacity problem, at that time we were usually fully booked at the time of the earnings call. The last time when I told you, three months ago when I said, we are fully booked but we do expect cancellations due to COVID. This time, things look a little bit more upbeat. Obviously, I cannot predict what COVID will do August and September, but what we are seeing in terms of POS, we got a 26% improvement in North American POS weekly sell-through from June to April. We have 14% improvement from July to June in terms of the weekly POS. So we feel good in general. So we think 100% right now is a very healthy number.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Mark Strouse with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Mark Strouse: Yes. Good afternoon. Thank you very much for taking our questions. I was just hoping you could talk a little bit about how you plan around the upcoming election in the U.S. Regarding inventory levels and manufacturing just ahead of the election and then immediately after if there is a need to increase manufacturing, how quickly you could potentially do that?
Badri Kothandaraman: Right. We have flexible manufacturing capacity. Our entire strategy relies on the fact we have a scalable model and we have low CapEx by definition, because our contract manufacturing partners are able to do a great job for us. We were able to increase our microinverter capacity, for example, in 2019 to almost 2.5 million units per quarter. There is no reason why that cannot be stretched if there is a sudden increase in demand. Now for that reason, now I went and qualified in our second contract manufacturer in Salcomp, Chennai and we do have two factories with our first contract manufacturer, Flextronics, both in China as well as Mexico. That’s under microinverter side. On the storage side in terms of battery capacity, we do have one supplier right now. We’re not happy with the capacity that we have. We are scrambling in order to get another supplier up and running very, very soon by the beginning of the fourth quarter so we can start addressing that demand. And if it is required, we will not hesitate to get a third supplier very fast. And my plan right now is getting the third quarter in the middle of 2021. So in general, I think we are pretty well set in terms of manufacturing.
Mark Strouse: Okay. Thanks, Badri. And then just want to go back to your comments around the small commercial product. It sounds like it’s tracking expectations there, but I think previously you talked about a 4Q release stage for that. Is that still on track? Just wasn’t clear from the prepared remarks.
Badri Kothandaraman: The IQ 8D product, let me just quickly elaborate about that product. It’s a microinverter for servicing two panels. It’s a 640 watt AC microinverter, outstanding power density and it’s able to address the key need of rapid shutdown with the traditional high-quality and customer service trademark of Enphase. And the main reason for us launching it is because it’s a natural extension of the residential market serviced by the same long-tail installers and distributors. So what have we done? We are making very nice progress on it. The design is completely done. And now we are basically working on the system performance. We already released preliminary information on the Web site. We think we can have beta piloting by the end of the year. That’s an aggressive date right now, but I’m holding my team to that standard. We’ll give a better update in the next three months, in the next earnings call, but we feel optimistic there.
Mark Strouse: Okay. I’ll follow up. Thank you very much.
Badri Kothandaraman: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Brad Meikle with Williams Trading. Please go ahead.
Brad Meikle: Thanks for taking my question. Could you add any more color on the recovery that you saw in May, June and July by region across the U.S. and internationally? Thanks.
Badri Kothandaraman: Right. First, let me actually come to Europe. Europe is a great story for us. Despite COVID, Q2 grew from Q1. We believe this is because we staffed the team really well. We basically had – we hired all the sales folks and we are actually expanding into more countries. And what they’re finding is in places like Netherlands, et cetera, simply because now we have more feet on the street, we are able to address more accounts, we are able to do more installer visits, we are able to win more distributors. So we are doing that well. And Netherlands and France are really – Netherlands, Belgium and France are really nice for us. In addition, we have started working Germany, we have started working Poland, we have started working Austria and that’s going pretty well. So I’m really happy with that team. And like what I said, in Q3 we expect much more significant growth compared to Q2. With reference to the U.S., we saw that California was a little bit down in April. We saw New York and New Jersey were also almost out in April. But we have seen healthy trends towards June. California is almost back. New York, New Jersey are back. Florida and Texas were quite strong in Q2. However, you guys all know that there is some minor setback or there is some setback in Florida due to increased COVID cases in July. It doesn’t seem to have affected the solar installations much, but you never know going forward. However, California, New York and New Jersey are still strong. So we are generally optimistic that demand is coming back. And like what I said, every week we see better point of sales, sell-through from our distributors to the installers versus the previous. Like what I said, July is 14% higher than June so that is what is happening in the U.S.
Brad Meikle: Thank you, Badri. Could you also add any color on – with the strong demand for storage, is that – how broad based is that regionally across the U.S.? Is it all California or how many states are you seeing participating in? I imagine a lot of it’s from North California where the outages are most severe. And then could you add any color on what the attachment rate might get to next year? Thank you.
Badri Kothandaraman: Next year is too early to predict, Brad, but you are right. Predominant demand is from California and Florida. That’s most of the demand. And we have started – like what I said, we shipped pilot systems in June. We shipped it to a bunch of installers and they have been very happy with the product. What they like about the product is it’s an all-in one AC coupled system for solar and storage. It is ideal for long-tail installers who really value quality and service. We have this amazing feature which is the Power Start technology which uses a software approach to mitigate demand spike, so that appliances like air conditioners and pumps can be easily started with Encharge versus other competitive solutions. We have this modular architecture where you don’t need to add in very high quantum of energy, you add only in steps of 3.3 kilowatt hours of energy and that’s important. Because if you see even in our executive team, I have a 16.6 kilowatt hour and Eric has got 20 kilowatt hour, Jeff McNeil has got 23.3 kilowatt hour. So it matters. We are able to fine-tune the storage to exactly what they want because that’s an important thing. The UL 9540 certification based on lithium iron phosphate chemistry, safe chemistry, basically no cobalt, air cooling versus other systems that use liquid cooling, redundant microinverters. I have multiple microinverters in one Encharge 3.3 kilowatt hours – I have four microinverters in a 3.3 kilowatt hour battery. If one of the four is not working, it’s not the end of the world. The charging and discharging rate is going to drop a little bit, but it’s not the end of the world. The system will continue to perform. One more cool feature is the ability to go off grid through the app. And that I particularly like because it helps – it is cool. With a click of a button you’re suddenly disconnected from the utility. And you know what, I do experiments all the time. I spent a weekend completely off grid. My wife doesn’t even know it. So more and more – we hope more and more people would use that feature. We also gave the customers unprecedented insight into solar and storage performance. Like for example, from the app you’ll be able to see what the microgrid voltage is, what the frequency is. Every microinverter in every Encharge 3.3 kilowatt hour whether that is working, how does the connectivity look like and how much is each microinverter discharging. We provided lot of insights, so the homeowners who really want to know the details, they know it and they have the comfort that there is technology in the back working all the time. So that’s a key. And then the last one is an important one. Obviously, I have plug and play with the IQ microinverters, but now a lot of folks came to us and they wanted Encharge to be compatible to the M-series. So I’ve had a team of people going and working on this. And we are happy to say that we can release that towards the end of Q4. And I think that will be a big deal, because it will help easier upgrades for 300,000 homeowners, so we are excited about it overall, Brad.
Brad Meikle: Thank you very much. My last question is, is there any update on the launch and the ramp of the rooftop IQ 8 which would enable a solar array without storage to operate during the day? What percentage of volume do you think that could be next year? Thank you.
Badri Kothandaraman: Right. Now that there’s Ensemble, I call this 1.0, this is now under control – storage is under control, the top most priority for the company is to work on 2.0, which is the IQ 8 PV, IQ 8 on the roof, which basically means a grid agnostic microinverter. And said another way, you have a free battery on your roof for 12 hours during the day. So basically, again, I expect a very similar timeline as IQ 8D. I expect in four months we will have pilot – we will start piloting towards the installers. And within a few weeks after that, we will be able to release that product.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Colin Rusch with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.
Colin Rusch: Thanks so much, guys. Can you talk a little bit more about the channel dynamics, particularly in Europe for you? Is there still some sell-in into some new geographies that you’re benefitting from in the third quarter and is that something that may continue on for the balance of the year? I know you’re guiding for the fourth quarter.
Badri Kothandaraman: Look, Europe is actually doing extremely well and Europe, the amount of inventory in the channel is pretty less. The POS is nice. No concerns on the channel being full. In fact, the channel is lean right now.
Colin Rusch: All right. And then just about pricing for the storage product, certainly there’s a number of products that seem to be in the market in the next couple of quarters. How are you thinking about that dynamic? You’ve been pretty disciplined around the microinverters. But if there are multiple products in the market, are you going to have to be a bit more active on the pricing side in your expectations?
Badri Kothandaraman: Right. We agree with that concept. But the way we have done pricing is we say the next best alternative, we take that and we compare the value that we generate with respect to that. Our bread and butter are the long-tail installers. And these long-tail installers are really excited because they have for the first time an AC coupled all-in-one plug and play solar and storage system, ideal for them with the trademark quality and service. Quality and service matters. So I would say, like what I said in my annual report. The biggest reason for the growth of our company in 2019 was IQ 7, and IQ 7 was a fantastic product. But the key differentiator was highest quality [indiscernible] in our target. I’m not been shy to say our target is 500 dBm. 500 dBm means 0.05%. That’s our target. And IQ 7 helped us to come closer to that target and that helped us to get a huge market share. So very similar here. We got a great AC coupled system for both solar and storage, ideal for the long-tail. And then, like what I rattled, the intelligent brownout. That matters actually for homeowners when they want to run air conditioners and pumps seamlessly. The modular architecture means that the homeowner doesn’t waste more dollars than he needs to, at the same time modular architecture helps the installer really made the installer – install a breeze. The UL 9540 certification is important because that’s fire safety certification. That’s possible because the lithium iron phosphate gives you enhanced thermal stability compared to the other chemistry. Redundant microinverters, I already told. Air cooling is another big deal and installers like that because it is more reliable. You have air cooling versus a liquid cold system, right. The unprecedented insight into solar and storage performance and going upgrade through the app, we think the homeowners will love that transparency and that’s what they expect from Enphase. And the last one is, we have 1 million homes. Out of 1 million homes, there is probably a lot with IQ. There is 300,000 with M-series. By making it compatible seamlessly with those, we think we have a lot to gain there. So I hope I gave you some color there.
Colin Rusch: Yes, that’s helpful. Thank you so much.
Badri Kothandaraman: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Eric Stine with Craig-Hallum. Please go ahead.
Eric Stine: Hi, everyone. Thanks for taking the questions.
Badri Kothandaraman: Hi.
Eric Stine: Hello. So just curious, you were just touching on storage and the M-series compatibility. Just curious if you’re able to or willing to maybe what type of demand do you expect you may see for that, whether it’s on launch or in 2021? And then how should we view the microinverter upgrade program in that context? I know one of the reasons that you would upgrade would be so that you could have storage to upgrade to the IQ series.
Badri Kothandaraman: Right. It’s too early to talk about 2021, but I’ll tell you what. The whole point of the M-series – people with M-series microinverters is they don’t need to upgrade their microinverters and they can buy Encharge storage from us. So obviously if I turn on all the 300,000 homes, if I start advertising through them, I need to have the capacity to be able to do that. So we need to thread that carefully, work with the homeowner as well and get a lot more capacity. The other interesting thing that you said is there will be many of the micro – many of these M-series guys who say, I want IQ 8 on the roof. And the IQ 8 on the roof is going to come, like what I said, we are going to start piloting towards the end of the fourth quarter. And so that – some of those 300,000 homeowners with M-series are going to say, I want IQ 8. So it’s too early to tell at this point. Maybe I’ll add more color in three months. And the good news is, we are going to have a lot of demand. That’s the bottom line.
Eric Stine: Yes. So we should read it, it’s not that you’re necessarily deemphasizing the upgraded series to the IQ 8 or the IQ series, it’s more just getting options to the install base?
Badri Kothandaraman: That’s right.
Eric Stine: Okay. Got it.
Eric Branderiz: It’s Eric. One more thing. We have planned capacity of 480 megawatt hours for next year, right? So that’s the starting point. The other thing, remember this upgrade program is going really well right now with the M190 series, which is a real success. So now we are talking about incorporating all the Ms, we’re going to be able to – if they choose to do so, take a batter to work with Enphase product. That’s another thing. The third one is, the same people may say, I may as well use this as an opportunity. I changed my mind. If we get a good deal, I can maybe try IQ 7 or even IQ 8, right, like Badri mentioned. So that’s kind of the mindset.
Eric Stine: Yes. Okay. That’s great. And then maybe last one for me. I know part of your strategy over the last couple of years on the pricing side and you have recently refocused a little bit on Tier 1s and making inroads with Sunrun. So just curious, would the Sunrun-Vivint combination thoughts on the impact that might have on your business going forward?
Badri Kothandaraman: Yes. We have made it clear that we like long-tail installers a lot. We like Tier 1 installers as long as they recognize the value that we have and we have a strategic relationship. We have a very good relationship with Sunrun. It’s too early to tell what your strategy is going to be after the merger. We are doing well with them. And the most important thing is our quality and our customer service. If we maintain that, there is no reason why we cannot have continued good relationship.
Eric Branderiz: And with SunPower as well --
Badri Kothandaraman: Same with SunPower and also with Sunnova, the same thing.
Eric Stine: Got it. Okay. I’ll jump back in the line. Thanks.
Badri Kothandaraman: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Maheep Mandloi with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
Maheep Mandloi: Hi. Thanks for taking the questions. Most of them have been asked, but one quick question just on the IQ 8D. Could you just clarify like on the timing for IQ 8 and IQ 8D, are those tools tied together because of the same architecture or does one come ahead of the other? Just trying to see if there are any milestones which we need to keep track of on those launches.
Badri Kothandaraman: They are not necessarily tied. However, they do have the base hardware architecture that was finalized a long time ago. They are two projects. Both of them average similar timelines. I do expect pilot runs, like what I said in December to installers. Based upon the feedback from them, a few weeks give or take from that time. So we expect a lot of revenue from those products in 2021.
Maheep Mandloi: Then, could you tell us – I think on the Analyst Day, you spoke about serviceable market of $1.5 billion for that small commercial. How much do you expect or when do you expect to reach most part of that market with --?
Badri Kothandaraman: Yes, we talked about the small commercial market as a nice extension of the residential market. We said the value proposition that we offer are basically rapid shutdown compliant, high quality, high customer experience. We also said there is no reason why we cannot get a fair share of this small commercial market, like the residential market. Obviously market share gains when you enter a new market take time, so there will be a linear ramp to it. But let’s say two years from the ramp – two or three years from the ramp, you should expect us to be at same market share on where we are at residential for small commercial.
Maheep Mandloi: Got it, that makes sense. And then just one last one on IQ 8D and a lot of them from me on that topic, but it does expand the power capacity of the inverters. Are you doing any inquiries on using IQ 8D for residential markets and price-sensitive international residential markets?
Badri Kothandaraman: It’s obviously – the question has come up. You’re not the first one. We haven’t finalized our strategy yet, but I think it’s a good concept on basically using it for us in order to bolster our market share in Asia Pacific, Australia, for example, and we are still thinking about it. But the nice thing is the technology is amazing. We are able to get 50% higher power density there, which is great. So we’ll keep you informed.
Maheep Mandloi: Got it. And just one last thing on modeling from my side. So operating expenses obviously regained control in Q2 and Q3, but how should we think about Q4 and going forward with respect to that target of operating margin for the business?
Badri Kothandaraman: We have an operating model. The operating model is 35, 15 and 20. That’s how you should model. The Q2 was a little bit of an anomaly due to COVID, but in general that’s the financial baseline.
Maheep Mandloi: Got it. Thanks for taking my questions.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Philip Shen with ROTH Capital Partners.
Philip Shen: Hi, everyone. Thanks for taking the questions. Can you provide a little bit more color on the visibility you have into Q4? How much is booked for the quarter and for your business? And what kind of discussions are you guys having as it relates to safe harbor? Have they started at all? Do you expect – I know the ITC and the potential for an extension there may impact things, but just curious if you’re having any discussions yet? And what kind of visibility you have in Q4?
Badri Kothandaraman: Phil, it’s too early for me to talk about Q4. I don’t have any visibility on safe harbor shipments. We have no safe harbor revenue assumed in Q3 guidance. We already told you and leaned in a little bit forward, talked about the 8% to 10% storage attach. That’s what I can give you right now.
Philip Shen: Okay. Thanks, Badri. As it relates to – you were talking about the pricing strategy earlier on the storage product. Can you talk through also the margins? Do you continue to expect storage to have similar margins through the corporate average? And how do you – as we get into '21, how do you think that pricing in the margin profile could trend?
Badri Kothandaraman: Yes is the answer. It’s going to be aligned to our corporate margins. And then we like how we have an excellent cost reduction program on the microinverters. We are using the same principles to drive world-class cost on the batteries, the cell packs, the BMUs, the battery controller, the enclosure, a time for switch. We are addressing everything holistically and we are making a lot of progress there. We are confident we can maintain our gross margins even in 2021.
Philip Shen: Thanks. And then as it relates to the Mexico capacity and also your new contract manufacturer, when do you expect to be able to serve 100% of the U.S. demand from non-tariff locations? Are we looking at Q4? Could it be in Q1? And how much – I don’t know if you gave this, sorry if I missed it, but how much of Q2 was served by Mexico and how much of Q3 do you expect to be served from non-tariff locations?
Badri Kothandaraman: Right. So in general, what I said was Mexico can do up to 1 million microinverters per quarter, that’s required. Now we have Salcomp. Salcomp in Chennai is ramping in Q4, so it’s too early to talk about that. But there is no reason why that cannot be a nice number in the middle of 2021. So that will basically cover the U.S. demand. And if the 1 million units is not enough, it’s easy for us. Within a quarter we – or rather it takes us a quarter. Once we make a decision to increase that capacity from 1 to 1.5, all we need to do is to invest the capital and move forward in Mexico. That’s the advantage of working with somebody very strong, like Flex. It’s easy to do it. What was your other question, Phil?
Philip Shen: Thanks, Badri. How much volume was served from Mexico in Q2 and then expectations for Q3?
Badri Kothandaraman: We normally do not break it out, but in this case because of COVID, because of our demand situation was less, the fraction that was manufactured in Mexico wasn’t that high. I would say it was less than 50% of the overall shipments.
Philip Shen: Great. That was for Q2. Expectations for Q3?
Badri Kothandaraman: Expectations for Q3, we don’t really break it out, Phil. So I’ll ask Eric to talk about it or to give you the data. I don’t have it with me right now.
Philip Shen: Okay. Thanks. I’ll pass it on.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Mike Cikos with Needham & Co. Please go ahead.
Mike Cikos: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the time on the call here. I just wanted to circle up on the training of the installers. If we’re talking about Encharge with the installers, how is that progressing versus your internal expectations? And also wanted to try and get a read as far as what would be involved or how involved the process would be for training installers on the IQ 8D smaller commercial microinverters?
Badri Kothandaraman: Right. In general, we are pivoting to online training. This is available right now or Enphase University is online. You can take – there are about eight courses on Ensemble that an installer has to take in order to achieve provisional certification. It takes several hours and you cannot go through that training without proper focus and understanding because there is quiz after each course. That’s going very successfully. About 130 for installer personnel have already completed that online training and in addition to those who completed face-to-face training at Enphase prior to COVID. In addition, we have 530 plus people basically taking the course as we speak and they usually have a cycle time of a couple of weeks in order to finish that course. The nice thing from that course is we have an NPS, Net Promoter Score, of 80%. That means everybody likes the course. They’re able to understand it. I have done the course myself; very intuitive, very nice. And we’ll adopt the same for IQ 8D. What we’ve realized from the Ensemble exercise is that it is a very complex system, got solar, storage, communication, transfer switch and so we have adopted the same approach on IQ 8D which is focusing on the end system and understanding the system performance versus thinking about it, like a micro, thinking about it holistically. We will make sure those aspects are included in the training for the installers and we’ll have the training online.
Mike Cikos: Thanks for that. Then one more, if I may. If we’re looking out to Q4 in this 8% to 10% attach rate that we’ve been talking about for the Encharge, does this consider at all I guess demand from your currently installed base or is this still primarily coming from new installs?
Badri Kothandaraman: The current install base is who we serve. We do business with almost 1,500 long-tail installers every year in the United States and this is our main – they are our customers. And they are serviced through distributors. They all have a nice storage demand, especially the long-tail installers in California and Florida. They have basically nice storage demand. And we already have them. They know us. They are very familiar with how to contact Enphase. They like our quality. They like our customer service. So they are the ones who are going to be ramping with us.
Mike Cikos: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Jeffrey Campbell with Tuohy Brothers. Please go ahead.
Jeffrey Campbell: Good afternoon. Thanks for getting me on. Badri, how would you characterize Maxeon’s decision to produce the IQ 7 AC Module versus your prior relationship with SunPower? On the outside, this seems like a bigger commitment to the Enphase solutions?
Badri Kothandaraman: When I presented to you guys, the investor community on the SunPower transaction, at that time I said one of the possibilities from that I was excited about was in addition to the North American business which was a commitment, there was a possibility of getting the international business, especially Europe and Australia. That’s now coming to fruition and it’s obvious, right. SunPower has an enormous success with their Equinox AC Module. And there is no reason why that concept will not work elsewhere. So they have made the right decision, which is to work with the best microinverter maker in the world. And now both of us are going together with the best panel on the market plus the best microinverter in the market.
Jeffrey Campbell: Right. My second question was I was wondering if there were any digital innovations that you’ve made in response to CV-19 [ph], maybe such as Enphase University or others that you might want to point out, that you intend to maintain even after some return to normal life, there’s more under control.
Badri Kothandaraman: Right. We are only scratching the surface there. Obviously, the Enphase University is a nice thing. The Enphase Installer Network is something that we introduced and this one is a powerful one. We classified installers into Platinum, Gold and Silver. These are the installers who trust us and we trust them. That was the best step that we did. But I think we have a lot – bigger plans in terms of digital transformation. The name of the game is how we can provide those installers the right tools and services so that we can maximize their productivity that it is going to be a no-brainer for them to chose Enphase all the time, every time. And that’s something that we are working on. And we will share a lot more things there when we are ready.
Eric Branderiz: So the COVID-19 situation already prompted pretty much everybody to become much more digitalized. But at the same time we launched EIN, which is Enphase Installer Network, with a high reward on NPS and a lot of things in terms of the quality of the design, the training capabilities, the market share of the installer in terms of using our technology and so on. So I think that all these things are converging and with the easy of the tools, small installers really appreciate being part of our platform, right. They don’t have resources necessarily to deploy our digital tools, some of them pretty sophisticated, right? So they need to have a potpourri of a variety of tools that they need to achieve or get through the Web. Here, we bring it altogether nice with a complete platform, with a great customer service and with the reward of a classification at the installer level. So it’s a perfect timing to [indiscernible] consolidate, we did it.
Jeffrey Campbell: Right. Yes, that seems like a very smart investment in the installer tiers that are your strengths. My last question was, if I understood correctly, earlier in the remarks you mentioned some disappointment with your current battery supplier. I was just wondering, was this due to more demand than you expected or was it some sort of issue on the supplier side? Thanks.
Badri Kothandaraman: It’s all about ramp. When you have a new product, you always have teething [ph] issues in the ramp. But here it is a combination of heavy increased demand that we see for the fourth quarter and what we saw in the third quarter. So it’s about ramping our current supplier and getting on capacity with the new supplier, ramping that new supplier and getting to our 480 megawatt hours that we talked about.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Joseph Osha with JMP Securities. Please go ahead.
Joseph Osha: Hello, everyone. Thank you.
Badri Kothandaraman: Hi.
Joseph Osha: I have two questions first. Going back to 8D, I’m wondering if you might share with us what you think is sort of the practical upper limit might be in terms of your system size, a couple hundred kilowatts maybe? I know from an engineering standpoint it’s larger than that. But what might be from an economics standpoint a practical upper limit for system size?
Raghu Belur: Hi. This is Raghu. The IQ 8D has been designed specifically targeted towards the small commercial, so the 200 kilowatt limit is about where we are targeting because of the value that we bring in that segment. It’s rooftop, so there’s a regulatory requirement for rapid shutdown as an example. Our installer partners who do residential also do installs of that – typically of that size anywhere from 15 kilowatts to 100 kilowatts to 200 kilowatts. And they also really like the simplicity of it. In fact, I could argue that IQ 8D is yet again simpler to install because of it’s a two panel, one microinverter, the cabling, et cetera, makes the installation extremely simple. So it really plays very well to needing the requirements of our installer partners who are installing in that segment in the small commercial segment.
Joseph Osha: Okay. Thank you. That’s helpful. 200 kW. And then on the storage side, I’m curious as your own product ramps, what is the house position on third-party storage? Are you willing to do it? Will you actively discourage it? You not care in particular if some larger developers come back and start pushing you on working with third-party storage. What’s your position there?
Badri Kothandaraman: On third-party storage, we have not taken a position right now. We say that everyone must use us right now. But there are companies – currently the existing storage systems, some of the most popular ones do easily work automatically with the Enphase solar system. So it’s not that we need to do something. It is that they already work.
Raghu Belur: Yes, so a couple of comments there. This is the power of the AC coupled architecture. People can come in and interconnect into an existing microinverter system which we have there. However, the benefits that you get from having our old storage system, a complete all-in-one system, Badri alluded to earlier on, the user experience will be significantly better when you have a micro on the roof and you have Encharge and you have microgrid interconnect device or the ATS. You have one app, you have one phone call to make, one training, one procurement. Just the all-in-one solution is extremely powerful. And of course, our storage solution is also LFP-based, lithium iron phosphate based, so it comes with added benefit of additional safety and performance because of how it does thermally. So, in short, yes, third-party storage systems are connecting, AC coupled into our micro, but the benefits of having our solution is significantly higher.
Joseph Osha: But it is possible and you wouldn’t actively stop it if people continue to do that? Obviously, your own system is going to be better, but it’s something that you would allow people to continue to do?
Badri Kothandaraman: Yes, correct.
Joseph Osha: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Dave Kang with B. Riley. Please go ahead.
Unidentified Analyst: Hi. This is Danny [ph] on for Dave. Thanks for taking the question. I was wondering if you could comment on the impact of COVID on revenues for the second quarter.
Badri Kothandaraman: The impact of COVID was that our revenue declined by 22% overall, excluding safe harbor. That was the impact for the second quarter.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay, great. Thank you. And I was wondering if you could comment on the current run rate in Mexico. We have 70,000 [ph] a week that you had in May. I was wondering if you have any current numbers on that.
Badri Kothandaraman: Right. We are no longer limited by the capacity in Mexico. And because of the reduced demand situation, overall, there was excess capacity and that’s a nice thing for us to work with the contract manufacturers, like Flex. So the Mexico factory was not loaded fully. And you saw our results that the inventory – we reduced the inventory in such a tough quarter. We dropped the inventory from $34 million to $31 million. That was excellent inventory management by the team. So Mexico is no longer a capacity problem. We do have all the capacity and we can – like what I said, we can make 1 million units per quarter – by Q4 '20, that’s not an issue.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question will come from Amit Dayal with H.C. Wainwright. Please go ahead.
Amit Dayal: Hi, guys. Thank you for taking my questions. I’ll be quick. The 8% to 10% attach rate, Badri, for storage, is this based off of any bookings you are seeing or some other type of estimate you’re applying?
Badri Kothandaraman: It is obviously based upon the demand profile that we have, based upon the bookings we have, based upon preorders we originally had and conversation with the distributors which are real, so yes.
Amit Dayal: Understood. Okay. And on the deployment side for Encharge, can you just give us some color on how it works between when somebody places an order and when somebody can receive it and it’s all working for the customer?
Badri Kothandaraman: Right. So basically, look, our channel is distributors. Enphase ships product to distributors. Distributors ship product to installers. Installers install products at the homeowners, right. That’s how the supply chain looks. And when distributors place orders – obviously when we are not full, our cycle time is anywhere between six to eight weeks. When we are full, meaning when we are maxed out of capacity, that cycle time obviously will get extended. And typically now because the products are flying off distributor shelves, there that cycle time is truncated. And especially because of the fire season right now in Northern California and installs that are happening furiously right now. I’m giving you a long answer. It’s a – typical cycle time should be from when we ship to when homeowners get it installed in a typical time when I’m not constrained by capacity, it should be around a quarter.
Amit Dayal: Understood. So how does this potentially impact how you manage inventory going forward when this starts scaling up for you? Obviously you’d probably want to keep a little bit of inventory of this. Any color on that would be helpful?
Badri Kothandaraman: That’s where we need very strong contract manufacturing partners and we do have just in time inventory models. We work a lot of suppliers. This is what Flextronics does and we work really closely with them. And we are confident that we can ramp product at the same time, ensure that we don’t build excess inventory.
Eric Branderiz: As a matter of fact, these experiences that we have with flex [ph] and with the coronavirus, right, flexing the inventory levels and working with their inventory levels that the contract manufacturers, those were incredibly valuable because that is strengthening the connections from the business processes at very much lower levels, right, meaning we do know exactly how much inventory they have of every single component that they source for our systems. And they flex it pretty quickly, because they don’t want to have the inventory on their books and they can ramp it very, very quickly working with their suppliers. So I think we’re in good shape in terms of business processes there.
Badri Kothandaraman: And the product advantage as well, right. If you look within our Encharge, we have the microinverter within Encharge as well. So the same microinverter that’s on the roof is also within Encharge. So that helps in the inventory management side as well.
Amit Dayal: Understood. That’s all I have, guys. Thank you so much.
Badri Kothandaraman: Thank you.
Eric Branderiz: Thank you.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes our question-and-answer session for today. I would now like to turn the call back over to Mr. Badri Kothandaraman for any further remarks.
Badri Kothandaraman: Thank you for joining us today and for your continued support of Enphase. We look forward to speaking with you again during the Q3 2020 earnings call. Goodbye.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today’s conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect and have a wonderful day.

===== 2020 Q1  (2020-05-06 16:30:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to the Enphase Energy's First Quarter 2020 Financial Results Conference Call. At this time, all participants' lines are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions].  I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Adam Hinckley. Thank you. And please go ahead, sir.
Adam Hinckley: Good afternoon. And thank you for joining us on today's conference call to discuss Enphase Energy's first quarter 2020 results.  On today's call are Badri Kothandaraman, Enphase's President and Chief Executive Officer; Eric Branderiz, Chief Financial Officer; and Raghu Belur, Chief Products Officer.

Now, I would like to introduce Badri Kothandaraman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Enphase Energy. Badri?
Badri Kothandaraman: Good afternoon. And thanks for joining us today to discuss our first quarter of 2020 financial results. I hope all of you are staying safe and healthy.  We had a good quarter considering the COVID-19 pandemic. We reported revenue of $205.5 million and shipped approximately 2 million microinverters.  I'm very proud of the fact that our global teams did an excellent job navigating the manufacturing and logistics disruptions in China due to COVID-19 in order to ensure on-time customer deliveries.  We reached an all-time record for gross margin, driven by both disciplined pricing and cost management. We exited the first quarter at approximately 40%, 14% and 26%, outperforming our baseline financial model. This means 40% gross margin, 14% operating expenses, 26% operating income, all as a percentage of revenue on a non-GAAP basis. As a reminder, our target baseline financial model is 35%, 15%, 20%.  When we last spoke in middle of February, the general concern was primarily around supply disruptions in China due to COVID-19. At that time, our teams were on top of the situation on a daily basis and managed the situation very well.  The demand in the US remained strong through early March, as distributors wanted to ensure they had adequate inventory. We were seeing excellent bookings for Q2 at that time, and were poised to rebound well from a seasonally soft Q1.  However, since early March, the spread of the pandemic worldwide has resulted in a significant downward pressure on worldwide demand due to current shelter in place restrictions.  Even though solar installations have been allowed as essential services in some locations, the ability to generate new sales has been hindered due to social distancing and economic uncertainty. I'll give you more color on the regions later in the call.  Let's now talk about how we are servicing customers in these times. I'm very happy to report that our customer service personnel in all four worldwide locations – US, Europe, India and Australia – are fully supporting our installers and homeowners while working from home. We have not missed a beat in supporting them as all our systems are cloud based.  I'm particularly pleased that our Q1 net promoter score in North America was 72% compared to 56% in Q4. This dramatic quarter-over-quarter improvement was the result of many initiatives, such as retraining our agents, matching orphaned sites to active installers for better servicing, and improving our tools, processes and systems.  Our average call wait time increased slightly in Q1 to approximately 90 seconds. We have taken corrective actions, such as optimizing customer notifications from our Enlighten cloud, enhancing self-service and chat capabilities to reduce call volumes and lower our wait times to 60 seconds or less. In addition, we are working regularly on continuous improvement to the Enlighten mobile app for homeowners as well as installers.  We're also very pleased with the momentum in the Enphase online store in the US, which now has got many of our latest products, including IQ 7 based AC modules available for sale.  I want to spend a couple of minutes on quality. We made excellent progress in 2019, dropping our IQ 7 defects by a third and getting closer to our 0.05% annual failure rate target.  Our always-on connectivity strategy, combined with our semiconductor and software-defined architecture, along with 8D problem solving methodology were instrumental in making this happen.  While we're planning to continue these actions aggressively in 2020, we have started focusing on storage as well. For example, our quality teams have been intimately involved in the design and reliability of our Encharge storage system from day one.  We believe that designing in, quality and reliability upfront will improve our top line due to better customer experience and bolster gross margins due to warranty expense reductions in the long term.  Let's now turn our attention to Mexico contract manufacturing facility that continues to ramp nicely for us. The facility has been deemed essential and has not experienced any significant production disruptions till date.  We manufactured more than 700,000 IQ 7 microinverters in Mexico during Q1 and exited the quarter at a weekly run rate of more than 70,000 units. We feel very confident in the ability to produce over a million units by Q4 2020, if justified by product demand. Let's touch upon overall inventory management. Given the reduced demand situation in Q2 of 2020, we are working very closely with our contract manufacturing partners to optimize our inventory builds both in China and Mexico.  Maintaining a tight lid on inventory is very critical for us, especially in times like this. However, it is important to note we are not compromising one bit on our Encharge storage ramp and are executing on all the necessary builds there. Moving on to the regions. Our US and international mix for Q1 was 84% and 16%, respectively, excluding safe harbor revenue. Europe, Asia-Pacific and Latin America all demonstrated sequential growth in Q1 compared to the US that had a slight seasonal decline in Q1.  We continued to make solid progress in acquiring new installers and growing our US business in Q1. As a result, we have seen a strong increase in sell-through from our distributors to installers by approximately 37% over the last six months ending March.  Recent installer wins include PetersenDean, Amica Solar [ph], RSI Energy and a whole bunch of small and medium sized installers. A number of these new installers also plan to offer storage in addition to solar. We are excited about bringing them on board and look forward to ramping the business with them as COVID-19 subsides.  In the US, we are hearing industry reports of a 30% to 50% drop in residential installations in April. Some states like New York and California are experiencing even bigger drops. With the near-term demand disruptions to the industry, we are taking all necessary reactions to keep our channel inventory in check.  With the lower sell-through in April, we are working closely with installers and distributors to optimize their existing inventory. We believe that this will result in a healthier organic pattern when installer sales activities pick up after restrictions on shelter in place are relaxed.  While the short term is painful and uncertain, we see a few long-term benefits for Enphase and the solar industry. Let's talk about the first one. For example, San Luis Obispo County in California introduced electronic permitting for microinverter-based PV systems in early April 2020. We are pleased that the building department recognizes the safety advantages of our AC architecture.  The second benefit is installers are rapidly adapting to the COVID-19 challenge by embracing virtual selling using digital tools. This is going to be a major trend in the future.  Third, we also believe that the pandemic will bring self-sufficiency to the forefront of the homeowners mind, particularly around energy storage, and we are in a great position to service homeowners, especially as our high quality solar and storage solutions can help them save money during difficult economic times, as well as providing energy security.  Now, let's talk about Europe. Europe, we made nice progress in Q1, more than doubling the revenue from Q4. As previously discussed, we have tripled our sales force in that region and we are working diligently with installers and distributors, while leveraging our high quality and customer service. We are excited by the opportunities in Netherlands, Spain, Germany and Belgium.  We also have a couple of AC module solutions that provide us with added differentiation. In fact, we expect Q2 sales to be in line with Q1 despite the pandemic reflecting the nice progress we are making. We previously indicated that our goal this year was to double sales in Europe from the prior year. It's going to be a little bit difficult given the pandemic, but we have not given up on it yet.  Both Asia-Pacific and Latin America demonstrated revenue increases compared to Q4. In Australia, we secured RACV, the equivalent of AAA in the United States, with 2.2 million members as a new landmark customer. We also introduced a partnership with Rexel to expand our Australian solar distribution network.  Again, our strategy here is pretty simple. Focus on the basics like increasing installer visits and training and promoting high quality safe AC.  We do expect a slowdown in this region in Q2 due to the pandemic, but with our solid growth initiatives and the talented team in place, we believe we are well positioned to grow for the long term.  In Latin America, our Q1 revenue sharply increased, primarily due to sales of our IQ 7 microinverters in Puerto Rico. We expect to make a lot more strides in this region with our Encharge storage product, which is coming soon.  Let's now turn to new products. I want to talk a little bit about how our engineers are doing. Despite the restrictions imposed by the lockdowns, our engineers have been working very hard to find ways to accelerate development, automate testing efforts and implement remote debugging.  In the US, we are in complete lockdown with the exception of very few engineers to support essential business activities or minimum basic operation.  In New Zealand, the government imposed a complete lockdown and just allowed partial opening up offices in the last week of April.  In India, a handful of engineers were able to get permission from the local authorities to do essential work.  We acknowledge the effort from all of our employees for their tremendous dedication to Enphase in these times. I'm really proud of them.  Nevertheless, the shelter in place rules implemented in March impacted our overall engineering activities, such as testing and compliance of our Encharge battery storage system.  As a result, we will unable to ship beta units before the end of the quarter – first quarter as we originally planned. As of now, all testing is complete and we expect to start shipping beta units to installers sharply. Barring any further impact from COVID, we do expect to have meaningful revenue in Q2 from production shipments of our Encharge battery storage systems.  Installer training is critical for Encharge's success. We trained 654 people at our Fremont headquarters in Q1 and were limited in being able to train more due to shelter in place rules. We are switching over to online training in the coming weeks. And after completing all coursework online, installers will receive provisional certification and will have a video inspection of their first install by an Enphase field application engineer. We believe this process adequately ensures the skill verification that we require of our certified installers.  As I mentioned in my recent letter to shareholders, new products are the lifeblood of Enphase. The IQ 7 family of products has put us in a very solid position today. We have an incredible product lineup awaiting us.  First, we are committed to launching IQ 8, the grid agnostic microinverter for residential rooftops which will add even more differentiation on top of IQ 7. Second, our small commercial offering, IQ 8D, the 640 watt AC microinverter for two panels, is coming along well. We expect this product to provide high quality, rapid shutdown compliance in addition to outstanding CEC efficiency of 97.5%.  Third, we are adapting the Ensemble in a box product we announced at our 2019 analyst day and expect to introduce it initially for the US followed by India. This product will be portable, with a battery capacity of 1.7 kilowatt hour, providing energy security inside the home, as well as energy on the go for outdoor activities such as camping. The battery can be directly charged from the grid or from portable solar panels depending on whether the product is used indoors or outdoors. The product will have our trademark characteristics, high quality, always-on connectivity, and exceptional customer experience. We are looking forward to introducing the product later this year.  Let me talk about another big initiative we are embarking on – digital transformation. Today, we are engaged digitally with our installed base of more than 1.1 million sites through the Enlighten mobile and desktop applications, putting us in a unique position to understand our customers' energy needs well.  Similarly, we work very closely with a few thousand installers and engage with them through the mobile app training workshops, customer visitations and installer newsletters.  We want to create an incredible experience for both installers and homeowners by developing a comprehensive digital platform. It is our desire that both existing and new homeowners come on to your platform, are seamlessly connected to our great installer network, and have an efficient interaction all the way through installation, activation, and O&M, which stands for operations and maintenance.  It is our vision that, when done right, this platform will serve as a powerful catalyst, accelerating our solar and storage sales. In order to build such a powerful platform, we are planning to create several tools for the installers to make the entire installation process a lot more efficient. This involves building software expertise both organically as well as inorganically. We expect to make significant progress on this front in 2020.  Although there is short-term uncertainty due to COVID-19, we have tremendous confidence in the strength of our business in the long term. Our supply chain is flexible and resilient, aided by our strong contract manufacturing partners. We are laser focused on operational excellence and customer experience. We have a very strong balance sheet, with additional cash from the recent convertible debt offering and good cash flow generation capability.  Our strategy is to manage the current circumstances by investing in innovation and creating new products with unmatched value based on our three pillars of differentiation – semiconductors, software and Ensemble. In summary, we are pleased with the results of the first quarter considering COVID-19 pandemic. We extend our deepest sympathy to those impacted by this pandemic. While it is impossible to know how the crisis is going to unfold, our top-most priority is to ensure the health and safety of our employees, customers and partners.  We will also do whatever possible to ensure uninterrupted supply and support of our high quality products to our customers and partners.  With that, I will hand things over to Eric for his review of our finances. Eric?
Eric Branderiz: Thanks, Badri. I will provide more details related to our first quarter of 2020 financial results as well as our business outlook for the second quarter of 2020.  We have provided a reconciliation of these non-GAAP to GAAP financial measures in our earnings release posted today, which can also be found in the Investor Relations section of our website.  Total revenue for the first quarter of 2020 was $205.5 million, including approximately $44.5 million of safe harbor revenue. Total revenue for the first quarter of 2020 decreased 2% sequentially and increased 105% year-over-year. Excluding safe harbor revenue, first quarter revenue decreased 7% sequentially and increased 51% year-over-year. We are pleased with this result considering the typical industry seasonality in the first quarter and the supply chain disruption in China from COVID-19 pandemic.  We shipped approximately 643 megawatt DC in the first quarter of 2020.  Non-GAAP gross margin for the first quarter of 2020 was 39.5% compared to 37.3% for the fourth quarter of 2019. The sequential improvement resulted from our continuous focus on pricing management and cost reduction initiatives.  Non-GAAP operating expenses were $28.5 million for the first quarter of 2020 compared to $26.1 million for the fourth quarter of 2019. The sequential increase was primarily driven by the hiring of sales personnel in Europe and higher payroll taxes related to equity vesting.  A significant portion of expected operating expenses for 2020 has been allocated to sales and marketing to support our international growth and to research and development for both hardware and software innovation, as well as the expansion of our digital platform.  GAAP operating expenses were $36 million for the first quarter of 2020 compared to $33.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2019. GAAP operating expenses for the first quarter of 2020 included $6.9 million of stock-based compensation expenses and $546,000 for amortization expenses for acquired intangible assets. On a non-GAAP basis, income from operations was $52.8 million for the first quarter of 2020, a record for the company compared to $52.3 million for the fourth quarter of 2019. On a GAAP basis, income from operation was $44.7 million for the first quarter of 2020. We are pleased with the increase in non-GAAP income from operation on a sequential basis, despite the modest seasonal decline in revenue.  On a non-GAAP basis, net income for the first quarter of 2020 was $51.9 million, basically unchanged from the fourth quarter of 2019. This resulted in diluted earnings per share of $0.38 for the first quarter of 2020 compared to $0.39 for the fourth quarter of 2019.  GAAP net income for the first quarter of 2020 was $69 million compared to $116.7 million for the fourth quarter of 2019. GAAP net income in the first quarter of 2020 included $15.3 million benefit from changes in fair value of derivatives and $11.9 million income tax benefits compared to the prior quarter that included $72.2 million tax benefit for the release of valuation allowance against deferred tax assets.  GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.50 for the first quarter of 2020 compared to $0.88 for the fourth quarter of 2019. GAAP earnings per share for the first quarter of 2020 included an $0.11 gain from change in fair value of derivatives and a $0.09 income tax benefit compared to the fourth quarter of 2019, which included a $0.54 non-cash benefit from the release of the valuation allowance. Now turning to the balance sheet. Inventory was $34.6 million at the end of Q1 2020, and included approximately $3 million allocated to Encharge battery storage product. Inventory at the end of Q4 2019 was $32.1 million.  Accounts receivable were $95.5 million at the end of Q1 2020 compared to $145.4 million at the end of Q4 2019. The reduction was primarily due to safe harbor shipments in Q1 2020 having been prepaid in Q4 2019 and improved shipment linearity in the first quarter of 2020.  We exited the first quarter of 2020 with a total cash balance of $593.8 million compared to $296.1 million for the fourth quarter of 2019. The cash balance includes a $320 million aggregate principal convertible note issuance in March that resulted in net proceeds of $313 million.  In addition, the purchase of the call spread to increase the effective conversion premium to 100% had an additional net cost of $17.5 million. The tax deductibility of the convertible note hedge effectively offsets the upfront net cost over the five-year duration of the notes. The cash balance in the quarter was reduced by $34.3 million for employees withholding taxes to net settle the stock compensation grants that vested in the first quarter of 2020. This prevented the issuance of 938,000 shares and does not count toward the $200 million share repurchase authorization that I will discuss in a moment. Ending cash balance would have been $628.1 million instead of $593.8 million if we did not execute on these anti-dilutive transactions.  We generated $39.2 million in cash flow from operations and $35.9 million in adjusted free cash flow for the first quarter of 2020. Capital expenditure was $3.4 million for Q1 2020, mainly to increase our microinverter supply capacity in Mexico and Encharge battery capacity to support our ramp in Q2. Now, let's discuss our outlook for the second quarter of 2020. We expect our revenue for the second quarter of 2020 to be within a range of $115 million to $130 million.  Turning to margins, we expect GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins to be within a range of 37% to 40%. We expect our GAAP operating expenses to be within a range of $33 million to $35 million, including a total of approximately $7.5 million estimated for stock-based compensation expenses and acquisition-related amortization.  We expect non-GAAP operating expenses to be within a range of $25.5 million to $27.5 million. The actual operating expense as a percentage of revenue will be above our target baseline financial model in the near term, but we expect to trend towards this model as demand rebounds later in the year.  I would like to spend a few minutes discussing the resiliency of our business model considering the current economic backdrop. Our outsourced manufacturing model results in low fixed cost of goods sold, and we have no material minimum volume commitments or take-or-pay provisions with our contract manufacturers or critical vendors.  We pay slightly more per unit when volumes decline and we are working with our contract manufacturers and suppliers to navigate through these unique circumstances.  Based on the gross margin guidance for Q2, it should be clear that these higher costs do not materially affect our gross margin. Then it becomes up to us to control operating expenses in the near term by restricting new hires to essential or strategic positions, deferring travel, and discretionarying the spending actions.  We have built a talented global team of employees. We seek to retain and are not reducing any headcount at this time.  It is important to note that we are doubling down on our new products and want to introduce them faster. We believe this will enhance our differentiation, making us emerge even stronger after the global economy gets back on track.  Before turning the call over for questions, I would like to touch on one of our capital allocation strategies. On April 21, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $200 million of Enphase Energy common stock to minimize shareholder dilution related to employee equity issuances.  The purchases will be completed from time to time in the open market or through a structural repurchase agreement with third parties. Such purchases are expected to continue through March 2022 unless otherwise extended or shortened by our Board of Directors. This adds another tool to our toolkit to increase shareholder value when management believes the market value of the stock deviates materially below the conservatively calculated intrinsic value.  With that, I will now open the line for questions. 
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. And our first question comes from the line of Brad Meikle with Williams Trading. Your line is now open.
Brad Meikle: If you could talk about the themes and demand patterns that you've seen across different countries in Europe and also the different states in the US, that would be great.  And then, also secondly, have you seen any supply interruptions and can you talk about your timing of your new products in that [indiscernible] second half, namely, the IQ 8, the roof top and the Ensemble storage? Thank you. 
Badri Kothandaraman: Right. So, regarding the demand situation, let me let me tell you the story. In the last earnings call in February, we all – all of us were looking forward to a nice Q2. And we were quite healthily booked at that time. And then, suddenly, in early March, we started seeing the pandemic spreading to the US. So, in the last three weeks of March, we started seeing the residential installations go down. And for Enphase, particularly, we were actually 100% linear at that time. And so, we were shipping perfectly. And yes, we did experience slowdown in the last three weeks, yet we managed to make our numbers.  Then April, the pandemic spread was a lot more severe. And particularly, we have seen it very severe in, obviously, California due to the shelter in place rules and, obviously, in New York where it is really severe unfortunately at this point in time.  So, I already said 30% to 50% drop according to industry reports that we see in overall residential installations. In some places like Texas, it's on the side of 30%. In some places like what I said, New York, California, it's even more than 50%. In Florida, it's a little bit less on the lower side.  And then, we also find – obviously, in times like this, our small and medium size installers are going to be a lot affected. And so, what we are doing, Enphase, if you see our midpoint of guidance, this time in Q2, that's about $122.5 million, the midpoint of guidance for Q2. And we are well booked above that number right now. But we know that we have to work with a lot of customers and make sure that we don't overload the channel.  It's important for us that we support our customers in this time. And so, we are working with each customer to make sure they have the right inventory because we have no interest in stuffing the channel. And then, we're looking forward to a great Q3.  So, right now, we are in the beginning of May. California is on lock down till the end of May, shelter in place till the end of May. The other states, they have been a little bit more aggressive. New York is also going to be similar to California. So, we expect – if things are optimistic, we expect to start seeing more activity in towards the end of May and June. Demand may pick up. But right now, with the visibility we have, we thought it is important for us to be realistic, give you the right guidance to work with our installers, to make sure we don't have excess inventory in the channel, so that we are ready for a nice ramp in Q3.
Brad Meikle: Thanks, Badri. Is the change in Europe different from the US, more severe or less severe? 
Badri Kothandaraman: Yeah, situation in Europe, sorry, I didn't answer that question. The situation in Europe – Italy, we are not in Italy. So, unfortunately, Italy has been a lot affected in Europe. But, fortunately, we are not there.  Netherlands, despite the pandemic, Netherlands is modestly affected, and our share in Netherlands has been quite low, maybe sub 10%. And we tripled our sales team. We hired some great people in Netherlands. We are working on distributor partnerships. We are working to win installers. And so, for us, the Netherlands, I would say it's more a share gain from our perspective because of our efforts.  And in terms of Germany, Germany is affected by COVID. Of course, we don't do much business in Germany. That's the nice thing about it. And we were able to make modest impact in Q1 and we expect to grow that in Q2. Spain is another place where we have started efforts. We have a team of three, four people, an excellent team of people. We expect them to start making significant progress for us in Q2 and beyond.  That's why you've seen Europe – although Europe is hit by the pandemic, for us, Enphase, we think we will be in line with Q1 for Q2. So, that's the situation.  Australia. Australia is similarly affected. Right now, Australia is doing a lot better than the US, but they do predict a drop in demand. And our numbers in Australia are also flat compared to Q1. Q2 numbers are flat compared to Q1.  So, if I were to summarize, the rest of the world business is doing better than the US and the US is a lot affected by the pandemic, basically.  Now, you've asked the question on manufacturing. Manufacturing is not an issue. Supply chain is not an issue. We have a lot of options. We basically – you know we have China. We have Mexico. They're all doing well. We are working with contract manufacturer to optimize inventory in both workplaces This is a time where cash is king and we want to make sure we don't spend money unless we need to. At the same time, we are not compromising on our batteries. As Eric said, we've built an inventory of $3 million for battery at the end of March and now it is even more. So, we are getting ready for the ramp there.  And in terms of manufacturing supply chain, we are also diversifying to another place, meaning another location, neither in China nor in Mexico. And we'll announce it when we are ready. But we'll be able to start manufacturing microinverters there in the fourth quarter. 
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Brian Lee with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.
Brian Lee: Hope everyone is doing well and staying safe. First question I had was on the inventory. Badri, it sounds like you don't think inventory is a problem right now. You're pretty lean. You want to keep it that way as well. So, can you give us some sense on where inventory levels are and also lead times right now in terms of, I guess, number of weeks?  And then, remind us on kind of where the target or healthy ranges are that you typically try to operate within? 
Badri Kothandaraman: Yeah. Our inventory target is usually – we have 30 days. Are you asking for channel inventory or Enphase inventory, Brian?
Brian Lee: Yeah. It sounds like you guys are lean, but the channel would be great. If you have some visibility on the channel. I think you've said 8 to 10 weeks in the past, but if you could just kind of refresh us on that and where you are today. 
Badri Kothandaraman: So, we misunderstood the question. Sorry. Yes. So, if you're asking about the channel, in the past, we have always said 8 to 10 weeks. Obviously, the downward pressure on demand means that the installations didn't happen. Didn't happen much in April. That means when you look at forward-looking inventory based upon what actually happened in April, you're going to end up with a big number of weeks of inventory. But what we are doing at this time is it's pretty clear, right? We are saying, okay, yes, you guys have stopped installing, therefore, it is no point for us to put more inventory into the channel. And therefore, we will make sure that we work with you, and we push out your orders into the next quarter and ensure that the channel inventory is always healthy.  If the channel inventory is always healthy, then when the demand comes back up, then we can – when the channel depletes a bit, we can basically refresh the material back. So, it's almost like a mass balance. When the channel depletes some inventory, we can ship back some inventory into the channel. And we are doing it mathematically. We have a lot of experience in this. In good times, obviously, inventory is going to be low. In bad times, the trick is to see how you can prevent inventory from ballooning up. And it's mathematically done, formulaically done and we work with our installers. So, that's what we're doing. 
Brian Lee: Okay, that's helpful. And I guess maybe just related to that, I wanted to understand one of the comments you made, Badri. You said bookings – you're well above the midpoint right now. For Q2 guidance, you said the $122.5 million, you're well above that from a bookings perspective. Clearly, you don't want to overload your customers with inventory. So, is that to suggest you're worried about some of those bookings, as you're describing them being canceled? Or are you seeing a high degree of cancels right now? Because it sounds like if we didn't have the COVID uncertainty, maybe with the level of bookings you'd have, you'd be guiding above the targets you're providing today for Q2. Just trying to parse those comments and understand sort of the level of visibility you have versus the level of maybe conservatism you're baking in, just given all that's going on?
Badri Kothandaraman: I think you've got it right. Yes, we are booked quite well. We are booked a lot more than the midpoint of the guidance. But our visibility is lowered this time and the uncertainty is high. And if April were a proxy of things, we will expect a little bit more cancellations and push out. On the other hand, if May or June is a lot more positive, we'll have a chance to hit the high point. So, we thought we should give you a number that takes into account all of these puts and takes. And that's why I'm giving you a full visibility. You guys know what I know.
Brian Lee: Okay, that's great. And then, maybe just last one and I'll pass it on. On gross margins, you guided 36% to 39% for Q1. You beat that range. Now, you're guiding 37% to 40% on 40% lower revenue. So, the model is pretty resilient irrespective of volumes. That's pretty clear. But once volumes do pick up later in the year, coupled with some of the new products that are ramping, it seems like you'd have some upside to that margin range. I'd be curious sort of what your views are on that. Margins in a healthier volume environment, kind of if they pick up from here.  And then, just on the flip side of that, you also mentioned you've got some of the longtail customers, maybe some of those customers are more challenged in this kind of environment right now. Any worries around bad accounts and sort of charges related to that? Maybe just some context around that, if you're seeing that or if you have anything to suggest that you have the ability to mitigate that.
Badri Kothandaraman: Right. Let me answer the question on gross margin. Yes, absolutely. We are highly confident of our gross margins. And that's why we gave you a guidance of 37% to 40% despite these times. Why is that? The basic question.  Gross margin comprises of two things, pricing management and cost management. Pricing management, we're very disciplined in pricing. We have a pricing team, which I established a couple of years ago, and they do a great job optimizing every transaction. That's extremely important for us and we do value-based pricing. We will continue to do that. Absolutely. So, pricing is one of the big reasons why our gross margin is where it is.  The second is cost management. Cost management comprises into a lot of tactical pieces and a few strategic pieces. Tactical pieces are blocking and tackling in order to do supply chain optimization, finding second sources here and there, dropping costs, negotiation with customers. The second piece is tariffs. We have systematically designed the supply chain such that microinverters produced in Mexico do not require a tariff and we are extending the same to accessories in the future. That's two. Number three. Also tactical is, you saw us doing a lot of expedites two or three quarters ago. And expedites are no longer required for us because we have solved the power transistor problem, we have solved the component shortage problem. So, therefore, expedites are going to be in the noise. That's one more thing there.  And then number four is a little bit more strategic piece. When it comes to cost reduction, we have an ASIC strategy. In the ASIC, we have basically the digital portion. And then we also have the analog integration of the ASIC. We are able to integrate analog chips that we use in the microinverter on to the AC. Even if it means $0.20 cost reduction, $0.20 multiplied by, let's say, 8 million units a year, that big deal, $1.6 million. So, every cent for us that we can take out of the micro by integration into the SIC is extremely critical.  And then, in addition, the last few things are how can we fundamentally change the architecture of our transformers that is used, how can we go from 300 components down to 50 components, how can we reduce the microinverter to the size of an iPhone? Those are some of the long-term strategic cost reductions that we are thinking about.  So, to answer your question, we have a very high degree of confidence. Especially when the demand comes back, we do have upside in gross margins.  Now, I'll have Eric talk about whether we are worried about bad debt. 
Eric Branderiz: Yeah. So, thank you for the question, Brian. As you know, on note 3 of our 10-Q filing that we just published, we disclose our allowance for doubtful account. And you can see that is very small. And the reason that is very small is because most of our business is through distribution. And with that, most of the distributors that we do business with, they have pretty strong balance sheets. Not only that, they also manage the cash and the days of inventory very well. So, they put some things that goes into a conversation with the installer of all their point of sale data from the distributor. It's normally done on a triage with the distributors as well, which they own the credit phase with the installer. So, at this point, we don't hear any issues associated with the payment terms or paying.  Some of our installers, we actually have a direct business relationship, in which all of them right now are doing fairly well. Some of them requested a little bit of an extended payment term, but for the most part, all of them are okay.  So, at this point, as of the time of this filing, we don't see or we don't foresee any issues on collections associated with my receivables at the end of the quarter. 
Brian Lee: Thanks, guys. 
Badri Kothandaraman: Thank you. 
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Colin Rusch with Oppenheimer. Your line is now open. 
Colin Rusch: Thanks so much. As you look at the market for energy storage and your ability to drive costs out, obviously, a little bit early days, and you just walked through a lot of detail on the [indiscernible], how much opportunity is there for you guys over the next couple of quarters to support your gross margin trajectories as you scale up a little bit on the margins? And then, curious about it, on a 12 to 18 month basis as well. 
Badri Kothandaraman: Right. If you look at Encharge battery, the subcomponents inside the Encharge battery or the cell battery pack, then you have the battery management unit, which is the BMS, then you have a battery controller which basically communicates to the gateway, and then you have the microinverters. As we dropped the cost of the microinverters, that's going to go down. We do have plans to integrate the battery management unit and the battery controller into one board and we do plan to use an ASIC to integrate to achieve even higher levels of integration.  Now then we are left with the cell pack. The beautiful thing about that is we work with so many cell pack vendors, and therefore, if they drop their cost, they are going to pass that cost on to us. So, I would say there is nice potential for us. Especially as we start ramping volumes, there is really – we can probably get a lot of costs out in the first couple of years, and then it more translates into steady progress after that. 
Colin Rusch: Great. Thanks so much. And then, looking out a couple of quarters and considering the long tail of installers that are customers for you guys, how much visibility do you get into the cash flow dynamics and the strength of their balance sheets? There's an awful lot of small operations in various localities, but how much information can you really gather at this point to looking at that portion of the customer base?
Eric Branderiz: Yeah. So, it appears that, for the most part, the installers are taking advantage of some of the generous programs issued by the federal government, right? Most of them actually qualify for those programs. So, some of them is taking some time to get them administratively completed because of the fact that they don't have a big accounting group to manage and to – we chase their reimbursements. But I don't hear – I have quite a bit of visibility and I don't hear any big issues on installers not being able to sustain through their balance sheet through this period for now.  Now, if this situation continues and deteriorates even more, the first ones to upfront that hit will be distributors, in which eventually we will need to triangulate that one into what it means to us, right?  But at this point, actually, to my surprise, the small installers, they do pretty well. Some of them, they manage their cash very tightly. They don't have a large OpEx or a big infrastructure to support and they can hunker down into a smaller operation and then be ready for the comeback when needed.  So, I'm actually okay with that. 
Colin Rusch: All right, great. Thanks so much, guys. 
Badri Kothandaraman: Thank you, Colin.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Mark Strouse with J.P. Morgan Your line is now open.
Mark Strouse: Thanks very much for taking our questions. Can you just touch on the competitive dynamics? Any signs that some of your weaker competitors may be looking to exit the market? Any evidence that your kind of fortress balance sheet that you've built is allowing you to take any market share?  And then, kind of lastly, as a follow on to that, are there any interesting competitors or technologies that are out there that could potentially be struggling during this downturn that you think could be interesting M&A opportunities?
Raghu Belur: Hi. This is Raghu. So, let's take your first one, which is on the competitive dynamics. Now, we are not hearing of any competitors at this time exiting the market. We, obviously, keep track of it, but we are not hearing anything. So, we expect that to continue.  Your second question was on any interesting technologies that are available for us to look at. Absolutely. And Badri mentioned that one area that we are looking at as part of our digital transformation technology to look at building out end-to-end software platform that can significantly improve the customer experience. Everything from generation – from the sales lead all the way through procurement, through installation, commissioning, operations and maintenance, and I think we're going to grow that business both organically and look at growing it inorganically as well. And, yes, absolutely, we're looking at a bunch of different software companies out there that can help us in that endeavor.  I think in the long run as well, we have talked about – given as Ensemble transitions into a more sophisticated energy management system, there's a tremendous opportunity to look at companies that are doing some interesting work in forecasting engines and machine learning and AI type work, managing big data, et cetera. So, all of those are a tremendous opportunity as we start bringing all of our new products into the marketplace.
Mark Strouse: Okay. Got it. That's it for us. Thanks very much.
Badri Kothandaraman: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jeff Osborne with Cowen and Company. Your line is now open.
Jeffrey Osborne: Yeah, great. Just a couple of questions. In response to Colin's question, could you break out, roughly speaking, the mix of small customers versus larger? I would assume it's 70%, 80% smaller through distribution, but I didn't know if you could…
Badri Kothandaraman: That's close enough.
Jeffrey Osborne: Okay. And then, in terms of the – I know I've asked you this before in past earnings calls, Badri, but the battery piece, a lot of discussion of costs and certainly LFP prices have come down. I assume it's still an LFP based battery, but is that still anticipated to be in line with the corporate average now that you're approaching 40%? Or should we be modeling something less than that as the storage piece ramps up?
Badri Kothandaraman: Yes, LFP. Yes, in line with 40%.
Jeffrey Osborne: Okay. Good to hear. And then, just given the uncertainty in the market, how should we think about share shifts between you and other competitors? Are we at a point in time where people are transitioning from door to door and sitting down at the kitchen table to digital sales where people would want to learn new technologies and potentially replace a different inverter company with yourselves or are people still hunkering down with the status quo? I just didn't know if you're seeing over the past, call it, six to eight weeks any inbounds as it relates to people wanting to get trained that maybe hadn't heard of in the past or were aligned with the competitor.
Badri Kothandaraman: It's still early days, but the nice things we have seen are our traffic, the leads have increased a lot. We don't do too much of business digitally today, but that is increasing, our traffic to the online store is increasing. So, that's why I talked about the digital platform.  And the digital platform is not something that we are taking it lightly as yet another effort. This is going to be a really powerful platform if we do it right. What does that mean? You've got a homeowner who is coming to you and you've got a lead that is coming to you, and how effectively you transfer that lead to your installer network. Enphase has got an installer network of 500 loyal installers. They are amazing partners for us. They are why we exist.  So, imagine if we generate thousands of leads, maybe it'll become tens of thousands of leads and maybe it'll become hundreds of thousands of leads soon, but, let's start with thousands of leads, we pass it to our Enphase loyal installer network, we help the homeowner make a decision there, and we then create a platform for the homeowner and the installer and Enphase to interact on one platform seamlessly. Then we start to take care of things, like, all the way from appointment setting, design closure, contract closure, bill of materials procurement, permitting, planning, and then activation when it shows up on our Enlighten database and then O&M after that. If we can help our installers to digitize all of these, and these are – yeah, I'm talking about small and medium size installers, because they are the ones who have manual systems. They use ad hoc tools for everything. It would be really advantageous for us to introduce this platform where we have everything in one place that is contained. And if we do that well – and I'm not saying that it's easy to do that well. If we do that, well – it's a multiyear effort. If we do that well, then we can sell a lot more solar and storage solutions because, as you can see, we are going to go from $2,000 a home to over $10,000 a home. And with things we are going to introduce later on for consumption with AC panels, it's only going to become more and more and more. And so, we are going to become a much higher fraction of the bill of materials.  And so, once again, the concept is if we can make it so easy for the homeowner, and in particular for the installer, the sales of our Ensemble based solar and storage solutions are going to shoot up. That's really what we want to do long-term.
Jeffrey Osborne: That makes sense. I was trying to get at with my question, somebody not going through your digital store, but somebody that hasn't established sales force, are you finding that 500 installers that are loyal today, do you anticipate that meaningfully growing over the next three to six months? I'm just trying to get a sense of – with the uncertainty in the space, are you finding that people want to actually shift vendors? Or are people just sticking with what they know as they transition from selling door to door, sitting face to face with people and moving to online or whatever to stimulate demand?
Badri Kothandaraman: Right. Look, even in this time, we do have installers – we're winning a lot of installers. Why? It's pretty simple. It's the same thing that I'll keep keeping on beating on, which is quality and customer experience.  If we get to 0.05% annual failure rate, which is – we are actually very close to that number. That's an outstanding number, unbeatable number. And if we demonstrate that continuously, which we have for the last couple of years with IQ 7, that is a big factor for people to move to us. And that transition will happen regardless because in tough times like this, that transition, I believe will happen fast. People do not have time to screw around with failures. They don't.  So, if we can keep our NPS, net promoter score, above 60 – this quarter, we did 72. That's a phenomenal quarter. If we can do that, if we can answer the phone in less than 60 seconds, 0.05% annual defectivity, if we can extend that to batteries, our all-in-one solar and storage solution is going to dominate. No questions.
Jeffrey Osborne: Great to hear. Thank you for the detail.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from a line of Philip Shen with ROTH Capital Partners. Your line is now open.
Philip Shen: Hey, guys. Thanks for the questions. Badri, what you were just talking about there in terms of the lead gen machine, sounds like it can be very powerful. Can you give us a little bit of a history on that? Meaning, where were your leads at Q1 and where do you think you could end the year at in terms of your lead generation that you can pass on to your partners? And what kind of close ratios have you experienced? I can imagine they're quite high because there are programs like this out there, and it seems like, again, this could be powerful. So, want to see what kind of ramp we could see ahead. And then also, what kind of capital are you willing to invest here? One of your peers spends millions of dollars on TV ads, for example. I don't expect you guys to do that. But just curious what kind of money you might be putting behind this?
Badri Kothandaraman: Right. So, Phil, you know that we are a disciplined company. We are not going to give you metrics without thinking. So, you've\ got to be a little bit more patient for those metrics.  But what I will tell you is this. We have 1.1 million sites today. And these are Enphase sites. And, okay, I have the ability to generate leads by spending a lot of extra money on my right hand. And I have all the 1.1 million homeowners on my left hand. What do I choose? Right? Yeah, the answer is obvious. Those are Enphase customers, and so therefore the low hanging fruit is those Enphase customers. And we are already working on such upgrade programs. We do talk about one particular upgrade program that we constantly issue press releases on, which is the upgrade program for the Enphase's first and second generation microinverters, who are transitioning from the M190 base products to IQ 7 and sometimes IQ7 based AC module. Those are examples of programs that you will start seeing more and more from us. But you're absolutely right. It's a powerful concept. And if he can do it right, we'll be in a different place.
Philip Shen: Great. As it relates to Q3, I know visibility is limited, uncertainty is high, but I do believe we've seen an inflection point in terms of sales have troughed out and they're improving week over week. So, things are improving a little bit. Just curious to see if you guys have seen an improvement in Q3, like what kind of visibility in Q3 do you have?
Badri Kothandaraman: Phil, at this point, we don't have visibility for Q3.
Philip Shen: Got it. Okay. And one last one here. In terms of your guide for Q2, you talked about meaningful storage revenues in that Q2 guide. I don't think you quantified it. I was wondering if you might be able to quantify Q2 and then also talk about the cadence of how storage revenues ramp in Q3 and Q4?
Badri Kothandaraman: We are not going to quantify it. We may separate it out. We may – and Eric already told you guys that last quarter. But in order for you guys to think about a lower number, we gave you the inventory of storage product that we built. We gave you that, but that number was at the end of March. And that number was $3 million. So, you guys can do the calculation and have a base number. That's the base number. Obviously, that's not all of it. But that will help you to at least have some number instead of shooting in the air.
Philip Shen: Okay. Great. Thanks, Badri. I'll pass it on.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Eric Stine with Craig-Hallum. Your line is now open.
Eric Stine: Hi, everyone. Most questions asked here, but I guess I'll just go with – so Ensemble in a box, I know that was a big topic at the analyst day in India. Just thought process on bringing that to the US now. How you view it competitively in the market? And then, if you have any thoughts on the overall market opportunity.
Raghu Belur: Yeah. I think one of the key things – and this is – as this disruption happened, we got together and we said, what is it that the people are thinking about? And I think you realize that self-sufficiency, resiliency is top of mind for a lot of people, especially here in the US. And so, that's why we decided, not long ago, that we were going to first prioritize getting the Ensemble in a box product here.  We did our competitive analysis, we did our survey up there and really felt that we have a phenomenal technology in Ensemble that we can leverage to bring a competitive product into the marketplace.  Like we mentioned, forefront of it being the reliability part, the always-on connectivity and, finally, the customer experience par. And we can address both resiliency part when you're inside the home or self-sufficiency part when you're inside the home and then you can also – it's a mobile device. So, it's basically energy on the go both for – whether it's for recreational use or for emergency purposes as well in the event of a catastrophic event.  We think it's a really complementary product to the complete Ensemble solution that we have with PV on the roof and beta in charge storage solutions with Enpower. So, I think it's a really complementary solution for about 1.7 kilowatt hours. And I think it plays really well with our set of products that we have. So, the opportunity I think is going to be very big here in the in the US to begin with.  We're also planning to, of course, do the India version of that product subsequent to the US version, and there we shared what our served available market is going to be and it's quite large.
Eric Stine: And is that something you think as a contributor? Can be a meaningful contributor in 2021?
Raghu Belur: Absolutely, yes. So, that's when we plan to introduce it, in the second half of this year, and it will play a big role in 2021.
Eric Stine: Okay. Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Maheep Mandloi with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.
Maheep Mandloi: Hi. Thanks for taking the question, everyone. I hope you all are doing safe. Could you just talk more about the software strategy? How should we think about it? Is it a new product or a service for the installers? Or should we think more of a platform for your core installers? And apart from any M&A opportunities for the Encharge solution, do you see any M&A opportunities for the software strategy?
Raghu Belur: Yeah. As Badri mentioned, it's a very key element of our overall strategy. This is the digital transformation piece. And the key here is to provide fantastic customer experience end-to-end, which means starting from that lead all the way through matching the installer with the homeowner, managing through the process, all the way through digital permitting. You're seeing some of the HAs [ph] moving to that environment as well. You see there's a general push towards moving everything into the digital world.  So, everything we want to provide as a seamless platform. And then, that platform then continues to extend beyond into the actual operation of the Ensemble technology, which is the energy management piece.  So, today, we think about it as disparate elements, meaning the frontend which is about sales and procurement and installation. And then, there is this Enlighten piece which is – or Ensemble energy management piece, which is a product related piece.  But imagine if that whole experience was completely seamless, of course, that means there's a lot to do and a lot of software to be developed. And so, we are going to be very thoughtful about what are the things that we can build in-house ourselves. Of course, the core Ensemble technology, there's a significant amount of IP there and we have built that in-house. But then there is the piece around the front end, which I think we'll build some and we'll look for some organic and inorganic M&A.  On the product side, of course, there is the micro part, the battery. We know what we are going to do. We know where all our IP lies. All our IP lies in the power management piece, the communications piece, the software piece. The two things that we are not in the business of is manufacturing of solar panels or manufacturing of cell packs. So, everything in between is significant IP to be developed, particularly around the software part, which is everything software defined power conversion, all the way through economic optimization, which is what we refer to as tertiary control. That's core IP for us. What I wanted to point out is that whole experience needs to be completely seamless. So, that is what we mean by complete digital transformation.
Maheep Mandloi: That's helpful. Thanks. And actually, one last for me on batteries. Could you just remind us which countries you will be buying the batteries from, just trying to get ahead of any trade escalations in the country? And also, it is a 5% battery attachment rates by the end of the year. Does that still hold? I know it's probably been pointing to one small number here, but any clarity on that will be helpful.
Badri Kothandaraman: Right. So, the answer is China. And we have one source now. We will have one more source in the second half of the year. And then, yes, the 5% holds in Q4 of 2020.
Maheep Mandloi: Thanks for answering my questions.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Campbell with Tuohy Brothers. Your line is now open.
Jeffrey Campbell: Good afternoon. I wanted to ask you, have you disclosed how many of the 1.1 million installed Enphase customers are on legacy micros at this time?
Badri Kothandaraman: No, we have not.
Jeffrey Campbell: Okay. But is it safe to say that it's still a fairly sizable amount?
Badri Kothandaraman: Right. Correct.
Jeffrey Campbell: Okay. As I've listened to you describe the digital platform in a number of different ways, it sounds similar to the approach of some large installers. Is it correct? At least optically. Is it correct to say that the main point of the initiative is to increase the sales potential of the smaller installer? 
Badri Kothandaraman: That's right. 
Jeffrey Campbell: And kind of following on that, can the digital platform positively impact Enphase internal operations in some way? 
Badri Kothandaraman: Not really. When you say impact the Enphase operations, I'm not sure what you mean. 
Jeffrey Campbell: Well, I'm saying, for example, would it make your sales ever more efficient? So, maybe you'll get more out of less headcount or would it somehow positively impact your inventory because it provides you maybe with another source of feedback that you're not getting now. Just wondering if there's any feedback loops there for you.
Badri Kothandaraman: It's got to make our installers' lives a lot better, the small and medium sized installers. It's got to make the homeowners life a lot better. In order for us to achieve such a seamless experience, it's going to take us time. It's going to – we need world class software. So, it's going to take us more people in order for us to do this. And, fortunately, for us, our gross margins are strong and we have a nice balance sheet. So, we are in the right time to invest and help both our homeowners as well as small and medium sized installers.  And I guess, the final point on this digital platform thing, I think it's been touched on it, just to confirm it. If this works the way that you want it to, is it reasonable to think that it's going to attract additional installers to you that you may not be working with now, and could that be significant? 
Badri Kothandaraman: That's right. Yes. That's right. 
Jeffrey Campbell: Okay, great. And just one question on a different subject. I was just wondering, is the IQ 8D still – because I know we have all these COVID-19 headaches. Is it still moving along fairly smoothly? And do you still expect to release it in the fourth quarter? 
Badri Kothandaraman: Because I did mention it in the call actually earlier. We are pleased with the progress that we're making on IQ 8D. IQ 8D, to remind everyone, it's a small commercial product, 640 watt AC. It will basically service two panels. And our differentiation there is, obviously, the trademark Enphase high quality, rapid shutdown implementation, and essentially very high efficiency product. But, yes, it is on track. 
Jeffrey Campbell: Great. Thank you. 
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. And our next question comes from the line of Pavel Molchanov with Raymond James. Your line is now open. 
Jeffrey Campbell: Thanks for taking the question, guys. You have not been asked yet about manufacturing. You mentioned that there is no issues. Mexico has been under a lockdown, maybe a weak one, but a lockdown since the end of March. And I'm curious if there have been any disruptions in terms of labor availability or the social distancing requirements at the fab in Mexico. 
Badri Kothandaraman: Our factory has been declared as an essential business, and so there have not been interruptions. And also, like what I said in my prepared remarks, obviously, this is a quarter where we are building less inventory, not more. So, we are carefully balancing the inventory between China and Mexico. And due to COVID, the amount of inventory that we have to build is quite small. 
Jeffrey Campbell: Okay. Let me ask one more regulatory question. From the perspective of your customers that are postponing installations, and you referenced the New York area in particular, is that because of lockdowns and stay at home orders or is it more of a precautionary measure? Because my understanding is most states do not push it solar installation because it has been considered an essential business. 
Badri Kothandaraman: From an installation point of view, I think just people are cautious about having other people come and interact with them in their house. And I think that's one slowdown. The second slowdown, obviously, is also on the permitting side. Not everybody is like some of the counties that you're seeing here in California, like San Luis Obispo, et cetera, who have gone completely digital.  And then, the third element is around permission to operate. The PTO, which is in – both inspection and PTO. So, I think you're seeing that there is friction in the system as a result of the social distancing element. I think that is the biggest challenge. On the sales side, again, kitchen table sales are now less likely to happen or not happening. But we're seeing and a lot of our installer partners are adapting to doing this more virtually using digital tools.  So, yeah, we're going through that – experiencing those processes right now. 
Jeffrey Campbell: Understood. Thank you, guys. Stay safe. 
Badri Kothandaraman: Thank you. 
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Amit Dayal with H.C. Wainwright. Your line is now open.
Amit Dayal: Thank you guys for taking my questions. You guys indicated that you're being aggressive on product introductions, but at the same time you're seeing some push-outs relative to go-to-market for existing products in the pipeline. I just wanted to understand what the timeframe for these new product introductions will look like. Is it something that may transpire in this calendar year or are we talking a little bit more further out?
Badri Kothandaraman: Right. The delay on Encharge is because of social distancing and work from home. The engineers essentially do not have – they have not been working together. And because of that, some of the engineering activities and the compliance activities were delayed. And that's kind of behind us now. It was a short-term blip, which affected us. Last February, I thought – or rather, two months back, I thought we were going to ship Encharge by the end of March. That didn't happen because of this.  And regarding the other regarding, I do plan to introduce the IQ 8, grid agnostic microinverters for residential rooftops. I do plan to introduce it in the second half. And I do also plan to introduce IQ 8D in the second half, along with Ensemble in a box. We have a lot of engineering teams in the company. And the teams, obviously, they are a little bit hampered right now working from home, but, hopefully, that will end and June will be a lot better. And at this point, we still see – so we are on track to getting them in the second half. 
Amit Dayal: Understood. Thank you for that. Just last one for me. Have you acted on any buybacks so far? 
Badri Kothandaraman: No. 
Amit Dayal: Got it. Thank you. 
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. At this time, I'm not showing any further questions on the phone line. This concludes today's question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back to CEO, Badri Kothandaraman, for closing remarks. 
Badri Kothandaraman : All right. Thank you for joining us today and for your continued support of Encharge. We look forward to speaking with you again during our Q2 2020 earnings call. Bye. 
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

===== 2019 Q4  (2020-02-19 16:30:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to the Enphase Energy Fourth Quarter 2019 Financial Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Adam Hinckley. Please go ahead, sir.
Adam Hinckley: Good afternoon and thank you for joining us on today’s conference call to discuss Enphase Energy’s fourth quarter 2019 results. I am the Head of Investor Relations for Enphase Energy and I am pleased to be hosting my first earnings call for the company. On today’s call are Badri Kothandaraman, Enphase’s President and Chief Executive Officer; Eric Branderiz, Chief Financial Officer; and Raghu Belur, Chief Products Officer. After the market closed today, Enphase issued a press release announcing the results for its fourth quarter ended December 31, 2019. During this conference call, Enphase management will make forward-looking statements including, but not limited to statements related to Enphase Energy’s expected financial performance, technology, new products, operations and sales and marketing. These forward-looking statements involve significant risks and uncertainties and Enphase Energy’s actual results and the timing of events could differ materially from these expectations. For a more complete discussion of the risks and uncertainties, please see the company’s annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018 which is on file with the SEC and the annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019 which will be filed with the SEC in the first quarter of 2020. Enphase Energy cautions you not to place any undue reliance on forward-looking statements and undertakes no duty or obligation to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future events or changes in its expectations. Also please note that financial measures used on this call are expressed on a non-GAAP basis unless otherwise noted and have been adjusted to exclude certain charges. The company has provided a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures in its earnings release posted today, which can also be found in the Investor Relations section of its website. Now, I would like to introduce Badri Kothandaraman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Enphase Energy. Badri?
Badri Kothandaraman: Good afternoon and thanks for joining us today to discuss our fourth quarter 2019 financial results. We had a good quarter. We reported revenue of $210 million and shipped approximately 2.1 million microinverters. Demand was strong for our microinverter products in Q4. We are pleased with the preorders for our Encharge battery utilizing our Ensemble energy management technology and have started training installers to support the upcoming product launch. We exited the fourth quarter at approximately 37, 12, 25. This means 37% gross margin, 12% operating expenses and 25% operating income, all as a percentage of revenue on a non-GAAP basis. As a reminder, we introduced our new baseline financial model of 35, 15, 20 at our Analyst Day in December. The baseline model represents the minimum financial performance we expect to achieve over the next 18 to 24 months while demonstrating meaningful top line growth. Eric will go into greater detail about our finances later in the call. Let’s now talk about ease of doing business, how customers perceive us. Our Q4 net promoter score was 56% in North America compared to 54% in Q3. Our average call rate time is slightly over a minute and we are working on several self-service initiatives to reduce call volumes. We recently opened our online Enphase 2 with the objective of providing even better customer experience. Our target is to exit 2020 with an NPS score greater than 65, a number that’s considered very good in our industry. Let’s talk about the impact of the coronavirus. Our thoughts and prayers are with the people of China as they fight the virus. Our priority is to ensure the well-being of our teams as well as our partners in China. Our contract manufacturing facility – partner facility in China is steadily ramping back up following the Chinese New Year. The component supply chain is also ramping. We are seeing some indications that the outbound logistics from China is constrained. Now, coming to the first quarter, we are fully booked for the first quarter to the midpoint of guidance. In addition with nearly 7 weeks into the quarter, our shipments have been 100% linear to our revenue guidance. While we remain cautious and are watching the impact of the virus carefully, we do not see a big impact to the first quarter revenue guidance at this point. Depending on the situation with the outbound logistics, we may have to expedite some product through air ships from China and we are getting prepared for that. We have already factored that in our revenue as well as gross margin guidance to the extent we know. Now is a good time to talk about how Mexico is doing. We are very happy that Mexico is running well and provides us a good backup to service global demand in the event of supply disruptions elsewhere. We manufactured more than 0.5 million IQ 7 microinverters in Mexico during Q4. Our current run-rate in Mexico is a little over 50,000 units a week. We previously stated our target is to double the capacity to 1 million microinverters per quarter by Q4 of 2020 and we are making very good progress towards that goal. I would like to acknowledge the hard work of numerous people both on our team plus the Flex team in order to make this happen. Next, let’s talk about safe harbor. The revenue related to safe harbor shipments was $36.4 million in Q4, an increase from $8 million in Q3. For Q1, we plan to recognize the revenue of $44.5 million for ITC safe harbor shipments. I would like to highlight that only a very small number of our customers engage in safe harbor activity and that each of these customers has an ongoing relationship with Enphase beyond safe harbor sales. These shipments are not nearly one-time purchases and growing share in their portfolio beyond safe harbor is an area of opportunity for Enphase. Let’s talk a little bit more about Q1. We all know Q1 is our seasonally soft quarter for the solar industry with double-digit percentage declines in revenue and it is worthwhile for us to look at how we are doing and our base business is doing with respect to the industry. For example, if we include safe harbor revenue from our midpoint of Q1 ‘20 guidance of $205 million our base revenue only drops by 8%, which is a pretty good result considering the typical seasonality. Although we will provide formal guidance for the second quarter of 2020 in our April earnings call, I would like to provide some color today. There will obviously be no safe harbor sales in Q2. Our bookings for Q2 look pretty healthy right now considering where we are. We expect a nice uptick in our base business for Q2 commensurate with the industry seasonality. We also expect Q2 to benefit from a full quarter of Encharge battery sales. As I said before, the preorders for Encharge remain very healthy and our installer training is already underway. Obviously, whatever we are seeing with respect to Q2 is based on our current understanding of the coronavirus situation. Let’s move on to the regions. The U.S. and international mix for Q4 was 92% and 8% respectively, excluding safe harbor revenue. The result is an obvious indication of strength of our North American business. Our U.S. mix as a percentage is probably going to remain high for a few more quarters with the introduction of Ensemble in North America. Nevertheless, we are putting a lot of effort to grow our international business. You heard some updates on the Analyst Day and I am going to expand a little bit more on that now. On Europe, we are making excellent progress. We are doing a few things that are different from before. We are pulling out all stops in order to bolster our sales force in both internal transfers and new hires. Some of those are already in place right now. We have made several offers and expect to have increased headcount in place in Netherlands, Belgium, France, Germany and Spain by early March. While relationships with the distributors are very important to us, we are placing extraordinary emphasis on winning the long-tail installers by focusing on quality and customer experience. We are doing this by increasing our installer training significantly in Europe and tracking installer visit metrics diligently. Our 2020 goal is to double the 2019 European sales, which was approximately $68 million. Aside from our focus on the long-tail installers, our key initiatives in the region are social housing, ACM partnerships and providing differentiated solutions, such as integrated improved solar with Kraton, which we announced last week. Let’s now talk about Asia-Pacific and Latin America. Both Asia-Pacific and Latin America are small-sized business in our similar sized businesses and quite small. Our businesses in APAC, is mainly in Australia. Just to remind you, we hired a General Manager for that region in early 2019. We had the right team in place along with the focus and the right metrics there. We are seeing very encouraging sell-through to the installers. In addition, you recently saw a press release where we partnered with the installers to support the Australian PV industry to introduce rapid shutdown as a requirement. On top of this, Enphase’s AC architecture means there is no high voltage DC on the roof, thereby providing increased fire safety. With these initiatives, we expect this region to grow nicely in 2020. We will discuss products next. We had volume shipments of IQ 7A, our highest power product, a 349 watt AC for SunPower as well as other customers in the fourth quarter. IQ 7A like what I said is our highest power microinverter for the residential space and fares very well with the high efficiency modules up to 450-watt DC in both 60 and 72-cell configuration. We are going to talk about AC module partners next. We continued to make steady progress with our AC module partners, including SunPower, Panasonic, Solaria to mention a few. We are working to bring in a few more module partners both in the U.S. as well as in Europe. Enphase energized ACMs from our module partners have now been adopted by more than 740 installers in the U.S. as of this date. By the way, some of these ACMs are also available for both installers and homeowners to purchase directly from the Enphase online store. Next topic is our Encharge battery that uses Ensemble energy management technology. The shipments for the Encharge battery are expected to begin in March of 2020. We have already started training installers. We are expecting to ramp trainings a lot over the next few months. The feedback has been really positive with very high NPS scores. The installers clearly see Encharge as a safe, reliable and powerful option for the homeowners. However, they feel the biggest value for the homeowners is that for the first time ever, they can easily generate energy, store energy and control energy in a single system all completely designed by Enphase. That is the power of Ensemble. In the coming months, we will be expanding the training program beyond our Fremont headquarters to include many of our partner sites in order to increase our training throughput significantly. In summary, we are very happy with our performance in 2019 across all fronts. We talked about our three pillars of differentiation at the Analyst Day: semiconductor, software and Ensemble. This combined with operational excellence and our scalable business model is helping us win new customers. As we highlighted in the Analyst Day, our immediate growth driver is the Encharge battery, followed by the IQ 8 solar microinverters on the roof, then by IQ 8D for the small commercial space, and finally, Ensemble and above for the India off-grid markets. With that, I will turn the call over to Eric for his review of our financial results. Eric?
Eric Branderiz: Thanks, Badri. I will provide more details related to our fourth quarter of 2019 financial results as well as our business outlook for the first quarter of 2020. We have provided reconciliations of non-GAAP to GAAP financial measures in our earnings release posted today which can also be found in the Investor Relations section of our website. Total revenue for the fourth quarter of 2019 was $210 million, including approximately $36.4 million of safe harbor revenue. Total revenue for the fourth quarter of 2019 increased 17% sequentially and increased 128% year-over-year. We shipped approximately 677 megawatts DC in the fourth quarter of 2019, an increase in megawatts DC of 16% sequentially. The megawatts shipped represented approximately 2.1 million microinverters. Non-GAAP gross margin for the fourth quarter of 2019 was 37.3% compared to 36.2% for the third quarter of 2019. Expedite fees are now normalized within our expected range and therefore did not have an abnormal impact in gross margin. Our component supply is stable and as a result we will no longer quantify this expense if it is within the normal course of business. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $26.1 million for the fourth quarter of 2019 compared to $25 million for the third quarter of 2019. GAAP operating expenses were $33.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2019 compared to $31 million for the third quarter of 2019 and GAAP operating expenses for the fourth quarter of 2019 included $5.6 million of the stock-based compensation expenses, $545,000 of amortization expenses for acquiring intangible assts and $1.1 million of restructuring expenses. Our restructuring program was completed at the end of 2019 and at this time, we do not anticipate any further or future expenses related to restructuring. On a non-GAAP basis, income from operations was $52.3 million for the fourth quarter of 2019 compared to $40.2 million for the third quarter of 2019. On a GAAP basis, income from operations was $44.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2019. This increase in operating income is reflective of the strong demand of our products and our focus on cost reduction on expense management. On a non-GAAP basis, net income for the fourth quarter of 2019 was $52 million compared to $39.5 million for the third quarter of 2019. This resulted in diluted earnings per share of $0.39 for the fourth quarter of 2019 compared to $0.30 for the third quarter of 2019. GAAP net income for the fourth quarter of 2019 was $116.7 million compared to $31.1 million for the third quarter of 2019. This resulted in diluted earnings per share of $0.88 for the fourth quarter of 2019 compared to $0.23 for the third quarter of 2019. GAAP earnings per share for the fourth quarter of 2019 includes a $0.54 non-cash benefits from the release of our valuation allowance against deferred tax assets that we highlighted on the Q3 2019 earnings call. I will address taxes shortly. The strong financial results for the fourth quarter of 2019, represents a fifth consecutive quarter of cash generation and GAAP profitability. I’d also like to highlight the significant milestone of achieving the first full year of GAAP profitability in the company’s history. Now, turning to the balance sheet, inventory was $32.1 million at the end of Q4 2019 compared to $30.2 million at the end of Q3 2019. We exited the fourth quarter of 2019 with a total cash balance of $296.1 million, including restricted cash compared to $230 million for third quarter of 2019 and $106.2 million for the fourth quarter of 2018. The restricted cash balance related to first quarter 2020 safe harbor deliveries. We expect that restriction to be lifted at the end of April 2020 and for all cash to be restricted by then. The cash balance benefited from prepayments of $49.9 million for safe harbor deliveries in Q1 2020, of which $5.4 million related to products with deferred revenue component, such as Envoy and Enlighten. Revenue from these products is deferred and recognized as revenue over the respective useful life. As a result, our safe harbor revenue guidance of $44.5 million for the first quarter of 2020 differs from the prepayments we have received. We generated $102.3 million in cash flow from operations and $94.9 million in adjusted free cash flow for the fourth quarter of 2019. For calendar year 2019, we generated $124.3 million of adjusted free cash flow. Capital expenditures were $7.4 million for Q4 2019 mainly to ramp up our microinverter supply capacity in Mexico and Encharge battery capacity in China. Now, let’s discuss our outlook for the first quarter of 2020. We expect our revenue for the fourth quarter of 2020 to be within a range of $200 million to $210 million, including $44.5 million of revenue for ITC safe harbor shipments. Turning to margins, we expect GAAP and non-GAAP gross margin to be within the range of 36% to 39%. We expect our GAAP operating expenses to be within the range of $35 million to $37 million, including approximately $7 million estimated for stock-based compensation expenses and acquisition-related amortization. We expect non-GAAP operating expenses to be within a range of $28 million to $30 million. The sequential increase is primarily related to greater spending on R&D to support new products as well as increasing sales headcount in Europe. In general, our operating expenses are expected to be in line or lower than our baseline financial model of 15% of revenue. Before wrapping up, let me address taxes. During the fourth quarter, we released our valuation allowance against deferred tax assets based on our recent history of profitability that is forecast to persist. This will result on a GAAP tax benefit. We will now be subject to a 26% to 28% GAAP tax rate in 2020, inclusive of federal, state and introduction of taxes. Cash taxes are expected to deviate materially from GAAP taxes as we have federal net operating loss carry-forwards of $147.4 million, federal reserve credits of $12.4 million, and state net operating loss carry-forwards of $97.6 million and state research credits of $11.3 million. Until we fully utilize these NOLs and research credit, most of the cash taxes will only relate to income from international operations, which represents the minority of our business. With that, I will now open the line for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Brian Lee with Goldman Sachs. You may proceed with your question.
Brian Lee: Hey, guys. Thanks for the questions and congrats on the strong quarter. I guess maybe first question on the Q1 guidance, the safe harbor revenue, appreciate all the granularity of providing around the dollar figures, can you also give us a sense of what the customer mix looks like, I know in Q4, you had specific called out the one customer, SunRun, is it the same customer in Q1, is it a totally different customer in Q1 and if it’s a different customer, are there multiple customers? That will be the first question I have.
Badri Kothandaraman: It is a different customer. In fact, there are multiple customers, yes, for the safe harbor, long-term $44.5 million.
Brian Lee: Okay. And Badri, it’s safe to assume that our Tier 1 installers, as you mentioned during your prepared remarks, there is only a handful of data due to the safe harbor?
Badri Kothandaraman: Yes.
Brian Lee: Okay, fair enough. That’s helpful. And then I guess if I – I don’t want you to – I don’t want to corner you into give any more guidance than you are willing to provide, but you did try to provide us a little bit of sense around Q2. So when I look back at the Q2 revenue trends historically, there has been about an average of 30% give or take sequential revenue growth and also a similar range for volumes if I look back to the model, dating all the way back to the 2010s. I know a lot has changed over the period, but is that the type of seasonality we should expect in Q2 this year as well based on your incumbents around healthy bookings and seasonality on core revenues, again, assuming no safe harbor and then no incremental coronavirus impact being the base cases, just wondering if that’s sort of the read we should be taking away from your comments? Thanks.
Badri Kothandaraman: Yes. I mean, that’s a good question. As you correctly said, Q2 is quite seasonally strong whether the number is 20% or 30%, it’s hard for us to say at this point in time, but in general, we expect to outperform the industry seasonality.
Brian Lee: Alright. And then maybe last one if I could squeeze it in, just around the Encharge, it’s encouraging to hear you guys are on schedule for the shipments in Q1, one of your peers who also has a new product in the market. Just last week, Generac announced that they are raising their target for shipments by 50% versus there original view, any thoughts around kind of the market makeup as you are seeing early traction of preorders and also to March and just in the context of your 5% attach rate, is there potentially some upside as you move through the year given how the market is developing? Thanks guys.
Badri Kothandaraman: Yes, I mean, look we are extremely excited by our product. In fact, Encharge is running well at all three of our houses, my house, Eric’s house, Raghu’s house, we are all running. In fact, I went off-grid this morning for about 8 hours. So we are really happy with the performance of Enchage so far. And of course it’s time for us to bring to the market. Ours – if you really step back and think about it, why installers like that solution a lot and this is what the installers told us is really it’s the all in one solar and storage system, seamless experience for the homeowner, one number to call, very high quality, very high customer experience, safe AC architecture, all controlled by Ensemble energy management technology. That’s our value proposition. And we are sticking to our value proposition, there is obviously a lot of competition, lot of noise in the market, but I think our value proposition is quite difficult to compete against. So, we will – many people are coming, we will see them in the marketplace, that’s all I can say right now.
Brian Lee: Okay. Thanks guys.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark Strouse at JPMorgan. You may proceed with your question.
Mark Strouse: Yes, thank you very much for taking our questions. Badri, I just wanted to go back to the comment that you made about the impact from coronavirus and what’s included and what’s not? I believe you said it’s possible there could be some expedited shipping fees, is that included or excluded from the 36% to 39% guidance that you have given?
Badri Kothandaraman: We have already included that in the guidance we gave you.
Mark Strouse: Okay, thank you. And then you have been talking about expedited shipping fees for several quarters now, excluding the wildcard from coronavirus, can you just give an update there? Are you tracking expectations having your capacity be above expected demand?
Badri Kothandaraman: Yes, I mean, look we used to have expedite charges of more than 200 basis points before. That situation has changed. We are now normalized with respect to expedite it’s really in the noise. Of course, due to coronavirus, we have planned little bit more than usual, but that’s already factored in the guidance and going forward if the situation normalizes with respect to coronavirus we will – expedite is going to become nice. It’s not going to be significant for us.
Mark Strouse: Okay, thank you. And then just one quick follow-up for Eric starting next quarter, with the Encharge starting to ship in March, how should we think about any metrics that you are going to give around those shipments – or those revenue beginning in 1Q?
Eric Branderiz: Yes. So we are considering the possibility that starting in Q3 we may start providing breakouts on revenue. We haven’t made the final decision yet. There are external reporting considerations, but we understand that when this becomes meaningful part of our ramp, it will create a little bit of a problem for you folks to be able to model and we are very sensitive to that and we will address it when we have more visibility into how that will workout for external reporting.
Mark Strouse: Okay, very helpful. Thank you.
Badri Kothandaraman: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from ` from Credit Suisse. You may proceed with your question.
Maheep Mandloi: Hi, good evening. Thanks for taking the questions and congratulations on the strong quarter. Maybe just on the other product launches just mentioned on the Analyst Day the IQ 8 and IQ 8D could you probably just talk about how you are thinking about the rollout of those products, specifically given the supply chain disturbances in China if any?
Badri Kothandaraman: Yes, I mean for those, basically we are thinking about the second half of the year, it’s the rough order would be the IQ 8 microinverters on the roof would be the first followed by the commercial microinverters followed by the Ensemble in a box.
Maheep Mandloi: Got it, thanks. And just probably going back to the Encharge, could you just talk about like how much do you – should we expect from Encharge in Q1 specifically or is mostly a Q2 number?
Badri Kothandaraman: We’ll have small shipments of Encharge in Q2 – I mean in Q1, but nothing significant in terms of revenue. Q2 will have one full quarter of Encharge and we expect that to be nice.
Maheep Mandloi: Got it. And just lastly on taxes, I just wanted to make sure we understood that correctly, so from a tax perspective it’s minimal cash taxes and like a standard GAAP tax rate in line with the U.S. corporate tax rate, is that a fair statement?
Badri Kothandaraman: Yes, you got it. Think about $59 million of cash savings for the monetization of the NOL and tax credits, right. That’s for my cash. And for P&L, we give you all the data to be able to morrow on a non-GAAP basis. When those are exhausted, we flip GAAP and non-GAAP will be the same.
Maheep Mandloi: Got it, right. Thanks for taking your questions.
Badri Kothandaraman: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Colin Rusch with Oppenheimer. You may proceed with your question.
Colin Rusch: Thanks so much. Can you guys talk a little bit about the growth in Europe, how effective you have been in being able to build out the sales team and how much of the 1Q guide is especially come out of non-North American sales?
Badri Kothandaraman: Yes, I mean, we don’t really breakout the exact numbers for Europe, but I did give you some color this time, on the total revenue for 2019 was $68 million. Our plan is to double it in 2020 to go to $136 million. And like what I told you, we have not been happy with our progress in Europe, but that has changed. Now, we are actually doing very well. We have hired already bunch of sales guys in place. We have internal transfers from the U.S. already in place, they have already started. And so in terms of headcount, approximately 5 sales people was the number we had in 2019 and that number will triple as we get towards March and April. So we are tripling our sales headcount in Europe. We are focusing on the right regions. Our sales guy in Germany already started. He is driving the collaboration with Kraton. We have already hired the guys for Spain. And we are doubling down on Netherlands, our most important area. We are also going to double down on France, where we have a very high market share already. Yes, I mean it’s a good story right now. We are very confident that we are going to make progress. We are very confident of start seeing an uptick in revenue as early as Q1.
Colin Rusch: Great. And then as you think about the battery supply chain and your cost structure there, how should we think about the cadence of cost reduction, I am assuming that you are going to go through a series of costs as you get to higher volumes, but just trying to get a sense of what the order of magnitude is on that and how quickly we might get to some of those cost breaks?
Badri Kothandaraman: Yes, like what I told you guys in the Analyst Day, cost reduction is embedded in our DNA, that’s what I call as operational excellence. We look at all kinds of costs. If I look at microinverter costs, I look at the transformer costs, defect costs, the connector costs, for example, the connector yes I can talk about that for hours. So we have a DC connector in our microinverter. Today, we have an adapter cable that converts the connection from the panel into a proprietary connector on the microinverter. We are going to eliminate that adapter cable by building what is called as an MC4 light connector on the microinverter. That alone will save us roughly $2 to $3, but that’s going to take some time. It’s going to take some time. It’s going to be done over multiple quarters. That is just an example of one. We are focusing on transformers. We are focusing on the – always on sourcing the right AC effects. We are always working on combinations where we can integrate more components into out ASIC. So that’s on the microinverter. On the accessories, gateway is an entire exercise. Our Envoy is – we are spending a lot about trying to take cost out of the Envoy, the same effort on the cable and we will apply the same diligence to Encharge going forward. So, that’s why you see our gross margins kinds of sequentially going up. If you see the Q4 number or Q3 number was 36%, Q4 ‘19 we did around 37%, we are guiding 36% to 39% for Q1. So, we are getting more and more executing well on the cost deduction.
Colin Rusch: I will take the rest of it offline. Thanks guys.
Badri Kothandaraman: Yes, thank you.
Eric Branderiz: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeff Osborne with Cowen & Company. You may proceed with our question.
Jeff Osborne: Hey, good afternoon. Just a couple of questions of my end, I was wondering if – I know I’ve asked you this in the past, Badri, but if you just confirm that with Encharge, the launch of that margin profile would be consistent with the corporate average or how do we – I think Colin was trying to ask about that as well, is the initial phases of the launch pressuring margins in Q2 and Q3 and then as you say cost out will come back to the targeted range?
Badri Kothandaraman: No, it’s not going to compress our margins it’s going to be right in line with our model.
Jeff Osborne: Great. That’s great to hear. And then can you just talk about IQ 8 introduction for solar-only deployments, is that still targeted for Q2, Q3? So right now, it’s in the Encharge solution, but how do we think about it, somebody doesn’t want storage, when will that be available?
Badri Kothandaraman: So, as I said, it’s in the second half of 2020 and yes, it’s almost ready. And basically you rightly pointed out it’s already available inside the Encharge, but of course we have to do a lot more work with lot of flavors on IQ 8, which is IQ 8, IQ 8+, the IQ 8X, the IQ 8A and then the real effort is to make sure that the gateway talks to the same language as IQ 8 and ensuring that we do all the due diligence on quality on the various flavors. So, we might do it, earlier things go better, but for now I am just – I am not giving a quarter, but I am saying generically second half of 2020.
Jeff Osborne: Got it. And the last one I had either for yourself, Badri or Eric, just how do we think about the second half as your Mexico capacity ramps up to the million a quarter target and what the implications are for pricing as you sort of reverse the higher prices that you had experienced in 2019, because of the tariff fully recognized and it doesn’t impact the gross margins, but just it would be important for modeling as we think about ASPs per watt?
Eric Branderiz: Like what I said, our – if you think about gross margin, gross margin is a combination of pricing and cost. We are continuously improving our cost in terms of pricing. We know right now the pricing environment is very stable, but of course, we always model 1% to 2% price reductions every quarter, that’s what we do.
Jeff Osborne: Got it. Thank you. 
Eric Branderiz: Thank you.
Badri Kothandaraman: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Philip Shen with ROTH Capital Partners. You may proceed with your question.
Philip Shen: Hey, guys. Thanks for the questions. First one is on the coronavirus situation, I was just wondering if you could give us a little bit more color on what’s happening on the ground there in their facility? So specifically, what kind of capacity utilization have you been running through this tough time and then how do you expect that to trend in the coming weeks? And then what kind of potential impact do you think you could see in Q2? And then finally, you source any critical components from Hubei Province specially?
Badri Kothandaraman: Thanks. So just to give you a quick thing, we make all our microinverters at Flex for young [ph], that’s about 12 hours drive from Wuhan. We have done our homework in terms of the raw materials, the supplier of the raw materials etcetera. Most of our raw material suppliers are in Suzhou and Hangzhou which are also a little bit away from Wuhan. From our diligence checks, our raw materials aren’t, they aren’t affected. And so if I were to think about the entire situation in terms of priority, I would think the following: number one is labor, is labor back in full force or not, the labor in our Flex factory is roughly about, because of the reduced labor our throughput is roughly 50% of the full capacity which is still pretty good for us and then the second priority or the second constraint that we think about is logistics we hear that the outbound logistics from China is getting difficult and so we are always watching our we are paying attention to that the third is a raw materials that you pointed out which we have done the homework we think we are good there. The fourth is obviously we are doing this conference call so late 7 weeks into the quarter if the revenue guidance for the quarter is X we have already shipped 7 over 13X right now that is what I mean by I am at 100% lane we have already shipped that revenue 7 over 13 multiplied by X is what we have shipped the last one is what god he is doing over a 50,000 units a week and of course what depends on the raw material from China and so there is always risk there but we feel pretty good about that guidance right now we have factored all of this situation in both revenue as well as gross margin guidance and considering that we one of the data point is we are fully booked to the guidance that we gave you we are fully booked we are 100% linear we have done the homework in terms of raw materials we are paying extraordinary attention to logistics and so at this time we feel pretty good that if that situation materially changes because there is something that we don’t know we will come back to you but that’s what we know now. 
Philip Shen: Okay. Thanks Badri. But as it relates to Q2 I know you have not provided official guidance you talked to Brian about seasonality kind of being in lines is slightly better than historical or something like that what is the risk to Q2 obviously you have already shipped for Q1 so the question is what is your view on how lets say the current situation remains at this level 50% of full capacity how does that impact what you can deliver on Q2?
Badri Kothandaraman: In the current situation I mean the situation remains the same we will be I don’t think will be in and I don’t think we will have a problem for Q2 if it remains the same the reason is of course we are making good progress in Mexico that is starting to take the burden more and more we are keeping a close eye on the raw material so all things being equal if it were exactly the same in a few days from now and Q2 beginning I am still pretty optimistic about Q2 but you don’t realize that things can change by the day so that’s all I can tell you right now.
Philip Shen: Okay, great. That’s really helpful. Thanks. Shifting gears to pricing I know you talked about that briefly but historically you guys have talked about as you shipped away from China and from Mexico that you test long that pricing to customers earlier probably a few months ago you are talking about may be a price cut starting April 1st to pass it on to customers seems like our recent checks with customers that you are not necessarily getting you have not been actively talking about that what is your view on a potential for price reduction and at what point of time would you expect that to possibly happen?
Badri Kothandaraman: Right. Yes, so we are clear when the supply chain right now is in turbulence due to the coronavirus. Other suppliers are thinking about raising the prices we are not we basically value our customers this time we think that they have already taken a lot of burden on the tariffs so we are not planning to raise prices and it is not prudent for us to also drop prices without understanding the situation on the supply chain due to the virus. So if things stabilize, we will do exactly what I said, which is basically depending upon the percentage of manufacturing in [indiscernible] versus China for North American shipments we will basically reduce prices to that level. And that will happen sometime in Q3 if the situation gets stable in terms of the coronavirus. If not, we got to wait and watch.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Brad Meikle with Williams Trading. You may proceed with your question.
Brad Meikle: Hi, guys. Thanks for the question. So your U.S. business grew 137% year-over-year in 2019, so can you give us some detail in terms of the level of inventories in the channel today versus a year ago? So we can understand how much market share has changed that is because other checks are indicating that SolarEdge inventories are higher in the channel than they were a year ago? I know you get POS data on your inventory in the channel, so can you add any color on that please? Thanks.
Badri Kothandaraman: Yes. We think the reasonable level of inventory to have is usually 8 to 10 weeks and we tried to maintain our channel inventory between 8 to 10 weeks like what I pointed out the last earnings call. But what you said is right we have grown a lot in the last year. Mainly the growth is because of our IQ 7 product, fantastic product it’s due to quality, due to customer experience. We have made a lot of announcements with Tier 1s. We have made a lot of announcement with the long-tail installers. We recently signed up Petersen-Dean and SunRun as well. Things look good there. But as long as we don’t take our eye off the ball in terms of customer experience, I believe we will continue to take shift.
Brad Meikle: Can you quantify though what that market share is today in U.S. residential versus a year ago?
Badri Kothandaraman: So, Brad, I mean, we don’t really track – we don’t really think market share. We control the inputs, but we don’t really track the output. So it would be – I don’t know the number and I am not going to that I am not standing by, okay?
Brad Meikle: Thanks. I mean, it’s obviously a big number given that the market is growing at 25% and you grew at 137% without much inventory growth, so what about storage, can you add anymore color on the beta installs, however many 500 to 800 that have been done, what your feedback has been from the customers, have you gotten follow-on orders? It sounds like April is when production volumes really start off. Can you give us a sense for, I know there is a day and a half training required for an installer? Can you give us some level of understanding what the ramp up might be? I know it’s a new business, but what is the theme like at this point?
Badri Kothandaraman: Yes. Just to get our terminology straight, right now, we are doing what are called as alpha. Alphas are basically near and dear people is what we are doing and like what I said to Eric’s house, my house, or Raghu’s house are all running full Ensemble. And that’s what we have done. So we are giving feedback to the team. There aren’t any major issues. There are always minor in our teething issues that are there in this. And now coming to the second thing is the training, the training of installers. We have trained all our beta installers. So they are our – what we call as the ambassadors that we claimed in the first round. So we obtained about 70 installer personnel and 32 installation companies. These farm our beta network and that essentially in the first week of March they will start installing – pardon, the second week of March, they will start installing beta systems. Ad we are going to get further feedback from that. By that time our compliance will also be done. And so we will be in a very good position in order to ship the product. But in terms of the performance of the product, we are actually exercising it. Like in my house like yes, like what I said this morning I was off-grid for about 6 hours. And everything goes finally, didn’t even – someone has flipped my app to go from on-grid to off-grid, so we can enter it through the app and they were doing a test in my house and I didn’t even know that I was off-grid. That’s a big deal. If I can make that customer experience seamless, it’s all going to be that. We can make that customer experience seamless, I think so there is a lot of upside here.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeffrey Campbell from Tuohy Brothers. You may proceed with your question.
Jeffrey Campbell: Good afternoon and congratulations on the strong quarter. Badri, at the Analyst Day, it was said that other than possibly the price that DC cannot compete with Enphase, and that's what I have me thinking about the IQ 8D and the and the small commercial solar I was thinking even with higher unit ASP IQ 8D reduction in components should see system costs come down relative to the IQ 7, so is it fair to think of it that way and could the IQ 8D be the first Enphase macro that will benefit from quality service and cost competitiveness?
Badri Kothandaraman: Yes but it is not because of the reason you said our architecture is a scalable architecture fully resonant architecture so we are able to what we told you in the analyst day is that the power density for our product is 50% higher for IQ 8D than IQ 8 which means we are able to pack a lot more power not more power in the same form factor and of course that translates into cost and of course we are going to be competitive but we do not price on cost we price on value what is the differentiation with respect to our next best alternative we will have to look at what is in the competition and what value are we specifically providing is it higher quality is it better customer experience is it better installation less labor all of those factors need to be looked at and then we will price our products.
Jeffrey Campbell: Okay well, that’s very helpful And then I also want to ask about the Kraton partnership that that you sent a press release on out recently it looks like it’s a large operation there is 8 factories but I have no sense of how large the client on retail market is or Kratons place in that market so some color there would be helpful and I also wondered if the installer relationships that Enphase will build through Kraton can go beyond claytie installation?
Badri Kothandaraman: Yes the idea is very neat right. If you basically have in-roof solar, and you do it for new homes you would think that it can it basically can catch on like wildfire right but this is an entirely brand new market we have not seen it kick off I expect that it will be a slow and steady growth because we are introducing it in a matured country like Germany. Germany is very strict on quality is very strict on customer experience they would not ramp something as fast it is going to be in a measured way but the advantages are very, very clear it is an AC roof basically standardizes everything and it will reduce the cost of an installation it by definition the modules are built in the factory including the microinverters quality is going to be very high and it is all in all a good experience for the installer so the installers obviously they want it but at this point it is too early for us to talk about the wrap.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Eric Stine with Craig-Hallum. You may proceed with your question.
Eric Stine: Hi everyone. Few quick questions here. The end maybe just on Tier 1 customers, I know a couple of years back you took the action to kind of step away there and late last year picked up sun run these new safe harbor customers that you referenced just curious what kind of contribution you expect from those customers as they come back in 2020 is it meaningful in 2020 and more of a 2021 or do you expect that it could impact 2020 nicely?
Badri Kothandaraman: Yes, we did the safe harbor with SunRun in Q4 and we are doing safe harbor in Q1 with the couple of customers who are not new who are our existing customers the answer to your question is we expect them to use a lot of the safe harbor material but that does not mean that they would not place additional orders in the quarters of course the orders will be in the reduced magnitude but I think they will still be tightened that is what I think.
Eric Stine: Okay, got it. And maybe last one for me just I know it is early here in the new year, but the new home mandate in California, whether you are starting to see an impact or how may be your view has changed or starting to become more clear and then just curious and do you have in mind kind of a share of that markets since you're partnered with SunPower and the Peterson and Dean relationship?
Badri Kothandaraman: I mean it is one way here I have to rely on our partners like SunPower like Peterson and Dean like Lennar homes, these are our partners. They are our front-end to the homeowners to the home builders and so we expect it really well because of our partnership with SunPower here and partnership with Peterson Dean and like our imagine a house being fitted with like for example in the case of Peterson just imagine a house being fitted with an all in one solar and storage system with beautiful in charge in the Enphase solar system that is going to be an amazing customer experience for them. 
Eric Stine: Got it. So this is I mean still thinks I mean it has not changed either way you still think it is a big opportunity and may be still too early to tell the magnitude?
Badri Kothandaraman: Absolutely. I mean it is a nice opportunity for us we are ideally placed because many of these will be small systems and if these small systems the whole point of micro inverters is I can build small systems very easily whole point of Encharge is I can do modularity flexibility very easily I can do 3.3 kilowatt or 6.6, 9.9 or 10 kilowatt hour and I can add chunks later depending upon the customer need for example Raghu has got a 10 kilowatt hour system he wants to add two more 3.3 I have a 16.8 kilo watt hour system Eric has got a 20 kilo watt hour system so each of us are different and the modularity really helps us to fine tune exactly what we want.
Eric Stine: Got it. Thanks.
Badri Kothandaraman: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Sameer Joshi with HC Wainwright. You may proceed with your question.
Sameer Joshi: Yes good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions. What are the products that are being pushed in Europe are they IQ 7 and 7+ based or are you pushing for IQ 8 as well there?
Badri Kothandaraman: Most of Europe right now today is 72 cell modules I believe and so that’s basically IQ 7+ and IQ 7 are the predominant cells in Europe.
Sameer Joshi: Okay. Coming to the safe harbor sales, are the gross margins similar the gross margin profile similar for a safe harbor versus non safe harbor sales?
Badri Kothandaraman: Since we are actually shipping to Tier 1, the gross margin in terms are a little bit lower but as you can see we have made extraordinary improvements in gross margins so you can see despite our huge shipments of safe harbor in Q4 our gross margin increased from Q3 to Q4 
Sameer Joshi: Right. Same with the midpoint of your guidance for Q1 right we got our referencing point there either on the low end or high end of the range in all cases.
Badri Kothandaraman: Yes, in all cases, it is pretty healthy.
Sameer Joshi: Understood. Moving down the operating expenses, the G&A costs or other overall OpEx calls that have been guided for 1Q, are they representative of the rest of the year or does the first quarter have some extra stock-based comp?
Eric Branderiz: Yes. So most of the infrastructure investments that we need to make for the headquarters, many of the IT improvements that we need to do actually will heat OpEx, so what I will say is that we provided the guidelines of 15% of revenue and our view is that the way you guys who know it is by taking that one as kind of base line and then it could be a little bit better than that but for the most part you should consider that to be best I mean investment lines through R&D increases a little bit of the sales in Europe and some of the IT infrastructure security things that we need to do for the company that in the old ways those used to be of a CapEx. Most of the subscription base or license-based IT investment that we need to make is on now P&L, here in the P&L. So that’s the way we are going to be subsidizing through the P&L in the form of investments and our infrastructure growth and supporting the growth.
Sameer Joshi: Understood. And just maybe just one clarification on the ASP per unit per inverter, if I do a back of envelope calculation based on your revenues and total number of units sold, it seems that the ASP is actually reduced over the last several quarters. I know it is not a accurate way of looking at it, but is this trend expected to continue?
Badri Kothandaraman: No, I mean it’s not an accurate way of looking at it. It basically depends the way you look at it, your calculations, take revenue, overall revenue divide it by the number of microinverters is not the real story, because for example, if we do ship our AC batteries which are our first generation batteries. Each of them has got an ASP of $1,000. So we are not breaking those, but your calculation includes those. If we ship a lot of cables for example, if we ship by disproportionate amount of cables, the overall revenue will actually come down. If you ship, I mean, the overall ASP will actually come down. So it’s a heavily dependent on mix. But what I can tell you is this we pay very close attention on what we call as customer variance that we reduced price at a customer – and specific customer and calculate that. And we roll that up. And those numbers are actually very, very less. So, there is really – pricing is very healthy, pricing is flat. And except for what I talked about in terms of the [indiscernible] transition, we don’t see many changes to pricing.
Eric Branderiz: Until it’s good for them to model some price erosion, on their models, right, we always recommend…
Badri Kothandaraman: We always model 1% to 2% for our modeling. So that is the right way to think about it.
Eric Branderiz: And it will get a little more complicated with Ensemble coming onboard, right. So we will provide some help hopefully for you guys tomorrow when the meaningful revenue of Ensemble starts to become more clear right.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Pavel Molchanov with Raymond James. You may proceed with your question.
Pavel Molchanov: Thanks for taking my question. In its mid-term review, the International Trade Commission talked about potentially adjusting or even setting aside the Section 201 tariffs. As it relates to the AC module relationships you have, is there any read-through depending on what the decision will be?
Badri Kothandaraman: No, I think there was a lot of discussion about it, but we have not heard anymore discussion on the tariffs going away and we also know that there is exclusions there. So I don’t believe that, that can play right now.
Eric Branderiz: Most of our volume business with SunPower already is excluded so.
Pavel Molchanov: Understood. And you have already asked about one of the new entrants Generac, if I may, let me ask about another one, LG, can you confirm whether LG is currently a customer for your microinverter as a component to LG’s integrated module product?
Badri Kothandaraman: No they are not a customer.
Pavel Molchanov: Okay, thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. And that concludes our Q&A session. I would now like to turn the call back over to Badri Kothandaraman for any further remarks.
Badri Kothandaraman: So, thank you for joining us today and for your continued support of Enphase. We look forward to speaking with you again during our Q1 2020 earnings call in April. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today’s conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to the Enphase Energy’s Third Quarter 2019 Financial Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Christina Carrabino. Thank you. Please go ahead, ma’am.  
Christina Carrabino: Good afternoon and thank you for joining us on today’s conference call to discuss Enphase Energy’s third quarter 2019 results. On today’s call are Badri Kothandaraman, Enphase’s President and Chief Executive Officer; Eric Branderiz, Chief Financial Officer; and Raghu Belur, Chief Products Officer. After the market closed today, Enphase issued a press release announcing the results for its third quarter ended September 30, 2019. During this conference call, Enphase management will make forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to statements related to Enphase Energy’s financial performance and the capabilities and performance of its technology and products, operations, including service and capacity and current and future market and customer demands and trends for its services and products. These forward-looking statements involve significant risks and uncertainties and Enphase Energy’s actual results or the timing of events could differ materially from these expectations. For a more complete discussion of the risks and uncertainties, please see the company’s annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018, which is on file with the SEC and the quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2019 which will be filed with the SEC in the fourth quarter of 2019. Enphase Energy cautions you not to place any undue reliance on forward-looking statements and undertakes no duty or obligation to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future events or changes in its expectations. Also please note the financial measures used on this call are expressed on a non-GAAP basis unless otherwise noted and have been adjusted to exclude certain charges. The company has provided a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures in its earnings release posted today, which can also be found in the Investor Relations section of its website. Now I would like to introduce Badri Kothandaraman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Enphase Energy. Badri?  
Badri Kothandaraman: Good afternoon and thanks for joining us today to discuss our third quarter 2019 financial results. We had another very good quarter. We reported revenue of $180.1 million, up 34% from the second quarter and up 131% year-on-year. Demand was strong as our customers continue to appreciate our differentiated products, services and quality. We stabilized our component supply in the third quarter and shipped approximately 1.8 million microinverters. I will talk in detail about our supply later in the call.  Our non-GAAP gross margin in the third quarter was 36.2% and our non-GAAP operating income was $40.2 million. Our gross margin was negatively impacted by approximately 220 basis points due to expedite fees related to component shortages. We expect this expedite fee to decrease to within a normal range of 0 to 100 basis points in 2020 and I hope to stop talking about them going forward. Let me provide some additional color on our gross margins. I often get the question on how high our gross margin can go and how sustainable that would be. The answer is that we are always working on improving our gross margin as it is embedded in our DNA. We see opportunities to increase our gross margin through multiple efforts: optimizing pricing, introducing differentiated products like Ensemble, eliminating expedite fees, addressing tariff costs, optimizing supply chain, and implementing engineering cost reduction through ASIC integration. Let’s now talk about cash. We exited the third quarter with a cash balance of $203 million and generated $5 million of cash flow from operations. We increased inventory on hand in Q3 to better service our customers. We expect to end Q4 ‘19 with a significantly higher cash balance due to prepayments for the ITC safe harbor product shipments we will make in Q1 of 2020.  We also exited Q3 at approximately 36, 14 and 22. What this means is 36% gross margin, 14% operating expenses, 22% operating income, all as a percentage of revenue on a non-GAAP basis. Eric will go into greater detail about our financial results later in the call. Let’s now talk about ease of doing business on how customers perceive us. Our Q3 net promoter score was 54% in North America compared to 53% in Q2. Our call wait times were at approximately 2 minutes on average, and we are working to get them to less than a minute by the end of Q4.  We are pleased to announce that as of today, more than 6,300 homeowners in North America have joined our Enphase Upgrade Program. This program is for approximately 30,000 early adopters of our legacy microinverters that reflects our commitment to quality and customer service. Our homeowner NPS for this legacy product upgrade program was 64% in Q3 of 2019. Now let’s cover tariffs. As previously stated, we shared the cost increases due to tariffs with our customers. We expanded our manufacturing with Flex in Mexico to help mitigate the section 301 tariffs, increased global capacity as well as improve delivery. We started shipping our IQ 7 family of microinverters from the Flex Mexico factory in late Q2 and increased shipments in Q3. We manufactured approximately 137,000 microinverters in Q3, a little short of the planned 200,000 that I mentioned on the last earnings call. However, our shipping troubles are over and the team is making great progress towards shipping approximately half a million microinverters in Q4. In fact, our weekly run rate right now is 35,000 units a week. Our plan is to service a significant portion of the North American business from Mexico by Q1 of 2020. Let’s now discuss our capacity in detail. In the past few quarters, we talked about component shortages, which were mainly in the 600 volt power transistors. As a result of our agreement with Infineon and a few other suppliers, we have now stabilized our component supply. In addition, with Mexico coming online, we have capacity in place for 2.5 million microinverters in Q4. Consistent with our revenue guidance, we expect to ship between 2.1 million and 2.2 million microinverters to our customers in Q4. This represents roughly a 15% buffer between demand and supply. We have instituted a 6-quarter forecasting process at Enphase where we review our unconstrained demand on a monthly basis and ensure there is enough storage capacity available in order to service customers well. Moving on to the regions, our U.S. and international mix for Q3 was 84% and 16%, respectively, compared to 74% and 26% in Q2.  Our third quarter revenue in the U.S. was up 51% sequentially and up 175% year-on-year due to strong demand from new and existing customers. As we have stated over the last year, our channel inventory has been tight. And for the first time this year, our supply was enough to accommodate customer demand.  In Europe, our third quarter revenue was down 21% sequentially and up 47% year-on-year. After a strong Q2 in which our channel inventory returned to normalized levels, our Q3 revenue in Europe was in line with our sales run-rate. Netherlands and France remain strong markets for us. However, we are not satisfied with the progress we are making in rest of Europe. Our executive team was in Brussels during the third quarter and identified many strategic initiatives for growth in the rest of Europe, including bolstering our sales force immediately. Our growth in Europe will be a major focus area for me, personally, in 2020. The opportunities are great, the market is a growing market, and we have a very strong product-market fit. We simply need to execute better.  In APAC, our third quarter revenue was down 16% sequentially and down 22% year-on-year. During the quarter, our executive team also reviewed the strategic plan for our Australian business. We are beginning to execute well on that plan by hiring top-notch sales managers, calling on the long tail of installers and selling our value proposition of safe AC on roof, high-quality and superior customer experience. I am confident that this region is going to bounce back as we transition into 2020.  In Latin America, our third quarter revenue was up 50% sequentially and up 47% year-on-year. We are excited about the growth opportunities in Latin America and are targeting more areas within Mexico and other LatAm countries.  We continue to work with some of our customers in North America on their ITC safe harbor demand. We plan to ship approximately $35 million of product for ITC safe harbor to a new customer in Q4. In addition, we expect Q1 to be an equally significant quarter for safe harbor. Let’s now cover our new products. We are pleased to announce the general availability of our latest product called IQ 7A, a high-power microinverter targeted for modules up to 450 watt DC. Installers will be able to pair the IQ 7A microinverter with monofacial or bifacial modules.  Let’s come to AC modules. We continued to make steady progress with our AC module partners during Q3, including SunPower, Panasonic and Solaria, to mention a few. Enphase Energy ACM from our module partners have now been adopted by more than 600 installers in the U.S. as of this date. I would now like to talk about Ensemble first, the off-grid product and then the storage product for North America. Let’s come to the upgrade product. We expect to ship several thousand units of the upgrade product we call that as EQ 8, to our partner in Q4. We plan to deliver the final requirements shortly to our partner in order to enable the plan.  Let’s now talk about Ensemble 1.0, which is focused on enabling high capacity storage for North America. Storage is enabled by our Encharge battery, which is a modular 3.3 kilowatt hours solution. The modularity allows for ease of installation, flexibility and scalability while helping to streamline our supply chain. The Encharge battery will be available in two variants: 3.3 kilowatt hour and 10 kilowatt hour. The 3.3 kilowatt-hour battery contains 4 IQ 8 grid-agnostic microinverters internally. As you are all aware, there have been fires in Sonoma County in the last few days. Many of our employees in Petaluma, as well as their families are affected and have been evacuated. Our thoughts are with those whose lives have been impacted. As a side effect from these fires, many of us, including me, have lost power for an extended period of time. The unfortunate reality is that homeowners are not prepared for these blackouts. Encharge powered by Ensemble technology will be an ideal product to address blackouts and keep our homes Always On. What do I mean by Always On? Ensemble is a technology that brings together solar, storage, grid and even a generator onto a single energy management platform to keep the home "Always On." This technology optimizes the usage of these resources under all conditions. For example, when the grid is down, Ensemble can balance the usage of solar, storage and the generator to keep the lights on and when the grid is up, it can make an economic decision regarding the source of energy. Today, we released some installer-specific content for Ensemble on our website. At the recent SPI conference in Utah, we held several installer roundtables with a total of approximately 15 stores. The feedback from the installers was to provide enough information on our website a little bit earlier to make it easier for them to pre-sell Encharge and we did exactly that. We are in the process of installing Ensemble 1.0 alpha systems at a few Enphase sites as well as a few employee’s homes. When we complete comprehensive software testing on these alpha systems, we plan to take pre-orders in December through our distribution partners. We expect production shipments in the first quarter of 2020 after completing real-world beta installations with nearly 20 installers. After the release of the storage product, we expect further revisions of Ensemble to be released in 2020 with a focus on IQ8PV or IQ 8 solar installations. The advantage of IQ 8s on the roof will be that these grid-forming microinverters will produce power from panels, even during blackout as long as the sun is still shining. It addresses a major pinpoint without the need for storage and is completely differentiated in that respect. In summary, we are pleased with our overall progress we have made this year. Our base microinverter business continues to grow and is pretty healthy. Our component supply has stabilized. We are excited about our upcoming storage product and remain focused on delivering Encharge to the market.  I would like to make one more important announcement. We will be hosting an Analyst Day during the second week of December to provide deeper updates on strategic initiatives, our financial model, as well as new products. More details on our Analyst Day will follow over the next few weeks. With that, I will turn the call over to Eric for his review of our financial results. Eric?  
Eric Branderiz: Thanks, Badri. I will provide more details related to our third quarter of 2018 financial results as well as our business outlook for the fourth quarter. As a reminder, the financial measures that I’m going to provide are on a non-GAAP basis unless otherwise noted. We have provided reconciliations of these non-GAAP to GAAP financial measures in our earnings release posted today which can also be found in the Investor Relations section of our website.     Total revenue for the third quarter of 2019 was $180.1 million, including approximately $8 million of safe harbor revenue. Total revenue for the third quarter of 2019 increased 34% sequentially and increased 131% year-over-year. We shipped approximately 584 megawatts DC in the third quarter of 2019, an increase in megawatts DC of 40% sequentially and an increase of 186% from the year-ago quarter. The megawatts shipped represented approximately 1.8 million microinverters, approximately 99% of which was IQ 7.   Non-GAAP gross margin for the third quarter of 2019 was 36.2% compared to 34.1% for the second quarter of 2019. Component shortages negatively impacted our Q3 2019 non-GAAP gross margin by approximately 220 basis points.    Non-GAAP operating expenses were $25 million for the third quarter of 2019, compared to $22.5 million for the second quarter of 2019 and $18.6 million for the third quarter of 2018.     GAAP operating expenses were $31 million for the third quarter of 2019, compared to $27.9 million for the second quarter of 2019 and $25.6 million for the third quarter of 2018. GAAP operating expenses for the third quarter of 2019 included $4.9 million of stock-based compensation expenses $546,000 of amortization expenses for acquired tangible assets and $469,000 of restructuring expense.    On a non-GAAP basis, income from operations was $40.2 million for the third quarter of 2019, compared to $23.2 million for the second quarter of 2019 and $7 million for the year ago quarter. This decrease in operating income is reflective of our continued improvement in our – in operational excellence and product leadership.      On a GAAP basis, income from operations was $33.7 million for the third quarter of 2019.     On a non-GAAP basis, net income for the third quarter of 2019 was $39.5 million, compared to $23.2 million for the second quarter of 2019 and $4.6 million for the year ago quarter. This resulted in basic earnings per share of $0.32 and diluted earnings per share of $0.30 for the third quarter of 2019, compared to basic earnings per share of $0.20 and diluted earnings per share of $0.18 for the second quarter of 2019.  GAAP net income for the third quarter of 2019 was $31.1 million compared to $10.6 million for the second quarter of 2019 and a loss of $3.5 million for the third quarter of 2018. This resulted in basic earnings per share of $0.25 and diluted earnings per share of $0.23 for the third quarter of 2019, compared to basic earnings per share of $0.09 and diluted earnings per share of $0.08 for the second quarter of 2019. We are happy to report that we achieved the important financial milestone of four consecutive quarters of cash generation and GAAP profitability. As we continue to maintain profitability, there is a reasonable possibility that we may release our valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets in the near future as disclosed in our 10-Q.   Now turning to the balance sheet. Inventory was $30.2 million at the end of Q3 2019, compared to $20.1 million at the end of Q2 2019 and then $17.9 million at the end of Q3 2018. We ended at 24 days of inventory on hand as of September 30, 2019, significantly below our internal target of 30 days, up from 21 days in the second quarter and down from 31 days in the year ago quarter. The increase in days of inventory on hand as of September 30, 2019 was intended to improve shipping linearity to our customers and better service increasing demand. Inventory management continues to remain one of our key cash management initiatives. We exited the third quarter of 2019 with a total cash balance of $203 million, compared to $206 million for the second quarter of 2019. We generated $5 million in cash flows from operations and $769,000 in adjusted free cash flow for the third quarter of 2019.    Capital expenditure was $4.2 million for Q3 2019, mainly to ramp up our supply capacity in Mexico and China. As Badri mentioned, we expect to end Q4 2019 with a significantly higher cash balance due to prepayments for the ITC safe harbor product shipment in Q1 2020.   Now let’s discuss our outlook for the fourth quarter of 2019. We expect our revenue for the fourth quarter of 2019 to be within a range of $200 million to $210 million, including approximately $35 million of shipments for ITC safe harbor to a new customer. Turning to margins, we expect GAAP and non-GAAP gross margin to be within a range of 34% to 37%. And we expect our GAAP operating expenses to be within a range of $31.5 million to $33.5 million, including a total of approximately $7 million estimated for stock-based compensation expenses, restructuring and acquisition-related amortization. We expect non-GAAP operating expenses to be within a range of $24.5 million to $26.5 million.   With that, I will now open the line for questions.  
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Philip Shen from ROTH Capital Partners. Your line is now open.  
Q - Philip Shen: Hi, everyone. Thanks for the questions. In terms of your guidance for Q4 in the $35 million Safe Harbor for a single customer, to what degree did you prioritize the need of a single customer and had you not served that customer, how much volume do you think you could have sold into the broader U.S. market?  
A - Badri Kothandaraman: Well, we gave you a clear view on our capacity. So basically, in Q4 of ‘19, which is this quarter, we have a capacity of 2.5 million microinverters and our guidance reflects basically shipments of 2.1 to 2.2 million microinverters. So our capacity problems are over and we are basically back to demand limited environment.  
Q - Philip Shen: Great. And Badri, I think you mentioned for Q1, you expect a similar level of Safe Harbor, is that correct?  
A - Badri Kothandaraman: That’s exactly right.  
Q - Philip Shen: Is it for the same – okay? Is it for the same customer or do you expect it to be for other customers as well?  
A - Badri Kothandaraman: At this time, I am unable to provide you that color. All I know is that it will be the same. It will be the equivalent amount.  
Q - Philip Shen: Got it, great. And then as it relates to storage, I know you gave us a ramp there, when do you – can you comment on when you expect to see the storage product really hitting meaningful volumes?
A - Badri Kothandaraman: Look, I mean like what I said we released our website this afternoon. That is going to give installers a lot of – install a specific information to help them pre-sell the product. We plan to take pre-orders in December. Once we have basically installed at a few of our homes which is myself, Eric, Raghu and our systems are functioning well and we personally ensure that it is high-quality, then we will begin taking preorders. We will release – we will start shipping production in the first quarter of 2020 and we are going to be prepared for a good ramp, but the ramps are often difficult. Ramps are often uncertain, very difficult to predict. So I would say by the second half, we should have ramped fully, but Q2, I would expect to be reasonably significant as well.  
Q - Philip Shen: Okay, great. And one last one for me, can you talk about the visibility you have into Q1, I know you don’t have guidance officially, but can you comment on the seasonality that you might expect to see in Q1 and what the overall direction of Q1 could be relative to Q4?  
A - Badri Kothandaraman: It’s too early to give you specific numbers on guidance, but we expect to see the typical seasonality associated with the industry in Q1.  
Q - Philip Shen: Okay, great. Thanks, Badri. I will pass it on.  
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Brad Meikle from Williams Trading. Your line is now open.  
Q - Brad Meikle: Hi, thanks for your question. As you are well aware, we have been without power in Northern California for the last 5 days, 2.5 million households. And I think if you guys did 100,000 homes that would be $1 billion in revenues. Could you speak to how much you will or will not be capacity constrained in terms of being able to ramp your battery shipments and I think you had a couple sources on the sale supply, right? Thank you. I have got a follow-up.  
A - Badri Kothandaraman: A follow-up, right. So the question is on the capacity of batteries and will we be able to handle the ramp considering there is going to be a huge demand here in Northern California. So the answer is yes, we have announced partnerships with A123 on the battery supply that is public. We basically have good capacity with them. We also signed agreements with one other battery supplier, a Chinese-based battery supplier that we have not announced. However, we are well into the qualification stages with them, and we expect them also to come on in early 2020. Both of them have promised that nice capacity number. So I think it would be well aligned with our ramp. And if we need to bring in a third supplier, we will not hesitate to bring one.  
Q - Brad Meikle: Okay. The follow-up I had was there has been a lot of speculation around inventory in the channel and whether you have been stuffing the channel. Can you tell us how many weeks your distributors have? How many weeks your direct customers have and whether the inventory level has been growing and whether you feel like you stuffing the channel? If you can add some color to that, please?  
A - Badri Kothandaraman: Right. So let me give some background there. In the last four quarters, we have been unable to meet our customers’ demand. We have been supply limited. And every quarter, prior to entering every quarter, we were fully booked. So there was no question that we were building inventory. We will hand them out. We didn’t have enough supply. Q3 is the first quarter where supply was able to keep up with demand. Now let me come to channel management. I have what is called as the ship review every week where we look at the revenue for the corporation. Basically, we have a channel management business process, which means that we look at every distributor. We basically look at what is their sell-through every week. Sell-through is how well that distributor is doing in order to sell to the end customers, which is the installers, the Tier 3, Tier 4 installers particularly. And essentially, we do both the top down as well as bottoms up, which is we do have distribution managers whose job is to watch the inventory. We also have sales speeds regardless the Tier 3 tier 4 sales folks. All they do is they generate a lot of demand, bottoms up, so that the distributors can sell-through the product to those installers. So we do a combination of both. And then we have strict limits, which is if we find that a distributor does not have enough sell-through for a previous week, we have formulas in place where we consciously limit shipment into the channel. So it is no longer an art, it is a science, and it is not yet run by a computer, it will soon be run by a computer. But we – our channel management is well under control.  
Q - Brad Meikle: How many weeks on average, can you say how many weeks on average?  
A - Badri Kothandaraman: Historically, we have not talked about the weeks of inventory. We do not talk about the weeks of inventory. However, I will tell you a good best practice that we have talked about in the past is to have 8 to 10 weeks of inventory in the channel. That’s the guideline I can give you, Brad.  
Q - Brad Meikle: Thank you very much. Great job on the quarter.  
A - Badri Kothandaraman: Thank you.  
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Mark Strouse from JPMorgan. Your line is now open.  
Q - Mark Strouse: Yes. Good afternoon. Thank you very much for taking our questions. Just curious if you can comment on any changes you have observed in the competitive environment, if any, either from anything that you saw at SPI or any conversations that you have had with your distributors or installers over the last quarter?  
A - Badri Kothandaraman: Yes, there have been a lot of – I mean several competitors that emerged with SPI announcements. We are closely watching everyone. But our strategy is the same. While we continue to watch competition, what we do is focus on the value we can provide. And I’ve always told you and I’m like a broken record here. So basically, we have 3 things: product innovation, quality and customer experience. It comes to product innovation, let’s start with IQ 7. We introduced IQ 7 in Q1 of ‘18. And IQ 7 was a software-defined architecture. Even though it was a software-defined architecture, we still have come with generations of IQ 7, IQ 7+ IQ 7X, IQ 7A progressively increasing power with the same base platform. And soon, we will introduce an even more higher powered version very soon in the coming months. So with the same platform, we were able to leverage the hardware to basically increase the AC power and increasing AC power is important. The more AC power the product has the more gross margin I mix. So it’s extremely important. So having talked about IQ 7, the biggest deal is on Ensemble, what is the fundamental point on Ensemble. It is that – Ensemble is a unique kind of product. Ensemble can function, meaning microinverters based on Ensemble technology called IQ 8 can function on the roof when the grid is down, when the sun is shining. I have not seen such an elegant product available yet in the research that I have done. So we are unique and differentiated in that respect. The second is Ensemble more than the microinverter is the technology. It’s an energy management technology. Energy management technology that manages, like what I said, it manages solar, it manages storage, it can even manage the generators and can manage the grid. So if you start progressing, if I don’t have anything except the grid, it is very easy. The consumption inputs the grid. If I have solar, then I have solar and the grid to optimize consumption. So it gets – starting to get a little complex. If I have storage, I have no solar, storage and the grid. Then if I have a generator, I have solar storage generated out of fewer cells and the grid to optimize consumption. So Ensemble technology can exactly do that. It can keep you always on, regardless of what is happening right now. I just wish our products were a little bit earlier. But regardless of the grid, if the energy sources are managed right, people can have their homes always on during these blackouts. And that’s what we are all about. So bottom line, our focus on product innovation. And of course, product innovation is not enough. We need the quality. We need – 500 DPPM is our target, which is of 1 million microinverter shipped annually, 500 come back to us. That’s our 500 DPPM, which is 500 defective parts per million. And that is not easy to do. This is with a very tight business processes, root cause corrective action methodologies, ASIC integration, over-the-air firmware upgrade. All of these are required in order to achieve this kind of quality level. And of course, customer experience. Next is customer experience. So customer experience is we pride on ourselves, being able to answer the phone in 2 minutes or less. And I am not satisfied with that. How about we answer the phone when it rings, that’s what I tell my team, which is get down even further. We have got together of Q4 with sub 1 minute of wait times and then eventually, get to pick up the call when I drink, so product innovation, quality, customer experience. These are our differentiating aspects. We focus on that all the time. And I hope I answered your question a little bit there.  
Q - Mark Strouse: Yes, that’s very helpful, Badri. And then just lastly, if I look at the guidance for Q4 and strip out the $35 million or so for safe harboring and then strip out the $8 million from this quarter, it kind of suggests relatively flattish revenue quarter-over-quarter. Can you just go back to your commentary you provided earlier, kind of by geography? And if you had to boil down that, that flattish revenue quarter-over-quarter to any particular geography or product, is there a way to do that or is that not a really fair way of looking at the revenue?  
A - Badri Kothandaraman: Your observations are right. On the base business, there are a lot of puts and takes in the base business. But realize one thing, that we have basically been supply limited for the last four quarters. So we have never been able to catch up on the demand. And this is the first quarter we actually caught up on the demand. But having said that, to answer your question, I already told you, Europe, I’m not happy with Europe. The performance of Europe is not that great. Although we have improved a lot compared to last year. We said 47% if I am right, 47% year-on-year. But I am not happy with the progress we are making in the rest of Europe. Netherlands is a very nice market for us. Netherlands is the biggest growing market in Europe. We are doing well there. France is we have over – I mean, we have majority of share in France. France is also growing, but we are still yet to make progress in Germany. We have yet to make progress in Belgium. Market share in Belgium is quite low. We look forward to making progress in other Eastern European countries, all in Hungary, those places. So yes, we have work to do.  
Q - Mark Strouse: Very helpful. Thank you very much.  
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Eric Stine from Craig-Hallum. Your line is now open.  
Q - Eric Stine: Hi, everyone. Just want to come back to storage a little bit, it sounds like you won’t be capacity constrained and I know it’s still early. You are just out with the early units in running those. But based on conversations with the channel, any thoughts on where you think attach rates could be whether it’s early or whether it’s when things are really rolling as you get into 2020?  
A - Badri Kothandaraman: I mean, our suppliers as well as our competitors have kind of provided an attach rate already. So basically, Sunrun talks about 25% attach rate in California and we expect that to be true. We also expect the blackouts to be accelerating that. And also, for us, it’s not only that in addition, we have an installed base. If you look at our installed base, as of today, our installed base is over 1 million homes. Of over 1 million homes, maybe 70% is in Northern – is in North America. And these are all loyal and safe customers. They’ve been waiting for some time for Ensemble storage. So there’s going to be a lot of demand from there, too in addition to the demand generated from blackouts. Of course, California is – yes, it got a nice attach. Hawaii has got a nice attach. Other countries are coming. Puerto Rico has got a nice attach, yes. Texas is going to come soon. Massachusetts is going to come soon. So we’re going to start seeing an option.  
Q - Eric Stine: Okay. And then just when talking about that installed base. I mean, the majority of that installed base is the IQ platform. Is that right? And that is what would be required for those homeowners to use storage?  
A - Badri Kothandaraman: Right. Yes, yes, is the answer, a significant portion of the IQ platform, not the majority. We do have our M215 and M250 product. But the customers are quite clear there that that they basically actually want to upgrade to the latest and greatest technology. Technology that gives them superior power reduction, technology compared to – it is comparable to Ensemble. It is a one-stop shop for – Enphase will be a one-stop shop for solar storage, communication, so yes.  
Q - Eric Stine: Okay. Maybe last one for me, just the recent announcement, the IQ 7A launch. I mean, it seems to me like that’s kind of an entry into the C&I market. Just curious, should we view it that way? Is that something that’s just based on your installers and what parts of the market they go after? Any thoughts on that would be helpful.  
A - Badri Kothandaraman: So to begin with, the 7A was really a big target for the – I mean, residential market as the power continues to increase. However, I’m sure some of our markets, some of our installers will be optimistically looking at using the 7A on the C&I business as well. Having said that, we really expect – we really targeted towards the residential. That’s what we keep in mind.  
Q - Eric Stine: Okay, thanks.  
A - Badri Kothandaraman: Thank you.  
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Jeff Osborne from Cowen & Company. Your line is now open.  
Q - Jeff Osborne: Hey good afternoon. I just wanted to circle back to Mark’s question about the flattish revenue and asking it a different way. As you look at your six quarter pipeline that you highlighted for your forecasting methodology. Can you just give us a sense of the 2.5 million units of capacity where you think that will be exiting next year? Clearly, you had the surge of 4 quarters where your capacity constrained. Now you’ve been able to catch up, which is great. Customers will be more satisfied with that. And I’m just trying to get a sense of as you have the safe harbor surge in Q1, do you become capacity constrained? And then how do we think about the time line or process for you to add more capacity whether it’s in Mexico or China?  
A - Badri Kothandaraman: Right. I mean, as an executive team, we decided that we will never be constrained by capacity. So that’s basically our thinking. And we look at our demand, unconstrained demand, on a 6 quarter basis. And then we have enough – meaning plenty of search capacity, almost 35%, 40% of search capacity that is available so that we can meet abnormally or demand spikes that happen. Having said that, yes, you can say that in Q4 the base business, if you exclude safe harbor, Q4 and Q3 are flat. But note that the safe harbor business came from a brand-new customer that was not there before. And so that’s a big deal. And also, going forward, we expect Ensemble once it kicks in, in Q1 of ‘20 that to drive major customer adoption. That’s what we are all about. So we are getting prepared for Ensemble. Your question on can we add more capacity, for example, if I find I need to go to – I need to go to 4 million units in Q4 of 2020. And if my 6-quarter forecast shows I need that, it will not be a problem for us to do that. It will take us anywhere from 3 to 6 months in order to build that kind of capacity.  
Q - Jeff Osborne: But in the meantime, if I’m hearing you right, Badri that you could do easily $3 million paying over time at Flex if there was a surge next summer, even though you’ve got a nameplate of 2.5%. Is the right way to think about it, right?  
A - Badri Kothandaraman: As of today, like what I said, clearly, our capacity is 2.5 million units. I told you 2 million units, a couple of quarters back. Now we have increased it to 2.5. We increased it because we are hovering around that for demand, and I talked about a buffer. So obviously, we are not going to do capacity changes in a vacuum. It will always be predicated by demand, which is why we have forecasting process. The forecasting process tells me that my demand is going to be 3 million units, it’s going to be no problem for me to get to that.  
Q - Jeff Osborne: Got it. Good to hear. I just have two financial questions for Eric. One is, you made reference to the valuation allowance, possibly being reversed, given you called it out, I would assume that, that happens at some point. Can you just remind us of how we should be thinking about tax rate modeling and the financial impact of that reversal?  
A - Eric Branderiz: Yes. We will provide more clarity on that one. As part of the Analyst Day, but the reversal can be as early as Q4, right? And that will be likely we’re going to have for us a GAAP-only treatment, because it’s a big large release of the allowance, which will be a bit credit on the balance sheet and the P&L. And then in terms of tax rate, I would use for now the corporate tax rate. Remember, we have no else on the books, right? So you can probably back into numbers until we provide more guidance in Analyst Day
Q - Jeff Osborne: Got it. And then the last question I had was just as you look at guidance of 34% to 37%. Can you just talk about, given the visibility you have, what would get you to the low end of that range versus the high end of the range?  
A - Badri Kothandaraman: I mean historically, we have talked about – we have given a 3 percentage point range. And in general, we give ourselves a lot of room for any execution issues that happen in the quarter, et cetera. So it’s basically, yes, short-term fluctuations. But what’s more exciting is the long-term view of gross margin. So everybody keeps asking me, is 35% it, and the answer is no. The 35% is not it. We have a lot of opportunities for us to improve gross margin. That’s what we do. Every week, we run a world-class cost, meaning where the focus is on improving cost of our system, system cost, not microinverter only, microinverters, cable, batteries, accessories, combiners, everything. We also run a pricing, meaning there, again, the focus is on pricing optimization. So multiple initiatives, optimizing pricing, like what I said, introducing products like Ensemble and IQ 7A, eliminating expedite fees as the component supply situation stabilizes, addressing tariff cost, doing cost reductions through ASIC integration. These are all something we’re continuously doing. That’s why you’re seeing the gross margin execution over the last year, we have steadily been climbing on gross margins.  
Q - Jeff Osborne: Certainly, it has been impressive. Thanks for all the detail. I appreciate it.  
A - Badri Kothandaraman: Yes.  
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Colin Rusch from Oppenheimer. Your line is now open.  
Q - Colin Rusch: Thank you so much. With the Ensemble technology development and kind of the preparedness to ramp that here, we knew that the firmware was one of the last remaining pieces that you guys were working on. Can you talk about where you’re at in that development? And then as you think about the updates as you go through testing next year, can you talk about your expected cadence for improvements as you go throughout the year?  
A - Badri Kothandaraman: Right. So yes, I’ll talk about something I’ve not talked about before. So there are multiple levels of testing that we do. One is called the unit testing on all the boards that we use inside products like Encharge, Enpower, the combiner box sector. That’s called the unit testing. The other is called the product testing, which is product testing means I test the battery using certain stimulus. And that’s called as product testing, which is – if I need to test the battery properly, I need to make sure the battery management unit [de-cell] themselves, the microinverters, the battery controllers, all of them are working together and responding right to stimulus, the external stimulus. So we covered the unit testing. We covered the product tests. The third, which is the most important, is actually system testing.  What do I mean by a system? A system is how you or me would use it in the house, which means I need to have a solar simulator for solar. I need to have the battery. I need to have my Enpower switch. I need to have the grid. And I need to have my communication equipment and the cloud. All of them will have to be real life. They have to be like how you are living in your home with your normal loads being consumed. So we have to simulate with all kinds of loads. We have to do grid on, grid off simulation. So we have graduated from component testing, which is the – which is what I said, that’s the first basic testing to product testing. Now we are doing system testing. System testing means we install the units like what I said at – it could be my house. It could be Raghu’s house, Eric’s house. In fact, they already have the system installed right now. And we need to beat on them to make sure all the use cases are covered. And in all of these, what is unique about Ensemble is that the hardware is done, which is the hardware that makes you grid-agnostic. That is done. But the software that helps you manage all of these resources, which I told you about, solar, storage, grid, even a generator and the loops. That need to be working well in real life, which is why once we finish our alpha installations, which will be primarily focused on the system software testing, once we do that properly, we will then start taking preorders because our confidence moves from 85% to 95% at that point. And then we basically start to ship that product after we finish real-life installations. We already have about 24 installers who are ambassadors for us. They already have signed up to receive beta installations from us. We will be installing – we will be doing these betas. These are real products. And we will be doing so many installs, 24 installs. We will be getting feedback from all of them. We will determine if we have to course-correct or not. And maybe there are minor course-corrections we will do. And then we will release the product to production. So it’s all coming together right now. I’m just giving you the full picture so you guys know exactly the same thing as me. And of course, we will never release something which does not have the quality and customer experience, which means if I have – if you have an Ensemble system at home, you should be able to – or we should be able to upgrade you to the latest software in the event we have to make changes. That’s called over-the-air software upgrade. And those are all – those all need to be working seamlessly. So it’s basically that is going on right now, but we are confident that by early December, that will be done and we would start taking pre-orders.  
Q - Colin Rusch: Perfect. And then just in terms of the geographies, you mentioned where your sales efforts aren’t as productive as you had hoped. Can you talk about what the sticking points are? I mean certainly, getting designed into a base-level design for systems ends up being very important for folks. What are the challenges? Is it familiarity with the product? Is it the design cycle? Is it just availability of product to those geographies? Help us understand what’s going on there?  
A - Badri Kothandaraman: Colin, it’s pretty simple. It’s a focus issue. We have not paid attention. And basically, the way we paid attention to North America by staffing with the best-in-class salespeople in North America, we need to do the same thing. Our products are world-class. Our products have a great fit for the market. The market is a growing market. We just need to execute.  
Q - Colin Rusch: Okay. Thanks, guys.  
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Jeffrey Campbell from Tuohy Brothers. Your line is now open.  
Q - Jeffrey Campbell: Congratulations on the quarter. My first question is with regard to the Safe Harbor sales that you’ve identified in the first quarter of ‘20. Are they somehow receiving the 30% ITC deduction? Or is this activity that’s actually pegged to the lower 2020 ITC?  
A - Badri Kothandaraman: They are going to receive the 30%.  
Q - Jeffrey Campbell: Okay, great. And my second question is back to the IQ 7A, do you envision this as primarily an ACM solution?  
A - Badri Kothandaraman: Not really, no, it can cater to both discrete as well as AC modules.  
Jeffrey Campbell: Q - Okay, excellent. Thank you. That’s it for me.  
A - Badri Kothandaraman: Thank you.  
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Amit Dayal from H.C. Wainwright. Your line is now open.  
Q - Amit Dayal: Thank you for taking my questions. Badri, just with respect to this million installed base, how are we reaching out to these folks? What is the plan of attack over here and has that effort already started? Are you waiting until you complete some of this testing, etcetera?  
A - Badri Kothandaraman: We will provide...  
Q - Amit Dayal: Related to the storage uptake, sorry.  
A - Badri Kothandaraman: Right. We will provide some more color during the Analyst Day, but here is the short story. The million homes or 997,000 homes, they all communicate with us through the Enlighten app. That is a mobile app that basically that we have. That is their gateway to their – providing a view of their power. So they already contact Enphase all the time, both homeowners as well as installers. Having said that, our strategy for Ensemble is making sure that these beta installations are right, we have the right customer experience, and then we can introduce our homeowners to do upgrades, upgrade online or introduce them to programs like the legacy product upgrade, which is a very successful program where about nearly 30,000 homeowners who bought product 10 years or 8 years ago are willingly, they want to all replace by IQ 7. So it will be a similar program. But we’ll do only when we are ready, when we have finished the beta installations. And then we will start on those.  
Q - Amit Dayal: Understood. And then with the Ensemble and IQ 8, etcetera, now coming into play, how should we think about the addressable market for Enphase and your opportunity to take a good share of that market?  
A - Badri Kothandaraman: Like what I told you, right, the – today, with pure microinverters, we do roughly about $2,000 a home. With batteries, meaning storage, we will do more than $10,000 a home. And that means even if the attach rate is 20%, it is still significant dollars for us, right? That’s the way to think about it. Still storage is nascent. There are only a couple of states like California and Hawaii who have really ramped on storage. The value proposition for the other states is not as straightforward as California. For example, there are blackouts. It’s simply a peace of mind. And that value proposition needs to come through. And basically, storage is going to start becoming mainstream. That’s going to happen very soon. And then with $10,000 a home, we should be getting our fair share of what we get for microinverters today.  
Q - Amit Dayal: Got it. And just one last one for me, your comments on the expedite fee, given that your capacity and shipment sort of expectations you’ve laid out, I mean, is this expedite fee gone by 1Q ‘20 results?  
A - Badri Kothandaraman: That’s what I said. I said from 2020, I really hope it’s going to be gone. I really hope I’m going to be not talking about it. And it needs to fall within 0 to 100 basis points so that we stop talking about it.  
Q - Amit Dayal: Yes, that’s all I have. I appreciate it.  
A - Badri Kothandaraman: Thank you.  
Operator: Our next question is from Maheep Mandloi from Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.  
Q - Maheep Mandloi: Hi, I am Maheep Mandloi from Crédit Suisse. Thanks for speeding me in Most of my questions have been answered, but just maybe if you can touch upon operating expense. It seems more or less flattish in Q4. But how should we think about that going forward in 2020, especially as you increase your focus in European markets and expand the Ensemble attachment rates?  
A - Badri Kothandaraman: Yes. I mean our OpEx, if you look at today, what we reported in Q3 is about 14% of sales, overall OpEx. And our OpEx at the midpoint of guidance for Q4, I think, is around 12.4% or something like that. But OpEx is definitely under control, and we plan to keep it in this range. And of course, if we need to keep it in this range, we are – our expectation is that we will continue to grow with the vectors of Ensemble, like what I said. So yes, yes, that’s it on OpEx, right.  
Q - Maheep Mandloi: Got it. And probably one last question for me, you earlier spoke about ensemble being able to connect with even generators. Is that something which you could look forward to kind of collaborating with any generators out there or have they reached out to you for that?  
A - Raghu Belur: So yes, this is Raghu. We really think about it in a much broader context than any specific type of duration resource, right? If you think about – we look at solar. We look at storage. We – if you think about generation resources like fuel cell, fossil fuel, DG, etcetera, and even load for that matter, right, because loads are also controllable. So it’s a very comprehensive, what I call, the master platform that can bring all of these resources together and manage them in a very seamless manner. So we are not – of course, we want to be clean and green. And so our focus on solar and storage is extremely vital. We also manage the grid, as you know. So we have a complete solution, bottom line. And so if there’s a particular resource that wants to come on to the platform beyond Ensemble, obviously, we will do that and we will manage it in a very effective manner in order to ensure that we have – that home is always on because at the end of the day, that is the most important function that we are providing for the homeowner.  
A - Eric Branderiz: Maheep, I want to make a clarification on OpEx, the fact that Badri mentioned that the midpoint is about 12.4% that we are guiding for Q4, that doesn’t mean that will be a new baseline of OpEx for 2020, right? That’s a guiding element of a particular dynamics in Q4. Think about the investments on R&D that we need to continue making. Think about the growth that we continue to experience in Europe and Asia Pacific. So we still have our 30-20-10. Obviously, that is here, much better outcomes than the original target setting on the financial model, and we’re going to revisit that one as part of the Analyst Day, right? But I just want to make sure we don’t model thinking that, that is the benchmark, the new benchmark for OpEx, right?  
Q - Maheep Mandloi: Got it. And thanks for the color. Look forward to more details on Analyst Day. Thanks for taking my questions.  
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Pavel Molchanov. Our next question is from Brad Meikle from Williams Trading. Your line is now open.  
Q - Brad Meikle: I had a quick follow-up. So I think that the three publicly traded installers, they are the only ones really safe harboring this year. And 2 of them are clients, and the largest one historically hasn’t been. So are you telling us that the third one has become a client of Enphase?  
A - Badri Kothandaraman: Brad, I’m not going to talk about it.  
Q - Brad Meikle: Okay. Well, I guess that some may read through to the way you’re reporting the Safe Harbor that the non-Safe Harbor was flat in Q4. Is it your feeling that the business is still growing or was this a peak revenue quarter for you guys?  
A - Badri Kothandaraman: I mean what should have been clear from the way I answered is we are very excited about Ensemble. We are very excited about storage. Storage has got a massive potential for us. It takes us from $2,000 a home to $10,000 a home. The attach rate of storage is only going to increase. And the California blackouts, is going to accelerate the adoption of storage. So – and we are going to be coming out with the product in Q1 of ‘20. So we are very excited there, and we are very excited about our growth. We’re going to follow up storage immediately with the IQ8PV. The IQ8PV is going to be – you’re going to have IQ 8 on the roof, which will produce power when the grid is down, when the sun is still shining. So that’s a massively differentiated product. So yes, storage is the next leg. The IQ8PV is another leg. So we really have a lot of legs for growth.  
A - Eric Branderiz: If you think about Q4, we monitor the point-of-sale data out of distribution, the channel very well, right? And all the numbers that we’ve seen is that we are growing, right? And the POS data activity is higher, right? So that’s a key point. I mean 1 quarter doesn’t make a trend, right? And safe harbor created a lot of interesting dynamics into the quarter as well, right? So I just want to point out that this observation about taking the midpoint, carving out a number and trying to look at the trends in the prior quarter, it may not be as logical as you may probably ultimately think it is, right?  
Q - Brad Meikle: Thanks Eric. How do you think about gross margins, Eric? So if you’re – if most of your non SunPower U.S. business in Q1 is out of Mexico, you basically have a 35% reduction in your cost of goods sold on that product and how would that – I guess you pass some of that through to customers at some point. But it sounds like margins are going higher, and you’re already above your previously?  
A - Eric Branderiz: Yes. So Badri mentioned how we think about margins very well in the script, right? So you can read the early part of the prepared remarks. We don’t see these checkpoints or midpoint numbers as anything more than a new potential target that can be better as we execute on all the other elements that Badri mentioned of cost reduction, the way we are managing pricing, the way we are introducing new value differentiated products, right? In terms of the tariff, 35%, remember, it’s 25, right? So definitely, that is basically closely tied to our ability to have adequate supply to fulfill the domestic non-SunPower demand, right? So we are always cautious on how we see that. But we don’t see that as a ceiling in any way, right? We look at margins. So we have accretion into the future as long as we can execute and as long as the dynamics of the margin, competitive pricing, our ability to secure, all of those things materialize.  
Q - Brad Meikle: Thank you.  
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Pavel Molchanov from Raymond James. Your line is now open.  
Q - Pavel Molchanov: Thanks for taking my question. Two quick ones, if I may, about the competitive landscape. You touched already on some of the products launched at SPI. Can you comment specifically on LG’s announcement of a module product incorporating its own microinverters and whether you guys are still selling your micros to LG directly?  
A - Badri Kothandaraman: Pavel, we won’t comment about any specific competitor like that. And we just want to be very clear about how we think about a very broad differentiation when it comes to our technology core Ensemble. That’s what we are focused on. For us, it is the entire solution. You have to be a one-stop shop, one warranty. You have to have the most resilient solution that’s out in the marketplace you have to have a scalable solution and a very simple solution, plug-and-play solution as well. So we really think about it not as a single little widget or a single little device but the entire solution. So I think it’s just not – we’re just going in a different direction, bottom line. That’s the way to think about it.  
Q - Pavel Molchanov: Understood. And can you also touch on a bifacial tariff being revived as of last month? Does that have any impact, positive or negative, on your business, particularly vis-à-vis the AC module product?  
A - Badri Kothandaraman: Yes. So actually, in general, when power goes up, it’s beneficial for us because we get to leverage the same platform and develop products using the same – leverage the exact same problem to develop higher power products. And the higher the power, it’s a more differentiated product as well as you get a family of products that we can optimize pricing better. So in general, higher power is good. And of course, bifacial is one way to get the higher power. Now as far as the tariffs on bifacial are concerned, it’s been in. It’s been out. There’s been noise around that. We pay attention to it on a peripheral basis. But we are pretty excited about the IQ 7A product, which really targets those higher power modules, and more importantly, it leverages the base IQ 7 platform, which is completely software-defined.  
Q - Pavel Molchanov: Got it. Thank you very much guys.  
A - Badri Kothandaraman: Thank you.  
Operator: Our next question is from Jeffrey Campbell from Tuohy Brothers. Your line is now open.  
Q - Jeffrey Campbell: Hi, thanks for taking my follow-up. I just wanted to get a little clarity. The 25% Ensemble attach rate that you referenced for California, is this referencing a go-forward new home solar installations under the California all solar mandate or is it something else? And I am asking because we know that SunPower has a high penetration rate of new home solar prior to the mandate?  
A - Badri Kothandaraman: Right. First of all, let me actually correct it. This is not an Ensemble attach rate. We were referring to what the customers’ competitors basically referred to in their earnings call. So this is public information. So companies have said that they are seeing an attach rate of 25% to their existing installed base, and that is in 2019. So it’s got nothing to do with the new home mandate, et cetera. And that is going to influence it, but I do not know the answer there. However, the attach rate right now is what they have seen.  
Q - Jeffrey Campbell: Okay. So we could at least say that based on the third party, they’re seeing a 25% attach rate. The new solar is not as to that so there could be upside?  
A - Badri Kothandaraman: Sure.  
Q - Jeffrey Campbell: Right. Thank you. Appreciate it.  
Operator: Thank you. At this time, I’m showing no further questions. I would like to turn the call back over to Badri Kothandaraman for closing remarks.  
End of Q&A:  
Badri Kothandaraman: Alright. Thank you for joining us today and for your continued support of Enphase. We look forward to speaking with you again during our Analyst Day in December.  
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today’s conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

===== 2019 Q2  (2019-07-31 16:30:00) =====

Now I'd like to introduce Badri Kothandaraman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Enphase Energy. Badri?
Badrinarayanan Kothandaraman: Good afternoon, and thanks for joining us today to discuss our Second Quarter 2019 Financial Results. We had a pretty strong quarter. We reported revenue of $134.1 million, reflecting the strong demand from our customers across the board. While the demand continued to outstrip available supply in Q2, we were able to increase capacity to better support our customers. I will provide a supply update later in the call. Our non-GAAP gross margin in the second quarter was 34.1% and our non-GAAP operating income was $23.2 million. Our gross margin was negatively impacted by 330 basis points due to expedite fees related to component shortages. The expedite fees were in the form of air shipments made to service our customers.We continued to make a lot of progress in strengthening our balance sheet. We exited the second quarter with a cash balance of $206 million, which included net proceeds of approximately $115.5 million associated with the issuance of convertible senior notes due 2024 and the repurchase and exchange of certain convertible notes due 2023.We exited Q2 with approximately 34-17-17. This means 34% gross margin, 17% operating expense and 17% operating income, all approximate non-GAAP numbers -- percentage. The most obvious question is whether we are going to reset our target financial base model, given that we're doing a lot better than 30-20-10. It is certainly a possibility that we will consider a new model in the future, but we would like a few more quarters of solid execution under our belt. Eric will go into greater detail about our financial results later in the call.Let's now talk about ease of doing business, how customers perceive us. Our Net Promoter Score in Q2 was 53% in North America. However, our call wait times were a little bit higher than what we wanted. We're working towards getting our call wait time back to two minutes or less through additional staffing and enhanced self-service options.We are also pleased to announce that as of today, more than 5,000 homeowners have joined our Enphase Upgrade Program, a program for early adopters of our legacy microinverters. This program is yet another example of our commitment to quality and customer service. We are happy to report our NPS for this upgrade program as given by the homeowners was 65% in Q2 of '19.We are paying more attention to our mobile apps as part of improving our overall customer experience. For example, homeowners can download the Enlighten mobile app that provides them with the comprehensive view of energy generation from each panel, also called panel monitoring, the energy consumed and the operation of their Enphase AC battery system if they have one. In January, we launched a version of -- a new version of this app which resulted in an iOS app rating that was not very good, it was less than desirable. We immediately created an internal task force in January to address these issues, and we are now pleased to report our ratings is approximately 4.4 out of 5, reflecting a better customer experience.Now let's talk about tariffs. As previously stated, we shared the cost increases due to tariffs with our customers. We are working to mitigate the Section 301 tariffs by expanding our manufacturing with Flex in Mexico, in addition to increasing global capacity as well as improving delivery. We started shipping our IQ 7 microinverters from the Flex Mexico factory in late Q2. The shipments were a couple of months later than what we anticipated, primarily due to qualification delays. The best way to get the Mexico factory ramping was to copy exactly what worked in Flex China; it's called a copy exact process. This copy exact process was executed well for all but two process steps out of 230 process steps. We quickly recognized this through our outgoing reliability monitors and comprehensive audits. We have rapidly corrected the issues. We are now well underway; you saw the press release on July 1 that stated we have started shipping from Flextronics Mexico. We expect this production ramp to take another two to three quarters as we continue to streamline our operations in terms of headcount as well as years in the Mexico factory.Now let's go to the regions. Our U.S. and international mix for Q2 was 74% and 26%, respectively, compared to 78% and 22% in Q1.Our second quarter revenue in the U.S. was up 29% sequentially and up 107% year-on-year, due to strong demand across the board. Our U.S. revenue also included volume shipments of our IQ 7XS and IQ 7AS microinverters to SunPower as planned.In Europe, our second quarter revenue was up 71% sequentially and up 46% year-on-year. Europe ramped up in Q2 as our supply increases to the region helped to service increasing customer demand as well as replenish the channel inventory to normal levels. IQ 7 offers unique advantages to European solar markets, particularly in new build and small residential system due to its scalable architecture. The Netherlands and France remains very strong markets for us in Europe.In APAC, our second quarter revenue was up 29% sequentially and down 23% year-on-year. We are rebuilding our solar and storage teams in the region under our newly hired sales leader for Australia.In Latin America, our second quarter revenue was down 7% sequentially, but up 27% year-on-year. We continue to be bullish about the growth opportunities in Latin America with Ensemble.We are also working with some of our customers in North America on their ITC safe harbor demand. We do have a good view of the Q3 demand and are working to understand how Q4 '19 and Q1 '20 will look. It's obvious Q4 '19 will be the big quarter, with some demand -- safe harbor demand expected to spill over into Q1. Our strategy is to first address the intrinsic demand from all of our customers, followed by the safe harbor demand. Eric will provide our safe harbor revenue outlook for Q3 later in the call.Now let's discuss supply. Our supply has been limited by component shortages in the past quarters, primarily the high-voltage FETs. We have qualified multiple suppliers, signed key contracts and have been rapidly increasing our microinverter output quarter-on-quarter. We have now focused on ensuring we have sufficient manufacturing capacity to meet our customer demand. We are on track to ramp to a capacity of approximately 2 million microinverters and beyond in the fourth quarter of 2019.Next, I would like to say a few words about our long-term strategy. As you know, we are working on transforming Enphase from a solar microinverter systems company to a home energy management systems company. We are thinking about this transformation in terms of four gears or four components; they are energy generation, energy storage, energy consumption and services.The first gear, which is energy generation, is the core part of our business today. The latest product in this gear consists of our IQ 7 family of microinverters and the AC modules. Approximately 98% of our microinverter shipments in Q2, were from the IQ 7 family, up from 94% in Q1.As previously announced, we released our latest product in the IQ 7 family called IQ 7A, a high-power microinverter targeted for modules up to 450 watts AC. We are on track for the general availability of IQ 7A microinverters for 72 cell modules in North America later this year.We continued to create value with AC modules that reduce logistics cost, while speeding up installation time. The AC module ramp for SunPower is now largely completed as planned. And it's been business as usual going forward. We are also making steady progress with Panasonic, Solaria and a few partners in Europe. Enphase Energized ACMs from our module partners have been adopted by more than 500 installers in the U.S. as of this date.Let me come to our Off-grid product. We're nearing completion of delivering the final requirements to our partner for our pure off-grid IQ 8 microinverter solution and expect increased shipment in Q3. We shipped approximately 1,000 microinverter to our partner in Q2 and have a few more requirements under the joint development agreement to meet before we receive the final $675,000 milestone payment.Let's now discuss our second gear, which is energy storage. We expect storage to play a major role in our near-term revenue growth. We plan to release the Ensemble 1.0 solution in the fourth quarter of 2019, primarily focused on residential storage in North America. Storage is enabled by the Encharge battery, which is a modular 3.3-kilowatt hour solution. The 3.3-kilowatt hour modularity allows for ease of installation, flexibility and scalability, while helping to streamline our supply chain. The Encharge battery will offer capacities of 3.3 and 10-kilowatt hours.Our third gear, energy consumption, will provide customers the ability to measure, report and manage their consumption. We currently ship products that provide both measurement and reporting through our Combiner Box and Enlighten products at an aggregate level. We expect to release new products over time with advance hardware and software capabilities to manage consumption in a fine-grained manner, both at a breaker level as well as an appliance level. We will provide details of these products in the coming quarters.The fourth and final gear is services. The existing installed base of more than approximately 940,000 systems worldwide, represents many potential opportunities, including product upgrades for solar and storage, in addition to software services. We have learned a lot from our legacy product upgrade program. We plan to build on this learning and introduce Ensemble 1.0 storage upgrades to our homeowner installed base through our network of installers. There are also several service such as APIs, warranty extensions, system monitoring, and advanced Enlighten features which have the potential to generate new revenue streams. We will start talking about more of these in the upcoming quarters.In summary, we are pleased with the overall progress in second quarter. In the short-term, we are laser focused on three objectives: ramping our supply chain to meet the increased customer demand, providing a superior customer experience through quality and ease of doing business and delivering Ensemble 1.0 later this year. With that, I will turn the call over to Eric for his review of our financial results. Eric?
Eric Branderiz: Thanks, Badri. I will provide more details related to our second quarter of 2019 financial results as well as our business outlook for the third quarter. As a reminder, the financial measures that I'm going to provide are on a non-GAAP basis unless otherwise noted. We have provided reconciliation of these non-GAAP to GAAP financial measures in our earnings release posted today, which can also be found in the Investor Relations section of our website.Total revenue for the second quarter of 2019 was $134.1 million, an increase of 34% sequentially and an increase of 77% year-over-year. We shipped approximately 416 megawatts DC in the second quarter of 2019, an increase in megawatts of 36% sequentially and an increase of 105% from the year-ago quarter. The megawatts shipped represent 1.283 million microinverters, approximately 98% of which was IQ 7. Both IQ 6 and IQ 7 represented almost 100% of the Q2 microinverter shipments.Non-GAAP gross margin for the second quarter of 2019 was 34.1% compared to 33.5% for the first quarter. Component shortages continue to negatively impact our Q2 non-GAAP gross margin by approximately 330 basis points.Non-GAAP operating expenses were $22.5 million for the second quarter of 2019, compared to $22.3 million in Q1 and $19 million in the second quarter of 2018. GAAP operating expenses were $27.9 million for the second quarter of 2019, compared to $26.2 million in Q1 and $23.3 million in the second quarter of 2018. GAAP operating expenses for the second quarter included $4.2 million of stock-based compensation expenses, $546,000 of amortization expenses for acquired intangible assets and $631,000 of restructuring expense.On a non-GAAP basis, income from operation was $23.2 million in the second quarter of 2019, compared to $11.3 million in Q1 and $4.1 million in the year-ago quarter. This increasing operating income is reflective of our continued improvement in operational excellence and product leadership.On a GAAP basis, income from operations was $17.4 million in the second quarter of 2019.On a non-GAAP basis, net income for the second quarter of 2019 was $23.2 million, compared to $9.5 million in Q1 and $1.6 million in the year-ago quarter. This resulted in basic earnings per share of $0.20 and diluted earnings per share of $0.18 in the second quarter of 2019, compared to basic earnings per share of $0.09 and diluted earnings per share of $0.08 in the first quarter of 2019.GAAP net income for the second quarter of 2019 was $10.6 million, compared to $2.8 million in Q1 and a loss of $3.7 million in the second quarter of 2018. This resulted in basic earnings per share of $0.09 and diluted earnings per share of $0.08 in the second quarter of 2019, compared to basic earnings per share of $0.03 and diluted earnings per share of $0.02 in the first quarter of 2019. We are happy to report that this was the third quarter in the company's history that we achieved GAAP net profitability.Now turning to the balance sheet. Inventory was $20.1 million in the second quarter of 2019 compared to $13 million in Q1 and $17.5 million in the year-ago quarter.We ended at 21 days of inventory on hand as of June 30, 2019, significantly below our internal target of 30 days, up from 18 days in the first quarter and down from 30 days in the year-ago quarter. The increase in days of inventory on hand as of June 30, 2019, was intended to improve shipment linearity to our customers and better serve increasing global demand. Inventory management continues to remain one of our key cash management initiatives.We exited the second quarter of 2019 with a total cash balance of $206 million, compared to $78.1 million in Q1. As Badri mentioned, the second quarter cash balance included net proceeds of approximately $115.5 million on June 5, 2019, associated with the issuance of $132 million aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes due 2024 and the repurchase of $60 million aggregate principal amount of convertible notes due 2023 in exchange for shares of Enphase common stock and separate cash payments. This convertible note transaction enhanced our balance sheet and will help enable our growth.We generated $14.8 million in cash flow from operations and $12.3 million in adjusted free cash flow in the second quarter of 2019.Now let's discuss our outlook for the third quarter of 2019. We expect our revenue for the third quarter of 2019 to be within a range of $170 million to $180 million, included a range of $6 million to $10 million for ITC safe harbor. Turning to margins, we expect GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins to be within a range of 33% to 36%. Note that our Q3 gross margin guidance include a negative impact of approximately 200 to 300 basis points due to expedite fees to meet customer demand. We expect our GAAP operating expenses to be within a range of $28.5 million to $30.5 million, including a total of approximately $5 million estimated for stock-based compensation expenses, and acquisition-related expenses and amortization. We expect non-GAAP operating expenses to be within a range of $23.5 million to $25.5 million. You should note that the midpoint of this guidance represents 34.5-14-20.5, which is 34.5% gross margin, 14% operating expense and 20.5% operating income, all non-GAAP numbers. With that, I will now open the line for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. And our first question comes from Colin Rusch with Oppenheimer.
Colin Rusch: Can you talk a little bit about the preparedness of the supply chain to support the elevated levels of revenue that you're seeing? Certainly, I think a lot of us are trying to figure out what the real ceiling is here.
Badrinarayanan Kothandaraman: Yes. We have been talking about component shortages in the last few quarters. And what we have done as we have qualified multiple suppliers, especially for the high-voltage FETs, we have signed a bunch of contracts. And we have been increasing our microinverter output quarter-on-quarter. If you notice, Q1 was approximately 980,000 microinverters, Q2 is about 1.28 million microinverters. And we expect roughly -- if you look at the midpoint of guidance, we expect around 1.7 to 1.8 million microinverters in Q3. And we are really comfortable with that. And also we are on track to do couple of million microinverters in terms of supply, we will be ready for couple of million microinverters in Q4. So basically, in terms of high-voltage transistors, I think we expect to be largely in good shape as we exit 2019.
Colin Rusch: Okay. And then just in terms of pricing power with your customers. How much do you have right now? Is it a situation where you guys could actually raise prices here or in the last couple of quarters and sustain that into 2020? Or are you just trying to move as much volume as you can right now?
Badrinarayanan Kothandaraman: Well, I mean, we have already increased pricing on customers because of the tariffs. The customers are actually absorbing the pricing today. And in general, other than that the pricing environment is largely stable.
Operator: And our next question comes from Eric Stine with Craig-Hallum.
Eric Stine: Maybe I'd just like to talk about SunPower a little bit. You said that you will be fully transitioned there and ramped there. Maybe just -- maybe if you can quantify what your expectation is for the 3Q contribution. And just looking at your Q2 number, I mean it does seem like that's trending well ahead of what your initial expectation was. So maybe just talk about how that's playing into the guidance and certainly as a big part of the rest of your overall business?
Badrinarayanan Kothandaraman: We did the SunPower transaction last year. We announced the transaction in June, we closed the acquisition in August of 2018. We said we would, by and large, be done by the second quarter of 2019. And that is the case. We are done with the SunPower acquisition, meaning we are done with the ramp. Basically, we also said we will do roughly about $60 million to $70 million of annualized run rate when the business ramps. So everything revenue we did in Q2 is completely consistent with that. So SunPower was largely on track, things are going well. If SunPower does well, we do well and that's all we can say right now.
Eric Stine: Yes, no, I got it. Okay, maybe I don't know if this is a number you've ever disclosed, but I'm just curious what percentage of your mix would be AC modules. And just obviously, that's a big component of the traction that you're getting. And wondering if that is something that's attracting other people, other potential partners for that in the market.
Badrinarayanan Kothandaraman: Yes. To tell you on the AC modules is not a hockey stick growth, it is steady -- slow and steady growth. And of course, the biggest customers there are SunPower and then, we have Panasonic started ramping couple of quarters ago. And Solaria is also ramping right now. And then, we are working with a couple of people -- couple of module customers in Europe to provide some differentiator AC module solutions. I would say, the pickup is kind of steady. And to date, about 400 or 500 installers have tried AC modules. It's not that they are going to switch to AC modules forever, but they have at least tried AC modules, and in our experience, once you try AC modules, usually you stick to that. Right now it's slow and steady.
Eric Stine: Okay, but it's fair to see we should see -- or it's very possible we see more partners for you in that area?
Badrinarayanan Kothandaraman: Yes. I mean we are always in the process of adding partners if and when it makes sense. And that will be the case going forward.
Eric Stine: Okay. Last one for me. Just on the component shortages you mentioned that you expect that to be pretty much taken care of by the end of the year, but I also know expedited shipping is -- can be just a part of the business. What would you expect a more normal number to be rather than the 300 basis points it was this quarter?
Badrinarayanan Kothandaraman: Yes. Normal [indiscernible] net as usual I would say expedite should be between 1 and 2, 1% and 2%, basically between 100 and 200 basis points. Component shortages, like what I said, we're largely out of the woods on high-voltage FETs, but think about it like this. The microinverter uses 300 components. So we are always constantly monitoring the supply chain on -- we are looking a few quarters ahead and making sure that we are completely out of the woods in general.
Operator: And our next question comes from Philip Shen with Roth Capital Partners.
Philip Shen: Congrats on the results, nice quarter. Wanted to ask about your units here, you talked about the 1.7 to 1.8 in Q3. And obviously $2 million in Q4 units. Is it possible to -- that Mexico could come in better-than-expected as we get into 2020? Is there potential for that facility to be able to ship closer to 2.5 million or maybe even 3 million units?
Badrinarayanan Kothandaraman: Yes, look, I mean we are only going to talk about right now our numbers for Q4 '19, but as a management team, what we do, we look at the next 6 quarters and we look at it on a monthly basis and then we are going to constantly look at our capacity. So the capacity is now a monthly process versus a one-time event. So of course, we gave you specific numbers for Q4 '19, but that doesn't mean we are not going to increase that number. So that number will continuously increase as far as demand also accumulates at the same level. And we are in a great position to do so because we have the [indiscernible] factory, Flextronics has done an amazing job there. And also, we have a capital light approach. All we need to do is to add the textures. So the capital investment is quite light. Of course, there is a lead time for it that's usually a quarter. So as long as we have reasonable notification, which we have with a six quarter forecasting methodology, there is no reason why we won't have -- why we cannot ramp up.
Philip Shen: Great. And then to what degree are you considering alternative geographies for capacity as well. So beyond China and Mexico. Is there anything there that you guys might be able to share?
Badrinarayanan Kothandaraman: Yes. We are not going to share in detail, but I'll tell you one thing that we have always talked about multi-sourcing. In all aspects of our business. And that is truly everywhere. So you can count on us to deploy the strategy wherever it makes sense in -- I'll leave it at that.
Philip Shen: Fantastic. As it relates to safe harbor, Eric, I know you guys talked about $6 million to $10 million in Q3. We've heard in our checks that there are some meaningful safe harbor deals brewing. So $6 million to $10 million seems a little bit modest, but it is earlier in the year. As you ramp up to Q4, what percentage of your shipments in Q4 could actually be safe harbor?
Badrinarayanan Kothandaraman: We are not going to be talking about Q4 at this point right now, we have great visibility, but good visibility of Q3. We don't yet know about Q4, we'll talk about it when we're ready in the next earnings call.
Philip Shen: Great, Badri. And this is a very quick set of housekeeping questions. Can you share what the impact of the tariff was on the margin in terms of basis points or maybe even dollars? And then, in terms of megawatts, any chance you guys could share how many megawatts was actually shipped in the U.S. or delivered in the U.S. in Q2? And if you think you guys are actually taking share from your peer at this point?
Badrinarayanan Kothandaraman: Well, I'll have Eric comment on the basis points if he's ready, but in terms of the megawatts, we said the rough split up in geographies we said 70 -- remember we said 74% in the U.S. and 26% outside the U.S. So you should think about the overall megawatts from that ratio.
Philip Shen: Great, Badri. Eric, any thoughts on the tariffs impact on the margin?
Eric Branderiz: Well, Phil we will not break it out, but you know the tariff percentage, as you know, we actually increased prices to cover 100% or a portion of it, I guess, of the cost, right. So we are sharing that cost with our customers, right. And so with that being said, we shouldn't be concerned about the breakout. It's all covered about -- through the price increase.
Operator: Our next question comes from Brad Meikle with Williams Research.
Bradford Meikle: Wow, great revenue growth...
Badrinarayanan Kothandaraman: Brad?
Bradford Meikle: You are growing a lot faster than the market. And then also last call you said you were sold out in Q2 at the time of the call. Are you sold out in Q3?
Badrinarayanan Kothandaraman: Yes, we are fully booked for Q3. Yes, at this point in time.
Bradford Meikle: And how do you make sense of the amount of -- obviously, there was a discount to the amount of business you were doing because of the bankability issue and there's a lot of catch-up. How do you interpret the amount of obvious market share that you're taking now?
Badrinarayanan Kothandaraman: Yes, it's basically comes back to the four things that always talk about. One is the bankability that you said and our balance sheet is pretty strong. And you guys know a lot about it. Our cash balance today is $206 million. Second is our product quality. Our target is to be at an annual DPPM of 500. We are not there today, but we are well on our way there. That's two. Number three is customer experience. Although we did go a little bit higher on rate times, we are really committed as the management team. In fact, in every executive staff meeting Tuesday, the first thing I review is the customer service calls, the sample of them to understand what kind of problems customers are having. So we are laser focused as management team on customer service. And the last one is innovation. I believe customers want to stick with us because of products like Ensemble.Of course, we haven't executed well on Ensemble. It's been delayed a little bit, so that's why we didn't talk about it much. But we're laser focused on getting Ensemble 1.0, which is the residential -- with the focus on residential storage, we are laser focus on getting the product out in the fourth quarter of 2019. So we are heads down there. So these are the four things. And I think I would like to think these are the ones that cause the customers to come back and the demand overall comes from long tail customers, those are the broad base of customers, they in particular, the long tail of customers really is suited -- is the right -- are the right customers base for us because of the focus on quality and customer experience; they just don't have the time to deal with quality issues, or they don't have the time to keep calling us again. So it's really that's the place where we service well. So Brad, these are the factors. And I'm not sure that I answered you enough.
Bradford Meikle: Just one other question would be, can you talk about the Mexico ramp? I think on July 1; you have a press release saying that the volumes were finally ramping out of Mexico. And you said in the past that Q1 of next year would be 100% Mexico. So should we just assume it's a linear ramp to that January level?
Badrinarayanan Kothandaraman: Yes, let me tell you a few things in the Mexico ramp. Basically, we are a couple of months behind what I expected. And it's really for us transferring the process steps using copy exact methodology. Basically it didn't go great. Two of the 230 process steps had issues. We quickly got on it, and the nice thing is we were able to get all of the signals in line in terms of reliability, monitors as well as we were able to do audit. So of course, that total is a little bit behind, that's why we started shipping only on July 1. And having said that, in this quarter, we will probably -- my team is looking at me, but we will probably do somewhere around a couple of hundred thousand units in Q3 of '19. And in two or three quarters from now, we expect the years to stabilize. We expect to have enough manpower to running all ships, but we are really laser focus on quality. We would like to ramp at the right levels, have a controlled ramp. So I'm looking for the next 90 days. Can we execute and do 200,000 units in Q3? That's what I'm looking at.
Bradford Meikle: Just last small one was, can you tell us the total megawatts shipped in the U.S. in Q2?
Eric Branderiz: Well, we already disclosed the megawatts for the quarter being 416 megawatts DC, so we talked about 74% being domestic. So you can probably do the math.
Badrinarayanan Kothandaraman: Yes, 74% of 416, that is roughly 312, around that.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jeff Osborne with Cowen & Company.
Jeffrey Osborne: Congratulations from me on the strong results. A couple questions of mine. I was wondering if you could just flesh out the share gains. Are you seeing any noticeable trends, Badri, on sort of the larger Top 5 installers in North America? Or is it more the longer tail of folks buying through distribution. Any noticeable commentary you have there would be helpful.
Badrinarayanan Kothandaraman: Yes. We are not going to give out any market share numbers because we don't look at the business like that. Basically, we are laser focused on customer experience, we are laser focused on our quality. And at the end of the day, profitable top line growth is what we are looking at. Having said that, we have 100% of the SunPower business. The North American demand is ramping quite nicely across the board and our long tail of customers is probably the place where we basically are gaining some share. And Europe is also, if you see the Europe numbers are also not too shabby either. The places that we are doing well are actually Netherlands and France. And I was just in Europe to do a bunch of review meetings there and it does turn out that Netherlands is the fastest growing country in Europe. So I think we are in the right places there. And these basically contribute to overall share.
Jeffrey Osborne: That's helpful and while you're meandering around the world, any commentary you have on the new leadership in Australia or Asia-Pacific more broadly?
Badrinarayanan Kothandaraman: We put the new leadership in place a couple of quarters ago. I'm going to be in Australia pretty soon. We are going to do a similar kind of exercise that what we did in Europe, but I think Australia, we need to rebuild our organization first. I think the Australian market is a very interesting market, both in terms of solar plus storage and it is not a small market. And so we are going to work on it.
Jeffrey Osborne: Makes sense. I had two other quick ones here. One, could you just give any sense of indication -- you mentioned fully booked for Q3. And demand constraint or supply constraint, sorry, for Q2. Any sense of what that excess demand was in 2Q, that you couldn't meet or did that just slip into Q3? I'm just trying to get a sense of are people walking away from you because your lead times are too long?
Badrinarayanan Kothandaraman: We are not going to break out the specific numbers, but we have had this situation of the last three quarters, people have not walked away, and as I mentioned, we are fully booked for Q3. And we still have a lot more days left in Q3.
Jeffrey Osborne: Makes sense. And then just the last one I had is just around the fourth pillar of your strategy around services and I'm an Enphase customer myself. I just received an e-mail today asking me to enroll in your program, but can you just talk about your attempt at services in getting the consumer engaged. And how do you bridge the border of stepping on the toes of the installer versus going straight to the customer in bringing them awareness of Ensemble and getting them on the 5,000 person waiting list to upgrade. If I click on that link in my own e-mail that I received today, does my installer receive an indication that I'm interested in doing that? Or can you just walk us through how that works? How you monetize that?
Badrinarayanan Kothandaraman: First of all, I'm going to say this is pretty nascent. And we are basically starting to scratch the surface. And I think you should -- if you are thinking that we are going around the installers, you should scratch that. We can never, ever go around the installers. The installers are a conduit for us. And basically, it is like what can we do in order to better service the customers. Here we are talking about the legacy product upgrade program. These customers bought the first two generations of Enphase products from us, now it's obviously been time. We would like to give them the option of purchasing an IQ 7 system and maybe also purchasing an Encharge system when it is available. So therefore, in a sense we basically generate the demand. And we essentially pass on the demand to our installers -- our network of installers who basically service it for us. So it is a win-win situation for both of us and not excluding the installers. So that's just scratching the surface. Of course there's a lot more things that we can start doing, understanding the consumption, providing homeowners a bunch of tools to enable that and we'll start talking a lot more about those down the line.
Operator: Our next question comes from Maheep Mandloi from Crédit Suisse.
Maheep Mandloi: Congratulations on the quarter. Just trying to dig more on the market share and thanks for the comments earlier, but can you just talk about how much of the growth in Q2 or even Q3 is driven by gaining market share versus overall growth, just trying to understand like your thoughts on the North American market business?
Badrinarayanan Kothandaraman: It's the same answer that I gave Jeff. We are not going to give out any numbers in market share, but the reasons why we are gaining market share, I believe, is basically along the lines of our core competence is essentially the focus on providing the highest quality, the highest customer experience and basically, products like Ensemble showed innovation in our product innovation capability. We think customers would like to stick to somebody who has an innovation road map like Ensemble. So those are the broad strokes and, of course, the healthy balance sheet always helps.
Maheep Mandloi: Got it. Second, you said you're fully booked in Q3, but how does the bookings look beyond Q3 or how should we think about that. And as part of that question, like, how do you think of the international mix in 2020 or kind of like a long-term target. Can you give an update on that?
Badrinarayanan Kothandaraman: Yes, we're not going to be breaking out numbers on Q4 bookings, it's just too early right now, it's not -- we are not going to give guidance. In terms of international mix, obviously with the SunPower acquisition, international mix is skewed a little bit towards North America. Right now we are approximately 75-25 and in the past has given numbers if possible, 50-50 would be nice. 50 North America and 50 rest of the world would be nice in a couple of years. And ultimately, something that is balance between APAC, Europe and North America would be actually perfect, but that's a little bit beyond doubt -- beyond that.
Maheep Mandloi: And just last question on Ensemble, could you just talk about like delay we now expect in Q4. And would we see some initial presentations to dealers, so could you just talk about like their initial feedback from dealers and U.S. rather markets?
Badrinarayanan Kothandaraman: Yes, Ensemble 1.0 is expected to basically release in Q4 of '19 and particularly we entered toward residential storage. And we haven't started any alpha or beta demonstration yet. In the next three months, we expect to obviously start doing those two with a few installers. But right now, we are laser focused on the development, we are heads down. It's all about execution.
Operator: Our next question comes from Amit Dayal with H.C. Wainwright.
Amit Dayal: Most of my questions have been asked. Just looking at IQ 8, is this more of a 2020 driver now largely?
Badrinarayanan Kothandaraman: No, it's not. If you see our Ensemble 1.0, we are talking about high-capacity residential storage for North America. If you see the Encharge, the Encharge battery system, it has got battery cells, it has got battery management system, software, the controller, battery controllers plus. Every 3.3 kilowatt hour system has got four IQ 8s. That IQ 8 is nothing but our grid forming microinverter. That's how we put together a battery system. So IQ 8 will be inside our battery. And that will be the first product that we will be releasing, that's what we call Ensemble 1.0. That will work with IQ 6 and IQ 7 installed base on the PV side. That's what we're going to release in the fourth quarter of 2019. And of course, Ensemble 2.0 is what we are talking about IQ 8 PV, which is IQ 8 on the roof, the IQ 8 solar system, that could be available in 2020.
Amit Dayal: Okay, understood. So as we move into more of a home energy management solutions company, how should we think about -- and this is more longer term obviously, but the shift in margins. How much of these services could be SaaS-type offerings? Or are they still going to be one-time sale. Can you provide any color on -- think about this?
Badrinarayanan Kothandaraman: Good question. These are more -- I think we will have a detailed discussion of these in the Analyst Day. The way we are thinking about it is storage alone -- like what I've said multiple times, the revenue potential for storage will take us from $2,000 per home, which is a pure microinverter play to over $10,000 per home. And then, consumption and services obviously add on a little bit more there. So basically, it will help us on the revenue side and on the gross margin side, no matter what business we take, we already established a floor. We are never going to take a business that is not 30% gross margin. And so our gross margin targets this quarter in terms of guidance or the midpoint of gross margin would be 34.5. Gross margin would be around that number.
Amit Dayal: Understood. And on the OpEx site, from just your ramping on the revenues on the OpEx. Are we at a stable level of these current levels? Or do we expect some ramp obviously from a marketing point of view, it may be some increases, but generally should we expect leverage to now really start kicking in?
Eric Branderiz: Yes. So you remember that we -- this is Eric. I don't know if you remember we had the big realignment of resources around the world, where we did double structure activity moving a functional [indiscernible], we created a new headquarter in Fremont establishing a center of excellence in India, plus additional R&D resources in New Zealand, right? Four of those are part of the bigger strategy on how we are going to be able to scale and we are going to have operating leverage, right? So from a expand point of view, operating leverage at the corporate level on G&A is probably already somewhat reflective of the guidance, right? So if you look at the guidance, we are at 14% OpEx as a revenue, right? Now in terms of sales and marketing and R&D, remember we are an innovation company, right? So our focus on investing on new products and product development and digital platform work and all that kind of stuff that Badri mentioned as part of our strategy and we'll have that probably in R&D part of that kind of [indiscernible] OpEx as well the same results of marketing growing regionally. Yes, we developed Europe, I think Badri mentioned Asia-Pacific We may need boots on the ground, a sales force there. We are going to roll out formation as well, right, in those depreciation associated with those technologies or licenses will also hit OpEx, right, in many cases. So I think that we have a healthy operating leverage, already will trigger on the guidance. You should also think about how those R&D investments will materialize over time, right.
Operator: Our next question comes from Pavel Molchanov from Raymond James.
Pavel Molchanov: On power storage. So sounds like Q4 is when you expect that to become, kind of, financially needle moving in the sales mix for the first time. Is that fair to say?
Badrinarayanan Kothandaraman: No, Q4 '19 will not be needle moving. Q4 '19 will be the introduction and then obviously, there will be a ramp. And I would say needle moving will be in 2020.
Pavel Molchanov: Okay. And when you talk about margin structure, 30% your long-term target, you're obviously a little above that now. Before the introduction of the storage product, is storage, all else being equal, likely to move that up or down, given the different competitive dynamics in the battery market as compared to microinverters?
Badrinarayanan Kothandaraman: Storage will always be at our corporate gross margin. And the reason I say that is, of course, if you -- this is not a commodity product, right? This is where we are going to differentiate Ensemble from the rest of the fact is the unique features that we are going to be offering. The flexibility, the scalability, the modularity and then, eventually, the Ensemble will work with our IQ 8 on the road. In addition, that is a bunch of software that we can introduce in order to enhance the customer experience. So you should not think about it as what you're thinking just on the battery cell site. It will fall in line with our corporate gross margin.
Operator: Our next question comes from a follow-up from Bradford Meikle with Williams Research.
Bradford Meikle: I have a quick follow-up. How much do you think the market share gains is driven by the lower failure rates in our surveys of installers, we increasingly been hearing of high 5%, 10% failure rates at SolarEdge. And I'm not sure what yours are exactly, but I think they are probably 90% less than that. How much do you think that's a driver of the unit growth?
Badrinarayanan Kothandaraman: That we are not going to comment on that.
Bradford Meikle: Okay. Well, in Storage, just to get a sense for how quickly it could grow. I know you're in touch with a lot of your existing installed base. Have you asked that installed base what their interest is in storage or do you know what percentage roughly might have said that they would be interested?
Badrinarayanan Kothandaraman: Yes, of course, these are surveys that are not comprehensive, but usually, people get excited when you ask them such questions and then they change their mind when it comes time to cut the check. So we'll see, we are very close to launching this product. So we are heads down launching this product right now. We will look at both new installers as well as the -- our existing [indiscernible], but we are obviously excited.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. And I'm showing no further questions at this time. I'd like to turn the call back to Badri Kothandaraman for any closing remarks.
Badrinarayanan Kothandaraman: Thank you for joining us today and for your continued support of Enphase. We look forward to speaking with you again on our call next quarter. Bye.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This concludes today's program. You may all disconnect, everyone, have a great day.

===== 2019 Q1  (2019-04-30 16:30:00) =====
Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Enphase Energy First Quarter 2019 Financial Results Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions] And as a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference Ms. Christina Carrabino. You may begin, ma'am.
Christina Carrabino: Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us on today's conference call to discuss Enphase Energy's First Quarter of 2019 Results. On today's call are Badri Kothandaraman, Enphase's President and Chief Executive Officer; Eric Branderiz, Chief Financial Officer; and Raghu Belur, Chief Products Officer. After the market closed today, Enphase issued a press release announcing the results for its fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2018. During this conference call, Enphase management will make forward-looking statements, including but not limited to, statements related to Enphase Energy's technology, products and financial performance, operations including supplier lead times and current and future market and customer demands and trends. These forward-looking statements involve significant risks and uncertainties, and Enphase Energy's actual results and the timing of events could differ materially from these expectations. For a more complete discussion of the risks and uncertainties, please see the Company's annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018, which is on file with the SEC, and the quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, which will be filed with the SEC in the second quarter of 2019. Enphase Energy cautions you not to place any undue reliance on forward-looking statements, and undertakes no duty or obligation to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future events, or changes in its expectations. Also, please note that financial measures used on this call are expressed on a non-GAAP basis unless otherwise noted, and have been adjusted to exclude certain charges. The company has provided a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures in its earnings release posted today, which can also be found in the Investor Relations section of its website. Now, I'd like to introduce Badri Kothandaraman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Enphase Energy. Badri?
Badri Kothandaraman: Good afternoon and thanks for joining us today to discuss our First Quarter of 2019 Financial Results. We had another solid quarter, we reported revenue of $100.2 million. The demand from all of our customers was strong across the boat. The biggest challenge in meeting the demand was component shortages. We are fully-booked for Q2 2019 just as we were for Q1 2019. I will provide an update later in this call on our plans to mitigate component charges. Our non-GAAP gross margin in the first quarter was 33.5% and the non-GAAP operating income was $11.3 million. Our non-GAAP gross margin was negatively impacted by 280 basis points due to expedite fees related to component shortages. The expedite fees were in the form of air shipments that we chose to make in order to service our customers better. We exited the first quarter with a cash balance of $78.1 million after repaying our high interest bearing senior secure term loan of approximately $39.5 million, plus accrued interest and fees. In addition, we reported $16.4 million of adjusted free cash flow in Q1. An important area of focus for us that we have discussed since the second half of 2018 is the ease of doing business- how our customers perceive us. Quality and customer service together constitute customer experience and are the cornerstones of our strategy. During Q1, we've made several improvements in our customer call center metrics and online support. For example, our first call resolution metric has improved from approximately by 15% over the past year, while our Service-on-the-Go support tool has enabled over 50% of our customer claims to be handled through self-service via their mobile devices. We recently announced that over 2,500 homeowners have now joined our Enphase Upgrade Program -- a program for early adapters of our legacy microinverters. This program represents a commitment to quality and service and we appreciate the solar installers who do so much to support the program. The key metric we used to measure customer experience is the net promoter score or NPS. This metric is calculated based on feedback from customer surveys on how likely customers or partners will recommend Enphase to a friend or colleague. Our NPS in North America was approximately 50% in Q1 compared to approximately 51% in the fourth quarter of 2018. Our target is to achieve a worldwide NPS of 60% or higher in the fourth quarter of 2019. Turning to tariffs. The 10% 301 tariffs became effective in September of 2018, impacting Enphase microinverters and accessories. As we have said before, we shared the cost increases with our customers. We are continuing to execute on our plans to mitigate the 301 tariff by expanding our manufacturing agreement with Flex in Mexico starting in Q2 of 2019. We are on track with our plan and expect to start shipping volume production from the Flex Mexico factory this quarter. Now, turning to our regions. Our U.S. and international mix for Q1 was 78% and 22% respectively. Customer demand was strong in all regions in the first quarter. However, all regions were also impacted by component supply shortages. As a result, we continued to allocate supply carefully to each region during the first quarter. Our first quarter revenue in the U.S. was up 9% sequentially and up 80% year-on-year. The IQ 7 product family has been well-received in the region and we are pleased to see our customer base expand during the first quarter. U.S. revenue also included shipments of our IQ 7XS microinverters to SunPower. In Europe, our revenue was down 11% sequentially, but up 2% year-on-year. Europe's growth in Q1 was impacted by component shortages, but we were able to meet customer demand with channel inventory. We expect the supply increases in Q2 2019 will help replenish the channel inventory in that region and service the increasing demand for the region . Europe continues to be a target region for expansion as IQ 7 has been very well-received and is particularly optimal for small systems. In APAC, our first quarter revenue was up 84% sequentially and down 54% year-on-year. We corrected the previously-discussed inventory challenges in the channel as reflected by the sequential growth and we continue to be optimistic about our growth opportunities in the region. In Latin America, our first quarter revenue was up 78% sequentially and 16% up year-on-year. We experienced steady growth in Mexico during the quarter. Both Mexico and Puerto Rico are important markets for Enphase. We're also working with the few of our customers in North America on their ITC Safe Harbor opportunities. While it's still early and we do not have accurate volume forecast yet, we expect to have more information on the next earnings call. Nevertheless, our strategy is to ensure we are prepared with the right capacity in place to support these opportunities. Now is the good time to talk about supply. As previously mentioned, in order to address the component shortages, we signed long term contracts for high voltage power transistors and expect additional supply, some of it starting as early as this quarter and most of it in the second half of this year. As a result, we expect to have a capacity of 2 million microinverters in the fourth quarter of 2019. This should also help us reduce our microinverter lead times closer to our internal target of approximately 6-8 weeks. Now, let's talk about our top line growth initiatives. We have four levers for profitable top line growth which we have talked about in the previous calls. The first one is IQ 7 regional expansion; the second one is high-power and high-performance products; the third one is AC modules and the fourth one is Ensemble Solar and Storage technology. The first lever for profitable top line growth is IQ 7 regional expansion. Approximately 94% of our microinverter shipments in Q1 were IQ 7, up from 84% in Q4, and our goal is to complete the transition of nearly all of our microinverters' shipments to IQ 7 by the end of Q3. The second lever for profitable top line growth is to release high power and high performance new products. As previously announced, we released our new product, the IQ 7A family of high power microinverters targeted for modules up to 450-watt DC. The IQ 7A is our highest power microinverter to date and is capable of producing as much as 366-watt AC of peak power at an average CEC efficiency of 97%. We shipped significant volumes of IQ 7AS to SunPower during the first quarter. They're expected to integrate the IQ 7AS into their 66-cell NGT A series AC modules. The general availability of IQ 7A microinverters for generic 72-cell modules in North America will follow in the second half of 2019. The pairing of high efficiency solar modules with IQ 7A microinverters is a powerful combination that creates tremendous value for homeowners, particularly those whose roofs are space constrained. The third lever for profitable top line growth is AC modules. We had fewer shipments of our IQ 7XS microinverters to SunPower in the first quarter compared to the fourth quarter. We worked with SunPower to ensure smooth product transition from their prior generation microinverters to IQ 7XS as they began ramping. As previously announced, we expect an acceleration of the ramp in the second quarter and throughout 2019. In addition, the N330E Panasonic AC modules integrated with our IQ 7XS microinverters became available in the March of 2019. These modules combine the efficiency of Panasonic's HIT solar panels with Enphase’s highly reliable IQ 7X microinverters. We are also making steady progress with our other module partners such as Solaria in ramping Enphase AC modules. Since their release in October of 2017, Enphase AC modules from our module partners have been adapted by about 439 installers in the U.S. as of this date. The most critical driver for our profitable top line growth is the Ensemble “always” on Solar and Storage technology. The Ensemble solution has four components: energy generation which is accompanied with the grid agnostic microinverter IQ 8; energy storage which is achieved by the Encharge battery with capacities of 3.3 kilowatt hour, 10 kilowatt hour and 13.2 kilowatt hour; communication and control which consists of the Automatic Transfer Switch and the combiner box with the Envoy gateway; and the fourth and final component is Enlighten, which is the IoT Cloud software. As discussed last quarter, we plan to introduce Ensemble in a phased manner. We expect to release the Ensemble 1.0 solution in the fourth quarter of 2019, exclusively focused on the residential energy storage in North America. Residential energy storage is enabled by the Encharge battery which is designed to be a modular 3.3 kilowatt hour solution. Encharge consists of LFP, which is lithium ion phosphate cells, the Enphase battery management system, communications, software and most importantly, our IQ 8 grid agnostic microinverter; all packaged together in a single enclosure. The 3.3 kilowatt hour modularity is a differentiating feature that allows for use of installations, flexibility and scalability while helping to streamline our supply chain as well. The Ensemble 1.0 solution is designed to be compatible with IQ 6 and IQ 7 PV systems, both for existing and new installs. And as our key part of the Ensemble 1.0 solution is the Automatic Transfer Switch called Enpower, which allows a home to be isolated from the grid in the event of a grid failure, enabling the grid agnostic function. We expect to release new generations of Enpower over time with enhanced software and hardware capabilities. Ensemble 2.0 is expected to follow 1.0 shortly after and will enable new IQ 8 PV installations. The next generation of Enpower which will be part of Ensemble 2.0 will have the software and hardware capability of managing consumption in a fine-grained manner. Our goal is to continue providing additional value to our partners and customers in every new Ensemble release. We will continue to update you on a quarterly basis. We are very close to delivering our final requirements on the pure off-grid IQ 8 microinverter solution to our partner and expect to ramp production in the second quarter. There has been a one quarter of delay here, mainly involving software changes to get the customer experience right. We now expect to receive the final milestone payment of approximately $675,000 from our partner in the second quarter. In summary, our top priority is to increase profitability quarter-on-quarter creating further shareholder value. In the near-term, our focus is to expand and optimize the supply chain to meet the additional demand, while providing a superior customer experience. In the longer-term, we are focused on product innovation to increase our revenue potential from approximately $2,000 per home to over $10,000 per home by leveraging Ensemble-based home energy management systems. With that, I will turn the call over to Eric for his review of our financial and the ducts. Eric.
Eric Branderiz: Thanks, Badri. I will provide more details related to our first quarter of 2019 financial results as well as our business outlook for the second quarter. As a reminder, the financial measures that I'm going to provide are on non-GAAP basis unless otherwise noted. We have provided reconciliations of these non-GAAP to GAAP financial measures in our earnings released posted today, which can also be found in the Investor Relations section of our website. Total revenue for the first quarter of 2019 was $100.2 million, an increase of 9% sequentially and an increase of 43% year-over-year. We shipped approximately 306 megawatts DC in the first quarter of 2019, an increase of megawatts of 19% sequentially and an increase of 71% from the year ago quarter. The megawatts shipped represented approximately 976,000 microinverters, approximately 94% of which was IQ 7. Both IQ 6 and IQ 7 represented 99% of Q1 microinverters shipments. I am pleased to report that since the inception, we have now shipped more than 20 million microinverters globally. Non-GAAP gross margin for the first quarter of 2019 was 33.5% compared to 30.7% for the fourth quarter. Even though we shared some of the expedite fees with our partners, component shortages continued to negatively impact our Q1 non-GAAP gross margin by approximately 280-basis points. Non-GAAP of operating expenses were $22.3 million for the first quarter of 2019 compared to $19.7 million in Q4 and $17.7 million in the first quarter of 2018. As I mentioned last quarter, 2018 was our first year of SOX auditor attestation and as a result, we incurred higher than expected expenses in internal audit plus additional consulting and advisory fees. These higher than normal expenses continued into Q1 2019. GAAP operating expenses were $26.2 million for the first quarter of 2019, compared to $23.2 million in Q4 and $20.8 million in the first quarter of 2018. The GAAP operating expenses for the first quarter included $3 million of stock-based compensation, $546,000 of amortization for acquired intangible assets and $368,000 of restructuring expense. On a non-GAAP basis, income from operations was $11.3 million in the first quarter of 2019 compared to $8.6 million in Q4 and $861,000 in the year ago quarter. This improvement in operating income is reflective of our continued improve operational excellence and continued product leadership. On a GAAP basis, income from operations was $7.1 million in the first quarter of 2019. On a non-GAAP basis, the net income for the first quarter of 2019 was $9.5 million compared to $5.1 million in Q4 and a loss of $1.3 million in the year ago quarter. This resulted in basic earnings per share of $0.09 and diluted earnings per share of $0.08 in the first quarter of 2019, compared to basic earnings per share of 0.05 and diluted earnings per share or $0.04 in the fourth quarter of 2018. GAAP net income for the first quarter of 2019 was $2.8 million compared to $709,000 in Q4 and a loss of $5.2 million in the first quarter of 2018. This resulted in basic earnings per share of $0.03 and the diluted earnings per share of $0.02 in the first quarter of 2019 compared to basic and diluted earnings per share of $0.01 in the fourth quarter of 2018. We are happy to report that this was the second quarter in the company's history that we achieved GAAP net profitability. Now turning to the balance sheet, inventory was $13 million in the first quarter of 2019 compared to $16.3 million in Q4 and $18.5 million in the year ago quarter. We ended at 18 days of inventory on hand as of March 31, 2019, significantly below our target of 30 days and down from 23 days in the fourth quarter and also down 32 days in the year ago quarter. Although most of the inventory reduction was due to high demand constrained by component shortages, inventory management continues to remain one of our key cash management initiatives. We exited the first quarter of 2019 with a total cash balance of $78.1 million compared with $106.2 million in Q4. As previously discussed, we paid in full hour high-interest bearing senior secured term loan with Tennenbaum Capital Partners. The repayment included a principal amount of approximately $39.5 million plus accrued interest and fees. We generated $17.1 million in cash flow from operations and $16.4 million in adjusted free cash flow for the first quarter of 2019. Now, let's discuss our outlook for the second quarter of 2018. We expect our revenue for the second quarter of 2019 it will be within a range of $115 to $125 million. Turning to margins, we expect GAAP and non-GAAP gross margin to be within a range of 32% to 35%. Note that our Q2 gross margin guidance includes a negative impact of approximately 250 to 350-basis points due to expedite fees, resulting from components shortages. We expect our GAAP operating expenses to be within a range of $25 million to $27 million, including a total of approximately $4 million estimated for stock-based compensation expenses, additional restructuring and acquisition related expenses and amortization. We expect non-GAAP operating expenses to be within a range of $21 to $23 million. With that, I will now open the line for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Philip Shen with ROTH Capital Partners. All right, we'll move onto the next question. Our next question comes from Colin Rusch of Oppenheimer.
Colin Rusch: Thanks so much guys. Can you talk a little bit about the operating leverage that you're seeing here? Are you expecting to hold your operating expenses flat here and see some additional leverage as you grow sales and revisit that 30-20-10 model or what can we expect going forward?
Eric Branderiz: So, the framework that we are using, which is the 30-20-10 framework that we lounge a year and a half ago, almost two years ago, remains in place of our baseline for operating in our business. Right? So, the operating leverage will be manifested overtime. You can see that in the Q2 guidance, on the midpoint, we basically are already achieving some of that by looking at the midpoint it's about 80% of the OpEx of our revenue drive. I'll say that we continue making investment on critical areas such as sales and marketing and the investments associated with R&D for future development of products and which is part of what we do, which you see in leverage.
Colin Rusch: Okay. And then just on the battery a product, can you talk a little bit about your expectations around pricing? How much that's moving around, how much visibility you have into that at this point? And then as well as the movement on LFP supply, we're certainly seeing some interesting movements in terms of cost structure there. And what are you expecting in terms of costs for acquiring those sales as you go forward and move into a little bit higher volume?
Badri Kothandaraman: Colin, it's a little bit early, but I'll share some of our current Nordic stats. In general, if I take a look at the market pricing, the market pricing, not our pricing, market pricing for a battery system is usually ranging from $600 per kilowatt hour for the big guys, the tier 1 guys to anywhere more than $1,000 per kilowatt hours for the long day guys. We will obviously price it appropriately taking the market dynamics into account. With regarding the cost structure of the sales, you asked, again, we have not going to break out the cost of a battery cells, but we have partnered already with one supplier who we are buying the ACB meaning the 1.5 to 1.2 kilowatt hour battery from and has given us extremely competitive pricing along with very high quality. We are in the process of signing an MSA with another very high-quality supplier with a great supply chain. So, those two will put us in a good position as far as both capacity and costs are concerned and we expect to be very competitive.
Operator: Our next question comes from Eric Stine with Craig-Hallum.
Eric Stine: Just related to SunPower and I know -- I don't if you're willing to break this out specifically, but I'm just curious maybe how that is trending versus your expectations. I guess what I'm getting at, obviously a very strong top line quarter and wondering if that was a major component of the strength or if this is your underlying business and then as we get into the back half of the year, we're going to layer SunPower the impact of the volumes of SunPower on top of that.
Badri Kothandaraman: The SunPower transition is going extremely well for us. They're very important customer. We will do whatever it takes to serve them well. Of course, when SunPower is ramping with the Enphase product, I mean, we had to basically work with them to ensure that the inventories position is right. And therefore, the numbers are little bit lower in this quarter. But yes, we had an extraordinary strength from all of the customers as well. And therefore, so even if their demand or if we ship less material to SunPower because of the inventory reasons, we made it up with the other customers. But going forward, we should start seeing that business ramping in Q2 of '19 and as we said before, so there's no change to what we we're thinking better.
Eric Stine: Okay, got it. And obviously, you're making quite a bit of progress with other AC module customers. Just curious what that's driving from the rest of -- I mean because you've got a number of AC module partners, whether it's current partners or new partners in response to the trends you're seeing today.
Badri Kothandaraman: So we started with AC module in the late 2017 and LG was the first AC module partner. We are thankful to them for that. And then since then we've learned a lot on AC modules. We have now started shipping in AC modules only or the microinverters for AC modules to SunPower. We are shipping microinverters for AC modules to Panasonic, we are shipping to Solaria [ph]; I mean, AC modules, that is a cornerstone of our innovation where we basically absorb a certain activity in the field in the factory. And because of that we are able to reduce the installation time, we are able to improve on logistics, we improve on quality, we improve on training. So it offers extraordinary value. The installers, whoever have converted AC modules find it obviously difficult to go back to this screen. So, AC module is very important, we are continuing to work on it. It's becoming -- it's not that it's going to ramp heavily in one quarter but it is slow and steady growth. For example, in Europe we are working with a couple of very key modules vendors in order to introduce AC modules, we will announce when we are ready and we are also working with a few partners in APAC as well.
Eric Stine: Maybe last one for me, and I don't know if I missed this. Did you mention or did you give the number 1Q was constrained by on the components and what that number looks like and Q2?
Badri Kothandaraman: No, we have no breaking out the number we were constrained by. No.
Operator: Our next question comes from Amit Dayal with HC Wainwright.
Amit Dayal: Congratulations, guys on the strong quarter and the guidance. Just the year, your strength you're seeing, I mean, is this tied to any one partner or customer? I know you're doing well in the U.S. and Latin America from a geography perspective, but what's driving some of this strength? Are you taking market share from other players? Could you just maybe give some color on the...
Badri Kothandaraman: Actually, 18 months back in page was in a very different place. The balance sheet was not in a great shape. P&L was hurting I think in the last 18 months with the hard work of a lot of people, we basically have done the corner. Our balance sheet is very strong now. We're starting to make money. So, our customers, a lot of the customers who were kind of nervous at that time to do business with us are now coming back. And most importantly our product innovation hasn't stopped even during the most difficult of times we introduced IQ 6 and IQ 7. And you know IQ 7 is a fantastic product. IQ 7 is best in class in terms of the number of components that has, the kind of power, the weight and in addition, the cable is a lot simpler cable. So product innovation has really been the root cause on why we are here. So, that combined with a great quality, great customer service coupled with a strong balance sheet, is the low cost probably of a lot of customers coming back. And having said that, where is this demand coming from? The demand is broad-based. It's coming from a lot of long-tail customers. In addition, we are seeing a bunch of tier 2 that's well cropping up. Of course, the AC modules are ramping, you know about that and Ensemble relationship is also important for us. Those are some of the vectors, I thought, of revenue growth.
Amit Dayal: Understood. Are you potentially seeing this strength going to play it out in the following -- in the second half of the year as well? I'm just trying to look further down the line a little bit. But I don't know if you can share that or you have that level of visibility, but sequentially it looks like you probably are in a position with Ensemble etcetera coming down in maybe the fourth quarter to continue sequentially.
Badri Kothandaraman: Yes. It's too early, Amit to talk about the guidance or the second half, but we feel good. We have a lot of positive things happening. Ensemble is going to get released in the fourth quarter with the focus on the residential storage market. We are very excited about that. But we are going to take it one quarter at a time now.
Amit Dayal: Just maybe one last one the expedite fees now with the Infineon coming online, is this now going away for us or should we expect this to continue playing out a little bit more?
Badri Kothandaraman: In the long-term, you should always expect a little bit of expedite, which is 1% to 2%, but anything in the 3% to 4% etc., is egregious that needs to go away. And it's probably going to go away only early next year or maybe the latter part of this year, which we will see. And again, Infineon is instrumental for us because we signed the contract with Infineon that a neighbor is a steady stream of supply in the second half with, in fact, some of it starting Q2. So, we expect some levels of expedite always.
Operator: Our next question comes from Philip Shen with ROTH Capital.
Philip Shen: Let's try this again. Can you guys hear me okay? Oh, sincere apologies for the technical difficulties with my cell phone. But first question is on pricing, apologies if you've already talked about some of this, but we've heard that you may have raised prices by 5% on April 1. I just want to confirm that that's just for the U.S. business, what percentage of the business does that apply to? And then looking forward, what's the outlook for pricing in general with the lack of entrance from a competitor and the strength that you have now. What do you -- how do you expect pricing to trend independent of tariffs as we go through the year? Thanks.
Badri Kothandaraman: Yes, it is true. We did raise the pricing by 5% on April 1, correct in North America. With regarding the pricing trends, I mean we see pricing to be sealed right now. And like what I said, we are going to take it one quarter at a time, but right now we see pricing flat.
Philip Shen: And I know you're not providing guidance for the back half, but I was wondering if you could provide some broad-brush strokes. So, specifically, you talked about being fully booked for Q2. Can you provide some indication about how much Q3 might be booked perhaps, talk about what the cadence of Q3 and Q4 might be?
Badri Kothandaraman: Phil, unfortunately, I cannot break up numbers for Q3 and Q4, but I'll say the same thing as told Amit. I mean we had had a very good spot in terms of the business. A lot of the business strength is due to the long-day tier 2 AC modules and our relationship with the SunPower is typically. Historically, you know that for the solar business in our Q3 and Q4 are usually good. But you know, having said that, you know the kind of business, the kind of government in our conditions we are at so anything can change. So, we are going to take it one quarter at a time, but we feel good.
Philip Shen: As for Q3 supply, how much of your U.S. demand do you think could be addressed by your Mexico facility? Are we looking at maybe 50%? I know you were started in the quarter of Q2 ramping up there but are we looking at a vast majority?
Badri Kothandaraman: It's a little bit early, but let me tell you my line of thinking. We take all of the product qualification seriously. The Mexico product will be treated like a new product. We will not release it until we are absolutely confident that it is as reliable and as high-quality as the China version. So, basically, we are going to -- we are not going to get ahead of ourselves. We are confident of getting the qualification done in this quarter. We will do a soft, what we call it, the soft ramp. We will do it. We'll do a focus group, we'll start with a few customers then we will introduce year on a broad scale. That's the color that I can provide right now.
Philip Shen: And one last housekeeping set of questions. Eric, this might be more for you as it relates to one timers. You seem like a very clean quarter, but I wanted to just confirm, besides the air shipments, were there any one timers in cogs? Were there any one timers in revenue or you going in G&A?
Eric Branderiz: Both exists, the only one had come to mind for the a little bit legacy of the SOX artificial work that we started last year and finished with the Q1 thinking, right? So other than that on the OpEx front it's pretty clean, rather it is pretty straightforward.
Philip Shen: Okay, great. Thank you, both. Congrats on the great quarter and the guide, and just development and progress in general. And I'll pass it on.
Operator: Our next question comes from Maheep Mandloi with Credit Suisse.
Maheep Mandloi: Thanks for taking my question. Just on the gross margin, can you talk about how much of the guidance includes the impact of component charges in the Q2?
Badri Kothandaraman: Yes. As we said in the script, the 32% to 35% gross margin guidance includes a 250 to 350-basis points spending per component charges.
Maheep Mandloi: Sorry for missing that earlier. And just on Safe Harbor, and you said it will be -- we can probably expect more details in Q3, but based on your talk so far what our customers are looking for in the Safe Harbor? Is it generally, the microinverter or -- I've been looking for AC modules; and have they talked about using your warehousing capacity or anything else which we can learn on the next call, on the stream in this regard?
Badri Kothandaraman: I mean it's too early for us to be talking about the nature of the human race now. We know that our customers have a need and right now it looks like it's going to be more of the microinverters, but we don't have the right details to share with you and that will be available in the next three months and we'll share it with you eventually.
Operator: Our next question comes from Brad Meikle with Williams Trading.
Brad Meikle: Thanks for taking the question. So, it's the end of April, so essentially saying by Q4 you'll have 2-million-unit capacity. So, you shift about $970,000, I guess. And so, you'll have more than twice as much capacity five months from now based on the way you're laying it out. So, can you fill that in with a little bit of color on where that incremental demand is coming from? Like, how you got to that number and how much of that may be -- even if it's not bookings, there may be some visibility on demand for even though you're not guiding on that period. Thank you.
Badri Kothandaraman: So Brad, you're right. I mean we are planning for a 2-million-unit capacity in Q4 of '19. We are putting in place measures that's how you saw the Infineon press release, etc., that's going to help us in terms of component shortages. And having said that, I will go back to our profitable top line growth vectors. I mean the root cause of our profitable top line growth vectors is a clean balance sheet. Now it's a great P&L and most importantly, our IQ 7 product. And that product with the highest quality in terms of great PPM long-term target is 500 DPPM. That is the one that is driving a lot of strength and the strength is obviously across the board. And as you know, it's no secret, Enphase is primarily focused on long tail customers because we think long-day customers are -- we have a great value proposition for long tail customers. Very often, they have crews of four to eight people in total and they do a limited number of jobs and all they want is to make sure their product is very high-quality and that customer service, when they come with a problem it is solved immediately. So, first call resolution is super important for the long day. And our job is really where we excel is to make that easy. So, smooth for the long tail, it's so easy to use our product that they just -- when they buy an Enphase product they hopefully will not switch to anyone else. So, that is our fundamental value proposition of the long tail. So, we are seeing a lot of strength across long tail. In addition, we are seeing some of the tier 2 customers, they are also growing in strength. As we talked about AC modules, we talked about Panasonic, which we did a press release. We talked about our great partners, SunPower, we talked about Solaria, we have a few more in the works. So, that is yet another AC module that makes long tail a lot more easier because it's just again, so easy to use. It absorbs a lot of field activity into the factory and it comes to very high quality because it's already preassembled. So, these all are actually together driving a lot of strength for us. It's too early for us to be talking about the second half. But like what I told you in the call historically, Q3 and Q4 are strong for the solar industry. And I hope it is true now too. And the Safe Harbor is another piece as well which we need to get visibility on. So, what we are doing this to prepare the company for the long-term. Irrespective of whatever happens in the short-term, we want to make sure we have the right capacity for the long-term. And for now, we have decided it is that number, 2 million units, getting to a 2 million unit capacity number in Q4 '19 and we'll keep you informed as we know better.
Brad Meikle: Do you have a sense for what your market share would be? Let's say you were to ship all of that 2 million capacity, there's some variation in the market share numbers that you see out there. But if you got to that point, at some point in time, do you have a sense of what the market share would be?
Badri Kothandaraman: Brad, I'm not going to speculate about market share because that involves that means I know the total available market and I don't really know what will the total available market before for the latter half. But what I can tell you at this time, I consider that, yes market share is important. But for me, the way I think about market share it is an output of a lot of things. And what is an input? Is can I solve customer's problems? Can solution be so easy for the customer to use and how can I innovate to solve customer problems better than the competition? And how can I differentiate better and therefore how can I maintain the value on my product? That is the most, most important thing and that's why you see a product like Ensemble; Ensemble addresses a problem that you still -- solar still works when the grid is off; so that is a problem that we took as we addressed that problem. AC modules; we wanted to absorb the field activities into the factory so that installers will reduce the installation time, making it easier for the installation partner while the Ensemble makes it easier for the homeowner. We believe in order to generate a lot of value, we need to focus on both our homeowner as well as our installer partner. And that's really how we drive the company to focus on innovation and differentiation and creating value.
Brad Meikle: The question is really thinking about if he got back to the dominant market share that Enphase had three or four years ago, is that more than 2 million units or 3 million units, kind of trying to frame the market. So, any help you can get on that offline, that would be much appreciated. And that's it. Thank you very much.
Operator: Our next question comes from Pavel Molchanov with Raymond James.
Pavel Molchanov: Thanks for taking the question. I want to go back to the gross margin guidance for Q2. If the supply chain loosening is indeed getting better in Q2, as you've said, and you're also going to benefit from the final partnership payment, which I suppose carries 100% margin, why wouldn't the overall margin actually improve in Q2 versus Q1? Because you're guiding could basically flat at the midpoint.
Badri Kothandaraman: So Pavel, the embedded range 32% to 35%; number one. The second one is we are talking about an increased revenue number and like what I said, some of the extra supply from supply agreements is going to trickle down into of '19, but most of it in the second half of '19. Having said that, it is a delicate balance between exactly the dates the customer needs product because they're going to go lines down, and the date we can supply. So, therefore, Q2 will still have expedite fees to the tune of 250 to 350-basis points, there is already enough gross margin guide.
Pavel Molchanov: Let me also ask about warranty obligations. Given that revenue obviously is increasing your reference that was up kind of seasonally Q1. Work obligations actually edge down in the quarter. Can you explain how that was?
Badri Kothandaraman: Look, I mean we are running the company with anonymous focus on quality and this started not only -- right from when we started the company, after the first year or two, we learned that the cornerstones of the company are customer service and product innovation. That's what we learned. So, basically if you look at our microinverter, if you look at our competition, the way other people do is a traditional microinverter has got two stages. We do it in one stage and we do it in one stage because we have an AC and that AC provides -- the AC has got a calculator on it that basically is predictive and it is able to reduce the number of stages from two stages to one stage. Because of that, there's reduced number of components. Because there's reduced number of components, the quality is inherently better and that gets better and better and better with every microinverter generation. The second aspect is because we use lesser number of components and lesser number of stages, we generate lesser heat, which means that our efficiency is higher. Because we generate lesser heat, we do not need metal casing. A plastic casing would do. So, it is architecturally, we have designed the product that is correct by construction for quality and our quality principals, the way we beat on quality in the last two years it is a business process that is ingrained in us, which is we go into a room, we understand the failures that came in during that week, we are relentlessly until we dig deep and understand the reasons on why exactly the failure happened. And many of the failures like, for example, 70% of all the failures are usually related to our suppliers. Then we are dogmatic about going back to them and saying, "You need to change your design or we are going to remove you from the bill of materials." So, that's the process that we are getting better at. We are not perfect today, but our long-term target is 500 DPPM 500. DPPM is 0.05%. We are not there today, but our quality principles are something that we very strongly believe in and that's how we run the company.
Pavel Molchanov: Just one quick one; as the battery becomes a more needle-moving revenue driver, do you plan to eventually break that out away from the microinverter megawatts?
Badri Kothandaraman: I think it's a good question. I need to debate it with my CFO, but I think it looks like that may not be a bad idea.
Operator: Our next question comes from Amit Dayal with HC Wainwright.
Amit Dayal: Badri, just on the long tail/tier 2 customers, is this sort of a reliable channel for growth? Is this most sustainable or is this something that has emerged now that could grow with you guys?
Badri Kothandaraman: I mean, we you have two customers that are actually definite an emerging customers because they actually emerge from tier 3 or tier 4 to tier 2 and on the rate to tier 1. So yes, they're sustainable. Yes, they've had a long-term relationship with us. Yes, they helped us when we were down in the dumps. They actually helped us. So, the end of yes.
Operator: I'm not showing any further questions at this time. I'd like to turn the call back to Badri Kothandaraman for a quick closing.
Badri Kothandaraman: So, thank you for joining us today and for your continued support of Enphase. We look forward to speaking with you again on our call next quarter.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's presentation. You may now disconnect and have a wonderful day.

===== 2018 Q4  (2019-02-26 16:30:00) =====
Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Enphase Energy's Fourth Quarter 2018 Financial Results Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct the question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions] And as a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference Ms. Christina Carrabino. Ma'am, you may begin.
Christina Carrabino: Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us on today's conference call to discuss Enphase Energy's fourth quarter and year-end 2018 results. On today's call are Badri Kothandaraman, Enphase's President and Chief Executive Officer; Eric Branderiz, Chief Financial Officer; and Raghu Belur, Chief Products Officer. After the market closed today, Enphase issued a press release announcing the results for its fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2018. During this conference call, Enphase management will make forward-looking statements, including but not limited to, statements related to Enphase Energy's technology, products and financial performance, operations including supply and lead times and current and future market and customer demands and trends. These forward-looking statements involve significant risks and uncertainties, and Enphase Energy's actual results and the timing of events could differ materially from these expectations. For a more complete discussion of the risks and uncertainties, please see the company's quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2018, which is on file with the SEC, and the annual report on Form 10-K for they ended December 31, 2018, which will be filed with the SEC in the first quarter of 2019. Enphase Energy cautions you not to place any undue reliance on forward-looking statements, and undertakes no duty or obligation to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future events, or changes in its expectations. Also, please note that financial measures used on this call are expressed on a non-GAAP basis unless otherwise noted, and have been adjusted to exclude certain charges. The company has provided a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures in its earnings release posted today, which can also be found in the Investor Relations section of its website. Now, I'd like to introduce Badri Kothandaraman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Enphase Energy. Badri?
Badri Kothandaraman: Good afternoon and thanks for joining us today to discuss our fourth quarter and full year 2018 financial results. We had a solid quarter, we reported revenue of $92.3 million. We had strong customer demand as our financial strength and robust balance sheet reaffirmed customer confidence. Our biggest challenge in Q4 was meetings this additional demand due to component shortages that constrained our revenue. We are fully booked for Q1 2019, just as we saw in Q4 2018. I will provide an update later in the call on our plans to mitigate component shortages. Our non-GAAP gross margin in the fourth quarter was 30.7% and the Non-GAAP operating income was $8.6 million. Our gross margin was negatively impacted by 4.3% due to expedite fees related to component shortages. The expedite fees were in the form of air shipments that we chose to make in order to service our customers. We exited the fourth quarter with a cash balance of $106.2 million net of a $10 million final payment to SunPower. The strong cash balance also enabled us to completely repay on January 28, 2019, our high interest bearing senior secured term loan of approximately $39.5 million plus accrued interest and fees. Now let's talk about 30-20-10 our target financial model. We introduced 30-20-10 at our Analyst Day in June of 2017 and committed to meeting the model in Q4 of 2018. The 30-20-10 stands for 30% gross margin, 20% operating expense and 10% operating income. We made significant progress towards making that model reality as we exited 2018. Eric will go into greater detail about our financial results later on the call. An important focus items that we discussed in the past few quarters is ease of doing business. How customers perceive us. Quality and customer service are the cornerstones of our strategy and our objective is to deliver exceptional customer experience. Our business processes are maturing, and we are prioritizing customer experience to be number one in all aspects of our business. During Q4,we made several improvements in our call center and online support, particularly in Europe and Asia Pacific. We also rolled out our Enphase Upgrade Program, the service program for early adopters of our legacy micro inverters and announced that over 1,000 homeowners have joined the program. The key metric we use to measure customer experience is the net promoter score or NPS, this metric is calculated based on feedback from customer surveys on how likely customers or partners will recommend Enphase to a friend or colleague. Our NPS in North America was approximately 51% in Q4, and our target is to achieve a worldwide NPS of 60% or higher in 2019. Now let's talk about the 301 tariffs that became effective in September of 2018 impacting Enphase microinverters and accessories. As we discussed last quarter, we are mitigating the existing 10% 301 tariffs by sharing the cost increases with our customers and expanding our manufacturing agreement with Flex in Mexico starting in Q2 of 2019.This additional line in Mexico is expected to help Enphase better service our North American customers by cutting down cycle times and streamlining inventory at a similar manufacturing costs currently with Flex in China. Now turning to our regions, our U.S. and international mix for Q4 was 77% and 23% respectively. All of our regions were impacted by component shortages in Q4. Our fourth quarter revenue in the U.S. was up 38% sequentially and up 29% year-on-year due to strong customer demand across the board. Note that the U.S. revenue includes volume shipments of our IQ 7XS microinverters to SunPower as we previously planned. In Europe, revenue was down 2% sequentially, but up 27% year-on-year. The megawatts shipments were up 26% sequentially and up 31% year-on-year setting a new record for Europe. Note that the Q3 2018 revenue for Europe included a $3.3 million of milestone achievement from a partner on IQ8. We are encouraged by the growth outlook in the new build and social housing sectors in Europe. In APAC our revenue was down 61% sequentially and down 74% year-on-year. As we previously mentioned, the region had built up significant channel inventory over time and we took this opportunity to bring the inventory down. We recently appointed Wilf Johnston as our new General Manager for the region and we believe his years of international executive management experience will help strengthen our APAC business. In Latin America fourth quarter revenue was down 41% sequentially and down 14% year-on-year, unfortunately component shortages significantly impacted our Q4 sales to this region as well. Now that we are financially stable a large portion of our time is spent on profitable top line growth. We plan to achieve this growth through differentiated products and services. Our four levers for profitably top line growth remain IQ7 regional expansion, high power and high performance products, AC modules and Ensemble Solar and Storage technology. The first lever for profitable top line growth is IQ7 regional expansion. Approximately 84% of our microinverter shipments in Q4 were IQ7, up from 78% in Q3. As I mentioned earlier, component shortages constrained our revenue in Q4. We have been working with our customers and partners to manage these shortages and we are thankful for their efforts and patience. The additional capacity based on an investment we made with one of our suppliers earlier in 2018 is now online. This has allowed us to increase our micro inverter supply for Q1 2019, but with the growth we have seen our lead times are still around 13 to 15 weeks. We have recently signed two new long-term contracts for additional high voltage transistors. This additional supply is expected to become available in the second half of this year, which we believe will help improve our microinverter lead times to six to eight weeks. The second lever for profitable top line growth is releasing high power and high performance new products. The IQ7XS product addresses 96-cell PV modules up to 400 watt DC and with its 97.5% CEC efficiency is ideal for integration into high power modules like SunPower and Panasonic. In addition, we shipped limited quantities of our new product IQ7A, which addresses up to 450 watt DC modules. The third lever for profitable top line growth is AC modules. We had volume shipments of our IQ7XS microinverters to SunPower in the fourth quarter and as previously announced, we expect a continuation of the ramp in 2019. In addition, we are making steady progress with module partners such as Solaria and Panasonic, and ramping Enphase Energized AC modules. These integrated systems allow installers to be more competitive through improved logistics, reduced installation time, faster inspection and training. Since their release in October of 2017 Enphase Energized ACMs from our module partners have been adopted by about 420 installers in the U.S. as of today. Finally, a major catalyst for our profitable top line growth in the long-term is our Ensemble solar and storage technology. The IQ8 system is based on our grid agnostic always on technology called Ensemble. This system has four components, energy generation which is accomplished with the grid agnostic micro inverter IQ8, energy storage which is achieved by Encharge battery with capacities of 3.3, 10 kilowatt hour, 13.2 kilowatt hour, communication and control called Enpower which consists of the automatic transfer switch and the combiner box with the Envoy gateway. The fourth and final component is Enlighten, which is the IoT cloud software. We are working hard on each of these four components of the IQ8 system. There are over 100 engineers working on the project across multiple time zones. However, given the high complexity of the technology in terms of hardware and software, we are running a little bit late. We believe in making right decisions for the long-term and getting the customer experience right. Therefore we now anticipate introducing Ensemble in a phased manner starting in the fourth quarter of 2019. Let me remind you that there are two major market segments Ensemble technology addresses. One is the pure off grid segment and the other is a grid agnostic segment. We just talked about the grid agnostic solution being delayed to the fourth quarter of 2019. However, the pure off-grid microinverter solution is on track. We shipped limited quantities to our partner on IQ8 during the fourth quarter of 2018 and we expect to ramp production in the first half of 2019. We also expect the final milestone revenue from this partner in the first quarter of 2019. In summary, we are encouraged by our progress in 2018. Our top priorities remain providing superior customer experience and focusing on our four profitable top line growth factors. I would like to thank our employees for their hard work and our customers, partners and shareholders for their strong support. With that, I will turn the call over to Eric for his review of our financial results. Eric?
Eric Branderiz: Thanks, Badri. I will provide more details related to our fourth quarter and full year 2018 financial results, as well as our business outlook for the fourth quarter. As a reminder, the financial measures that I'm going to provide are on a non-GAAP basis, unless otherwise noted. We have provided reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures in our earnings release posted today, which also can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website. Total revenue for the fourth quarter of 2018 was $92.3 million, an increase of 18% sequentially, and an increase of 16% year-over-year. We shipped approximately 257 megawatts DC in the fourth quarter of 2018, an increase in megawatts of 25% sequentially, and an increase of 16% from the year-ago quarter. The megawatts shipped represented about 820,000 microinverters, approximately 84% of which was IQ7. Both IQ6 and IQ7 represented 91% of Q4 microinverter shipments. Non-inverter revenue, which includes our AC Battery Storage Solution, Envoy Communications Gateway, combiner box and accessories increased as a percentage of revenue compared with the prior quarter. Total revenue for 2018 was $316.2 million, up 10% from 2017. In 2018, we shipped approximately 2.8 million microinverters, representing 972 megawatt DC, a 13% year-over-year increasing in megawatts shipped. Non-GAAP gross margin for the fourth quarter of 2018 was 30.7%, compared to 32.8% for the third quarter. Note that Q3 2018 non-GAAP gross margin including a $3.3 million milestone achievement from a partner on IQ8. Even though we shared some of the expedite fees with our partners, component shortages negatively impacted our Q4 gross margin by approximately 4.3%. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $19.7 million for the fourth quarter of 2018, compared to $18.6 million in Q3 and $18 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. 2018 was our first year of SOX compliance efforts and as a result we incurred higher than expected expenses in internal audit plus additional consulting and advisory fees. These higher than normal expenses will also continue into Q1 2019. Non-GAAP operating expenses for 2018 were $75 million, compared to $72.8 million in 2017. GAAP operating expenses were $23.2 million for the fourth quarter of 2018, compared to $25.6 million in Q3, and $21.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. GAAP operating expenses for the fourth quarter included $1.5 million of the stock-based compensation expenses, $1.5 million of restructuring expenses, and approximately $400,000 [later changed by the company to $500, 000] of acquisition related expenses and amortization. GAAP operating expenses for 2018 were $92.8 million, compared to $95.4 million in 2017. On a non-GAAP basis income from operations was $8.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2018, compared to $7 million in Q3 and $1.3 million in the year ago quarter. This improvement in operating income is reflective of our improved operational excellence and continued product leadership. On a non-GAAP basis, net income for the fourth quarter of 2018 was $5.1 million, compared to $4.6 million in Q3 and $683,000 in the year ago quarter. This resulted in basic earnings per share of $0.05 and diluted earnings per share of $0.04 in the fourth quarter of 2018, compared to basic and diluted earnings per share of $0.01 in the year ago quarter. GAAP net income for the fourth quarter of 2018 was $709,000. We are happy to report that this was the first quarter in the company's history that we reported GAAP net profitability. Now turning to the balance sheet. Inventory was $16.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2018, compared to $17.9 million in Q3, and $26 million in a year ago quarter. We ended at 23 days of inventory on hand as of December 31, 2018 significantly below our target of about 30 days and down from 31 days in the third quarter, and also down from 39 days in the year ago quarter. Although most of the inventory reduction was due to high demand constrained by component shortages, inventory management continues to remain one of our key cash management initiatives. We exited the fourth quarter of 2018 with a total cash balance of $106.2 million compared to $116.2 million in Q3. The Q4 balance includes the final payment to SunPower of $10 million for the acquisition of its microinverter business. We also generated $1.9 million in cash flow from operations and $4.1 million in adjusted free cash flow. The $1.9 million in cash flow from operations in Q4 would have been $5.9 million as we allocated $4 million out of the $10 million payment to SunPower in operating cash flow for the acquired customer relationship acquisition related intangibles. As Badri mentioned, on January 28, 2018 we repaid in full our high interest bearing senior secured term loan with Tennenbaum Capital Partners an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of BlackRock Inc. The repayment included a principal amount of approximately $39.5 million plus accrued interest and fees. The repayment also terminated the liens of all Enphase’s assets, providing greater operating flexibility going forward. Now let's discuss our outlook for the first quarter of 2019. We expect our revenue for the first quarter of 2019 to be within a range of $90 million to $95 million. Turning to margins, we expect GAAP and non-GAAP gross margin to be within that range of 31% to 34%. Note that our Q1 gross margin guidance includes a negative impact of approximately 2% to 3% due to expedite fees, resulting from component shortages. We expect our GAAP operating expenses to be within a range of $25 million to $26 million, including a total of approximately $4.5 million estimated for stock-based compensation expenses, additional restructuring expenses and acquisition related expenses and amortization. We expect non-GAAP operating expenses to be within a range of $20.5 million to $21.5 million. With that, I will now open the line for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Brad Meikle with Williams Trading. Your line is now open.
Brad Meikle: Hi. Thanks for the question. Could you add a little more color in terms of your visibility into second quarter and the second half the year from a demand standpoint. And also areas you're ramping, it sounds like you prioritize the ramp of the IQ7 and to alleviate the shortages and catch up with customer demand. Can you comment on how much more capacity you'll have as you go into the second and third quarter? Thanks.
Badri Kothandaraman: Yes, Brad, thanks for the question. As you know, we are not going to provide guidance beyond a quarter and we guided $90 million to $95 million of revenue for Q1 of 2019. Having said that, we are unlocking three of the four top line growth vectors that I said. The first one was the IQ7 regional expansion, the second is the AC modules and the third is the high performance, high power products so I'll take each of them. In the first one obviously our balance sheet has significantly improved. We are very financially stable we have great cash in our cash balance. So customers are coming back to us. In addition, we pride ourselves on offering the highest quality end customer experience. So, with all of this our demand has started to increase and what we did was we recognized this sometime last year and we basically we worked with one of our suppliers to increase our 600 volt transistor supply, which is a key component in our microinverters. And we did that early in 2018 we locked some capacity down and that capacity is coming on in Q1 2019. In fact, it is online right now. But having said that, as we unlock more of our top line growth vectors, we found that that is not enough. We found that in the fourth quarter that we had to scramble for more capacity and I personally went down and talk to the CEOs of these companies and we were able to get two additional long-term contracts done. The result is that from middle of 2019, meaning from the second half of 2019 the incremental supply will turn on and we will start to service customers a lot better. The answer to your question is Q1 2019 will be better than Q4 of 2018, Q2 1019 will be better than Q1 of 2019 and Q3 and Q4 will be a lot more comfortable for us.
Brad Meikle: Thanks, Badri. I guess just to ask in other way. I think you’ve said in the past that the new power MOFSET line could be 60% of your output, when ramped. And I'm not sure exactly how long it takes to ramp, but that really implies close to doubling of capacity depending on how your existing contracts sort of look, but is that the right way to think about that?
Badri Kothandaraman: Well, I mean, yes that is the right way to think about it. The -- let me let me say this. In the second half of the year we will be in a very comfortable spot in terms of our supply. Supply -- I hope supply will not be a major problem in the second half.
Brad Meikle: And are you sold out through the second quarter at this point as well?
Badri Kothandaraman: We’re not going to talk about the second quarter, Brad the -- we are sold out for the first quarter though.
Brad Meikle: Okay, thanks. And just last question, could you speak to the battery ramp and we've heard of some high attach rates in California of 25% plus and, obviously you make probably eight times as much on a storage installation with your customers. So could you comment on what you're seeing from customers that you're talking about in terms of storage attachment and what that could mean for the business. Thanks very much.
Badri Kothandaraman: Yes, we’re extremely excited about storage, as I said in the prior quarter, storagerepresents a significant opportunity for us to increase the revenue potential for home from $2,000 to $10,000. And a key part of Ensemble is Encharge, Encharge is going to have capacities of 3.3 kilowatt hour, 10 kilowatt hour, 13.2 kilowatt hour it is going to have us see over two charging rate, it is going to have LSP chemistry, which is going to be very safe for residential applications. It is, I mean, most importantly, it’s going to use IQ8 and the same IQ8 microinverter. So we are furiously working on Encharge, having said that like what it has it is a little bit delayed to the fourth quarter of 2019. But we are extremely optimistic about our prospects in storage and yes I’ll leave at that.
Brad Meikle: Thanks. I'll get back in the queue.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Carter Driscoll with B. Riley FBR. Your line is now open.
Carter Driscoll: Good afternoon gentlemen. I mean you just talk about your assessment of the opportunity for Ensemble and the grid-tied versus not necessarily having being grid-tied and the delay of when you're going to ramp the second portion of that market just trying to get a sense of relative market opportunity.
Badri Kothandaraman: Right, so Ensemble is designed to service two markets, one is grid agnostic market segment and the other is the off-grid market segment. Come to the off-grid market segment where we are on track. We started sampling the product to our lead customer in the fourth quarter of 2018 and we are expecting to ship significant quality to them in the first quarter of 2019. So what I’ll say is this, I mean, if you look at of -- if you look at the countries, where the off-grid technology is going to play a major part is going to be places like India and Africa. India and Africa are places where you will see, of course the PV and storage systems are not going to be that big, they've got to be small. But imagine a hot -- having one or two AC modules or one or two modules with microinverters. And so that will be just perfect for the architecture of a microinverter. It's still too early for us to assess, to talk about volumes and talk about ramps, but we're excited that our product is there, our product is sampling. We have a strong partner and we will talk about in the coming quarters progress. So, that's on the off-grid -- pure off-grid microinverter. On the grid agnostic one it gets more exciting, the grid agnostic one obviously there's a lot of cases. We service somebody, who wants to be completely good independent. We service somebody who wants to be totally dependent on the grid, but just wants backup as a peace of mind. So Ensemble technology that can do whatever the customer wants. That's why, we call it as grid agnostic and Ensemble complex. It has got four components, which is the micro, the battery, the automatic transfer switch, and the combiner and cloud. Having working all of these together seamlessly in terms of hardware and software is something that we have been challenged with. And I think that's why we are experiencing the delay, but the way I think about it is two big opportunities on the Ensemble side is one is the storage, which is Encharge, which takes our revenue per home from $2,000 to $10,000. And the other is even if there is not much storage attachment, what would people want grid agnostic solar or a grid-tied solar. I mean, we think that most people would want a grid-agnostic solar they've given a choice. So once again, we are extremely excited about the technology, we're extremely excited about Ensemble. But we did not want to get ahead of ourselves. Right now we are basically having our heads to the table, we are focused on execution and we are focus on getting this product out in the fourth quarter of 2019.
Carter Driscoll: Okay. Maybe just another one in, maybe talk about the percentage shipped to AC modules and the form factor or a range. Where you have been 4Q and where you think it could go by say year-end 2019?
Badri Kothandaraman: Well, we’re not going to break out the percentage shipments. But AC modules have been increasing slowly and steadily. And it starts with customers like SunPower, which is all AC modules are the microinverters IQ7Xs that we shipped to SunPower is in their Equinox AC modules. In addition, partners like Solaria or all gaining a lot of traction in their market. Solaria has got a 355 watt AC module, they use their IQ7 plus microinverter, which is a 295 watt AC output. So basically a DC/AC ratio 1.2 there. And Solaria value proposition is it's effective module is aesthetic and that's why everybody likes it that's that. And earlier in the year, we announced our partnership with Panasonic that's slowly getting to be a reality and we'll announce when we are ready there. So basically these are our very strong partners and in addition we have a few more that we are working on in the international regions, which we’ll announce when we are ready.
Carter Driscoll: Maybe just last one for me. To get to the high and low end of your margin guidance for 1Q. Can you just talked about the factors is it some combination and mix. Obviously what you've done in -- potentially in terms of sharing the tariff impact. Maybe just talk about those factors the more important ones to get to the 300 bps delta?
Badri Kothandaraman: Yes. I mean, look we are already sharing the tariff costs with our customers. We did that effective in Q4 of 2018, which is what we said we were. So we're doing that our -- really the puts and takes on gross margin. The 4.3% really comes from air shipping our microinverter. So that we provide customer service. And so I didn't -- to tell you the truth, I prioritize customer service in Q4. And therefore we spent a lot of money air shipping product. Yes, now a few of our customers are also willing to pay for air ships. So that basically offset us a little bit, but even after that we still had a gross margin hit of 4.3% as we said. And now in Q1 of 2019 with the supply situation a little bit better. We are not going to be spending so much money, but still is a significant 2% to 3% in terms of air shipments is still significant. And that's really accounted in the guidance of 31% to 34%.
Carter Driscoll: Sorry, if I may just sneak the last one. Just talk about the competitive environment from existing and then maybe the new entrants what you're seeing both last quarter and what you expect in 2019?
Badri Kothandaraman: I mean, the competitive environment remains pretty -- I mean, pretty much the same there is not much change of course we're all talking about Huawei. We do not see them that much in the residential space right now, but of course they are a formidable competitor we are watching the space. But let me remind you that our product is unique, our product is differentiated it's a micro inverter and we focus on the differentiation through innovation. So we'll be prepared to meet competition.
Carter Driscoll: Appreciate taking all my questions. I’ll go back in queue guys. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Eric Stine with Craig-Hallum. Your line is now open.
Eric Stine: Hi, everyone. Maybe just wanted start with SunPower and I might have missed this, but did you break out the percentage of your revenues in fourth quarter there? And then just curious, if you could talk about the ramp, I know it's still early, but the ramp? And maybe how it's progressing versus your expectations when you made the acquisition a couple months ago?
Badri Kothandaraman: Yes, we're not going to make on the percentage of SunPower revenue. But I'll tell you what, I mean, it is -- the ramp is very much in line with our expectation. I expected volume shipments beginning Q4 of 2018 and we are exactly at that point where we had volume shipments to SunPower on our IQ7X microinverters in Q4, of 2018. I expect Q1 2019 to be a ramp, nice ramp. And I expect us to be done by Q2 of 2019 as I previously communicated.
Eric Stine: Okay. And I guess you touched on this on your answer to previous questions. But, I'm just curious with SunPower with some of the traction you're getting with some of your other AC module partners. Just curious what you're seeing from the rest of the market? I mean what that's doing in terms of interest people coming to you looking for their own solution, anything along those lines would be helpful.
Badri Kothandaraman: Yes, I mean, if you really see it an AC module is actually perfect when you see that the modules are going to higher and higher power. Because we can easily scale our microinverters. So, it’s actually advantageous for us in terms of gross margin as well. And, having said that, SunPower is the biggest. And then people like Solaria, for example, like I will reemphasize that again, it's a 355 watt AC module. And it is a really neat module, 72 cell modules and very high aesthetic black on black and it really looks nice. So those are the kinds of partnerships we are actually getting and we're getting many such partnerships across the world. Like for example, Europe, yes, Europe there are couple of partnerships which we're working on. We cannot allow them yet, but they are making rapid progress.
Eric Stine: Got it. So may be last one for, Eric, just on the OpEx you mentioned that in fourth quarter you had some professional fees and some other stocks related items that ran a little hotter than you thought. And the guide for first quarter, I mean, it sounds like it's going to persist maybe beyond first quarter, maybe a way to think about OpEx at a more normalized level.
Eric Branderiz: Yes, I think that as we -- when we think about OpEx for 2019 except for the qualification from Q4 and Q1 we should thinking in terms of a model, the financial operating model that we set out price, which is cash generating so the $0.24 number is still relevant. It may go up a little bit may go down. It's the whole model of the 30-20-10 that we basically live by and double-digit earning principle outside this unique specific circumstances, right.
Eric Stine: Okay, thanks for that.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Jeff Osborne with Cowen and Company. Your line is now open.
Jeff Osborne: Excellent. Maybe just following up on Eric's question, Eric is there a way you can quantify what the OpEx increase was in Q4 for SOX in professional fees or will that be broken out in the 10-K?
Eric Branderiz: Yes, it will be broken out in 10-K, you actually can see that as well I believe in the table of the press release, right. And for the most part you can see there the stock component 1.5, another portion associated with the restructure fees. So everything is neatly easy to follow there compared with prior quarter and then you can take it into a following impact.
Jeff Osborne: Got it. And then, I think Badri had in his prepared remarks a comment about the last -- if I heard you right Badri the last milestone payment would be showing up in Q1 from your partner for IQ8. Can you confirm; A, confirm that? Then B, is there a way to think about what the magnitude of that payment is?
Badri Kothandaraman: Yes, confirmed, yes, it will be Q1 of 2019 and it will be under $1 million.
Jeff Osborne: Okay. I just noticed you didn't break that out when you were talking about the puts and takes on the gross margin side, but if it's under $1 million, is that the last of the -- if that's the last of the payments? Or is there any additional payments in the future?
Badri Kothandaraman: That's the last of the payments.
Jeff Osborne: Got it. And then another question on SunPower, I know you can't break out specifics, but is there a way you can talk about what your level of engagement is with their channel, their dealer network? Is that something that you have more than half of their channel has been exposed to the product? Or is that still an uphill battle over the next six months for you to penetrate that channel?
Badri Kothandaraman: No, I mean, it's not an uphill battle, but it is not for us to penetrate the channel. SunPower has -- is going to exclusively use end phase microinverters and therefore it is in SunPower's best interest to promote these microinverters and the future microinverters to their dealer network. So, our job is a little bit easier there, because SunPower is taking all -- I mean, is making all the efforts to make sure that everybody is trained, the dealer network is trained. And of course, we are helping them every step of the way.
Jeff Osborne: Got it, that makes sense. The last question I had was on the component side, two part question one is an IQ8, does that use more or less of the 600 volt transistors? I know it's a slightly different form factor and more cost optimized, but I wasn't sure if it's more intensive on the transistor side in particularly?
Badri Kothandaraman: The IQ8 uses the same for high voltage transistors.
Jeff Osborne: Got it. And then as part of these now, I guess, three contracts you have in supply, is there any notable cash payments upfront, that would be disclosed in the 10-K, as that's published or how did the mechanics of these work? And the second part of that question would be, what are the general duration of these types of contracts? Just any events so the auto industry or some other industry comes back and these components continue to have a problem later in the year and in 2020?
Eric Branderiz: Yes, we have two arrangements that we have on top of the one that we existing before, is one of the two that are new that Badri set out is actually a continuation of the existing one with some prepaid arrangement similar to what we had before. The other one is with another one, with has a take-or-pay that is very short timeframe, right? So probably I wouldn't think beyond 18 months to 2 years right, which gives us enough runway to get the problem resolved. But at the same time doesn’t committee company on our structure pricing arrangement on a take-or-pay for the long-term.
Jeff Osborne: Got it, that’s very helpful, Eric. I appreciate it.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Amit Dayal with HC Wainwright. Your line is now open.
Amit Dayal: Thank you and good evening guys. Most of my questions have been asked. Maybe just on the leverage of the business, now that we're seeing some revenue ramp coming through, what is the opportunity over here, should we expect operating costs to sort of normalize at these levels? Or should these expected to increase with the ramping revenues?
Badri Kothandaraman: Right now you should think about the OpEx as our long-term model is 20% of revenue, we are not going to deviate from that. We incurred restructuring expenses to make sure we have the right people in the right places. So we are very confident that we can meet that. That's not an issue. So we are -- while we ramp revenue we will control OpEx at 20% of sales.
Amit Dayal: Got it. So the 30-20-10 no update to that maybe in the next few quarters?
Badri Kothandaraman: Look, I mean, the 30-20-10 is more and more looking like 32-22-10. So the -- I mean what you should be looking at is the 30-20-10 spirit is what is the 10% operating income. So as long as that is met numbers will fluctuate a little bit. Having said that we feel good about are profitable top line growth vectors. We feel good that even if Ensemble is late we feel that the other three vectors are actually kicking in and more than compensating for that. And so we feel really good about that, but still we’re not going to guide more than one quarter out. And we know this is a solar industry anything can happen overnight. We know if the government sneezes on this a little bit, things can go south. So we’re not going to be update more right now.
Amit Dayal: Right. And in the context of pretty strong sort of guide for the first quarter relative to the fourth quarter, Ensemble -- should we expect Ensemble to really contribute anything meaningful this year? Or should that be pushed out in terms of expectations for 2020?
Badri Kothandaraman: Well, look, I think, when we introduce the product in the fourth quarter, obviously that will be only the ramp, right. There won't be much significant revenue from Ensemble in 2019.
Amit Dayal: Got it. Yes, that’s all I have guys, I’ll follow-up offline. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Colin Rusch with Oppenheimer. Your line is now open.
Colin Rusch: Thanks so much guys. It looks like you increase the working capital a little bit here with AR getting up to almost 78 days for the quarter. Can you talk a little bit about what happened there and what your expectation is for working capital needs as you go into the first part of 2019?
Eric Branderiz: Yes, I'll take the first part and Badri, can probably cover the business aspects of it, Colin. But if you think about it the fifth supply component some shortages right, it has created challenges on our linearity right. So what you see is significant amount of shipments taking place sometimes on even an expedited costing basis on air shipping towards the end of the quarter. And that has been aggravated since Q3. And so now I believe we are turning a corner right in which you can see receivables with day sales outstanding of 70 basis, right and at the same time that compensate with the payable side, which we have a lot of purchases of inventory taking place towards the end of the quarter. So with that being said, you end up with a super low levels of inventories on the working capital front, maybe a little bit below our comfort level for operational flexibility now at 23 days with a total cash conversion cycle of 24 days of working capital in the corner, right. So we believe the linearity challenges being starting to get resolved in Q1 and pretty much gone by the end of Q2, we are in good shape to normalize the business back again and if are seeing receivables, payables getting to our own internal target.
Colin Rusch: And as you go into 2019 so you're expecting that 10/1 should be a source of cash and your expectations for March and June?
Eric Branderiz: I didn't quite follow your question. Say that again.
Colin Rusch: You should be generating a bit of cash from the working capital as you go into March and June, or you feel like you're going to consume that as you ramp up.
Eric Branderiz: It's just needs [ph] cash a little bit. We feel confident about our cash generating capabilities based on our financial operating model that we have right 30-20-10 or like Badri reported 32-22-10. That model is a cash generating model. And we don't see all the things that we took into account. I believe, we're going to continue going forward into the year by resolving the linearity challenges and increasing our cash cover.
Colin Rusch: Okay, that's helpful. And then you broke out international and domestic sales. As you look into the 2019 how is that shifting at all? And is there a price component that you're going to see a benefit or any sort of headwinds on -- from mix on a geographic basis?
Eric Branderiz: Look, I mean, it's still going to heavily be skewed towards North America, because of SunPower. Having said that, we are really excited about Europe, we had the highest megawatt shipments like what we noted, really excited about the social housing boom in Netherlands and we have very strong distribution partnerships in France. And once the component shortages are resolved, we hope to break into other regions like start ramping in Germany, start ramping in Austria. Those are the places, we would like to start ramping. And then if you look at Australia and the Asia Pacific, Australia and New Zealand, et cetera. There we really took this opportunity with the component shortages in order to correct our inventory, correct the inventory in the channel. We did that before we brought on a general manager and his expertise, he is a solar guide, he understands storage as well. And we really want him to grow the battery business there. And then the last one is India, we’re not talking about India much, but with the off-grid product starting to come, the pure off-grid product, I'm really excited about the prospects in India as well. There are some niche applications that I am not going to talk about right now. But as our pure off-grid product rolls out in the first half of the year and as Ensemble turns on, there are exciting prospects there as well.
Colin Rusch: Okay. Thanks so much, guys.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Philip Shen of ROTH Capital Partners. Your line is now open.
Philip Shen: Thanks for the questions guys. I have follow-up on the last question there by Colin. I think we're seeing some really nice growth internationally, is there a situation where you can see the international growth rate actually being faster than the U.S.? Or do you kind of look at it in that way at all? And if so, do you see potential for getting to an international versus U.S. mix of call it 60-40 even 50-50 someday in the near call medium-term two to three years out?
Badri Kothandaraman: Yes, I mean, that's our goal to obviously get to parity in terms of U.S. versus Europe versus Asia to get to something like 33-33-33. But having said that, the U.S. business is the strongest at this point in time, especially with SunPower, especially with our financial stability with the long tail of customers coming back because of our product quality, because of our customer experience. U.S. is really firing on all cylinders right now. And I think, 2019 is going to be about the U.S.. And -- but I'm optimistic that 2021 time frame we can start being more balanced in terms of all the deals.
Philip Shen: Great. That makes a lot of sense. And we're even starting to hear about some really aggressive growth rates for the overall U.S. market. I think people going to think about 15% year-over-year growth. But I'm hearing now a 20% -- maybe even 25% or 30% growth in the U.S. as a market overall. Are you guys seeing any of that? And then let's put your internal supply constraints or component shortages aside, when you look at the U.S. market, is there any validation or a potential you think that the overall U.S. market can actually grow 25% year-over-year in 2019 versus 2018? Let me let me specify that for residential and if you want to speak to commercial feel free.
Badri Kothandaraman: Yes, I mean, I'm going to talk on the residential space. And yes, I mean, look, what I said in the last conference call is that we could not ship more than $10 million of demand. And in the -- I said that in the Q3 conference call, and that number is a little bit higher for Q4. So basically, yes, there is a lot of demand out there and we are seeing a lot of demand because of our financial stability because of our strong balance sheet. Because IQ7 is the latest and greatest product that we have, our customer experience, our high quality. And so demand is strong and it is also probably the middle at this point in time and I expect the next two quarters like that, but I'm optimistic about Q3 and Q4.
Philip Shen: Great. On -- following up on that thought there, Badri, can you talk about Q1, and your official guide is $90 million to $95 million. I know you're sold out. I know you had internal constraints, but how much revenue do you think you're leaving on the table as it relates to Q1 specifically?
Badri Kothandaraman: So Phil, we are not going to break that out. I broke that out in Q3, because just to make sure that our top-line is starting to break out. Now, we are not going to get into the habit of breaking that out. But I’ll just tell you this, I mean, we feel really good, the demand is strong and what we feel bad is we are not -- I mean, we're still not servicing customers well in terms of deliveries, and we need to fix that. That's what I'm working on day and night. That's what our top priority is to not be internally focused, but to be focused on what customers want. And we need to do a lot more work there.
Philip Shen: Great. One last one for me on the competitive dynamics in Europe. I know we were just talking about Huawei more skewed to the U.S. but in Europe, they have been selling their products for some time. Can you talk about whether or not you're running into them at all as it relates to installers and customers is their storage product getting, like are you competing with them you think or do you feel like the demand -- overall market demand is so strong it's really not an issue. Would love to get your thoughts on that in Europe. Thanks.
Raghu Belur: Hey Phil, this is Raghu. Yes, we definitely see them in the market in Europe. We are competing with a very effectively, of course, in the markets that we are more active in Holland and Netherlands and in France and couple of other countries in that region. So we do run into them. But we clearly have been very effective there and doing well, given that in Q4, we had the highest megawatts shipped ever in Europe, both in terms of megawatts actually as well in terms of units. So I think it is -- Badri mentioned this earlier on, it's because we have a really well differentiated product, we do microinverters, we are string with or without optimizer, right. So I think the fact that it's a microinverter that is the highest performance and very high quality and reliability as well as the customer experiences itself including customer support in the work that we have done is what I think separating us from all the other string players that are out there, which obviously there's more than just Huawei. The other thing also is and we touched upon this earlier on the ACM, AC module is going to be very interesting in Europe. We are now actively engaged with a few partners that we’ll announce when we are ready and there is clear value to the -- value generation when installers have installed AC modules both in terms of the savings both on the logistics side as well as the installation time and quality of installation, training, inspection, et cetera. So all in all, we feel pretty -- we feel very good about Europe and it's shown in the numbers right like I said we did record numbers in Q4.
Philip Shen: Great, thanks Raghu and Badri. I'll pass it on.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Pavel Molchanov with Raymond James. Your line is now open.
Pavel Molchanov: Thank you for taking the question guys. Given the deleveraging that you've recently accomplished with a debt pay down and the cash flow that you'll likely generate in 2019. I'm curious if you're becoming more open to acquisition opportunities above and beyond what you've purchased from SunPower. I know that hasn't historically been the Enphase business model to do M&A but any changes on that front?
Eric Branderiz: Yes. So, the conversation about the strategic target is accretive short impact acquisitions similar to something like SunPower on different parts of the spaces more in line with the complimentary to assemble our position in the commercial sector are always part of the discussion here, right. The success on how we integrated paid for and we studying harvesting the benefit associated with the SunPower transaction put a high bar in terms of what we are trying to achieve, right. And we have cash, we feel very comfortable, but we want to be very careful on how we are going to go about spending it and targeting, trust me, Pavel, I mean, there will not be kind of big diversion to what we are trying to do for 2019 strategy or potentially decisions that we eventually will need to have a payback that extends beyond 18 months or maybe 2 years right. So that's kind of how we are seeing it.
Pavel Molchanov: Okay. And can we get a quick update on the tariff exemption process with relation to the AC modules? I know that's been kind of a work in progress for a while.
Badri Kothandaraman: Yes you can get an update and the update is that we have not heard back.
Pavel Molchanov: I can understand how that can be. All right, thanks guys.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Brad Meikle with Williams Trading. Your line is now open
Brad Meikle: Thanks. Just a follow-up. So you've spoken about one power MOFSET line that's running, another one that's coming up and as well as a couple of contracts I think from a supplier standpoint. So obviously implies a lot more demand out there and a lot more supply. Can you speak to your level of confidence that the demand is there and what -- I know you are not guiding on the second half, but just kind of what your demand visibility is for the second half? And just as part of the capacity ramp up also I wanted to know what portion you expect of U.S. demand to be from Guadalajara in the second and third quarter? Thank you.
Badri Kothandaraman: So Brad, so like what I -- I mean you already know we're not going to be talking about specific demand in the beyond Q1. But, having said that, our objective is to basically make sure we take all supply related problems off the table. That's what we would like to do. That is why I went and did in the last couple of months I went and take these additional two long term contracts. And you know, Guadalajara coming on is an interesting dynamic it doesn't change anything on the supply scenario. But it does one thing with the stream line inventory and cycle time to all our customers, which we think is important especially as we service the U.S. So if we do a good job in ramping, the Flex Mexico there's no reason why we cannot ship almost all of the North American demand from Mexico. Time will tell in terms of the quality of their plant, et cetera which we will have to see, but we are working towards that.
Brad Meikle: Thank you. And just last question is I guess solarquotes.com at EU and Australia reported of solar edge threatening to sue some of the customers around the failure rates being higher I guess unexpected in that region we've heard about it in the U.S. as well. Can you speak to whether you think that Enphase will benefit from market share shift away as a result. And just broadly speaking, what your feeling is in terms of your potential for market share again.
Badri Kothandaraman: So Brad, we’re not going to comment on the competition what their strategies, et cetera but like, I sound like a broken record what -- where we really our core strength are the product quality, superior customer experience, that is what we do, ease of use, high quality, high customer service. And so we will continue to offer that to customers. And if they pick us we are more than happy we need to solve this component shortages, we can start servicing them right.
Brad Meikle: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator instructions] I am not showing any further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the call back over Badri Kothandaraman for any further remarks.
Badri Kothandaraman: Yes, thank you for joining us today and for your continued support of Enphase. We look forward to speaking with you once again on our call next quarter.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude today’s program and you may all disconnect. Everyone have a wonderful day.

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Enphase Energy's Third Quarter 2018 Financial Results Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct the question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions] And as a reminder, this call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Christina Carrabino. Please go ahead.
Christina Carrabino: Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us on today's conference call to discuss Enphase Energy's third quarter 2018 results. On today's call are Badri Kothandaraman, Enphase's President and Chief Executive Officer; Eric Branderiz, Chief Financial Officer; and Raghu Belur, Chief Products Officer. After the market closed today, Enphase issued a press release announcing the results for its third quarter ended September 30, 2018. During this conference call, Enphase management will make forward-looking statements, including but not limited to, statements related to Enphase Energy's financial performance, market demands for its current and future products, advantages of its technology, and market trends. These forward-looking statements involve significant risks and uncertainties, and Enphase Energy's actual results and the timing of events could differ materially from these expectations. For a more complete discussion of the risks and uncertainties, please see the company's annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017, which is on file with the SEC, and the quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter, and nine months ended September 30, 2018, which will be filed with the SEC in the fourth quarter of 2018. Enphase Energy cautions you not to place any undue reliance on forward-looking statements, and undertakes no duty or obligation to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future events, or changes in its expectations. Also, please note that financial measures used on this call are expressed on a non-GAAP basis unless otherwise noted, and have been adjusted to exclude certain charges. The Company has provided a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures in its earnings release posted today, which can also be found in the Investor Relations section of its Web site. Now, I'd like to introduce Badri Kothandaraman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Enphase Energy. Badri?
Badri Kothandaraman: Good afternoon, and thanks for joining us today to discuss our third quarter of 2018 financial results. We reported revenue of $78 million for the third quarter. The customers continue to appreciate our differentiated products, quality, and service initiatives. Our strong balance sheet was instrumental in driving increased customer demand. Our biggest challenge in Q3 was meeting this additional demand. We experienced supply shortages that constrained our revenue by more than $10 million. For Q4, we are seeing strong demand and are fully booked already. We expect to be supply constrained in Q4 as well. Our non-GAAP gross margin in the third quarter was 32.8%, and our non-GAAP operating income was $7 million. We are pleased to report the fourth consecutive quarter of positive non-GAAP operating income. We have also made a lot of progress on transforming our balance sheet and improving the company's operations. We exited the third quarter with a cash balance of $116.2 million. Next, I will talk about 30-20-10. We introduced the concept of a 30-20-10 target financial model at our Analyst Day in June 2017, with a commitment to meeting it in Q4 of '18. 30-20-10 stands for 30% gross margin, 20% operating expense, and 10% operating income. We have now reported five consecutive quarters of improved financial performance, and are very close to realizing 30-20-10. Eric will go into greater detail about our financial results later in the call. An important focus item that we have discussed over the past few quarters is ease of doing business, how customers perceive us. Quality and customer service are the cornerstones of our top line growth, and our objective is to deliver exceptional customer experience. Our business processes are maturing, and we are prioritizing customer experience as number one in all aspects of our business, be it in product development or operations. During Q3, we continued to make several improvements in our customer contact center metrics and online support. Our Service-on-the-Go has now enabled majority of customer claims to be handled through self-service via mobile devices. A key customer experience metric we introduced last quarter was Net Promoter Score or NPS. This metric is calculated based on feedback from customer surveys on how likely customers are to recommend Enphase to a friend or colleague. Our customer service NPS was over 50% in Q3, versus 40% in Q2. We have made significant improvement with our customer service in the last four quarters, making it easier to do business with Enphase. Our target is to achieve an NPS of 60% or higher in 2019. Let's now talk about tariffs. We all know about the 201 tariffs on solar cells and modules. Many of our AC module partners are building factories in the U.S. to counter the tariffs. Also, we all know SunPower recently obtained an exemption from the 201 tariff. In summary, we see the barriers on AC module seem to be easing up, and their production is beginning to ramp. Let's now move on to 301 tariffs, which became effective late September, and their impact on Enphase microinverters and accessories. We expect to mitigate the 301 tariffs by sharing the cost increases with our customers and expanding our manufacturing agreement with Flex to include Mexico. Starting in Q2 of '19, Flex will begin delivering Enphase products produced in Mexico to the U.S. market. This additional line in Mexico will help Enphase not only to mitigate the tariffs, but also better serve our North American customers by cutting down cycle times and streamlining inventory at a similar manufacturing cost as China. Now, turning to our markets, our U.S. and international mix for Q3 was 65% and 35% respectively. Third quarter revenue in the U.S. was up 1% sequentially, and down 4% year-on-year. We ramped IQ7 shipments to our U.S. customers during the quarter, along with IQ7X, our microinverter compatible [ph] to 96-cell modules. In Europe, revenue was up 9% sequentially and 31% year-on-year. We entered the German and Austrian solar markets in Q2 with IQ7, and continue to develop the customer relationships in Q3. We maintained our market share lead in France, and were flat in Benelux and Switzerland compared to Q2. In APAC, the revenue was down 7% sequentially and up 18% year-on-year. The revenue decrease was due to channel inventory on our legacy microinverters. We expect to bleed out the excess inventory in the fourth quarter, and we also expanded our partnership with BayWa to distribute IQ7 microinverters across Southeast Asia. In Latin America, the third quarter revenue was up 33% sequentially and down 38% year-on-year. We experienced steady growth in Mexico during the quarter. Now that we are financially stable, a large portion of my time is spent on profitable top line growth. We plan to achieve this growth through differentiated products. Our four levers for profitable top line growth remain IQ7 regional expansion, high-power and high-performance products, AC modules, and Ensemble solar and storage technology. Of course, quality and customer experience remain cornerstones of this top line growth. The first lever for profitable top line growth is IQ7 regional expansion. We had a significant IQ7 ramp in Q3, and we expect to complete the transition in Q4. Approximately 78% of our microinverter shipments in Q3 were IQ7, up from 22% in Q2. As I mentioned earlier, we experienced supply shortages on high-voltage transistors in Q3. We expect this situation to continue in the fourth quarter, and have made appropriate investments to alleviate majority of the constraints in early 2019. The second lever for profitable top line growth is releasing high-power high-performance products. As you know, IQ7X is the highest power and highest efficiency variant of our seventh generation family of microinverters. The IQ7X product addresses 96-cell PV modules up to 400 watt DC, and with its 95% CEC efficiency is ideal for integration into AC modules. We plan to introduce a new product in the first quarter of 2019, IQ7A, which is even higher power than IQ7X, to address up to 450 watt DC modules. The benefit of our architecture is that it enables higher value to customers at lower incremental cost for us, thus improving our gross margins. The third lever for profitable top line growth is AC Modules or ACMs. Last week, we announced a strategic partnership with LONGi to develop Enphase energized LONGi ACMs based on IQ7. We expect these ACMs to be available in the U.S. starting in the fourth quarter of 2018. Enphase is now the exclusive model-level power electron supplier for SunPower's residential business in the U.S., and we anticipate volume shipments of IQ7X microinverters in the fourth quarter, and an acceleration of ramp throughout 2019. We expect to add $60 million to $70 million of annualized revenue from this acquisition in the second-half of 2019 at 33% to 35% non-GAAP gross margins. Both SunPower and LONGi joined leading module manufacturers such as Panasonic, Solaria, and LG, in developing Enphase Energized AC Modules. These integrated systems allow installers to be more competitive through capital management, reduced labor costs, and improved SKU [ph] management with accelerated design and installation. Since their release to installers in October of 2017, Enphase Energized ACMs from our module partners have been adapted by 330 installers in the U.S. Finally, a big catalyst for our profitable top line growth is on Ensemble solar and storage technology. The IQ8 system based upon our grid agnostic always on technology called Ensemble. This system has four components: energy generation, which is the grid agnostic microinverter, energy storage which is the Encharge battery with capacities of 3.3 kilowatt hour, 10 kilowatt hour, and 13.2 kilowatt hour, communication and control, which consists of the automatic transfer switch that provides fine grain load control, and the combiner box circuitry, and the fourth component is Enlighten which is the IoT cloud software. The IQ system with its sophisticated software capabilities can address use cases ranging from grid-tied to off-grid and any possible hybrid configuration in between. In addition, the grid agnostic feature of the microinverter can be turned on and off through software remotely. This is just one of the many software configurable options in the IQ8 system enabling a future service business within our install base. Consequently, the Ensemble technology enables Enphase to transition from a pure-play microinverter solar company to a complete energy management system's company, bringing about a substantial growth opportunity for us. We expect our revenue potential to increase from approximately $2,000 per home selling pure microinverter systems to over $10,000 per home selling complete energy management systems with Ensemble solar and storage technology. We anticipate introducing the grid agnostic IQ8 systems to customers in the first-half of 2019, and realize meaningful revenue by Q4 2019, while still adhering to 30-20-10. We also expect to release the pure off-grade microinverter solution in Q4 of '18 in limited quantities as we previously discussed. We have completed the necessary safety certification and the off-grid product is currently being field tested. In summary, our top priority is to improve profitability quarter-on-quarter, creating shareholder value. In the near-term, our focus is to optimize the supply chain to meet additional demand, unlocking our growth vectors, and providing outstanding customer experience. In the next few years, Ensemble represents the transformative opportunities for Enphase to increase our revenue manifold by providing a complete home energy management system. With that, I will turn the call over to Eric for his review of our financial results. Eric?
Eric Branderiz: Thanks, Badri. I will provide more details related to our third quarter 2018 financial results as well as our business outlook for the fourth quarter. As a reminder, the financial measures that I'm going to provide are on a non-GAAP basis, unless otherwise noted. We have provided reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures in our earnings release posted today, which also can be found in the Investor Relations section of our Web site. Total revenue for the third quarter of 2018 was $78 million, an increase of 3% sequentially, and an increase of 1% year-over-year. We shipped approximately 204 megawatts DC in the third quarter of 2018, an increase in megawatts of 1% sequentially, and a decrease of 12% from the year-ago quarter. The megawatts shipped represented about 665,000 microinverters, approximately 78% of which were IQ7. Non-inverter revenue, which includes our AC Battery Storage Solution and Envoy Communications Gateway and accessories increased as a percentage of revenue compared to our prior quarter. Non-GAAP gross margin for the third quarter of 2018 was 32.8%, compared to 30.5% for the second quarter. We are pleased with the continued progress that we have made expanding our gross margins. The increases reflect the targeted initiatives of our pricing management, transition to IQ7, and the $3.3 million milestone achievement from an IQ8 partner. We continue to be impacted by component shortages, which negatively affected our Q3 gross margin by approximately 2% due to expedite fees. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $18.6 million for the third quarter of 2018, compared to $19 million in Q2 and $16.9 million for the third quarter in 2017. GAAP operating expenses were $25.6 million for the third quarter of 2018, compared to $23.3 million in Q2, and $22.4 million for the third quarter of 2017. GAAP operating expenses for the third quarter included $3.7 million of stock-based compensation expenses, $2.6 million of restricting expenses, and approximately $700,000 of acquisition-related expenses and amortization. On a non-GAAP basis, income from operations was $7 million, compared to $4.1 million in Q2, and a loss of $102,000 in the year-ago quarter. This improvement in operating income for the year-ago quarter is reflective of our hard work and underscores our commitment of establishing a solid financial foundation. On a non-GAAP basis, net income was $4.6 million, resulting in basic earnings per share of $0.05 and diluted earnings per share of $0.04. Now turning to the balance sheet, inventory levels were $17.9 million for the third quarter, compared to $17.5 million in the second quarter, and $25.3 million in the year-ago quarter. We ended at 30 [ph] days of inventory on hand as of September 30, up from 30 days last quarter, and down from 38 days in the year-ago quarter. Inventory management remains one of our key cash management initiatives in 2018. We exited the quarter with a total cash balance of $116.2 million, compared to $58.5 million in Q2. The Q3 balance includes both net proceeds of approximately $62.7 million from a convertible debt offering, and a payment to SunPower of $50 million. We generated $6.8 million in cash flows from operations, as well as approximately $11.9 million in positive adjusted free cash flow. The $6.8 million in cash from operations in Q3 would have been $12.8 million as we allocated $6 million out of the $50 million payment to SunPower in operating cash flow for the acquired customer relationship intangible. Now, let's discuss our outlook for the fourth quarter of 2018. We expect our revenue for the fourth quarter of 2018 to be within our range of $80 million to $90 million. Turning to margins, we expect GAAP and non-GAAP gross margin to be within a range of 31% to 34%. Note that our Q4 gross margin guidance includes approximately 2% of higher expedite fees, resulting from industry-wide component shortages. We expect our GAAP operating expenses to be within a range of $25 million to $28 million, including a total of approximately $7.2 million or $50 million [ph] in stock-based compensation expenses, additional restructuring expenses, and acquisition-related expenses, and amortization. We expect non-GAAP operating expenses to be a range of $18.5 million to $20.5 million. With that, I will now open the line for questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Colin Rusch with Oppenheimer & Company. Your line is now open.
Colin Rusch: Thanks so much, guys. Can we break down that 10,000 per home opportunity. How much of that is energy storage and Ensemble? And then could you break it down between what's hardware and what's actually software and service type revenue?
Badri Kothandaraman: Yes, so Colin, today we ship a microinverter system that is roughly on the average $100. This includes a microinverter, the Envoy, the Combiner Box, the Cable, and usually there are 20 microinverters per home. So that makes it -- a microinverter system is about $2,000 per home. When we go to the home energy management system powered by Ensemble, we are now talking about additional storage, and then we are talking about an automatic transfer switch in addition to our usual Combiner Box, and we are talking about software. So if you think about it, let's say, for anything from eight to 10 kilowatt hour system, you are right, that the storage will be the $8,000, the storage plus ATS. And even then, we are only scratching the surface because the software component, like for example, the grid agnostic service capability will be available as software, which we are still thinking about it, but we are thinking of having a yearly software fee there, which can be rolled out through our IoT system via the cloud. So you're right, it's at least $10,000, and we expect to get more.
Colin Rusch: Okay. And then, just on the component shortage, obviously you guys are working through the issues on this, but how can we expect that to start flowing through over the next several quarters in terms of your ability to actually serve the revenue or the opportunity that you think you have in front of you with your customers?
Badri Kothandaraman: I mean, just stepping back and looking at it, the supply shortage is on the high-voltage transistors. These are the 600-volt transistors. They are complicated devices to make. The people who usually make this, I'm talking about the general suppliers who make it are a handful. They are basically STMicroelectronics, Infineon, Alpha & Omega Semiconductor, On Semi, Toshiba, these are the usual suspects. We have done our homework. We have three of these five suppliers on our AVL today. Despite that, those guys are facing unprecedented demand due to EV charging. So their demand exceeds the supply that they have. We recognized this problem about six to eight months ago. I invested money, creating a dedicated line for us to create capacity, and that line is coming on board in January of 2019. So I expect majority of my supply problems to be gone in Q1 of '19.
Colin Rusch: Okay. Thanks so much, guys. I'll hop into queue.
Badri Kothandaraman: All right, thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brad Meikle with Williams Trading. Your line is now open.
Brad Meikle: Hey, guys, thanks for the question. So just to follow-up on the power -- the line that you're brining on I guess is the power MOFSET line exclusively or could you talk more about how broad the shortages are, and what capacity you're bringing on. Thanks.
Badri Kothandaraman: Yes, I mean, to basically give you a color, we walked away from $10 million of demand in Q3, and at this point in time, we are fully booked for Q4 to the guidance that I gave you. And it is only early November right now. So obviously the demand is outstripping supply from our end. In terms of the investment with the supplier, I'm not going to provide too much of details, but all I can say is that we are switching to that supplier as our preferred supplier, and they basically have given us assured capacity. They are a very reputed, very reliable supplier, and we expect to -- you know, between that source and our existing other two sources, we expect to have more than the available demand that we need. So I expect the problem to be gone in Q1 of '19.
Brad Meikle: Okay. Could you elaborate at all in terms of whether it's generally within the industry -- specialty memory shortage as well or is it really the power MOFSETs, capacitors, passive components primarily?
Badri Kothandaraman: Yes. I mean, look, the power MOFSETs 600 volts is by far the biggest shortage. Yes, there are problems on MLCCs, everybody knows that, but we have been able to resolve that through spot buys. It's not pretty. It affects our gross margins by a couple of percent, as Eric said, but we are getting by there with the shortage of MLCCs, but the high-voltage transistor FET is an esoteric device. It's made only by the five suppliers I said, and therefore that's a little bit more complex, and like what I said, we believe we have put in the right actions six to eight months ago, and the capacity is coming onboard now. It is at the right time, and I think this should be behind us soon.
Brad Meikle: Okay, thanks. On a separate topic, can you talk about your being sold out for Q4, what's your visibility into the first quarter at this point, and could you share some thoughts generally on 2019 revenue growth and opportunities that you're looking at? Thanks.
Badri Kothandaraman: Well, we're not -- we don't give guidance normally for more than a quarter out, but in general, I'll give you some color on 2019, our four vectors for profitable growth they are turning on, you know, IQ7 is catching on, our balance sheet is very robust now, and that is enabling customers to come back to us, especially, you know, and you already know about the SunPower transaction, so that is going to add about $60 million to $70 million annualized in the second-half of '19. Then we have other relationships on the AC modules. On top of it, we are introducing high-power and high-performance products that are high gross margin as well. The biggest icing on the cake is Ensemble. Ensemble Solar and Storage is -- yes, of course new product development is always very complicated. You can hardly predict the exact timelines you're going to get, but if we are on track there, which we are right now, our revenue per home is going to increase by manifold, and that can be transformational for Enphase.
Brad Meikle: Thanks. And the second part of that was just around the first quarter. Do you think the supply problem gets better in the first quarter? Can you grow your amount shift base on that? And are you sold out in the first quarter already? What's your visibility into the quarter?
Badri Kothandaraman: Yes, I mean, like what I said, I'm not going to provide guidance for Q1 of '19, but like what I said, our balance sheet is robust, we really feel good, customers are coming back, demand is strong. I am fully booked already for Q, and this is only the beginning of November, I still have two more months if customers order, they are going to go to Q1 by default. So we feel good about Q1.
Brad Meikle: Thanks, Badri. And last question is just -- and thank you for the time. We've heard reports, you know, we do a lot of surveys and checks with installers, and a lot of discussions we've had indicate that the SolarEdge failure rates are in the 10% to 15% range as compared with, I think you're in the 0.2 % range, and this drives warranty reserves, and so it's created a lot of speculation on whether -- how appropriate warranty reserves are. So, is there a point where you can share what your failure rates are with us, so that we can back-in to those numbers more precisely?
Badri Kothandaraman: We are not going to be talking about competition, but I'll talk about our strategy. Our quality business process is something which I learned from my previous company, over the last 21 years, and that is based upon what is called as the Root Cause Corrective Action Methodology. And that is, you review your quality failures every week, you look at the root cause, you ask yourself five whys, you put in containment actions in place, you put in interim corrective actions, you then look at permanent corrective actions, and then you change the culture of the company so that everybody reacts to quality in the same way and it is number one priority. That's what we are trying to do here at Enphase. So my target personally is to get to 500 PPM. 500 PPM is 0.05%, if I'm doing the math. So that is my target, to get to 500 PPM, and we are working day and night to achieve that target. We have a great leader in place in quality, and like what I told you, we engage in root cause corrective action to fix the problems.
Brad Meikle: Excellent, thank you.
Badri Kothandaraman: Yes, thank you, Brad.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Eric Stine with Craig-Hallum. Your line is now open.
Eric Stine: Hi, everyone. Was just wondering on the guidance, the guide, the revenue range wider than normal, and so just curious, I mean is that in place -- is it all component shortages, or are there some other factors that are driving that it's a $10 million range?
Badri Kothandaraman: That's a good question. I deliberately did this because our supply situation is a little bit like what I told you, we are short of supply. We are getting good news every day. Sometimes we get some bad news everyday. So we thought we should guide to the right range for you, and I felt that range was $80 million to $90 million.
Eric Stine: Okay. And then, in terms of the 30-20-10, just doing the quick math, it looks like a little bit -- the midpoint or a little bit above on revenues would get you to that 10% level for op margins. I mean below the revenue line, can you just talk about some of the puts and takes that get you to the high-end of that range?
Badri Kothandaraman: I mean you're right. That's exactly how we are thinking about it too, you know, the gross margin around that range, 32.5 is the midpoint of guidance, and the OpEx in the midpoint of guidance gets us to 30-20-10, and the way I want you guys to think about 30-20-10 is that's our target operating model, and sometimes we maybe -- sometimes we'll overshoot gross margin, sometimes we'll undershoot gross margin. Then you should really go by the guidance there, but that's our model. That's what we are sticking to. In terms of our OpEx, for example, we are restructuring the company to achieve 20% OpEx, what does that mean, right. As customers come back to us, we have a strong balance sheet; customers are coming back to us. We are starting to grow top line. We're starting to invest in Ensemble. We don't want to -- I mean, we want still be very careful on OpEx, which is why we have made the decision to have the right people at the right places, and therefore, we are shifting majority of execution teams to India and New Zealand to control costs, while we will add selected strategic talent in the U.S., India and New Zealand will be a massive base for us in terms of controlling the OpEx. So that's why we are confident that 20% OpEx model is the right long-term model for us. So that explains to you 30-20-10.
Eric Stine: Yes. Okay, thanks for that. And then last one, just for Eric, just to clarify, I missed it, the milestone payment in the third quarter, the amount that that was, and then is that something that you expect to get as well, a third milestone payment in the fourth?
Eric Branderiz: Yes, and it will be 700k.
Eric Stine: Okay. And what was -- I'm sorry; what was the 3Q number?
Eric Branderiz: The 3Q, 3.3.
Eric Stine: Okay, thank you.
Eric Branderiz: You're welcome.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Philip Shen with ROTH Capital Partners. Your line is now open.
Philip Shen: Hi, everyone. Thanks for the questions. So, first one is on pricing. Can you talk about how much you may be passing pricing on -- how much higher is pricing in Q4 in the U.S, and then how much do you expect to raise price in Q1?
Badri Kothandaraman: So, Phil, with regarding the tariffs, you know that we had the 10% tariff, 301 tariffs effective September 24, and basically, what we communicated to our customers is we will absorb a portion of that while we will pass on a portion of that. So, roughly that is actually equal, so average about 3% to 4% price increases to customers in Q4. Q1, we don't yet have visibility whether the tariff is going to be a 25% tariff or not. So, in the event, it is 25%, our strategy will be very similar. We will share the cost increases with our customers.
Philip Shen: Okay, great. And then, as it relates to the SunPower volume, you made it very clear what the revenue contribution can be in the back-half of next year, but to what degree -- how much ACM volume could you see in Q4 of this year, and also in Q1? My sense is your volumes might be ramping up decently, is it possible to share what kind of mix ACM for SunPower might be in Q4 and/or Q1? Thanks.
Badri Kothandaraman: Yes, in Q4 we are starting to ramp. We expect volume shipments in Q4. Q1 will be a really nice ramp. I expect to get most of it in Q1, and we should complete the ramp by Q2.
Philip Shen: Okay, great. And then, as it relates to -- and I know you can't provide guidance, but in the event that we have a 25% tariff on the 301, and in the event that you raised pricing in a way that you talked about, suffice to say, do you expect margins to be roughly in line with what you are experiencing now? Is there some degree of maybe even upside with the price increases, but if you can talk about the Q1 margin might look like or even the cadence as we go by quarter throughout '19, that would be really helpful. Thanks, Badri.
Badri Kothandaraman: Yes. Okay, thank you, Phil. So we don't guide to our gross margins in Q1, but I will give you some color. In general, we're making a lot of progress on gross margin. We are working on costs day and night. We are working on the architectural innovation. We are working on accessories, dropping out overhead. In addition, as we transition to higher-power higher-performance products, our gross margin is naturally better. So we actually feel good about gross margins in Q1. And like what I said, this is the solar industry, we have 201, we have 301, I'm not sure what comes next. So obviously we are cautious, but we really feel good about gross margins.
Philip Shen: Okay, good. That's great color. And then finally, in terms of that partner for IQ8, can you give us a little bit more information on that. I know you introduced it last quarter. When do you expect commercial business to come from this partner? Can you share more about this partner, in what country this partner might be based in, and then beyond them, are there opportunities similar to them that could be in the near-term, call it, the next six months to one year that could be supportive as well? Thanks.
Badri Kothandaraman: Right, while we cannot give too many details, the opportunities are outside the U.S., that is one. And the partner is currently doing field trials with our off-grid version product, and we have completed all the safety certifications. So we do expect a ramp in the first-half of 2019, yes, as I said. And with regarding other opportunities, yes, we are bullish about other opportunities, especially in regions like where I am from. In my hometown, in my city, there is no power for eight hours a day in summer. I mean, those are the places where it can actually really help. Off-grid solar and storage will be a game-changer for India as well. And granted, we need to work with the partner there too, I mean the opportunities are big there.
Philip Shen: Great. And then, one last follow-up on that, in terms of the ramp in the first-half next year, can you quantify that in any way, are we talking about tens of millions or single millions?
Badri Kothandaraman: I cannot quantify it yet, Phil, no.
Philip Shen: Okay, great. Thanks for all the color, Badri. I'll pass it on.
Badri Kothandaraman: Yes, thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Carter Driscoll with B. Riley FBR. Your line is now open.
Carter Driscoll: Good afternoon, gentlemen. So, of the 10 million that you think you couldn't satisfy this quarter, do you think that was a lost opportunity went to competitors? Could it have been pushed out? And then at all if you could qualify -- if so, maybe the mix of customers that were not able to be satisfied with that either regionally or by type?
Badri Kothandaraman: Yes, I mean, the $10 million was evenly spread between both long tail [ph] as well as the Tier 1 customers. They're going nowhere, they are going to stick with us, and we are going to service them in Q4.
Carter Driscoll: Okay. Okay, excellent. Can you talk about -- if could quantify the kind of tariff mitigation impact from Flex in 2Q relative to your pricing strategy in 4Q and 1Q, I mean do you anticipate you would be able to lower your prices in response to having Flex up and running, or would that be an incremental margin add?
Badri Kothandaraman: Well, first, I will answer the question on Flex. Basically we expect the Flex capacity to come on board in Q2 of '19. In Q2, we expect to service 50% of the North American demand from Mexico. In Q3, we expect that 50% to go to 90%. We've already put the additional capacity in terms of -- capital we've already invested the capital for that. With regarding your question on pricing, we're going to look at the pricing environment at the point in time and we will make a decision that is right for our customers.
Carter Driscoll: Okay. I guess you talked about when you were not in a stronger financial position just a couple years ago that relationships with the Tier 1 installers was more transactional. Would you characterize it as moving towards more of a relationship, or have you achieved any of those longer-term relationships or solidified them, is that a fair statement now or would that be still an unfolding process?
Badri Kothandaraman: I would say, it's work in progress, and the reason I say work in progress is we have started the discussions what the Tier 1 love is the Ensemble product. The Ensemble Solar and Storage is a game-changer for anybody. It provides the clear value proposition, AC marketplace, a complete solar and storage solution, grid agnostic solution, and that is difficult to get from anybody else in such an elegant form. So the discussions with Tier 1s are progressing very well, and we'll announce more when we are ready.
Carter Driscoll: Okay. I mean, just two quick ones, you see anyone anywhere close to maybe not with an integrated level, but offering something similar to Ensemble at this point, or next quarter or two, even if they're trying to cobble something together?
Raghu Belur: This is Raghu. We cannot say for sure, but if you look at architecturally how we are building our -- we are -- it's microinverter-based, heavy on semiconductors, and leveraging Moore's Law, and all of it is built around like I said a custom ASIC, which is a 55-nanometer technology with an ARM core embedded in each one of those ASICs. So, it uses -- it's a very high-speed architecture that performs very complex computations, and manages this AC bus or this AC marketplace at an extremely high rate. So architecturally, we don't know, but I think it's going to be challenging for the string inverters. However, as we get the product out into the marketplace, I think we'll know more. I just wanted to say that our architecture is quite unique, and it's built around semis and software, and I think that gives us some very unique capabilities that we're leveraging to release the Ensemble technology.
Carter Driscoll: Okay. Thank you, Raghu. And then just last one, is any noticeable incremental spend in S&M for rollout of Ensemble? Just because you're going to different geographies or there's different tape-outs you know, get product -- early product to some customers, or just trying to get a sense of what that might be OpEx line.
Badri Kothandaraman: Well, in general, we are adding more sales and marketing heavy hitters across the board, and that is true in general, because as we grow our top line, as we introduce complicated products like Ensemble, it is more of a solution sell. It's more of a technical sell. So we are adding heavy hitters there. I expect we will continue to add incremental talent in the sales and marketing side, but you still need to think about a long-term OpEx model at 20%.
Carter Driscoll: Yes. Excellent. Okay, I think I'll stop on. Thanks, gentlemen.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Amit Dayal with H.C. Wainwright. Amit Dayal, your line is now open. If your line is on mute, can you please un-mute your line? Our next question comes from the line of Pavel Molchanov with Raymond James. Your line is now open.
Pavel Molchanov: Thanks for taking my question, guys. You referenced the SunPower exemption for the 201, and my understanding is there are some additional rounds of exemptions that have yet to be granted. Is there any sense of, you know, what has been the reason why yours has not been processed to-date, is it just administrative slowness or is there something substantive that has been impeding the process?
Badri Kothandaraman: We don't know this, Pavel, so we don't have an answer.
Pavel Molchanov: Okay. Any guidance on when you're anticipating or when you're being told this process will run its course?
Badri Kothandaraman: Well, we have talked [ph] expecting something, but on the other end, the way we have sidestepping this problem is by engaging -- I mean the partners are actually building factories in the U.S. So we are sidestepping this problem, and I think it's not a big deal for us in the long-term.
Pavel Molchanov: Okay, I hear you. Let me ask a quick one about the battery. You've been selling the kind of first-generation battery product I think for about two years now. With those sales having moved I imagine fairly slowly, what are the learnings or lessons that you've gleaned that will influence how you're going to go about selling this integrated solution going forward?
Badri Kothandaraman: Yes, it's pretty simple. We have shipped over 25 megawatt hours till date on the ACB 1.0. The main target markets have been Europe as well as Australia. So let me let me tell you the good, it's an Enphase system, so you can expect the high quality and easy installation. It is also very highly modeler. It can be scaled very easily. If you want to build a 3 kilowatt hour system, you have to buy three of those, string it together, you're done. On the other hand, the negatives are two. One is we're being told that although we do value-based pricing, our prices are high. That's one. Number two is it doesn't support backup. And I'll add a third one; the capacity of that system is quite low. So we're solving all of these problems, and we are basically building 10 kilowatt hour system and 13.2 kilowatt hour system, while still keeping the modularity of 3.3 kilowatt hour building blocks. That's what we're doing right now.
Pavel Molchanov: All right, I appreciate the color, guys.
Badri Kothandaraman: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back to Badri Kothandaraman for closing remarks.
Badri Kothandaraman: Hi, thank you for joining us today and for your continued support of Enphase. I look forward to speaking with you again on our call next quarter.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude today's program. You may all disconnect. Everyone have a great day.

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the Enphase Energy's Second Quarter 2018 Financial Results Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time [Operator Instructions]. And as a reminder, this conference call may be recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Christina Carrabino. You may begin.
Christina Carrabino: Good afternoon and thank you for joining us on today's conference call to discuss Enphase Energy's second quarter 2018 results. On today's call are Badri Kothandaraman, Enphase's President and Chief Executive Officer; Eric Branderiz, Chief Financial Officer; and Raghu Belur, Chief Products Officer. After the market closed today, Enphase issued a press release announcing the results for its second quarter ended June 30, 2018. During the course of this conference call, Enphase management will make forward-looking statements, including but not limited to, statements related to Enphase Energy's financial performance, market demands for its current and future products, advantages of its technology and market trends. These forward-looking statements involve significant risks and uncertainties, and Enphase Energy's actual results and the timing of events could differ materially from these expectations. For a more complete discussion of the risks and uncertainties, please see the Company's annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017, which is on file with the SEC and the quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter and six months ended June 30, 2018, which will be filed with the SEC in the third quarter of 2018. Enphase Energy cautions you not to replace any undue reliance on forward-looking statements, and undertakes no duty or obligation to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future events or changes in its expectations. Also, please note that financial measures used on this call are expressed on a non-GAAP basis unless otherwise noted, and have been adjusted to exclude certain charges. The Company has provided a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures in its earnings release posted today, which can also be found in the Investor Relations section of its website. Now I'd like to introduce Badri Kothandaraman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Enphase Energy. Badri?
Badri Kothandaraman: Good afternoon and thanks for joining us today to discuss our second quarter of 2018 financial results. We had a reasonable quarter. We reported revenue of $75.9 million for the second quarter of 2018 at the midrange of guidance. Our non-GAAP gross margin in the second quarter was 30.5%, surpassing the higher end of guidance. Our non-GAAP operating income was $4.1 million and we are pleased to report the third consecutive quarter of positive non-GAAP operating income. During the second quarter, we continued to make progress on strengthening the balance sheet and improving the company's operations. Turning to the balance sheet, we exited the second quarter with a cash balance of $58.5 million. Our sharpened focus on improving AR, AP and inventory management in Q2 resulted in approximately $3.6 million of positive free cash flow. We are pleased that we reached our gross margin model two quarters ahead of our plan. We are making good overall progress on reaching our 30-20-10 target operating model by the fourth quarter of 2018. Eric will go into greater detail about our financial results later in the call. An important focus in our business that we discussed last quarter is what we call the ease of doing business. How customers perceive us. During the second quarter we significantly improved our customer contact center and online support. The contact center improvement resulted in a six-fold decrease in the average wait time in the second quarter as compared to the first quarter of this year. Our customer wait times were down to less than two minutes on average. We have also improved our self service support tools to help installers and homeowners. Last month we launched Service-on-the-Go which installers can use from their mobile device to get service instantly. Now 65% of our customers are using self-service tools to get warranty support saving about 10 minutes per case by not having to call Enphase's customer service. We will also be launching a chat function from our website this quarter which will be another timesaver for our customers. As part of our efforts to improve customer experience, we are rolling out an upgrade program for our legacy microinverter products. During the second half of 2018 Enphase will offer a targeted program for homeowners who purchased our first and second generation microinverter products by providing these early adopters with upgrade choices to the latest generation of products. We know these customers were instrumental in enabling Enphase to ramp in its early days. We appreciate their loyalty and would like to offer them update options. We have piloted this program to homeowners located in the Northeastern U.S. and will be rolling it out to homeowners throughout North America during the remainder of 2018 and into 2019. We will be discussing our customers' experience, initiatives in more detail at our Analyst Day on August 16 and I will also continue to provide updates every quarter. As a key customer experience metric we introduced last quarter was a net promoter score or NPS. NPS is calculated based on feedback from customer surveys on how likely they are to recommend Enphase to a friend or colleague. To be completely candid, we were not doing a good job of servicing our customers a year ago, but that has changed. Our NPS has improved dramatically in just three quarters. We view it as evidence of our progress towards embracing a customer experience focus culture. We are making it easier to do business with Enphase, significantly reducing cost of ownership and using outstanding customer service as a competitive differentiator. Now turning to our markets, the second quarter revenue in the U.S. was up 9% sequentially and down 6% year-on-year. We continue to ramp IQ 7 shipments to our U.S. customers during the quarter along with shipments of IQ 7X our microinverter compatible with 96-cell modules. In Europe the revenue was up 12% sequentially and 30% year-on-year. We announced the introduction of IQ 7 in Europe during the second quarter. This represents Enphase's entry into the German and Austrian solar markets while expanding its presence in other solar markets such as France, Benelux, UK and Switzerland. We maintained our market share lead in France during the second quarter and grew market share in the UK, Benelux and Switzerland. In APAC, revenue was down 13% sequentially and up 46% year-on-year. We introduced IQ 7 in Australia and New Zealand during the second quarter along with Enphase IQ microinverters across India. In Latin America the second quarter revenue was down 6% sequentially and 42% year-on-year. There have been delays associated with Puerto Rico recovery after the devastating hurricanes and we look forward to introducing our IQ 8 system solutions based on our always on Ensemble technology to the region in 2019. So finally, our U.S. and international mix for Q2 was 62% and 38% respectively. Now that our balance sheet and progress towards 30-20-10 operating model are on track we are increasing our focus on profitable topline growth. In 2017 we walked away from low margin businesses, focused on operational excellence and cost control. In January 2018 we launched the topline business process to grow both organically and profitably. We expect the results of this business process to bear fruit in the fourth quarter of this year throughout 2019 and further beyond. We plan to achieve this through innovation and delivering value-added products to our customers. The four levers for profitable topline growth are IQ 7 regional expansion, IQ 7X for 96-cell modules, AC modules, and IQ 8 Ensemble. Of course providing the best possible customer experience is the bedrock of such growth. The first lever for profitable topline growth is IQ 7 regional expansion. In Q2 we introduced IQ 7 to more regions around the world. Approximately 22% of our microinverter shipments in Q2 were IQ 7 up from 8% in Q1. We expect to have a much more significant ramp in Q3 and complete the transition in Q4. We are still experiencing worldwide component shortages in our IQ 7 rollout on transistors, capacitors, and resistors. We continue to work diligently to resolve these issues at both a tactical and strategic level. The second lever for profitable topline growth is our IQ 7X which is the highest power and highest efficiency variant of our 7 generation family of microinverters. As I mentioned, we started shipping our IQ 7X microinverters to our U.S. customers during the second quarter. The IQ 7X product addresses 96-cell modules up to 400 W and with a 97.5% CEC efficiency is ideal for integration into AC modules. We will introduce IQ 7X to rest of the world later this year. The third lever for profitable topline growth is AC modules. In June, we announced a definitive agreement to acquire SunPower's microinverter business for $25 million in cash and $7.5 million shares of Enphase common stock. Enphase will become the exclusive microinverter supplier for SunPower's residential business in the U.S. Enphase's IQ 7X microinverter was designed specifically for SunPower X series 96-cell modules. This transaction is expected to close by the end of the third quarter of 2018 followed by initial IQ shipments in the fourth quarter. We expect to add $60 million to $70 million of annualized revenue from this acquisition in the second half of 2019 at 33% to 35% non-GAAP gross margin. In April 2018, we announced a strategic partnership with Solaria Corporation for the introduction of an Enphase Energized IQ 7+ AC Module, the 355W Solaria PowerXT-AC. Solaria is already shipping these AC modules to distributors. Earlier this year we also announced a partnership with Panasonic to integrate IQ 7X into Panasonic's 330W HIT module. Just to remind everyone, we announced ACM partnership last year with LG Electronics and JinkoSolar. Based on interviews from installers Enphase Energized AC modules allow installers to be more competitive through significant savings on installation time, logistics, training, and inspections when compared to discrete inverter solutions. Finally, a big catalyst for our profitable topline growth is our next-generation IQ 8 system solution. IQ 8 is based upon our grid independent "always on" technology called Ensemble that has the capability to transform our future by creating new market opportunities. As we have previously discussed, one of solar's biggest challenges is that it is grid tied. What this means is that if the grid fails and the sun is still shining there will be no production out of your solar system. With IQ 8 system you have a solution that will continuously provide energy regardless of the presence or absence of the grid that is solar during the day and storage at night. This is what we refer to as "always on". We have been working with a partner under a joint development agreement to customize IQ 8 for their off grid applications under which we earned $2 million of revenue in Q2 for product milestones that we completed. We expect to earn an additional $4 million as we complete subsequent milestones over the next two quarters. We are on track to introduce IQ 8 off grid system in Q4 2018 followed by grid independent IQ 8 system solutions in 2019. We continue to validate the IQ 8 systems solutions with our customers and are receiving very positive feedback. Our product development progress has been significant and we will be discussing the IQ 8 system and our Ensemble technology in detail at our upcoming Analyst Day on August 16. In summary, we are pleased with our overall progress during the first six months of 2018. The discipline we apply to gross margin improvement is now also being applied to drive profitable topline growth and improve the customer experience. Before I turn the call over to Eric, I'd like to make some general remarks. Last week we were attacked by a short seller who accused us of fudging the books. We did not respond, but to be honest this news aggravated and enraged us as the remarks were baseless and wrong. I want to say a few worlds on our core values as a company. We hold ourselves to the highest standards of ethics and integrity. We tell the truth and don’t tolerate excuses and the only thing we value is data, logic and reason. Last year McKenzie came in taught us how to work on costs. This literally involved working on hundreds of little things to improve the company. Just to show you every cent we take out of cost is important. A few extreme examples to show the extent of how we think and manage our, yes, for example we've spent a lot of time optimizing the labels and manuals on the microinverter to save pennies. We've spent tons of time in minimizing and squeezing every square millimeter of PCB space for the microinverters. We spent a lot of time eliminating components such as resistors and capacitors even if it means a fraction of a cent at a time. I am proud to have an incredible group of people who have worked very hard and turned this company around. We are laser focused on our number one priority, improve profitability quarter-on-quarter and creating further shareholder value. With that, I will turn the call over to Eric for his review of our financial results.
Eric Branderiz: Thanks Badri. I will provide more details related to our second quarter 2018 financial results as well as our business outlook for the third quarter. As a reminder, the financial measures that I'm going to provide are on a non-GAAP basis unless otherwise noted. We have provided a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures in our earnings release profit today which can be found in the investor relations section of our website. As Badri mentioned, total revenue for the second quarter of 2018 was $75.9 million, an increase of 8% sequentially and an increase of 2% year-over-year. Total net revenue per DC Watt decreased by 4.4% from the first quarter of 2018 largely because of changes in product mix. We shift approximately 203 MW DC in the second quarter of 2018 and increasing megawatts of 13% sequentially and a decrease of 9% for the year ago quarter. The megawatt shipped represent 675,000 micro inverters, approximately 72% of which were our IQ microinverter systems. Non-inverter revenue which includes our AC battery storage solution Envoy, Communications Gateway, and all accessories decreased as a percentage of revenue compared to our prior quarter results. Non-GAAP gross margin for the second quarter of 2018 was 30.5% compared to 26.5% for the first quarter. We are very pleased with the continued progress we have made expanding our gross margins. The increases reflect the targeted initiatives of our pricing management, supply chain optimization, transition to IQ 7 and the IQ 8 milestone payment. I will note that we continue to be impacted by component shortages which negatively affected our Q2 gross margin by approximately 1% to 2%. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $19 million for the second quarter of 2018 compared to $17.7 million in Q1. As compared to the second quarter of 2017, non-GAAP operating expenses increased by 7% or $1.2 million. The increase in operating expense is primarily due to our discretionary quarterly bonus that Enphase employees have earned. On a non-GAAP basis, income from operations was $4.1 million compared to $861,000 0in Q1 and a loss of $4 million in the year ago quarter. This improvement in operating income is reflective of our hard work over the past year and underscores our commitment to us establishing a solid financial foundation. Now turning to the balance sheet, inventory levels were $17.5 million for the second quarter at the lowest point since 2014 compared to $18.5 million in the first quarter and $20.8 million in the year ago quarter. We ended at our target of 30 days of inventory on hand as of June 30 down from 32 days last quarter and down from 31 days in the year ago quarter. As Badri mentioned, inventory management remains one of the key management initiatives cash management initiatives in 2018. We exited the quarter with a total cash balance of $58.5 million compared with $53.3 million in Q1. During the quarter we generated $4.1 million in cash from operations as well as approximately $3.6 million in positive free cash flow. Now let's discuss our outlook for the third quarter of 2018. We expect our revenue for the third quarter of 2018 to be within our range of $76 million to $82 million. Turning to margins we expect GAAP and non-GAAP gross margin to be within a range of 30% to 33%. Note that our Q3 gross margin guidance includes 1% to 2% of higher expedite fees resulting for industry-wide component shortages. We expect our non-GAAP operating expense for the third quarter to be within a range of $18 million to $19 million and GAAP operating expense to be within our range of $22 million to $23 million including an estimated $4 million of stock based compensation expense. With that, I will now open the line for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Brad Meikle of Williams Research. Your line is now open.
Brad Meikle: Hi guys, good afternoon. Could I ask about what you're seeing in the second half demand trends over, you know for fourth quarter how the seasonality works and just to touch on the gross margins obviously you revised up your gross margin target for the year. Do you think that gross margins will trend higher in the fourth quarter also? Thanks and I have one follow up.
Badri Kothandaraman: Okay, so let me tell you how we think about market share in topline. So our top priority in 2017 was to build a solid financial foundation and we basically, we walked away from low margin businesses. We focused on operational excellence and we transformed the company. Since January 2018 we started focusing on topline. And like what I said we have very tangible vectors, four vectors for profitable topline growth and they are the IQ 7 regional expansion, the IQ 7X which basically means higher power modules, of ACM partnership starting with SunPower and IQ 8 which we will introduce in Q4 of 2018. So we are really excited about our topline growth initiatives and while we cannot guide what Q4 will be, we definitely look forward to a healthy Q4 in terms of topline. So Brad, what was the other question, it was gross margins?
Brad Meikle: The other was on the margin side, so with your IQ 7 going to 100% by the end of the year, and that being a lower cost product than the IQ 6, should we assume that gross margins will trend higher in the fourth quarter compared to third quarter?
Badri Kothandaraman: Yes, well, I mean we are very happy that we reached our gross margin target two quarters earlier than scheduled and it was possible because of strong pricing management, great supply chain optimization and the new product transition. And you know, right now we are very comfortable with where we are. We are guiding to 30% to 33% in Q3 of 18 and you know about solar industry every day I see the news I see it better and we are working on all possible ways to mitigate the tariffs. The numbers are included, I mean I gave you includes the impact of the tariff. So we are very comfortable with the 30% to 33%. We are not guiding any numbers for the fourth quarter right now.
Brad Meikle: Thank you. And one question for Eric, Eric would it be possible to touch on just the 605, 606 accounting change and the 6.3 reduction of deferred revenues. I guess the question is, was that just a balance sheet item or did that every flow through the income statement? Was it recognized as revenues? And then just the second part of the accounting question is, could you talk about how you guys improve warranties and why that has trended down over time? Thank you.
Eric Branderiz: Sure, I'm going to answer the first and question and then Badri will take on the warranty one, because, yes, there is actually there is a lot of business considerations there that want the audience to understand, but in terms of the question about the deferred revenue, you can see that in fact there is a new accounting pronouncement that the company abides to, every company abides to, which basically we recorded in the company journal entry as of January 1, 2018 in compliance to the particular pronouncement which is basically 606 the famous ASC 606 known in the industry which in fact revenue recognition but actually have an impact on the balance sheet as well. So these transactions that we booked basically the $6.4 million that you referred to did not impact the P&L nor cash. So it's a purely balance sheet transaction where we took the, what we call it an invoice receivable balance which is an asset seen on the books and against that, we offset it against the deferred revenue account on the books and very close on the balance sheet and then one with each other offset basically creates a neutral impact on the P&L on cash flows. I hope that answer helps you is, in compliance, every company that has these type of accounting needs to comply with this treatment.
Badri Kothandaraman: Okay, Brad with regarding the warranty basically let me start off by saying one thing, is any comparison of failure rates and between string inverters and microinverters need to be done really carefully because microinverters have a fundamental architectural advantage. It is well known that string inverters have a single point of failure and microinverters do not. Having said that our warranty liability is calculated using multiple inputs and the methodology is described in our audited financial statements. The inputs to our warranty calculation include units by product type and architecture sold in each period estimated failure rate, cost of the replacement units, estimated labor cost associated with replacing a unit and discount rates. The warranty expense recognized in a given period includes our estimated future warranty obligations of the units sold based upon the above inputs that I said, plus any accretion of interest expense on the liability that is recorded at fair value and any adjustments that result from prior failure rates. And we have been driving down warranty expenses due to the three main reasons. One, our products have significantly improved in failure rate from one generation to the next. For example, our current generation products have 10x improvement and reliability compared to our legacy first and second generation microinverter products. These improvements in reliability are enabled by every generation. We have a 6% to 10% component reduction as compared to the previous generation which is possible due to ASIC integration aided by Moore's law. For example, the 7 generation product IQ 7 it uses an ASIC with 3.8 million gates manufactured in 55 nanometer technology at TSMC. The semiconductor integration methodology has helped us in driving down failure rates of every generation because simply there are less number of components. In addition, the intrinsic fast and nanosecond response times of the ASIC have helped us in detecting abnormal grid conditions much more efficiently avoiding inverter damage, that is one. The second one is Enphase’s over the add firmware update technology allows microinverters to be continuously upgraded in the field to incorporate state-of-the-art best practices from the factory, and therefore being enabled to further improve the reliability of our inverters over time. The third is the cost of the replacement microinverters are also being continuously driven down because the replacement for even for the prior generation failures will come from the latest generation of products such as IQ, so that's the holistic answer to your warranty question Brad.
Brad Meikle: Thanks. I guess just one followup would be is it possible to get any qualitative or quantitative, there's a lot of back and forth in terms of what the failure rates are there for micros versus strengths is there anything you can point to for better data on that?
Badri Kothandaraman: No, right now we're not providing the data, but it is something that we can provide like a white paper that would be helpful for the future.
Brad Meikle: Excellent. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Amit Dayal of H.C. Wainwright. Your line is now open.
Amit Dayal: Thank you. Good afternoon guys. In terms of the IQ 7 are you now launched in all the key markets?
Badri Kothandaraman: Yes, we are now launched in all the key markets. We introduced IQ 7 in rest of the world in Q2.
Amit Dayal: So this was 22% this quarter, where do you anticipate this will be by the end of the year?
Badri Kothandaraman: I would be disappointed if we get, if we don’t get more than 65% in Q3.
Amit Dayal: Understood. And in terms of this IQ 8 milestone payment, could you talk a little bit about whether we are expecting more payments on a similar nature from other partners?
Badri Kothandaraman: Okay, I’ll talk about the IQ 8 milestone payment. So in short we are working with a partner to customize IQ 8 solutions for upgrade application. We earned about $2 million of revenue in Q2 2018 for the completion of project milestones. Our guidance for Q3 includes a $2 million of milestone payments that will be earned for the future milestones and we have a total of $6 million and we recognized already 2 in Q2. We expect to recognize the remaining 4 over the next two quarters. And with your question on are there more customers coming? The answer is right now is we’re not going to be discussing any specific customers, but yes there is a lot of interest from many customers including very key customers in North America on how to customize Ensemble for their needs. That will be a major topic for us to discuss on the Analyst Day.
Amit Dayal: Thank you for that. Badri, you've talked about some component shortages, how has this been impacting sort of your supply chain initiatives, et cetera?
Badri Kothandaraman: Yes, component shortages is a very long story. We have been experiencing component shortages for the last year, while in the last year the focus, I mean the component shortages were on high voltage transistors and memories and right now the component shortages we are facing are on the same high voltage transistors in addition capacitors have been added to the mix, resistors have been added to the mix. So it’s a world-wide component shortage and it is wide spread in the industry. So what are we doing about it? One is, in the short term we have no choice but to expedite material. So what does that mean? It is, we basically expedite raw material to the factory, plus we also expedite finished goods which is microinverters instead of being shipped on the boat, we spend a lot of money at shipping the microinverters to the U.S. and that we told you is an impact of 1% to 2% gross margin. So we continue, I mean we expect the same impact in Q3. If you ask me what is my long-term thinking there, I mean in the medium term, my - what we can do is to change our design to be a little bit more flexible, but we can’t really do that for capacitors or resistors, for there our best bet is to quality a lot of suppliers which is what we are doing right now. While long term what we are trying to do is, since we’re in a much healthier position right now, we are establishing long-term supply contracts with a lot of our key suppliers, we have already signed one for the transistor suppliers which will kick in from 2019 and I’m hoping that this problem will go away from the middle of 2019.
Amit Dayal: Understood. Just last one from me on your new service customer support and service related initiatives, are all these improvements adding to the cost side of the equation and this Service-on-the-Go feature that you highlighted in the press release, is it being rolled out in all markets or is it just pilot levels or execution at this point?
Badri Kothandaraman: The Service-on-the-Go is being rolled to all regions and we want everybody to be using self-service. I mean what we found in the last four quarters is people call us for a lot of reasons like for example they want to return a microinverter, they basically call us and they spent valuable time, their time which is valuable on the phone talking to us. Now with a few clicks on your phone you can make that entire process seamless and we want to provide customers that option. So basically, we expect virtually 100% of our returns to be processed through that half pretty soon. It's not yesterday, like what I said 65% of the returns are being processed by that app, but very soon we expect a big improvement there. Our goal is to basically make sure everything is self-service, so that there is no need to basically call us, okay.
Amit Dayal: And there is no additional cost to the customer on this side?
Badri Kothandaraman: All of the cost has been incorporated in our gross margin guidance.
Amit Dayal: Okay, understood. Thank you. That is all I have.
Badri Kothandaraman: Yes, thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Eric Stine of Craig-Hallum. Your line is now open.
Eric Stine: Hi everyone. I just wonder if we could touch on the SunPower, the acquisition there and I'm just curious what response you've seen to that from your other AC module partners, whether you've seen any accelerated movement as a result? And then the second part of the question, is you’ve gotten into that and it's gotten a little bit closer, any change to the timeline? I know you're expecting some units or some shipments in fourth quarter of this year, but just curious what you're thinking about early 2019 for that product?
Badri Kothandaraman: Yes to answer the first part of your question, yes we are seeing a lot of our other partners wanting to also do AC modules of their own, so we’re working really close with the other partners as well. For example Panasonic is one such partner where we expect to have - Panasonic expects to have an AC module by either late Q4 2018 or early Q1 of 2019. With regarding your second question on SunPower, yes I told you we expect to close towards the end of the third quarter but and things are going pretty well there, so there is a possibility that we may close earlier, but I’m not committing to it right now. The acquisition of that business like what I said we're excited yes because it's going to add us, add about $60 million to $70 million of annualized revenue in the second half of 2019 and non-GAAP gross margin of 33 to 35. With regarding your specific question on do you expect shipments in Q4? Yes, we do expect shipments in Q4 of 2018 and we do expect shipments to start at that point. Q1 of 2019 will be a nice ramp and the business should be fully ramped by the end of Q2 2019 as consistent with what I said before.
Eric Stine: Yes okay. Maybe just turning quick to energy storage, I know on the last call, you noted a nice sequential increase and you actually had higher levels of non-microinverter revenue in the quarter just curious, have you seen that follow through or those positive trends, and then just what’s your expectation may be for that part of the business for the second half? And then I know you’re not projecting 2019, but any commentary would be great?
Badri Kothandaraman: Right, we are definitely seeing an uptick in ACB sales in 2018 compared to 2017. We are definitely seeing that and just to remind everybody, we sell a 1.2 kilowatt hour system and right now the sales are coming from Europe and Australia. And basically our value proposition is the modularity of the system. It is very easy to start small and add on to it and that is the biggest value proposition that other some of our competitors don’t have. Having said that, in a solar plus storage is central to our strategy as we develop IQ 8 or Ensemble. When I talk about Ensemble, I will always talk about four components of Ensemble. The four components are energy generation which is IQ 8 microinverter, energy storage, we will talk about the AC battery that we are planning to introduce in Ensemble. The third is what is called as energy hub for communication and control, and the fourth is the cloud piece which is Enlighten software. So Ensemble yes it’s going to have both solar plus storage and yes it is going to be very different from the storage solution which we have today and we will talk a lot more about it during the Analyst Day on August 16.
Eric Stine: Okay, fair enough. Thanks for that. Last one just more bookkeeping, but on those milestone payments you’ve got and what you're expecting going forward, I mean should we think of those as 100% gross margin?
Badri Kothandaraman: Yes, you should think of those as 100% gross margin.
Eric Stine: Okay, thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Pavel Molchanov of Raymond James. Your line is now open.
Pavel Molchanov: Thanks for taking the question. Given the complexity of those milestone payments as well as the battery, it’s getting tougher and tougher to kind of zero win in our white specific product pricing is doing, so if you can just get some general commentary on kind of year-over-year, what you've observed in pricing and what Q3 guidance perhaps is predicated on?
Badri Kothandaraman: See I always tell you that we model a price reduction of 2% every quarter, but what does that mean? When I say I model a price reduction of 2% that means on an average at every customer I expected 2% price reduction. That's what I mean by saying that I model a customer price reduction of 2% but when you see, like, yes like for example if I walk away from empty calories revenue which is basically walk away from low gross margin customers. My microinverter pricing automatically goes up. The average pricing automatically goes up although I don't specifically increase pricing at any long tail customer. So that's what has happened to us. Basically in the last four to five quarters what has happened is, because of our excellent pricing management we have gradually have transitioned from to few big accounts and more of a long tail accounts. Because of that our average price per microinverter has gone up nearly by 10% to 15%, so that's why we are seeing a lot of jump in the gross margins at Enphase. But if you ask me in terms of modeling going forward I will always say the same thing 2% quarter-on-quarter is what I see.
Pavel Molchanov: Okay, any update on getting a section 201 exemption for the AC module?
Badri Kothandaraman: No, update on getting the section 201 extension. We have already filed the case, I mean filed for exclusion with the USDR, we're waiting to hear from them.
Pavel Molchanov: Okay, I appreciate it.
Badri Kothandaraman: Yep.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Philip Shen of Roth Capital Partners. Your line is now open.
Philip Shen: Hey guys as a follow up on the terrorist, I think the Section 301 is highly relevant for you guys as well with a potential 10% tariff, can you guys walk us through what's the plan they have in place to address that situation, do you plan to just pay the 10% tariff or is there an opportunity where you guys can get many factoring from a different country online and just talk about timing and so forth. And then if there possibly could be an impact to things there is 10% the kind of high watermark as to what could be impacted if an alternative site does that get put in place?
Badri Kothandaraman: Got it. That's a good question Phil. So here I'm going to walk you guys patiently through all of the portions of the tariff because there have been a lot of tariffs lately, so the $50 million 301 tariffs which were originally announced that affected batteries first microinverters and the tariff on the batteries was 25% but fortunately we were not affected by that because 95% of our shipments of AC batteries are to basically APAC and Europe, so that doesn't affect us to a first order. Then we saw that there was a $200 billion tariff which is called, which I call as 301B which added microinverters to the lift at 10% tariff and yes that will affect us. The good thing is our international mix is getting better for example in Q2 of ’18 62% of our microinverter shipments where in North America 38% were rest of the world, but it is still an issue for us. And while we are doing tactical things like submitting appeals to the U.S. TR officials. We are actually in very active discussions with a bunch of contract manufacturers. And while we are not going to specifically did the negotiations with any of our suppliers we are converging on three possible options, one Mexico, two Taiwan, three Malaysia and we expect to ramp production outside China in six to nine months. And this multi-sourcing strategy not only helps us for tariffs but it also helps us on costs, so it's going to be a win-win for us in the long term.
Philip Shen: Great and budget a real or quick follw-up there six to nine months. I know most of the CapEx is typically shouldered by your contract manufacturers. Do you anticipate any CapEx if any level at all as a result of this additional ramp up.
Badri Kothandaraman: I mean, the good thing is basically these are semi auto lines and worst case I would say. Something like a $1 million you have CapEx.
Philip Shen: Okay, modest have certainly.
Badri Kothandaraman: Yes, it’s a modest CapEx that our cash is very healthy right now. Yes, we have no problems in doing that.
Philip Shen: Great, shifting gears back to the milestone payments, I know it's a 100% margin now $2 million in the guide for Q3, suggesting $2 million for Q4 as well. But can you give us a little more color on the business arrangement there? It sounds like it's Ensemble days, but what is the output that they get? Why are they willing to pay $6 million over three quarters for - and what are you actually providing them is it initial access to certain ensemble features or as you mentioned I think just deeper customization for their business, so are these - TPOs for example like one of the major TPOs where adapting their service model, so that they can embrace the feature set that you bring to the table with IQ 8, so giving us some more business color there would be very helpful as well as what they're getting overall? Thanks.
Badri Kothandaraman: Right. Yes, this - well we can’t say too many things about the specific partner. The general story is this, they basically came to us to customize Ensemble for their upgrade applications and basically, I mean those upgrade applications are outside the United States and therefore we are working on both slight modifications to our hardware as well as firmware in order to give them what they want. That’s to the extent of what I can talk about them, but yes of course they're not going to be doing this until that there is light at the end of the tunnel which is basically they are going to buy microinverters from us very soon, so and that is going to be IQ 8.
Philip Shen: And so that's really interesting in the sense that they are willing to spend $6 million to buy more product, so what kind of revenue opportunity could this customer actually represent? It sounds like it could be meaningful but if there's a way to quantify in some kind of fashion that would be fantastic.
Badri Kothandaraman: Yes, I mean it could be really meaningful and basically like when you are going to, go to these countries outside the U.S. where the grid is weak or where there is no grid, I mean things will take time and these guys are a very strong go-to-market partner and therefore we expect this to be really meaningful for us. I am unable to put any numbers at this point in time, but I'm sure that yes, over the next few months as we roll out Ensemble we'll be able to give you a lot more color on it.
Philip Shen: Great and one last question on this topic and I'll pass it on. Can you give us a little bit of color of what kind of partner this might be, is it a utility, is it a government or is it - what's the category of partner that this might represent?
Badri Kothandaraman: Phil, yes, the answer is no. I cannot give you.
Philip Shen: That’s right. Okay, thanks very much.
Badri Kothandaraman: Yes, good try.
Philip Shen: Okay, thanks Badri.
Badri Kothandaraman: Yes.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Carter Driscoll of B. Riley. Your line is now open.
Carter Driscoll: Hi guys. Well, let me just follow up on Phil may be ask a little differently. This relationship would not necessarily entail some type of limited preferred supplier agreement because of their early investment would it?
Badri Kothandaraman: We're not prepared to talk about the arrangement with our suppliers, I mean with our consumers right now.
Carter Driscoll: Okay, the geography you said was not in the U.S. is it potentially the first territory where you have a meaningful presence today or would it be new territory?
Raghu Belur: Let me, yes let me tell you this. It is a place where grid is weak or grid is non-existent and the opportunity is huge.
Carter Driscoll: Okay, all right. I can go around. I know you talked a bit about the pricing, the tariff issue. How about India just introduced a 25% safeguard looks like India, China and Malaysia, but I guess technically for all developed countries, is that you've obviously put a lot of assets on the ground there, but could that potentially impact your growth in India in the near term?
Raghu Belur: No, not really. I think the opportunity in India is really very broad and so we are not looking at anything significantly impacting our opportunity. One thing that happens is that there is some level of integration of a product that happened in India, so and with some of our partners who are doing ACM as an example, we actually ship inverters into the country into India and they have what I call special economic zones is where they actually assemble the systems, put it together before they ship it out into the site and all of those things are looked at very positively from a tariff point of view and so the impact tends to be minimal.
Carter Driscoll: Okay. A - Raghu Belur Oh by the way this is Raghu. Sorry I didn’t mean to just jump in.
Badri Kothandaraman: Sure.
Carter Driscoll: So let me ask maybe slightly differently, in terms of all the machinations with the different tariff policies being thrown around, does that change at all your estimation of AC module penetration in terms of the form factor maybe back half of this year or in 2019?
Badri Kothandaraman: Well, yes and no is what I'll say. No because our biggest partner SunPower, they basically assemble these AC modules and they do that the outside China. So that's one, but for customers like Jinco as well as LG, they basically need a strategy on how they are going to handle the tariffs. And of course the best case would be if our exclusions, the exclusion that we have filed for if that materializes, that would be the best case and that would help a lot. And for partners like Panasonic for example, the AC modules are going to be done in North America for partners like Solaria it is partially done here as well as in Korea, so we think it's going to be okay.
Carter Driscoll: Maybe just last one from me. Go ahead.
Raghu Belur: One thing, actually one point I would like to add and this is something that’s very early on during the product development phase we made a very conscious choice of, is the attachment mechanism that the device is removable, so it gives us more flexibility in where the actual AC module physically gets installed whether it’s in which geography is it installed in installation process is extremely simple. So those things help us a lot what we are finding out from a tariff point of view.
Carter Driscoll: Yes, okay. So it would mean it is a temporary work around at a minimum, it's maybe not a long-term?
Raghu Belur: Exactly right. It is architecture.
Carter Driscoll: Okay. Maybe just last one from me, really the acquisition of the [indiscernible] hasn’t closed, but maybe talk about your level of engagement, is it increased for SunPower at least in terms of discussions about future broad pass or is it still largely focused on closing and then coming out first product in 4Q?
Badri Kothandaraman: Yes, the level of engagement is actually very good with SunPower. We have multiple meetings on a weekly basis. Like what I said, I would be surprised. Right now we are committing to close by the end of this quarter, but I would be surprised if it didn't happen before. However you asked us on what do we think about this long-term. So long-term we're excited about the growth prospects of this business. So let me talk about growth, one is the international expansion in the residential markets across Europe, Australia and Japan. So there we would be working closely with the SunPower team on seeing how to adapt the Enphase AC modules there. Then the second factor is of course we discussed an attachment rate of 85% of AC modules in the U.S. and we expect that attachment rate to continuously keep going up simply because AC modules add more value. The third one is we are proud to develop microinverters for SunPower NGT or the next generation technology. So as that starts to become a lot more prominent in higher and higher wattage modules will be there and we are the technical partner to SunPower. The fourth one is the access to the SolarWorld business that SunPower has acquired, but now we will, we're happy to provide SunPower with options there as well. The fifth one which could be quite significant, but it needs to, I mean really to make progress is the great potential of Ensemble on micro grids, so that's an opportunity as well. And the last one is, this is more of in a long term as we introduce our new storage in Ensemble, so opportunities for working together in storage especially considering their attachment rate is 35% as announced in the call yesterday and future C&I expansion, when we’re ready to serve the market. So I gave you a list of six things and we're excited about all of them in terms of near term, medium term and long term opportunities.
Carter Driscoll: Now it’s great deal. I’m sorry last just quick one, a housekeeping maybe Eric, is there 7.5 million shares that is part of the deal, is there any lock-up period once they get commenced?
Eric Branderiz: Yes, yes, there is six months lock-up period.
Carter Driscoll: Got it, I will it pass along. I appreciate the time.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Osborne of Cowen and Company. Your line is now open.
Jeffrey Osborne: Yes, good afternoon. Couple of quick ones from me, just a followup on Philip’s question on the EMS vendor discussion, is that hinging on the tariff sticking or just from a risk mitigation perspective are you looking to diversify away from the one vendor you have in the one geography?
Badri Kothandaraman: I think the answer is B, what we realized is that it is always a good business practice for us to have two or three contract manufacturers, always a good business practice to spread the risk around multiple locations. So therefore we decided it has to be outside China regardless.
Jeffrey Osborne: Got it. That’s helpful and then on the Tennenbaum facility just with the cash flow profile that you have this quarter as well as the improvement in margins, is there any update as it relates to restructuring your debt or is that something that you're more inclined to do next year?
Badri Kothandaraman: Well, just a quick thing on cash, the way we manage cash, cash is turning in the right direction because we are very disciplined in running the company, we have an elaborate cash management business process to manage AR, AP and inventory. Just to give you numbers our Q1 2017 that is almost six quarters ago, our ending cash was $30 million and the free cash flow was negative $28 million. Q2 2018 the quarter that we are reporting was positive free cash flow of plus $3.6 million with ending cash balance of $58.5 million and some of these will not be possible without real massive operational changes, for example we have reduced our inventory from $33.8 million in Q1 2017 to $17.5 million in Q2 2018, so it’s a different company and we have made massive operational progress in running it and we are doing all possible to stay at our target inventory model of 30 days. Now coming to the SunPower transaction, because of the rapid progress we're making in generating cash from operations in Q3 and Q4, we think we are, I mean we are very comfortable in the $25 million for SunPower to be paid from the balance sheet, that's no problem. But as the opportunity arises, I think we need to be looking at the loan that we have and that loan, we are paying significant interest today, and we are paying LIBOR plus almost 9.25%. So and there is a clear opportunity considering how healthier we have become to restructure that debt and I think it would be in our best interest and in our shareholders best interest that we restructure that debt as quickly as possible likely end of 2018 we should be able to restructure that debt and I think we will be doing that.
Jeffrey Osborne: That's great to hear, the last question I had is just is there a way to roughly quantify the amount of as you refer to low calorie revenue that you're walking away from, just with the guidance being a bit below where the analysts were looking for, obviously the stocks are bit here, but is there a way to put in perspective the quantity roughly of revenue that you've chosen not to chase as you focus on the cash and the margin improvement that you just elaborated on?
Badri Kothandaraman: It's tough for me to give you a number, but the color that I can provide is this right as we walked away from these empty calorie business we intensified our efforts on the long tail, so basically we might have lost $10 million to $15 million of revenue but we gained it back. We gained a lot of that back not fully in the long tail, which is why you're seeing probably a depressed guidance from us for Q3 of ’18. But the real answer is this, we have spent the majority of 2017 fixing the company which is basically walking away from such low margin businesses focusing on operational excellence, improving the gross margin. The company is in a different place right now and we have started working on a lot of top line initiatives. I've started to balance my time on top line personally which is why of all the four vectors I told you, Ensemble with it’s off grid microinverters plus with the new storage system is going to be terribly exciting for us in terms of the top line. But let me tell you once again our strategy is really simple, we do not want to go after empty calorie businesses. We want to make sure our products add value and that is possible only with innovation which we are focused on. So that’s our strategy.
Jeffrey Osborne: I appreciate the detail.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Edwin Mok of Needham. Your line is now open.
Alexander Kim: Hello, this is Alex Kim calling in four Edwin Mok. Thank you for taking my questions. My first question is are you planning to continue to maintain stable pricing and have you seen any major changes to market pricing right now?
Badri Kothandaraman: No, we have not seen any major changes to market pricing, pricing the main stable. As I told you guys before I always model a 2% price reduction quarter-on-quarter.
Alexander Kim: Okay, got it and I just have a followup. With the success of the IQ series have you any competitive response from the key NLP customers?
Raghu Belur: Not from a pricing, I mean pricing point of view like Badri mention things have been things are stable and for us from an we'll when we think about our IQ. I think the IQ 7 with it being further what I call, what we call a software defined a single worldwide skew making it much simpler for our partners, for our installation partners to install the system. I think that is our core focus. Bear in mind that in the U.S. the customers are transitioning from IQ. to IQ 6 to 6 to 7. However in the rest of the world they're transitioning from a older generation of product Gen5 to Gen7 so they are effectively skipping a generation. So what they should see is a significant improvement in significantly better products than even the Gen5 with all the improvements that we have made, so.
Badri Kothandaraman: Yes and especially with AC modules and IQ 7 you're going to be saving approximately 20% to 44% in installation time and roughly 10% to 15% in logistics, so there are huge savings for the installer. And with the microinverter being embedded in the back of the module the only variable now is AC cable and in the AC cable what we have done going from the fifth generation product to the seventh generation product is the AC cable has reduced by 50% in weight. You know, 50% in weight means going from a four wire cable to a two wire cable. Why is that important because when installer carries that cable up on the roof now it is 50% lighter. So whatever we do we think about the user experience of the installers and that basically differentiates our product from the rest of the people. And that's what I meant by saying that we focus on innovation and yes, that creates a differentiation.
Alexander Kim: And how is the competitor response, how competitors are responding to your success?
Badri Kothandaraman: We are actually from, again like I said, it's not been on pricing. Pricing has been pretty stable. We are expecting a new big player expecting them to be entering the market in this quarter and the next. And well, we haven't seen any of their products as yet. It remains to be seen what the, it remains to be seen how they will be accepted in the marketplace. Having said that I want to be very careful is that we take all our competitors extremely seriously. So, we have to continue down our path of innovation and I think what I'm trying to get actors yes the competition's going to do what they were they're going to do but we have a very clear plan on how we're going to continue adding value to our products to help our customers, especially as you think about the whole Ensemble solution that's coming out by the end of this - starting with the end of this year and heading into 2019, so our focus is our value add to our customers.
Alexander Kim: Got it. Thanks and some more modeling question, how do you think about OpEx turning to be on the current quarter right now?
Badri Kothandaraman: Our long term model is to basically have OpEx at 20% of revenue.
Alexander Kim: Got it. Thank you so much.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Colin Rusch of Oppenheimer. Your line is now open.
Colin Rusch: Thanks so much. I guess as the balance sheet is improving and the cash flow is improving. Can and can you talk a little bit about how your strategy around managing the supply chain is changing and how soon that might start to impact some of the cause [ph] line?
Badri Kothandaraman: So Colin when you talk about managing the supply chain what exactly do you want to know?
Colin Rusch: Really about managing costs and if there's a component shortage exploring things are really I assume that you're in a position to begin making larger purchases in advance billing a little bit of inventory that may end up producing the cars line [ph] even though you carry it on the balance sheet.
Badri Kothandaraman: Yes, I mean as we get healthier and healthier you heard me talking about this all the component reductions, I'm signing long term agreements with some customers and that was not possible when our financial situation was not healthy. Again, and us qualifying multiple contract manufacturers and us spending the capital, that was not possible when the financial situation was healthy. So when our balance sheet is healthy, we can do a lot of things and our top line and both our cost as well as the top line are I would say enhanced in a virtuous cycle. And having said that, so if you ask me what is the – what are the other things we're doing in the supply chain? One is we always talked about microinverter costs, but as a team we are laser-focused on our accessories cost, every day I come in we think about the combiner box, the Envoy, the cables, how we can architecturally go to a superior cost structure that’s one. Then the last one is actually overhead. Companies rarely think about overhead. They spend probably maybe 10% of their revenues in overhead, but they don't think about overhead much and that when I mean overhead, I mean what I mean is inventory variance, the money that we spend in expedites, stuff that we spend in warranty, all of those are things where we can optimize and sub-optimize things. So we are again laser-focused like what I told you on reducing overhead costs, on reducing accessory cost and of course focusing on the microinverter.
Colin Rusch: Thanks so much guys, I will take the rest offline.
Badri Kothandaraman: All right, thank you.
Operator: Thank you. I’m showing no further questions. At this time, I would like to hand the call back over to Badri Kothandaraman, your line is open.
Badri Kothandaraman: All right, so thanks for joining us today and your continued support of Enphase. We feel very good about the second quarter in terms of cash and our 30-20-10 operating models progress, but we do recognize that we are just getting started on profitable top line growth. We look forward to our Analyst Day on August 16 and to speaking with you again on our call next quarter.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today’s conference. This does conclude today’s program. You may all disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen. And welcome to Enphase Energy's First Quarter 2018 Financial Results Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct the question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time [Operator Instructions]. And as a reminder, this conference call may be recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Ms. Christina Carrabino. Ma'am, you may begin.
Christina Carrabino: Good afternoon. And thank you for joining us on today's conference call to discuss Enphase Energy's first quarter 2018 results. On today's call are Badri Kothandaraman, Enphase's President and Chief Executive Officer; Bert Garcia, Chief Financial Officer; and Raghu Belur, Chief Product Officer. After the market closed today, Enphase issued a press release announcing the results for its first quarter ended March 31, 2018. During the course of this conference call, Enphase management will make forward-looking statements, including but not limited to, statements related to Enphase Energy's financial performance, market demands for its current and future products, advantages of its technology and market trends. These forward-looking statements involve significant risks and uncertainties, and Enphase Energy's actual results and the timing of events could differ materially from these expectations. For a more complete discussion of the risks and uncertainties, please see the Company's annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017, which is on file with the SEC and the quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, which will be filed with the SEC in the second quarter of 2018. Enphase Energy cautions you not to replace any undue reliance on forward-looking statements, and undertakes no duty or obligation to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future events or changes in its expectations. Also, please note that financial measures used on this call are expressed on a non-GAAP basis unless otherwise noted, and have been adjusted to exclude certain charges. The Company has provided reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures in its earnings release posted today, which can also be found in the Investor Relations section of its Web site. Now I'd like to introduce Badri Kothandaraman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Enphase Energy. Badri?
Badri Kothandaraman: Good afternoon. And thanks for joining us today to discuss our first quarter of 2018 financial results. We had a decent quarter. We reported revenue of $70 million for the first quarter of 2018 at the higher end of guidance. Our non-GAAP gross margin in the first quarter was 26.5%, surpassing the higher end of guidance. Our non-GAAP operating income was $861,000. We have come a long way in the past year and are pleased to report the second consecutive quarter of positive non-GAAP operating income. As I have stated several times before, my top priority at Enphase is to build a solid financial foundation by improving operations and fortifying the balance sheet. During the first quarter, we continued to make progress on these fronts with further gross margin improvement through pricing management, supply chain optimization and IQ transition. We are making good progress on reaching our 30-20-10 target operating model by the fourth quarter of 2018. Now turning to the balance sheet. We exited the first quarter with a cash balance of $53.3 million, which included a previously announced $20 million private equity investment. Our sharpened focus on improving AR, AP and inventory management helped improve the cash conversion cycle in Q1, resulting in approximately $2.3 million of positive free cash flow. Bert will go into greater detail about our financial results later in the call. Over the past year, Enphase has transformed its culture to one of discipline and rigor supported by metrics. This focus continues to be applied broadly across all aspects of our business. One such example is ease of doing business, the way we are perceived by customers. This is measured by a popular metric called as Net Promoter Score, also called NPS, and NPS is calculated based on feedback from customer surveys on how likely they are to recommend Enphase to a friend or colleague. Our executive team is very involved with ensuring we provide a best-in-class customer experience that is a benchmark for the solar industry. In January, we hired a seasoned executive to lead our customer support team. We have optimized our call center, resulting in a significant improvement in wait times over the past two months. We measure wait times based upon 95th percentile, not that average. We are not satisfied with the average wait times coming down. Rather, we want the worst case wait times to come down significantly. We began rolling out self-help tools this quarter that provide our customers the option to resolve majority of their problems quickly and without human intervention. In short, we are focused on providing superior customer experience measured by continuously improving NPS metrics. I will provide updates on this effort every quarter. Now turning to our markets. The first quarter in U.S. was down 22% sequentially and up 11% year-on-year. We started shipping IQ 7 to our customers during the quarter. In Europe, revenue was up 11% sequentially and 92% year-on-year. We recently announced IQ 7 for the U.K. and look forward to introducing the product in Germany and Austria along with other European countries during 2018. We maintained our market share lead in France during the first quarter and grew market share in the U.K., the Benelux and Switzerland. In APAC, revenue increased 5% sequentially and 88% year-on-year. This first quarter was the largest quarter ever for shipments to the region. Our business in India continues to ramp, and we recently announced the availability of IQ family of microinverters across India. This is a rapidly growing solar market and our IQ family of microinverters is designed to operate in the harsh and dusty conditions in India. In Latin America, the first quarter revenue increased approximately 32% compared to Q4 as Puerto Rico began its slow recovery after the devastating hurricanes last year. The IQ 8 product based on Ensemble technology will be the perfect fit for such island nations where the grid is susceptible to natural disasters. As a company, we have been laser focused on pricing management, supply chain optimization and new product transition. These efforts are obviously paying off with continuously improving gross margins. With these becoming ingrained into the company's DNA, we are now starting to work on profitable top line growth. In order to achieve this, we need to continue offering differentiated products that add value to the installers and homeowners. The first such lever for top line growth is the IQ 7 transition. We started the IQ 7 rollout in Q1 and did limited volumes, which were in line with our plan for a well-controlled ramp. In Q2 ,we expect to continue the ramp and introduce IQ 7 in rest of the world. Note that the rest of the world is directly transitioning from the fifth-generation product to the seventh-generation product. In Q3, we expect to have a significant ramp; and in Q4, we expect to complete the IQ 7 transition. We are continuing to experience component shortages in our IQ 7 rollout and are working diligently to resolve the issues. We believe IQ 7 with its worldwide SKU will help us access a gigawatt of new market opportunities. This represents approximately a 20% increase to our served available market. The next lever for top line growth is IQ 7X. We look forward to the release of our IQ 7X discrete microinverter solutions to address 96-cell modules. This high performance product with its 97.5% CEC efficiency will enable us to address a significant market both in North America and worldwide, which was not possible with IQ 6. The third lever for top line growth is AC module. We recently announced a strategic partnership with Solaria Corporation for the introduction of Enphase Energized AC Module, the Solaria PowerXT-AC. Solaria will be integrating Enphase IQ 7+ microinverters with its high-output PowerXT 355-watt 60-cell equivalent module. As stated in our last conference call, we are working with Panasonic to integrate IQ 7X into Panasonic's 330-watt HIT module. This will result in a high-performance module with 97.5% CEC efficiency, the first of its kind. So let me remind you once again about the benefits of an AC module. In the recent interviews we conducted with installers on their AC module experience, they reported installation time savings up to 20%, logistic savings up to 10% and simpler inspection procedures when compared to discrete solutions. We now have 3 different IQ 7 solutions for AC modules based on IQ 7, IQ 7+ and IQ 7X. We believe this pairing of Enphase microinverters with well-known module brands will help long-tail customers offer high-quality, high-performance, residential solutions to homeowners. Let me now update you on our next-generation IQ 8 product, which is yet another important and exciting catalyst for our top line growth. IQ 8 is based upon our grid-agnostic, always-on technology called Ensemble that has the capability to transform our future by creating new market opportunities. As we have previously discussed, one of solar's bigger challenges is that it is grid tied. What this means is if the grid fails and the sun is still shining, there will be no production out of your solar system. To address this limitation, we have invented a microinverter technology that is completely grid agnostic. With IQ 8, you can have a system that will continuously provide energy regardless of the presence or absence of grid. That is solar during the day and storage at night. This is what we refer to as always on. The IQ 8 platform based on Ensemble technology includes energy generation, storage, communication and software. It has a unique capability to address off-grid, grid tied and grid-agnostic use cases, all on the same platform. We are continuing to productize the technology building on the significant ASIC milestone we achieved last quarter when we established technological feasibility. We plan to introduce IQ 8 solutions in a phased manner beginning with off-grid solutions in Q4 '18 followed by grid-agnostic solutions in 2019. These off-grid installed systems can be remotely upgraded by software to become grid agnostic in future. These systems can then function in grid tied mode of off-grid mode depending on the presence or absence of the grid and seamlessly transition between the 2 depending on the performance of the grid. We expect this grid-agnostic feature to be useful not only for energy access in regions with no grid or weak grid but also for regions with stable grid as a valuable insurance policy against unexpected outages. We will continue to update you on IQ 8's progress over the coming quarters. In summary, we are pleased with our overall progress during the past 3 months. We are now applying the same rigor and discipline we used on gross margin improvement to drive profitable top line growth along with a best-in-class customer experience. So before I turn the call over to Bert to discuss our financial results, I would like to mention we announced today that Bert is leaving Enphase to pursue other opportunities. He will continue as our CFO until June 30, 2018. An external search is underway to identify a replacement, and Bert will support an orderly transition to his successor. We thank him for his 8 years of service and wish him well in his future endeavors. With that, I will turn the call over to Bert for his review of our financial result. Bert?
Bert Garcia: Thanks, Badri.  I'll provide more details related to our first quarter 2018 financial results as well as our business outlook for the second quarter. As a reminder, the financial measures that I'm going to provide are on a non-GAAP basis unless otherwise noted. Total revenue for the first quarter of 2018 was $70 million, a decrease of 12% sequentially and an increase of 28% year-over-year. Total net revenue per DC watt increased by 8% in the fourth quarter of 2017, largely as a result of changes in product mix. We shipped approximately 180 megawatts of DC in the first quarter of 2018, a decrease in megawatts of 19% sequentially and an increase of 12% from the year-ago quarter. The megawatts shipped represented 611,000 microinverters. Approximately 67% of which were our new IQ microinverter systems. As Badri mentioned, we began shipping our IQ product in the U.S. during the first quarter. Non-inverter revenue, which includes our AC Battery storage solution, Envoy Communications Gateway and all accessories, increased as a percentage of revenue compared to our prior quarter results. Non-GAAP gross margin for the first quarter of 2018 was 26.5% compared to 24.2% for the fourth quarter. We are very pleased with the continued progress we've made expanding our gross margin. The increases reflect pricing management, supply chain optimization and the IQ transition. I'll note that we continued to be impacted by component shortages, which negatively affected our Q1 gross margin by approximately 1%. Non-GAAP operating expense was $17.7 million for the first quarter of 2018 compared to $18 million in Q4. As compared to the first quarter of 2017, we reduced non-GAAP operating expenses by 13% or $2.5 million. On a non-GAAP basis, income from operations was $861,000 compared to $1.3 million in Q4 and a loss of $12.9 million in the year-ago quarter. This dramatic improvement in operating income is reflective of our hard work over the past year and underscores our commitment towards establishing a solid financial foundation. Now turning to the balance sheet. Inventory levels were $18.5 million for the first quarter compared to $26 million in the fourth quarter and $33.8 million in the year-ago quarter. Inventory levels decreased Q4 as we improved our working capital management. We ended with 32 days of inventory on hand as of March 31, down from 39 days last quarter and 64 days in the year-ago quarter. Our target inventory level is 30 days, and as Badri mentioned, inventory management remains 1 of our key cash management initiatives in 2018. We exited the quarter with a total cash balance of $53.3 million compared to $29.1 million in Q4. The Q1 increase includes the net proceeds from the previously announced $20 million private equity investment. During the quarter, we generated $3.4 million in cash from operations as well as approximately $2.3 million in positive free cash flow. Now let's look at our outlook for the second quarter of 2018. We expect our revenue for the second quarter of 2018 to be within a range of $72 million to $80 million. Turning to margins. We expect GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins to be within a range of 26% to 29%. Note that our Q2 gross margin guidance includes the negative impact of higher expedite fees resulting from industry-wide component shortages. We expect non-GAAP operating expense for the second quarter to be within a range of $17.5 million to $18.5 million and GAAP operating expense to be within a range of $19.5 million to $20.5 million, including an estimated $2 million of stock-based compensation expense. Before we'd open up the line for questions, I'd like to take a moment to say it has been my great privilege to be part of the Enphase team for the past 8 years, and I'm incredibly fortunate to have worked with so many dedicated and talented people. I want to thank our customers, vendors, partners, employees, shareholders and of course, the Board of Directors for their support throughout the years. It has truly been an honor to be the CFO of Enphase Energy, and I wish the company much continued success. As Badri mentioned, I am committed to helping Enphase through an orderly transition to the new CFO. With that, I'll open up the line for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from the line of Philip Shen with Roth Capital Partners.
Philip Shen: Great job on the margins, I know that's been a focus of yours for some time now, and part of that is perhaps some trade-off of volume. With the Q2 guide being slightly weaker than expected, I think the midpoint is roughly flat year-on-year growth for Q2 of this year. Do you expect that the trend flat still in Q3 and 4? I know it's still early. You don't provide official guidance, but some of the PG&E data -- or the sorry, California PG data suggested that the volumes in California for you guys were down 20-ish percent. So just kind of walk us through how you see volumes and also revenues trending as we get into Q3 and 4.
BadriKothandaraman: Phil, thanks for your questions. So let me tell you how we think about market share. It should be very clear to all you guys that our top priority is to build a solid financial foundation. We are focused on consistent profitability than growing market share at any cost. We are consciously walking away from empty calorie revenue like I have repeatedly said. Having said that, since we are performing great on gross margins and that is ingrained into our business or into our DNA, we are starting to work on profitable top line growth. And the 4 vectors for top line growth are IQ 7 regional expansion where the software configurability of IQ 7 helps us to be compatible to multiple regions, which was not possible before. So that adds roughly a gigawatt of new market. The IQ 7X is something that was not possible with IQ 6, where we are now addressing 96-cell modules, that was not possible before and of course, the solid color on ACM partnerships. We are partnering with a number of people. We have announced some are in the works. And we have AC modules for IQ 7, IQ 7+, IQ 7X. So we are a big believer in AC modules. That's going to propel our future. The last one, last but not the least is IQ 8 in Ensemble. In fact, we announced that we are going to introduce our grid solutions in Q4 of '18, then followed by grid-agnostic solutions in 2019. So these are the 4 growth vectors that you should think about Enphase. But again, the main message is whatever we do, we will not compromise profitable growth.
Philip Shen: Great, that's really helpful, Badri. So given that, can you give us a sense for -- we've seen some kind of flatness on the year-on-year growth in Q2. Would you expect that acceleration from these greater revenue opportunities to kind of pick up in Q3 and 4? Or could it be sometime next year? What's your sense as to when the growth really starts to accelerate nicely?
Badri Kothandaraman: Well, we are not going to be guiding to any numbers for Q3 or Q4, but I told you the 4 vectors. And I think they're all very tangible ones. And we have the product coming out. I'll talk a little bit about the IQ 7 transition, and let me add some color on the IQ 7 transition. So basically, Q1 '18, we started shipping IQ 7 in the U.S. We did a limited quantity of IQ 7, which was by plan as part of a controlled ramp. In fact, 8% of our shipments in Q1 '18 was IQ 7. As we proceed to Q2, that number will get better, more IQ 7 shipments. We will start introducing IQ 7 to rest of the world. We will also introduce IQ 7X. Q3 '18 will be a significant ramp for IQ 7, and we'll complete the IQ 7 transition in Q4 '18. So that gives you some sense of the time line on the IQ 7 transition. And I already told you 3 of the 4 top line growth vectors are dependent on IQ 7 transition. So that's how I'm going to answer your question.
Philip Shen: Badri, that's super helpful. I know that you guys are targeting Q4 as the full ramp-up of IQ 7. If you can put any specific numbers around the IQ 7 mix for Q2 and 3, that would be great. But are we kind of looking at maybe 20% in Q2 and maybe 60% in Q3? Do those numbers kind of ballpark feel appropriate?
Badri Kothandaraman: I'm not going to provide conversion numbers, Phil, but like what I told you, 8% in Q1, incremental progress in Q2, big ramp in Q3, completion in Q4.
Philip Shen: One last one, I'll pass it on. As it relates to the AC module, is there anything you might be able to share on the 201 tariff exclusion potential? I know, based on our work, it seems like you have good shot at it. Additionally, I think SolarWorld left an opening for you guys. To what degree can you comment on timing as well as whether or not you think you might be able to get it?
Badri Kothandaraman: Yes. So let me make some general comment on the ITC ruling. While we expect the ITC ruling, what we did not expect was the impact on AC modules. So we are working on an exception process to get exclusion on the microinverter portion of ACM. We have submitted to their exclusion request to the USTR, and we expect to hear from them by the end of June. Our overall direction as a company does not significantly change because of this tariff. Like what I said, profitable growth strategy, that doesn't change. We are working with a number of partners, some of who are affected by the tariff, some are not affected by the tariff. So we'll wait and watch, but that's our strategy.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Eric Stine with Craig-Hallum.
Aaron Spychalla: It's Aaron Spychalla on for Eric Stine. Maybe first on the Q2 rev guide. Can you just talk a little bit more about the puts and the takes there? I mean, is that just primarily the controlled ramp for the IQ 7 like you're talking about? And then just maybe conservatism or depending on how the U.S. market looks, are those kind of the 2 drivers diverse? Or is there anything else there?
Badri Kothandaraman: Yes. I mean, yes, the Q2 guidance is between $72 million and $80 million. Like what I said, it is about the IQ 7 transition, and we also talked about the 4 vectors for top line growth. So we expect to introduce IQ 7 in rest of the world. We introduced IQ 7, as you know, in the first quarter of Q1 '18 into the Americas. We now expect to introduce IQ 7 into rest of the world in Q2 of '18. And so that will be a continued ramp compared to the 8% number I told you. Then, Q3 and Q4 is where the ramps happen. Like what I said, Q3 will be a significant ramp. Q4 will complete. So some of the opportunities, top line opportunities that we are working on will start coming into play during that time along with our transition.
Aaron Spychalla: And then maybe second on pricing. Can you just kind of give us an update on your pricing outlook? Obviously, pricing management has been a key focus like you said and great margins this quarter. What are your thoughts kind of for the rest of the year on a year-over-year basis or something like that? And then just anything on broadly Section 201 impact as inventory moves through the channel?
Badri Kothandaraman: Yes. I mean, I'll give you some color on pricing. So we have three levers on gross margin. The first one is pricing management. The second is supply chain optimization. The third is new product transition. So I'll talk about pricing management. Pricing has been very important to us. We hired a VP of Pricing almost a year ago. He taught us how to do pricing. So basically, our focus is value-based pricing. The way we do pricing is we look at the next best alternative. Then, we look at what value we add on top of that next best alternative. So that has taught us a lot. In addition, we are blocking and tackling on the transactional side to making sure that we are profit focused and shed away empty calories. That has been one more discipline. Also, the way we think about products is like, we think about product segmentation, how those products can be segmented from a pricing perspective in order to generate value. So basically, we have changed our game on pricing. With regarding how we model pricing, we usually model a couple of percent every quarter. And historically, for Q1 '18, for example, our pricing was flat. There has been not much change. In fact, it was up a little bit. But we model 2% erosion, price erosion quarter-on-quarter for the -- I mean for the 3 quarters in 2018.
Aaron Spychalla: And then maybe last for me, can you talk a little bit about the opportunity in South America following the strategic investments? Maybe just frame that out, what the opportunity looks like and how this investment helps the prospects down there, and any thoughts on timing?
RaghBelur: This is Raghu. Latin America is, again, one of our top line growth initiatives, is when we think about regional expansion, because of the benefit of the microinverter being software defined, we are now certifying the product to be available in South America as well. So over time, we'll share with you more details about the market plan itself. But yes, we are gearing up to get our product out into that market.
Operator: And the next question comes from the line of Jeff Osborne with Cowen and Company.
JeffOsborne: Just a couple questions from my end. One is on the international expansion in the second half of the year and into 2019. How do we think about OpEx as that plays out? All the training and seminars that you folks do, is there any noticeable increase that we'll see from a P&L perspective?
Badri Kothandaraman: So I'll go to the OpEx. We have reduced OpEx very significantly as a company. So from $108 million in 2016, we have dropped to $73 million in 2017. Our Q1 '18 non-GAAP OpEx is a little higher, 25% of revenue because primarily due to Q1 seasonality of revenue. But we do expect our long-term OpEx to be consistent with the 30-20-10 operating model, which means close to 20%. We have certain investments that we make on profitable top line growth, which we will not compromise on, and we will do them. And in addition, the most important point there is we have opened an R&D center in India, and we now have over 50 employees in India. And India is a key strategy by which we can accomplish low OpEx as well as do all the things we need.
Jeff Osborne: That makes sense. I appreciate it. Just two other quick ones. One, Bert, any update on the Tennenbaum facility in terms of the ability to renegotiate the terms of that, the interest expense moving forward? And then you sort of answered it in the prior caller's question. But just in terms of the competitive environment in the second half, do you think that there's a step-function change in ASP? Or is that kind of 2-ish percent sequentially each quarter pretty consistent with what you're expecting based on your conversations with your customers?
Bert Garcia: Yes, so I think Badri answered the ASP question pretty well in terms of what our expectations are, so I don't have anything more to add to that. Respect to the Tennenbaum facility, as you know, we did do a little bit of recasting of that facility in the first quarter to push out 50% of the principal out of 2018. That was a direct result, as you can imagine, from our improving financial results. It gave us a little bit of opportunity to get creative on that and get constructive with them. As we continue to improve financially, and we do expect to continue to improve financially, we do believe it will have similar opportunities in the back half of the year to do similar constructive work with Tennenbaum, and it's definitely something that's on our radar.
Operator: And the next question comes from the line of Brad Meikle with AMPAC Research.
Brad Meikle: It's Brad Meikle, AMPAC Research. Bert, best of luck. Sorry to hear you leaving. And 2 questions. I guess, the IQ 8, is that planned for January of next year for initial shipments? Or do you have a sense on the timing of that?
BadriKothandaraman: So Brad, as we said, we plan to release the off-grid solutions in Q4 of '18, and it'll be followed by the grid-agnostic solutions in the first half of 2019.
Brad Meikle: And would you expect to ramp similar to the IQ 7 in terms of the slope and penetration? Or do you think you'll see still some balance of IQ 7 shipments?
Badri Kothandaraman: Well, IQ 7 will be our bread and butter, but IQ 8 addresses a brand-new market. And once you address a brand new market, there is a cycle of learning there. I'm sure we'll go through that cycle of learning. It's difficult for us to predict ramp, but the good news is we'll have the product out there.
Brad Meikle: So thinking about the third and fourth quarter in terms of IQ 7 ramp. Obviously, the international, I guess, 20% or so of your business has not been IQ 6. So with the ramp, 200%, I guess, you see a nice margin incremental boost off that. And I guess, the question's how much are you going to pass along to customers at that point versus capture from a margin standpoint yourself.
Badri Kothandaraman: If you see our mix of international versus North America, right, we basically had 62% and 38%, which basically means 62% is North America and 38% is rest of the world. So rest of the world is becoming a nice fraction of our business. We want that to grow more and more. And it is important to note, the rest of the world is on the fifth-generation product, and it's directly transitioning to the seventh-generation product. Okay? So that should give you some color on the gross margin.
Brad Meikle: How are the costs looking for the IQ 7 in terms of the cost reduction ramp for that?
Badri Kothandaraman: Well, we are not going to be giving out cost numbers here. But the way we think about cost, right, our supply chain initiatives, for example, we have a multi-sourcing strategy, which means no matter what the component is, you always have multiple sources; 0-based costing approach, which means due to physics-based costing. You look at the stack-up of the product, and you calculate the cost from first principles. The third one is clear supplier selection and analysis, so basically, methodical analysis of suppliers in terms of their quality, in terms of supply chain, in terms of reliability, performance and having methodical score cards. The fourth is focus on accessories. It's not just about the microinverters, focus on accessories because that is getting to be a sizable fraction of our business. And this was previously neglected. Now we are applying a lot of focus there. The last one is overhead. No matter how the efficient company is, there is overhead, and the overhead is basically freight, service, stocking, things like RMAs, the way they are handled, things like inventory, things like variance, warranty. There is lot of hidden costs there, so we are constantly blocking and tackling that. So I think about this as a business process where we control costs in the company. And the most important part is that everybody is involved in the cost improvement. It's not just the supply chain guys. It is the CTO. It is the engineering team along with strong program management. So while I'm not answering your question directly in terms of what is the cost, I'm just giving you color on that. This is a business process we are doing methodically. We are grinding everyday and that's where costs are getting better.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Colin Rusch with Oppenheimer.
Colin Rusch: The pace of the platform development has been fairly quick here over the recent quarters. Can you talk about expectations for whether that pace is going to continue on a multiyear basis? Or are you going to slow that down and just continue to mind the supply chain and mix to optimize the profitability of the company?
RaghuBelur: This is Raghu. So the way we think about it is the heart of our system is the ASIC, is the chip itself, the ASIC, and there's a lot of opportunity for us to continue the rapid pace of development of the ASIC in order to drive greater functions and features as well as lower our cost. Just to give you an example, if you look at our IQ 6 ASIC or IQ 7 ASIC, it has 3.8 million gates. If you look at our IQ 8 ASIC, which we mentioned came back and is fully operational, is 5 million gates, gives us huge amount of leverage in terms of cost as well as functionality. Now the other thing to take into account is, when we say platform, yes, the inverter itself may change because you're driving, the brain of the system is changing. The rest of the system, the cabling, the accessories, et cetera, we try to keep those as unchanged as possible. The advantage of that is you bring a lot of efficiencies to our installer partners. So when they get on the roof, they're installing the same exact, same cabling systems, same balance of system, but the inverters just get better and better with lower cost and better functionality.
Colin Rusch: And just to follow with that point about the data management and collection, obviously, you guys have done a couple of important upgrades on some of these inverters in various locations, and you've been working with utilities to figure out how to optimize the use of those data cases. But can you give us an update on where you're at in terms of monetizing those capabilities and what that business model can look like going forward?
Raghu Belur: That promise always exists about what can you do with the data and can you monetize it. So at this time, we are not announcing anything in terms of monetizing the data, but the data is extremely valuable. Let me speak about like in little more generality in that as our platforms change or as we progress throughout generations of inverters, the reliance on software is becoming greater and greater. So between 6 to 7 to 8, it's becoming more and more software defined, more and more software upgradable functions and more and more software capabilities are being included into the system. So in the long term, we still believe that there will be opportunity to do that. But at this time, the business plan is what we have right now.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from the line of Pavel Molchanov with Raymond James.
Pavel Molchanov: Another trade word question but from the other kind of side's perspective. We saw headlines a few weeks ago that Huawei is essentially pulling out of the U.S. market. And I think that they have not actually sold any microinverters here, but they had talked about it. So I'm curious your thoughts are about that decision and what it might suggest about the competitive landscape.
Badri Kothandaraman: Yes. I mean, we have been hearing about Huawei a lot in the last year. We heard that they were in Europe. Now we are hearing that they plan to be in the U.S. in Q3. And like what you said, solar is a dynamic phase. Things can change very fast. Competitive dynamics is amazing. But our strategy doesn't change. We are focused on profitable top line growth. And for us, it is the differentiation of the product that counts, and that's what I articulated in the 4 vectors of my top line growth.
Pavel Molchanov: Can we also get an update on how things are looking with the battery product?
Badri Kothandaraman: Yes. I'll give you a brief update on the battery product. Basically, we are seeing a sequential uptick in AC Battery sales every quarter, and the uptick that we are seeing comes from both Europe as well as Australia. Our value proposition is pretty simple. It is the Enphase ease of installation combined with the modularity of the system. When I say modularity is it's available as 1.2 kilowatt-hour, small battery, easy to install, very easy to start small and then add on to it later. So that's why it has started selling. So we are very happy there. However, there is a lot more work to be done. On IQ 8, like what I have repeatedly said, solar plus storage is central to our strategy as we develop IQ 8. So as we come closer to Q4 of '18, when we release our off-grid solutions, we will start talking a lot more about our storage.
Operator: And the next question comes from the line of Carter Driscoll with B. Riley FBR.
Carter Driscoll: Sorry to see you go, Bert. Hopefully on to new opportunities for you. The question I had was given the -- SunPower's acquisition of SolarWorld, if I recall quickly, you had a terms of working agreement on the AC module side with SolarWorld. Is the acquisition at all either a restart or more put to bed the opportunity for a module with SolarWorld and/or its new parent?
Badri Kothandaraman: Yes, you are correct. In the last year sometime towards the end of last year, we were working with SolarWorld, and we did have an AC module ready before the thing happened at SolarWorld. We heard about the announcement from SunPower. Once we are not sure when that acquisition is going to close, et cetera. Once the acquisition closes, then I'm sure the opportunities will come. And like what I said, we are a very strong believer in AC modules, and SunPower is also a strong believer in AC modules. So I think there is lot of synergy there.
Carter Driscoll: Maybe just a follow-up to that. Obviously, Panasonic's making a lot of inroads in the U.S. and has a somewhat unique position because of Tier 1. Can you talk about the timing maybe of the integration you have with their module product?
Badri Kothandaraman: Yes. So it is a 2-phase approach. One is we are first introducing IQ 7X with discrete product, and it will go into the channel where it'll be combined with the 96-cell panel. That's the first phase. The second phase is where we are working with Panasonic in order to integrate our IQ 7X microinverter into their 330-watt HIT module. And that is more -- you know the Japanese. They are going to stress on the quality, which is the most important, right? So basically, we expect that to be available by the later part of 2018 on the full-blown ACM.
Raghu Belur: This is Raghu. Just the IQ 7X, the discrete solution, our plan is to introduce it in Q2.
Carter Driscoll: Just two more quick ones for me. You just talk about IQ 8 and your inroads potentially in Latin America. I mean, how do you think of that market? I mean, obviously, it's very diverse. There's a mix of, let's say, stable grid and then something that might be a perfect solution for your to IQ 8. How do you think about approaching it? Is it take a different sales approach on country-by-country basis or a region-by-region basis? And that take any incremental spend at least vis-à-vis what you had to do in some of your more established markets? Trying to think of an SG&A spend as you try to target that market particularly as you roll out IQ 8.
Badri Kothandaraman: Yes. Let me give you some color on IQ 8. So basically, IQ 8 is based upon a brand-new technology called as Ensemble, which was invented here at Enphase. As we said in the past, we are getting, I mean, we got the technological feasibility last quarter when the ASIC was completely functional. And once again, I'll remind you that IQ 8 consists of energy generation, energy storage, communication and software. So like, the use cases that IQ 8 addresses is enormous like what you said. It is off grid. It could be grid tied. It could be grid agnostic. So the go to market is involved, and we don't claim we have understood everything. But we are going to introduce it for the off-grid markets first, which is basically a phased introduction. In the off-grid market, the obvious places for us to attack are to go and gain market share in would be Africa and India. Africa is no-grid market, while India is weak grid market. Those are the places where we will begin. And you're right. It will involve some SG&A spending. We have comprehended that in a few places. We may enter with partners, so more to come there, but you're exactly right. We are thinking about it the way you said, and we are adopting a phased approach.
Carter Driscoll: And then just the last question, a high level. Given the 62%-38%, NA-rest of the world, split you just posted, could you hit parity by year-end '18 or probably more likely in 19? And that take a mix of 7 and 8 rollout? Or that'd be based just on IQ 7 when you hit the ROW by 3Q and full ramp by 4Q, just trying to get a top-level geo mix.
Badri Kothandaraman: Yes, there are lot more quarters between now and 2019. But if I want to be abstract about it, I'd say India is growing for us. Europe is growing. So I would be happy if we can get to something like a 50-50 sometime in 2019, 2020 time frame.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] This does conclude today's question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the call back over to CEO, Mr. Badri Kothandaraman, for closing remarks.
Badri Kothandaraman: All right. Thank you for joining us today. Our 30-20-10 execution is going very well, and we have started working on several initiatives for profitable top line growth. We look forward to speaking with you again on our call next quarter. Thank you.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude your program. You may all disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.

Now, I'd like to introduce Badri Kothandaraman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Enphase Energy. Badri?
Badri Kothandaraman: Good afternoon and thanks for joining us today to discuss our fourth quarter and full year 2017 financial results. We had a profitable quarter. We reported revenue of $79.7 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 at the higher-end of guidance. Our non-GAAP gross margin in the fourth quarter was 24.2% also at the higher-end of guidance. Our non-GAAP operating income was $1.3 million. This, return to profitability represents a significant milestone for the Company. My top priority at Enphase is to build a solid financial foundation by improving operations and fortifying the balance sheet. We are making excellent progress towards achieving our target 30-20-10 financial operating model. We are targeting 30% gross margin, 20% operating expenses and 10% operating income all by the fourth quarter of 2018. In 2017, we sequentially increased our non-GAAP goes margin every quarter from 13.3% in Q1 2017 to 24.2% in Q4 2017. This margin improvement came from the IQ 6 transition, supply chain optimization and pricing management. On supply chain optimization we were laser focused on IQ 6 transition in 2017. We successfully executed on multi-sourcing strategies for our micro inverter components and accessories in addition to reducing overhead costs. In short, we went through a major cultural transformation and developed systematic business processes for achieving world class costs with cross functional teams spanning the entire company. We introduced IQ 7 in the first quarter of 2018. We expect IQ 7 transition to be fully complete in 2018, leading to further improvement in our gross margin. It is important to note that IQ 7, is a worldwide product skew and every one of our regions will transition to IQ 7. This is a notable difference from IQ 6, which was primarily a North American product. Another lever that is instrumental in gross margin improvement is pricing management. We have been disciplined in keeping pricing flat for the last couple of quarters. We have a established a dedicated pricing team led by a Senior Executive to underscore its importance. So pricing management in 2017, was focused on transactional control, which is establishing policies and procedures, and executing them rigorously. In 2018, we will focus our efforts on value creation for installers through product segmentation. For example introducing high performance AC modules with our partners. In recent interviews, which we conducted with installers on their AC module experience they reported installation time savings up to 20%, logistic savings up to 10% and simpler inspection procedures when compared to a discrete solution. In summary, we are confident of achieving our 30-20-10 financial model by Q4 2018 with continued cost management via supply chain optimization and IQ transition combined with pricing management. Now turning to the balance sheet, we exited the fourth quarter with a cash balance of $29.1 million and recently closed at $20 million private equity investment. This additional liquidity will allow us to grow our market share as well as accelerate our cost savings initiatives. We have also sharpened our focus on improving AR/AP and inventory management business processes to improve the cash conversion cycle. Bert will go into greater detail about our financial results later in the call. Now turning to our markets. The fourth quarter revenue in the U.S. was up 4% sequentially. We completed the transition to our IQ 6 product for our North American customers during the third quarter, and substantially all fourth quarter inverter shipments in these regions were IQ 6. In Europe, revenue was up 1% sequentially and 66% year-on-year. We maintained our market share lead in France and grew market share in Netherlands. We look forward to introducing IQ in Europe and increasing our served available market by entering Germany and Austria. In the APAC region, revenue increased 51% sequentially as the demand for our products continued to grow and we added to our customer base. India is starting to ramp revenue for us and we expect the business to grow significantly in 2018. Both IQ 6 Plus and IQ 7 Plus are already certified for India. We opened an R&D center in Bangalore, India during the fourth quarter. Our presence in India enables us to leverage the enormous talent available to grow the business worldwide while maintaining control on the OpEx. In addition, we see a growing commercial opportunity for Enphase in India as the country is powering the growth of solar with its ambitious target for clean energy. In the Latin American market, the fourth quarter revenue was down 58%, sequentially as a continued result of the devastating hurricanes in Puerto Rico that occurred last August and September impacting overall shipments to the region. Mexico however remains a strong market for Enphase. Moving on to products. We released IQ 7 in January 2018. IQ 7 is segmented into three variants, the 250-watt AC IQ 7 for 60-cell modules. The 295-watt AC IQ 7 Plus for 60-cell and 72-cell modules and the 320-watt AC IQ 7X for 96-cell modules. Note that IQ 6 was not compatible with 96-cell modules, IQ 7X fills that gap now and makes that market available to us. We have started shipping IQ 7 to our U.S. customers and we expect to start shipping to rest of the word in the second quarter. We are experiencing the industry-wide component shortages in our IQ 7 roll out and we are working diligently through the issues. We recently announced a strategic partnership with Panasonic Corporation of North America for the development of high efficiency AC modules, using our IQ 7X Microinverter, which addresses 96-cell modules. In addition, we are working with several other partners on IQ 7 based AC modules. While IQ 7 provides us with a good platform for growth in 2018 worldwide, IQ 8 based on our grid-agnostic always Ensemble technology has the capability to transform our future by increasing – by creating new market opportunities. So one of solar's biggest challenges is that it is grid-tied. What that means is if the grid is failing and the sun is still shining, there will be no production out of your solar system. To address this limitation we have invented a microinverter technology that is completely grid-agnostic. The Enphase System's capability is further enhanced when the Ensemble technology is incorporated into our AC Battery storage solution. With IQ 8, you can have a system that will continuously provide energy, regardless of the presence or absence of the grid that is solar during the day and storage at night. This is what we refer to as always on. We continue to make progress on IQ 8 during the fourth quarter. The ASIC used in IQ 8 represents many power plant and is the brain of the microinverter. We are pleased to report that the ASIC is fully functional demonstrating the feasibility of Ensemble technology. The ASIC has five million gates and is made in 55-nanometer state-of-the-art technology at TSMC enabling very high speed digital signal processing. We are continuing to productize IQ 8 and we expect to introduce it in 2019. We will update you on IQ 8’s progress over the coming quarters. In summary, we are encouraged by our overall progress in 2017. Our 30-20-10 transformation is going well. We are committed to creating a solid financial foundation with further gross margin expansion and sustained profitability in 2018. I would like to thank our employees for their hard work and dedication and our customers, partners and shareholders for their continued support and interest in Enphase. Now I will turn the call over to Bert for his review of our financial results. Bert?
Bert Garcia: Thanks Badri. I’ll provide more details related to our fourth quarter and fiscal year 2017 financial results as well as our business outlook for the first quarter. As a reminder, the financial measures that I'm going to provide are on a non-GAAP basis unless otherwise noted. Total revenue for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $79.7 million, an increase of 3% sequentially. Total net revenue per DC watt decreased by 11% in the fourth quarter of 2016, consistent with our expectations for year-over-year reductions in ASPs. Total revenue for 2017 was $286.2 million, representing shipments of approximately of 2.9 million microinverters and 837 megawatts DC, a 1% year-over-year decrease in megawatts shipped. We shipped approximately 221 megawatts DC in the fourth quarter of 2017, a decrease in megawatts of 4% sequentially. The megawatts shipped represented 755,000 microinverters, approximately 73% of which were our new IQ Microinverter Systems. As Badri mentioned, we completed the transition to our IQ 6 products for our North American customers during the third quarter, and as a result, substantially all fourth quarter shipments to these regions were our IQ 6 product. Non-inverter revenue, which includes our AC Battery storage solution, Envoy Communications Gateway and all accessories, increased as a percentage of revenue compared to our prior quarter results. Non-GAAP gross margin for the fourth quarter of 2017 was 24.2% compared to 21.8% for the third quarter. We’re pleased with our progress we’ve made with our gross margin expansion. The increase reflects the transition to our IQ Microinverter System in North America and the improvements to-date we've implemented on our supply chain optimization initiatives and pricing management. Gross margin was negatively impacted by approximately 1% related to expedite fees that we incurred because of industry-wide component shortages. Non-GAAP operating expense increased approximately $1 million sequentially, from $16.9 million in Q3 to $18 million in Q4, primarily due to an increase in R&D expenses related to the development of our IQ 8 product. As compared to the fourth quarter of 2016, we reduced non-GAAP operating expense by 22% or $5.5 million, reflecting the cumulative impact of restructuring actions and operational efficiencies we've implemented. Non-GAAP operating expense in the fourth quarter of 2017 excluded $2 million of restructuring charges and $1.2 million of stock-based compensation expense. Non-GAAP operating expense for 2017 was $72.8 million, compared to $107.6 million in 2016. This 32% decrease is reflective of our hard work and commitment towards establishing a solid financial foundation. We believe we've laid the groundwork for 2018 to be successful and grow our business. On a non-GAAP basis, income from operations was $1.3 million, compared to an operating loss of $104,000 in Q3. We're extremely pleased that we’ve achieved non-GAAP operating profitability. Our non-GAAP net income was $683,000, resulting in $0.01 per share, compared to a non-GAAP net loss of $964,000 in Q3, or a loss of $0.01 per share. On a full year basis non-GAAP net loss for 2017 was $20.5 million, or a loss of $0.25 per share, compared to a non-GAAP net loss of $52.4 million, or a loss of $1.06 per share in 2016. The significant year-over-year improvement underscores a substantial work we've done over the past 12 months to solidify our financial footing. Now turning to the balance sheet. Inventory was $26 million for the fourth quarter, compared to $25.3 million in the third quarter and $32 million in the year ago quarter. As Badri mentioned, inventory management is one of our key cash management initiatives in 2018. We exited the quarter with total cash balance of $29.1 million, a slight increase from the Q3 balance. On February 9, we sold approximately 9.5 million shares of the company's common stock, a private equity investment at a price of $2.10 per share for gross proceeds of $20 million. Now let's discuss our outlook for the first quarter of 2018. We expect our revenue for the first quarter of 2018 to be within a range of $65 million to $70 million. Turning to margins, we expect GAAP and non-GAAP gross margin to be within a range of 22% to 25%. Note that our Q1 gross margin guidance includes the negative impact of higher expedite fees resulting from industry-wide component shortages. We expect our non-GAAP operating expense for the first quarter to be within a range of $17.5 million to $18.5 million; and GAAP operating expense to be within a range of $19.5 million to $20.5 million, including an estimated $2 million of stock-based compensation expense. Now I will open up the line for questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Eric Stine from Craig-Hallum. Your line is open.
Eric Stine: Hi, everyone. Maybe to start with the IQ 7, just to confirm, did you say you're rolling that out in Q2? And as we think about some of the new markets you're entering, I mean, which one should we look to be meaningful contributors first maybe in Europe and also in Asia?
Badri Kothandaraman: So let me talk about the IQ 7 rollout. We announced that we're rolling out IQ 7 in Q1 of 2018, which is this quarter. So we've already done that in North America. We are going to rollout IQ 7 in the rest of the word in the second quarter of 2018. And let me remind you of all the benefits of IQ 7. So IQ 7 produces 4% more power is about 17% smaller and 19% lighter than IQ 6 providing value to installers. It is a single worldwide skew so that it improves product velocity and operational efficiency which is inventory. And IQ 7 expands our served available market which is primarily in Europe and Asia Pacific. When I'm talking about Europe, I mean Germany and Austria, when I'm talking about APAC, I mean India. And if you note, the rest of the world product is moving from the fifth generation of microinverter to the seventh generation of microinverter, which is IQ 7. So that is gross margin expansion, and IQ 7 ACM will inherit those benefits. The last one which is icing on the cake is IQ 7X. Note that IQ 6 was not compatible to 96-cell modules, and IQ 7X changes that. Our 320 watt AC IQ 7X is comparable to 96-cell modules and it has 97.5% CEC efficiency. So it addresses a huge portion of the market in North America which was not available to us previously in IQ 6.
Eric Stine: Okay, got it. That is extremely helpful. I guess talking about the benefits there on the installation side and I guess it's also kind of works for AC module as well. You mentioned the positive feedback from installers. Just curious how that is playing in the market given that it sounds like in response to the tariffs that a lot of installers are choosing to absorb that cost rather than pass it on.
Badri Kothandaraman: Yes. So let me start with the AC module. So the AC module provides a lot of value by absorbing the field assembly of the module and microinverter into the factory by integration. You know that we announced ACM partnerships with LG, Jinko, SolarWorld and Waaree in 2017. We started shipping microinverters to our ACM partners from June 2017 and they started rating the channel in October of 2017. We have also involved, I mean, been heavily involved along with our partners in training and evangelizing ACM with installers. I'd like to remind you once again that our interviews with installers have indicated up to 20% savings on installation time and 10% savings on logistics. We are working with a number of other module partners and we'll announce them when we are ready. We already told you about the Panasonic partnership as well for IQ 7X ACM, which addresses 96-cell modules. Let me now come to the 201 case. So the 201 case has created some headwinds on our ACM progress. The tariff inadvertently affects the ACM, while the intention of the tariff was only for sales and modules. So we are actually diligently working on getting exclusion on the microinverter portion of the ACM tariff and we are working with the USTR on that.
Eric Stine: Okay. Is there – I mean, any thoughts on how long that process could be? Display that one by here.
Badri Kothandaraman: Well, we are going to submit our response within the allowed time. We are going to actually submit the response in 30 days, the allowed time is 60 days. And after that I think they will probably take another 30 days –
Raghu Belur: Government process so…
Badri Kothandaraman: Yes. It is a government process, so it's not going to be available.
Eric Stine: Okay, thanks a lot.
Badri Kothandaraman: Yes.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeff Osborne from Cowen and Company. Your line is open.
Jeff Osborne: Hey, good afternoon, guys, and congratulations on the results of margin expansion. I was wondering if you could just touch on the component MOSFET IGBT shortage that you’ve talked about and others have talked about in the space. A two part question; one is how long do you think it will last? And then I think as part of the guidance you talked about that impacting gross margin. Is there anyway to quantify what that impact is?
Raghu Belur: Yes. So let me give you some color on the components shortages, I'll give you a little bit of history as well. We experienced significant component shortages throughout 2017. These components shortages were mainly on high voltage FETs and on memories. Our gross margin was negatively impacted by 1% to 2% due to expedite fees in Q3 2017 and Q4 2017. In Q1 2018 we see continued pressure on the same components. In fact, we think this component shortage will persist throughout 2018 and even into early 2019. And it is a top priority for us as a management team. We are always working on a three horizon framework to tackle this. In the short-term it’s basically hustle like hell which is blocking and tackling. In the medium-term, create viable options, look at alternate sources, make our design more flexible, even changing layout. And in the long-term, given our improved liquidity provision, creating long-term supply agreements with our partners. So to answer your question, I expect the same 1% to 2% impact to gross margin in Q1 of 2018. And we incorporated that in our guidance.
Jeff Osborne: Yes. I was just going to say, I mean, you knew about the shortage in 2017 in the spring I think it started. So I assume that's factored in the 30-20-10 plan or should we discount that by a few points?
Raghu Belur: No, you should not discount that. It is already factored into our 30-20-10.
Jeff Osborne: Okay. Wanted to double check on that. And then can you just talk about the cadence of OpEx throughout the year? Is the McKinsey study still going on? And how does that progresses the second half evolves?
Bert Garcia: The McKinsey study is done. It was finished in Q4 of 2017. So let me give you a little bit of color on our OpEx. We have reduced our OpEx significantly from $1.08 million in 2016 to $73 million in 2017. Our current OpEx is a little bit high. It is at 22% of revenue. I would like it to be at a model of 20% consistent with the 30-20-10 operating model. And we have certain investments that we want to make on the IQ 7 – I mean, on the IQ 8 platform which we’re not going to compromise. With that in mind, we also established a R&D center in India, where we do expect to get to our long-term 20% OpEx target and have absolute – and have the adequate capacity.
Jeff Osborne: Perfect. Thank you, that’s all I had.
Bert Garcia: Okay, thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Brad Meikle from AMPAC. Your line is open.
Brad Meikle: Hi, gents, how you’re doing? Can you talk a little bit about just with the IQ 7 on the IQ 6 road map? How the things are going with your customers? And how does that – how do you view your market share trending in 2018? And also along with that how do you see the end market growing? Thanks.
Badri Kothandaraman: Right. IQ 7 like what I said, it produces more power. It is 17% smaller, 19% lighter than IQ 6. So it provides intrinsic value. It’s a single worldwide SKU. And extremely important there is the single hardware SKU and every country is a software profile. So it's a software configurable architecture. And so therefore in terms of product velocity operational efficiency, in terms of managing inventor IQ 7 will be fantastic. IQ 7 increases ours served available market in Europe and Asia Pacific. We are going to – go after new markets in Germany, and as well as Austria, and mainly India. As I told you, the rest of the world is moving from not the sixth generation but the fifth generation till the seventh generation. So you can see the intrinsic gross margin expansion which we are so focused on. Getting to 30-20-10, achieving 10% profit by the end of Q4 2018 is the top most priority for us. And we talked about IQ 7 – I mean, we talked about ACM in general, an IQ 7 based ACM will inherit a lot of these benefits. And now to talk about IQ 7X, that will address about 500 megawatts of market in North America, which was not previously available to us, now it's available. And with our focus on long tail and high performance IQ 7X, it's consistent with our strategy of expanding gross margin.
Brad Meikle: So how does the IQ 7X compared to the SolarBridge solution that SunPower is shipping today for their 96-cell modules. Could you give us a sense for what the performance characteristics and price differences may be?
Raghu Belur: Hi, Brad, this is Raghu. I think performance wise it's a much more efficient, the CEC efficiency of the SunPower SolarBridge product I believe it's 95% or 95.5% and we are 97.5%. That’s a pretty substantial improvement in efficiency and efficiency as you know also drives things such as – of course drives energy yield, but also drives the participation and reliability as well. Obviously we are driving our cost down affectively through silicon integration, the IQ 7 actually has a new AC on it compared to even the IQ 6, we went from a 2.8 million gate ASIC to a 3.8 million gate ASIC on the IQ 7 and the IQ 7X has the same ASIC as well. So I can say that we are driving our cost on of course price is a very complex thing to talk about and can’t talk about it on this way.
Brad Meikle: Excellent, thanks. And I guess that – how quickly do you think that the IP7 could ramp in some of these new geographies like India and Germany.
Badri Kothandaraman: Well, so let me talk a little bit about the timing of the IQ 7 transition. Like what I said, we have introduced IQ 7 in North America in the first quarter of 2018 already. So IQ 7 is shipping as we speak. We expect to introduce IQ 7 to rest of the world in the second quarter. And we are very careful in ramping our new products because Enphase stands for quality and reliability first. So we want to make sure that we do a lot of beta testing in the rest of the word and then we release the product in a controlled fashion, which is why IQ 7 is a complex transition for the rest of the world. And the entire supply chain of IQ 7 will ramp up in the next six months. While I did talk about the supply constraints, we are mitigating those constraints by qualifying additional sources and making the design flexible and we expect to mitigate those issues in the next four to six months. So that's basically the color on the transition.
Brad Meikle: Thank you. My last question is on the growth rate of the market. If you look at your regional customers I think are that growing the most rapidly across a sector. They're doing obviously better than SolarCity who has been in decline for the last year or so. Can you characterize what you're seeing in terms of your increases likely to be seen this year for the small and medium sized customers that have been taking share from the larger nationwide TPO installers thanks.
Badri Kothandaraman: I'll probably give you a little bit of color on market share in North America. We believe we are holding share in North America. And the way we think about market share, let me actually elaborate on that. Our top priority is to build a solid financial foundation. We are focused on consistent profitability than growing market share at any cost. We are consciously walking away from empty caloried business that is very low margin businesses. Our products are actually ideal for long tail installers who value our ease of use high quality. And we are introducing high performance products such as IQ 7X, IQ 7 based ACM which are ideal for the long-term I mean long tailed markets. So, we expect the long tail markets to grow significantly and we have the ideal products for that. And we expect that to be a significant expansion in our gross margin.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Philip Shen from Roth Capital Partners. Your line is open.
Philip Shen: Hi guys, good work on the steady execution. First question, is on the IQ 7 roll out, just to put a finer point on things Badri, would it be possible to give us a sense of what the mix of products might be by quarter. Historically, you guys have done that with prior generations of a product release, by when do you think we could see a 100% IQ 7 mix for example. And all along, the way what the quarters possibly look like in Q2, Q3 and so forth. Thanks.
Badri Kothandaraman: So I'll just give you some color on the IQ 6 transition, then I'll talk about IQ 7 transition so you get the full picture. The IQ 6 transition took us three to four quarters to complete. The IQ 7 platform it uses the same accessories as IQ 6 for North America. However the IQ 7 platform is brand new in the rest of the world. It is a huge learning curve for the rest of the world. We think therefore in combination the IQ 7 transition will take us approximately three to four quarters. We expect to complete the IQ 7, transition by the fourth quarter of 2018. Like, what I said we have already started shipping in North America in this quarter. We expect to introduce it in rest of the word in Q2 of 2018 and we are confident of meeting our 30-20-10 by Q4 of 2018.
Philip Shen: Great and then you mentioned a couple times earlier already that there's possibly meaningful margin benefit as the rest of the world converts to IQ 7 since they're coming from the me Gen Fiber and 250 so can you quantify in some fashion what that margin benefit might be.
Badri Kothandaraman: Yes, I am going to talk about gross margin in general. So we have three levers on gross margin. The pricing management, the supply chain optimization, and IQ 7 transition. On pricing management, we are focused like what I said in the prepared remarks on transactional control. In 2017, and then 2018 will be about offering high value products like IQ 7X and IQ 7 based ACM. On supply chain optimization, we are focused not only on the micro inverter but also focused heavily on cost reducing the accessories as well as reducing our overhead. And note that a significant portion of our revenue does come from accessories. So it's important for us to control cost there. In terms of overhead, we are looking at all aspects which is variance, logistics warranty and are tackling those. The last one is obviously IQ 7 transition, which has clearer benefit in terms of BOM reduction, in terms of SAM expansion in terms of IQ 7X but it is not the only thing in our gross margin expansion. So bottom line we are changing the way we work on pricing and cost. It is not just about IQ 7, in combination of these three things, which is Pricing Management supply chain optimization and IQ 7 transition we will get to the 30-20-10 by Q4 2018.
Philip Shen: Great, one last one here for me. I think if you look at the blended company numbers the blended ASP from Q3 was about $0.38 and in Q4 $0.41 if my numbers are right there. So you actually have had some degree of perhaps price increase and some of our discussions with customers have been that you've been able to actually been raising some pricing out there perhaps not the MSRP necessarily but reducing the rebates out there. So historically, we see a 7% to 10% price erosion year-on-year, clearly we're not in that situation now. In fact it might be going the other way. How do you expect, and I know pricing discipline and management is a core part of your strategy as you just mentioned but as you look at ahead, do you expect ASPs to continue to rise or should we just should we expect a flat kind of curve ahead.
Badri Kothandaraman: Right that's a good question. Our revenue includes a mix of inverter and non-inverter sales. But non-inverter revenue was up sequentially as a percentage of our mix compared to Q3. Our non-inverter revenue when I defined that, that's basically your accessories which is Envoy, Combiner box and the AC battery. So you got to be careful in looking at those numbers to draw a conclusion. But what we are doing is very clear. We are walking away from empty calorie businesses. We are focused on profitability, as a company. We will achieve 30-20-10 by Q4 of 2018. So having said that, I believe we maintain pricing flat for the last couple of quarters. And what's our strategy in 2018? We have modeled a 2% reduction every quarter in 2018. So that's what we've modeled and all our financials, all our operating plan 30-20-10 et cetera takes into account that. And we are focused like what I said on value creating products like IQ 7X like IQ 7 based ACM, like IQ 8, which will come in 2019, which is an enormous differentiator for us. So that's our focus.
Philip Shen: Great. That color and detail is very helpful. I’ll pass it on.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Colin Rusch from Oppenheimer. Your line is open.
Colin Rusch: Thanks so much guys, you talked a little bit about the high voltage sets. Can you talk specifically about silicone carbide sourcing and any sort of mitigation that you're doing around TV demand for those materials to mitigate any sort of price increases.
Raghu Belur: So, yes this is a Raghu. As Badri mentioned about industry wide components shortage on the high voltage sets and memory as well. We actually do not use silicon carbide diodes in this IP generation of the product.
Colin Rusch: Ever so that's hook-on and then can you talk a little bit about the pricing dynamics and the AC module offering and how that’s supporting your price dynamics as you go through the balance of 2018.
Badri Kothandaraman: Right. So in terms of the AC modules, so basically I talk to you about the interviews with installers. And in the interviews with installers, that so far indicated up to 20% savings in installation time, up to 10% savings in logistics. And these are clear value levers for the AC module that offer clear benefits to the installers. And therefore, when we discuss pricing – our partners it basically takes into account this value. And we make sure that we share some of this value with the installers as well.
Colin Rusch: Okay, I'll take the rest of it offline thanks guys.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Edwin Mok from Needham & Company. Your line is open.
Edwin Mok: Hi guys, thanks for taking my question. So first just since we talked about ACM just a follow-up, is there a way to think about how much your volume has been on each side it sounds like 440 ships on products ACM already right and with IQ 7 coming do you have a target percentage of the sale that will come from ACM that you see exiting this year.
Bert Garcia: Hi Edwin, its Burt. So we're not breaking out discretely volumes for ACM at this point but as we've mentioned we are very excited about the progress we're making and as noted in our recent announcement with Panasonic, I think there is equal excitement with some of our partners that this is a product category that has tremendous upside and tremendous promise. So, again as this develops, we'll continue to talk about and give you guys as much color as possible. At this point, we're not breaking it out.
Edwin Mok: Okay, that's fair. And then for the quarter, your non-inverter sales went up, right. Is that the way to think about and maybe you can help us by explaining what part of your non-inverter sales was – what product was driving that growth, is it just still happen if you are buying more combiner box this quarter or do you have growth in battery this quarter. I think the progress has been helpful a little bit and maybe just kind of tied to battery. What are you guys seeing in the market as adoption and what do you think can change that…
Badri Kothandaraman: Yes, we are seeing an uptick in ACB sales, compared to the previous quarter. And the uptick we are seeing quarter-on-quarter comes from both Europe as well as Australia. And solar plus storage is extremely central to our strategy as we develop IQ 8 and we remain committed to it. With regarding the other portion on the accessories, yes, we ship a little bit more combiner boxes as well as on voice in Q4 of 2017. Yes, that's correct.
Edwin Mok: Okay, great. That’s helpful. And then last question, I have on the 30-20-10 model, right. If I look at this quarter OpEx, in your OpEx guidance as you said your OpEx ticking up a little bit right, that would push your revenue to hit your 30-20-10 number to kind of like $19 million range, right. If that would be 20% OpEx being $18 million, is that how we are thinking about the 30-20-10 model now. I just want to make sure, I understand that correctly.
Badri Kothandaraman: Yes, so that’s certainly one way to look at it, of course we aren’t going to be providing guidance beyond the next quarter. But yes, I mean if you just do the simple math, I think you could probably back into it that way. Again, the most important thing is we are absolutely committed and confident in our ability to get to 30-20-10, I think that’s kind of bottom line, if you haven’t pick that up, that is definitely what we're focused on.
Edwin Mok: Okay, great. That’s all I have. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Pavel Molchanov from Raymond James. Your line is open.
Pavel Molchanov: Thanks for the taking the question, you alluded to the tariff issue on AC module imported into the U.S. I’m curious just mechanically, how would you get an exemption for a product that is physically attached to an imported module that is otherwise covered by the tariff. I mean, it seems like just administratively that might be a bit of a half of now?
Raghu Belur: Hi, this is Raghu. So let me give you some color on that. So clearly the ACM is the very natural technological evolution to the standalone microinverter and because of the value that it provides by absorbing all the field assembly into the factory. Now the 201 case has inadvertently affected the ACM by the ad valorem ruling. But if you go back to what being tend to the 201 was it was limited to certain modules and inverters should be outside the scope of 201. However, the government has unintentionally created this situation so of course increasing the cost of our micro by 30%, only in an ACM case, incentivizes the string inverter technology as an example. So doing that is very bad for innovation and step backwards in terms of the advancement of technology and clearly that was not what the intent of the government was, right. So what's the good news here is the USTR has now published a process for exclusion and that process for exclusion is a detailed explanation and reasoning for exclusion via a questionnaire. And they have given us some time to go submit all of the details behind it. And they've given us 60 days to do it and we're going to turn around and do it in the next 30 days. We also looked at the mechanics of how this exclusion can take place, if you think about how the customs and border patrol, how they would tariff it. There's actually some precedents here back in the days memory devices had the similar issue and they established a process for separating out the two values and then taxing or tariffing the value appropriate to the right component. In our case, it would be the DC module. Then the unlikely event that such an exclusion is not granted, we have an alternate path. So one of the key features of our ACM solution is that micro is detachable from the module. So what this means that the module can be connected to the microinverter after importing the DC module into the U.S. So while this will increase the cost a little bit but it will be much less than the 30% of the tariff.
Pavel Molchanov: Okay, interesting. So that's plan B I suppose.
Raghu Belur: Yes.
Pavel Molchanov: Regarding the battery, when you talk about your margin structure including the 30-20-10 target, what assumptions does that make for the profitability of the battery or is it just so small in your sales mix that it doesn't really matter either way?
Raghu Belur: Well, although we are seeing an uptick in the ACB sales, it is still a small percentage of our sales mix. We are working like what I said we are working on IQ 8. And IQ 8 as a platform will have a new AC Battery configuration. And that will come out in 2019, it will have a great cost structure but for now it is the low percentage of our sales.
Pavel Molchanov: Okay, understood. Appreciate it guys.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Vishal Shah from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
Vishal Shah: Hi, thanks for taking my question. Can you talk about the margin profile of your shipments in the U.S. versus the international markets? And also in the first quarter or the first half of the year, what percentage of your shipments will be to the U.S. market?
Badri Kothandaraman: Yes, so hey, [indiscernible]. So broadly speaking, our shipments – our products shipments in rest of world are perhaps slightly less margin reach than the U.S. products, just are very, very small though and its really related to the configuration of those products. So again not significant differences there, with respect to the mix. U.S. versus rest of the world, it's still about 70/30.
Vishal Shah: So you still expect U.S. shipments to be 30% in the first half?
Badri Kothandaraman: That's right.
Vishal Shah: Is the industry showing any signs of slowdown post the 201 case until you get some clarity on the ACM ruling or not really?
Badri Kothandaraman: So we're not seeing much impact on U.S. Reg related to the 201 trade case. As Raghu mentioned, there is a little bit of uncertainty with respect to the ACM product. With respect to again to that exclusion but as you mentioned, we're working very, very quickly to work through that and to relieve that uncertainty. But no, we're not seeing a big impact at all with respect to 201 at this point.
Vishal Shah: And what percentage of your Q4 shipments were from ACM?
Badri Kothandaraman: We're not breaking that out as I had mentioned before.
Vishal Shah: Okay. And then as far as the non-inverter revenues, if I can say like, how should we think about the margin profile of that part of the business. And when do you think it's going to be meaningful enough for you to report a separate percentage of the mix?
Badri Kothandaraman: So in terms of when we think we're going to have enough data or when we're going to start breaking out its percentage of mix. That's a good question, I'm not sure we're prepared to do at this point. What was your first question, Vishal, remind me.
Vishal Shah: What is the margin profile of that business relative to your inverters, I mean is it similar margin or better margin?
Badri Kothandaraman: Yes, again, sorry Vishal, we're not prepared to break out the margin differential between the inverter and non-inverter.
Vishal Shah: Okay. And one final question, as you approach this 30-20-10 model, how should we think about the cash inflation profile of the business. I mean are you going to be cash flow positive for the rest of the year through every single quarter or that was going to take some time?
Badri Kothandaraman: So if you've noticed over the last several quarters, our cash has been improving, holding aside even the $20 million recent investment. Our cash has been improving in the sense that we've been reducing burn sequentially every quarter. We see that improving in 2018, again a lot of the work we've done to restructure the company continues and will continue to bear fruit into 2018. Again we talk about it as a process, not an event and that process will continue into 2018. And we will yield benefits certainly not only in terms of profitability but in terms of cash flow as well. We've said I think pretty consistently that we believe 2018 will be a year where we get sustainably profitable. And I think that follows through the cash as well.
Vishal Shah: Good. Thank you.
Badri Kothandaraman: Yes, you bet.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And I am showing no further questions from our phone lines. I would now like to turn the conference back over to Badri Kothandaraman for any closing remarks.
Badri Kothandaraman: So thank you for joining us today. We have stabilized our cash position and are very pleased to be profitable in the fourth quarter of 2017. And we are working hard to achieve our 30-20-10 model in Q4 2018 and creating a solid financial foundation. We look forward to speaking with you again in the next couple of months.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program, you may all disconnect. Everyone have a wonderful day.

Now, I'd like to introduce Badri Kothandaraman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Enphase Energy. Badri?
Badri Kothandaraman,: Good afternoon and thanks you for joining us today to discuss our third quarter 2017 financial results. So, we had a good quarter. Our 30, 20, 10 transformation is going very well. We were almost breakeven in non-GAAP operating income during the third quarter and we have stabilized our cash position. We reported revenue of $77 million for the third quarter of 2017, an increase of 3% compared to the second quarter of 2017. We shipped approximately 231 megawatts or 790,000 microinverters. Our GAAP gross margin was 21.4% and non-GAAP gross margin was 21.8%. Our focus on operational excellence resulted in gross margin expansion, lower OpEx and overall improvement to our financial position in the third quarter. We're laser focused on further gross margin improvement through supply chain optimization, new product introduction and pricing management and are on track to reach our 30, 20, 10 target operating model by the fourth quarter of 2018. Bert will go into greater detail about our financial results later in the call. So, turning to our market. The third quarter revenue in the U.S. was up 2% sequentially. We completed the transition to IQ 6 product for our U.S. and Latin American customers during the quarter and nearly all fourth quarter inverter shipments to these regions will be the IQ 6 products. Shipments for AC module product also increased sequentially. In the Latin American market, the third quarter revenue was down 9% sequentially as a result of the devastating hurricane in Puerto Rico at the end of the quarter, which impacted overall shipments to the region. We look forward to playing a key role in the future as the island rebuilds and diversifies its electrical infrastructure. Raghu, our Chief Product Officer will provide details later in the call on a key technology that will be central to this effort. In the APAC region, the revenue increased 35% sequentially as the demand for our products continued to grow. We established new partnerships with distributors, installers and module manufacturers in India during the quarter resulting in our first shipments to the region. In Europe, revenue was up 3% sequentially and 114% year-over-year. The third quarter was a record quarter for unit shipments and revenue in the region as we continue to grow our customer base. Moving on to products, we believe the IQ 6 microinverter system and our AC modules will help drive profitable growth with new and existing partners, thus increasing our share of market. We remain focused on operational blocking and tackling to achieve this goal. With the introduction of what IQ 7 product in the first quarter of 2018, we expect to grow revenue by increasing out served available market. IQ 7 will be a single world-wide product skew that allows us to penetrate new markets in Europe, Asia Pacific and Latin America, while also helping to drive gross margin expansion. In summary, we are pleased with our overall progress during the past three months. My top priorities over the next six months are to improve cash flow, further expand gross margin with the introduction of IQ 7 worldwide and achieve sustained profitability, creating a solid financial foundation. We will also continue to provide customers with the value, quality and customer service they’ve come to expect from Enphase. With that, I would like to turn the call over to Raghu, our Chief Product Officer to provide an expanded update on our products.
Raghu Belur: Thanks, Badri. As part of our commitment to deliver increased value to our customers, we transitioned over the past few quarters from our M-series to our IQ series product. IQ is an integrated solar, storage and energy management platform that enables self-consumption and delivers our core value proposition of yielding more energy, simplifying design and installation and improving system availability uptime and reliability. In addition, IQ provides advanced grid functions that are capable of meeting worldwide regulatory requirements. IQ also enables our AC module product further simplifying the installation process, reducing installation time and streamlining logistics. IQ 6 delivers more power and higher efficiency, while further reducing the balance of system cost due to its simplified wiring, reduced size and weight. Much of IQ 6 performance was achieved by silicon integration with our new ASIC. With IQ 7 we will yet again offer greater power and a smaller, lighter and easier to install product. What is unique about our IQ 7 is that it's a single worldwide skew, achieved as a result of our software defined architecture. Similar to IQ 6, we have developed a new ASIC for IQ 7 that enables greater semiconductor integration. Solar plus storage, which includes our AC battery product is central to our product strategy. Our storage business continues to expand worldwide because of the unique features of our AC battery solution. We believe the storage market will continue to improve over the next 12 months as cost come down and as utilities better understand how to incorporate distributed storage on to the grid. Now let me talk about our next generation IQ 8 product expected to be introduced in 2019 based on our always on technology called Ensemble. One of solar's biggest challenges is that it is grid tied. What this means is that if the grid fails and the sun is still shining, there will be no production out of your solar system. Most customers are unaware of this limitation with today's solar technology. So, to address this limitation we have invented a microinverter technology that is completely grid agnostic. This means that even if the grid fails and there is sufficient sunlight, the Enphase system will continue to produce energy and meet the demands of the home or business. The Enphase microinverter system's capabilities further enhanced when the Ensemble technology is incorporated into our AC battery storage solution. With IQ 8 you can have a system that will continuously produce energy, regardless of the presence or absence of the grid that is storage during the day -- sorry, solar during the day and storage at night. That is what we mean by always on and it can address challenges like those experienced in Puerto Rico, other island nations and countries with weak grids. We also believe IQ 8 will grow our total addressable market worldwide. For example, there are over 1.2 billion people with limited or no access to energy in regions such as India and Africa. IQ 8 is uniquely positioned to address the energy challenges inherent in these and other regions of the world. We'll continue to update you on IQ 8's progress over the coming quarters. Now I'll turn the call over to Bert for his review of our financial results.
Bert Garcia: Thanks Raghu. I'll provide more details related to our third quarter 2017 financial results as well as our business outlook for the fourth quarter. As a reminder, the financial measures that I am going to provide are on a non-GAAP unless otherwise noted. Total revenue for the third quarter of 2017 was $77 million, an increase of 3% sequentially. Total net revenue per DC watt was unchanged from the prior quarter, reflecting relatively stable ASP's. On a year-over-year basis, total net revenue for DC watt decreased by 11%, directionally consistent with the broad reduction in ASP's. We shipped approximately 231 megawatts DC in the third quarter 2017, an increase in megawatt of 3% sequentially and a decrease in megawatts of 3% on a year-over-year basis. The megawatt shipped represented 790,000 microinverters, approximately 6% of which were our new IQ microinverter system. As Badri mentioned, we completed the transition to IQ 6 product for our U.S. and Latin American customers during the third quarter and as a result nearly all fourth quarter shipments to these regions will be our IQ 6 product. Non-inverter revenue which includes our 18-battery storage solution, Envoy Communications Gateway and all accessories, was consistent as a percent of revenue with our prior quarter results. Non-GAAP gross margin for the third quarter of 2017 was 21.8% compared to 18.4% in the second quarter. Non-GAAP gross margin excludes approximately $347,000 of stock-based compensation. The improved gross margin reflects the transition to our IQ microinverter system in North America as well as the improvements to-date that we have implemented on our supply chain optimization initiatives. The improvement to our gross margin was slightly offset by approximately negative 1.8% related to expert IPs that we incurred as a result of industry-wide component shortages mentioned on our Q2 call. Non-GAAP operating expense decreased $865,000 sequentially from $17.8 million in Q2 to $16.9 million in Q3. As compared to the year ago quarter, we reduced non-GAAP operating expense by 41% or $11.7 million, reflecting the cumulative impact of restructuring actions and operational efficiencies we've implement. Non-GAAP operating expense in the third quarter of 2017 excludes $4.1 million of restructuring charges and $1.4 million of stock-based compensation expense. On a non-GAAP basis, income from operations was essentially breakeven with a loss of $102,000 compared to an operating loss of $4 million in Q2. We're extremely pleased with the progress we've made on operating income and have increased confidence in our ability to achieve non-GAAP operating profitability in the fourth quarter. Our non-GAAP net loss was $964,000 resulting in a loss of $0.01 per share compared to a net loss of $6.6 million in Q2 or a loss of $0.08 per share now. Now turning to the balance sheet, inventory levels were $25.3 million for the third quarter compared to $20.8 million in the second quarter and $39.1 million in the year ago quarter. Inventory levels increased from the second quarter, primarily a result of the timing of shipments. We exited the quarter with a total cash balance of $28.9 million, a slight decrease from the Q2 balance. We expect to be cash flow positive in the fourth quarter. Now let's look at our outlook for the fourth quarter 2017. We expect our revenue for the fourth quarter of 2017 built in a range of $72 million to $80 million. Turning to margins, we expect GAAP and non-GAAP gross margin to be within a range of 21.5% to 24.5%. Note that our Q4 gross margin guidance includes the negative impact of higher expedited fees resulting from industry-wide component shortages. Non-GAAP gross margin excludes approximately $300,000 of stock-based compensation expense. We expect our GAAP operating expense for the fourth quarter to be within a range of $19.5 million to $21.5 million and non-GAAP operating expense to be within a range of $16 million to $18 million excluding an estimated $1.4 million of stock-based compensation expense and approximately $2.1 million of additional restructuring expense. I'll note that we do not expect to incur significant restructuring expense beyond the fourth quarter. At the midpoint of our guidance range, we expect to be profitable on a non-GAAP operating income basis in Q4. With that, I'll open up the line for questions.
Operator: [Operator instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Eric Stine with Craig Hallum. Your line is now open.
Eric Stine: Hi everyone. Thanks for taking the question or the questions. Maybe just starting with the AC modules, maybe just some commentary on early returns and are you still targeting an additional module partner by the end of the year?
Badri Kothandaraman: So, let me give you some color on AC module. This is Badri. We started shipping AC modules to LG in the second quarter of 2017. We said in the June Analyst Day Presentation, that we shipped about 18,000 units to LG. Our shipment increased sequentially in Q3 of '17. LG if you know introduced the IQ 6+ neon AC module in July. That product is making its way through the channels now. It's too early to say but we've done a lot of interviews with the installers and those interviews have been -- those interviews have been very encouraging. There is clear savings on installation time as well as streamlined logistics on the ACM. We announced the Jinko Eagle in IQ 6 AC module at SBI and we expect to start shipping that shortly. We also announced Waaree, a module partner in India. We are working with a few other partners as well and will announce when we're ready.
Eric Stine: Okay. Sticking with India with Waaree, is that a little bit different version of what you're able to talk about? Is that a little different version or scaled-down version versus LG or Jinko and if so, is that something that you're working to replicate with other partners in different markets?
Badri Kothandaraman: No, it's not a scale down or a different version. We have a AC module product strategy and it is in line with all the other partners as well, the only difference being LG would be -- is a 60-cell module and Waaree will be a 72-cell module because in India primary the market segment is 72. What's really good is that the IQ 6 Plus blood and the IQ 7 Plus product works on the same product works on both 60 cell and 72 cell module.
Eric Stine: Got it. Okay. Thanks for that color. Maybe last question for me. Just an update on installer trends, you mentioned the good feedback you're getting early with LG, but clearly things moving to Tier 2 and Tier 3 installers. So just any thoughts or color there would be helpful, thanks a lot.
Badri Kothandaraman: Yeah, we're continuing to reach out to all the installers who have either done the installs as well as we are on roadshows collecting data and the feedback has been pretty consistent. The value is there, the installed time value, logistics value, the good matching between the power production because of the inverter and the module being closely matched. And then quantitatively speaking, good quality installed as well because it's a very fast and very clean install. So, lot of outreach is going on. We're on the road right now showing it to all number of the longtail installers as well. So, the feedback has been good.
Eric Stine: And just market share there, just overall share with Tier 2 and Tier 3. Any thoughts on how that's trended. I know you gave an update at the Analyst Day but maybe anything that might be refresh over the last couple months?
Badri Kothandaraman: No, it's too early to tell at this time.
Eric Stine: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from line of Brad Meikle with Coker Palmer. Your line is now open.
Brad Meikle: Hey guys. Good afternoon. First question is do you think that the revenues you were able to achieve this quarter were limited by the 201-case impact, which has increased module prices and made them more scarce in some cases and also due to the component shortages that you have?
Raghu Belur: So, hey Brad. No, I think there's been a lot of concern around the 201 case and as I think everybody saw, the preliminary recommendation that were made were certainly looking punitive than everybody was expecting, but that's good news. That said, looking at third quarter, we really didn't see any impact related to 201 in terms of revenue shipments. Although the second part of your question was income shortages.
Brad Meikle: If revenue is limited, we're limited by component availability.
Badri Kothandaraman: So, Brad, the revenue was not limited by component shortages, but what we -- but the gross margin was limited. As we noted, the Q3 gross margin was negatively impacted by about 1.8% resulting from expedite fees and those expedite fees were a result of us having to air ships compared to ocean ships. And in Q4 '17 we still see continued present on memories and high-voltage feds and that's why we said, we expect to incur expedite fees in Q4 '17 as well. We are putting in some business processes in place like qualifying multiple sources as mitigation actions, but we really need the supply situation to improve and at this point, we see the situation persisting into the first half of 2018.
Brad Meikle: Yeah, it sounds like lead times have come down already for the feds, but on IQ 7, is there a -- what portion of the market would you say is a high-voltage modules that had not really been suitably served by your power rating on the M280 or the IQ 6, like how much more market does it open up to you?
Raghu Belur: Sure hey, thanks Brad, this is Raghu. One of the nice things about again the IQ 7 being a universal black farm house, like a worldwide skew is that it does open up the market for the 96-cell module as well. So, in that there are a couple of players who are doing 96-cell modules as well. So, Panasonic is now entered the market with a 96-cell product. We already know there's another player here lately who is also a 96-cell product, but the IQ 7 does open up those markets for us as well from a technology point of view.
Brad Meikle: Yeah, yeah, I think it's about a quarter of a third of U.S. residential market probably is that right?
Raghu Belur: Yeah probably upside order or little bit less actually.
Brad Meikle: Okay. And this is last question, thanks for the time, on the IQ 8 could you talk a little bit more about the types of companies that are currently serving this market? I've read about half-dozen that are well-capitalized in Africa doing small 1-10 installations that enable light and some articles have talked about a AC output enabling air-conditioning and refrigeration, which is limited by the current DC output. So, I would love to hear any more about the dynamics of what you see out there in that market?
Raghu Belur: I think it's Africa and there is also India as well. I think there are number of players. Go to market is the problem that needs to be solved there. I think we have solved the technology problem. So clearly there are -- we were seeing that both in India and Africa and in India, there are a number of companies that are working on the go-to-market problem and have had varying degrees of success there. So yes, that are a number of companies that are out there. They're not making any announcements at this time.
Brad Meikle: All right. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Philip Shen with Roth Capital Partners. Your line is now open.
Philip Shen: Hey guys. Thanks for the questions. First one here is on the IQ 7. I think in your release, you talk about getting that out there in Q1 '18 so what do you expect the mix of IQ 6 and IQ 7 to be starting Q1 '18 and how do you expect that mix to trend as we go through 2018?
Badri Kothandaraman: Just to give you some color on IQ 6, the IQ 6 transition took us three quarters to complete. We expect the IQ 7 transition to take a similar time, may be a little bit lesser. A new product transition as you know is always tough to predict, but we're doing a lot of detailed planning to counter surprises. Having said that the IQ 6 the IQ 7 uses the same balanced system as IQ 6. So that will make it a little bit easier. And also, one more thing is the transitioning for example IQ 7 to North American customers is going to be easier than transitioning wildlife. So, I expect that to be done faster maybe in a couple of quarters compared to world-wide. That might take full three quarters timeframe. So more to come there, but we are planning -- we're doing a lot detailed planning.
Philip Shen: Good. Thanks, Badri and if you can remind us or update us on what kind of margin benefits we should see as you fully transition from IQ 6 to IQ 7?
Badri Kothandaraman: So, as I told you we're focused on building a healthy financial foundation and we are laser focused on gross margin and operational excellence leading to profitability. We told you that we will reach the 30, 20, 10 target operating margin by Q4 of '18 and we are on track to do so. The 30, 20, 10 stands for 30% gross margin, 20% OpEx and 10% operating income. The IQ 7 transition will not only help in improving gross margin, but will also help to expand the served available market into more regions in Europe and Asia Pacific to increase the top line and we also see the ACM as an important driver of the IQ 7 platform. So, with the IQ 7 with all the supply chain optimizations that we are doing, we expect to reach our target operating model by the timeframe that we said, which is Q4 of '18.
Philip Shen: Okay. Great. So, moving the question to the top line that I think you blended ASP decline in the quarter was roughly 12% year-on-year, do you continue to expect that rate of decline. I think that was for Q3. So, do you continue to expect that for Q4 and what are you seeing now for Q1 and what do you expect for 2018?
Badri Kothandaraman: Well for 2018 we have a number of factors I'll come to that later, but for Q4 I see the pricing pretty stable at about 2% erosion a quarter. So, in 2018 I have a couple of factors which could contribute to the pricing environment. One is an [Sunny] case. We all don't know what the final outcome is going to be in January. So that could influence that. And the second one is a potential Huawei entry in the middle of 2018. If I pretend that those two were not there, I expect a pretty stable pricing environment, similar to 2017.
Philip Shen: Okay. Good. And finally, as it relates to your non-GAAP profitability, it sounds you are in check for Q4, I know you haven’t provided guidance for '18, but do all signs give you a sense that you can maintain that for '18 and what are the puts and takes maybe just mentioned a couple with the 201 and Huawei, but how are you thinking about profitability as we go through '18?
Bert Garcia: Hey Phil, it's Bert. You're right that we did signal non-GAAP profitability to the midpoint of the range for the fourth quarter. If we transition out into 2018, you're right, we don't provide guidance out that far, but clearly the work we've done to date to restructure is begin to yield significant benefits for us. And if we think about the transition to IQ 7 that's certainly going to continue to help, not only margin expansion but also help grow the topline. As Badri mentioned, the IQ 7 does open up a couple of new markets that's certainly helpful, but bear in mind, a lot of the work we've done around restructuring even here in the tail end of 2017 will continue to bear fruit out in 2018. It's more of a process non-event so to speak. So, we do expect to continue to see benefit from our broad supply chain optimization and our focus and operational excellence also continue to help move margins and profitability along in 2018.
Philip Shen: Great. Thanks Bert. I'll pass it on.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Edwin Mok with Needham & Company. Your line is now open.
Edwin Mok: Great. Thanks for taking my question. First just in terms of 4Q guidance, can you talk a little about your puts and takes on that? It seems like your guidance is flattish right and mostly just seasonality in the fourth quarter or do you see the margin recovering after this 201 is settled, do you have any color on that?
Badri Kothandaraman: So, I think what you're seeing in our guidance really is us holding share. So, we're thinking about it, but more importantly what you're seeing at one is some pricing discipline. We're being very, very, very disciplined on pricing, optimizing for profitable to well and that is of course reflected in our topline guidance. In terms of puts and takes again as I mentioned to Brad, I am not seeing any impact from them on our topline that's not really factoring our guidance. So, it really is a factor of us holding share and being disciplined on pricing.
Edwin Mok: Okay. That's helpful. And then maybe talk a little about gross margin, given that you have this excess could happen because of the shortage right, how much impact have you factored out into your gross margin guidance and do you any kind of view when we should start to have this stabilize and you can stop being risky?
Badri Kothandaraman: Yes, so just to level set anything you back in Q3 was about 1.8% impact negative on Q3. We had somewhere between 1% and 2% in Q4 and then expect to start seeing it tailing off into 2018. So, it's a little early in these things. It's not entirely within our control, but our guess right now is that we'll start to see a tailing off of that impact in Q1.
Edwin Mok: Okay. That's helpful. I guess I'll stick with you Badri. I saw on the balance sheet of fees actually going up and then I think cable has also gone up a lot this quarter. Do you expect those to normalize as you in the fourth quarter or would that take some time?
Badri Kothandaraman: Yes, we do expect to normalize and they are somewhat related. So, on the receivables line, it was really impacted by the linearity of sales in Q3 relative to Q2. So that's really what drove the increase there. On the AP side it was actually related to inventory. We had some late receipts of inventory in September that's reflected in the increase sequentially in inventory. It's also in our AP. The other thing that in our AP line that's beyond the inventory and its really part of the work that we've been doing on supply chain optimization and working capital management in particular inventory management is working with our vendors to get returns and you see some of that in our AP in Q3, slight improvement in AP terms.
Edwin Mok: Okay. Great. One last question I had on IQ 7 I think you mentioned 1Q is not launched out and you mentioned it will penetrate some new markets. Is it just software feature that allows you to kind of all this grid in phase for different regions of the world or what allows you to penetrate these new markets and I notice that Japan I mentioned there, where do we stand on Japan?
Raghu Belur: So yes, this is Raghu. The architecture is such that you know it's a digital architecture, is a piece of power electronics, not a big box power. So, both are on our ASICs. So, it is a completely software defined device that allows us to profile to do configure them based on the geography that you're into meeting the connection requirements and the requirements that's correct. Of course, right now we're focused on IQ 7 is our fan expansion plan and Japan is on the roadmap. We're not exactly talking to today about the timing on that, but it does open up, as I said it's a worldwide skew that is capable of being configured for virtually all the geographies. So, we're going to be attacking more geographies over time.
Edwin Mok: Do you see IQ 7 accelerate ACM adoption or are those mutual exclusive?
Raghu Belur: No absolutely, IQ 7 is again it's much smaller, much lower profile. It's actually been designed and architected with the ACM in mind because ACM is absolutely a very key strategy for us. So yes, it does in fact accelerate ACM and accelerate new partners as well.
Edwin Mok: Great. That's all I have. Thank you. Appreciate it.
Operator: [Operator instructions] Our next question comes from line of Colin Rusch with Oppenheimer. Your line is now open.
Colin Rusch: Bert, can you talk a little bit about the pricing dynamics on a regional basis, it looks like if you're flat quarter-over-quarter, but with the growth in Asia, is that offsetting some price pressure in other geographies?
Badri Kothandaraman: Regarding the pricing -- regarding the pricing environment like what I said, we see pricing pretty stable at about 2% erosion quarter-on-quarter. If you ask me what it was for 2017, it was about 7% to 10%.
Colin Rusch: Okay. So, you're seeing a 2% across the Board regardless of regions. Okay. And then with the working capital dynamics, as you guys get into a more robust transposition and operational cash flow, are you seeing opportunities to go back to your suppliers and get better terms and support some of the balance sheet with longer payment terms on the payables line.
Badri Kothandaraman: Yeah, I just mentioned in the last -- with the last caller that one of the driving AP up a little bit sequentially are the better terms You're hitting something that's really important Colin, which is as our financial performance improves, naturally my cost of capital comes down. I expect to see that reflected in terms only with my vendors, but also with our lender. And we're excited about the opportunity to go back and recast some of those relationships in a more positive way.
Colin Rusch: Okay. And then the last question for me is really about the warranty obligations they haven’t really move much here for a little while and obviously you are growing sales. So, can you talk a little bit about some of the reliability data that you're seeing and how those things are rolling off for you guys in terms of the forward risk sure?
Badri Kothandaraman: Sure, I can handle both of those areas. I may ask Raghu to weigh a little bit on the reliability piece. So, I would like to take them in reverse order. On the reliability piece, we're seeing tremendous reliability returns from our current product is really, really performing very, very well. So, the reliability is very high and as a result the returns are understandably low. From a warranty perspective, bear in mind, you're right, our install base is growing but we are relieving the warranty liability as we build it. So, what you're seeing is really the netting of those two things over time. So again, as we ship more units into the installed base, the warranty liability will go up as we settle the warranty obligations for a large and growing install base, you will that liability to come down.
Raghu Belur: And Colin from a product point of view, what's core to our product strategy is semiconductor integration and every generation of product from the M-series to IQ 6 to IQ 7 has been -- we have a new ASIC in there, a new chip in there and what chip does is more and more integration. So, we're in from 1.8 million gauge to 2.8 to 3.8 million gauge now the IQ 7. More integration means just better reliability because you have got fewer and fewer components on it. And internally and all our testing just gets more sophisticated over time, the data that comes back from the field as you know all our systems are connecting. So, we get very high-quality data from the field and our systems are performing. All of that informs the quality and reliability of our product. So, the combination of a semiconductor strategy which is core to Enphase coupled with all of the feedback that we get from the field are you just creates us nice virtuous cycle that's needy of having a digital architecture and power tonics.
Colin Rusch: Great. Thanks, so much guys. I'll hop back in queue.
Operator: [Operator instructions] our next question comes from the line of Pavel Molchanov with Raymond James. Your line is now open.
Pavel Molchanov: Thanks for taking the question guys. Given that Jinko and a few other Chinese companies as your partners do not have manufacturing assets in the U.S. currently. Would anything change in a relationship depending on how the tariff decision ends up coming out?
Badri Kothandaraman: No. We don't expect any significant change there. Again, with the tariffs concerned it's on the module. We don't know all the details as yet, but our expectation is that it won't change. Second, is we also think about ACM as a worldwide skew. It's one just simply a North America skew alone. And coupled with the fact that IQ7 is a worldwide product and it's going also inure at the ACM and we think that the risk is lower manageable.
Pavel Molchanov: Okay. And there was a comment you guys made earlier about the percentage of non-inverter revenue remaining stable quarter-over-quarter if I heard that correctly. Will that percentage in theory increase over time, particularly as battery sales become more meaningful and should it be increasing?
Badri Kothandaraman: It's very intuitive. It should, you're right as ACV become a larger and larger part of a portion of our mix it would be an increasing portion of that non-inverter revenue and mix that's right.
Pavel Molchanov: All right. That's for me. I appreciate it.
Operator: [Operator instructions] Our next question comes from line of Vishal Shah with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.
Vishal Shah: Yeah hi. Thanks for taking my question. Just a couple of questions on the pricing environment and the competitive environment, you mentioned stable pricing in the near-term what are your conversations with the customer suggesting its pricing is going to be in the next quarter or and when kind of seasonality are you seeing in the business. And then you mentioned Huawei is rolling out products in the second half of '18. What's the initial feedback you're hearing from the field on that product from your customers? Thank you.
Badri Kothandaraman: As I think about the pricing environment, environment has been pretty stable, it's at about 2% erosion per quarter. For the entire year we have been at about 7% to 10%. Coming to 2018 so there are two factors like what I said again. [Sun Eva] as well as potential Huawei entry. In the case of Sun Eva, the final outcome is not yet out. So, after that we'll be able to see what happens. In the case of Huawei, we don't even understand what their product is yet and once that is announced, we can react better. But let me give you some color on our pricing management, the way we think about pricing is by doing value based pricing. What do you mean by value-based pricing. So, we take the next best alternative, which is offered by our competition and then we think about what value does offer compared to the product next best alternative. For example, in ECM it is installation time saving, it is streamlined logistics, it is improved quality, it is enhanced power production. Then we say here is the value you ascribe to that and we tell the customers that look we'll share some of that value with you. So, we do that -- we do this transactional discussion with every one of our customers and this is transactional pricing, which means it's literally hundreds of lines item every quarter and in some cases the customers doesn’t see the value, then we go and look at what we should do on that case, but there are literally a lot of cases like that. It is a process, it's not an event. We're getting better at it and pricing management is key for us to improve our gross margin and to reach our 30, 20, 10 operating model by Q4 of '18.
Vishal Shah: That's helpful. Just a follow-up on the first quarter outlook, have you seen a slowdown as normal seasonality would suggest or do you think the first quarter this year will be next quarter, next year will be different concerning some of the 201 dynamics. So, thank you?
Bert Garcia: So, as you know Vishal we don't guide beyond the current quarter, but there is no reason to believe that normal seasonality patterns are going to hold and are likely not going to be necessarily impacted by it.
Vishal Shah: Thanks Bert. Thank you.
Operator: [Operator instructions] I am showing no further questions in queue at this time. I would like to turn the call back to Badri Kothandaraman for any closing remarks.
Badri Kothandaraman: Yeah, thank you for joining us today. We're extremely pleased with our progress in the third quarter towards our 30, 20, 10 target operating model. We look forward to speaking with you again on our call next quarter.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference. This concludes the program and you may disconnect Everyone, have a great day.

Paul Nahi: Good afternoon and thank you for joining us on today's to discuss our second quarter 2017 financial results. We reported revenue of $74.7 million for the second quarter 2017 an increase of 36% compared to the first quarter 2017. We shipped approximately 224 megawatt to DC or 775,000 microinverters which is a 39% increase in megawatt compared to the first quarter. GAAP gross margin was 18.1% and non-GAAP gross margin was 18.4%. The positive impact from the restructuring actions and optimization initiatives that we've been focusing on resulted in lower OpEx and improvements for our financial position in the second quarter. These efforts have also helped to reduce pressure on working capital. In fact, we generated $1 million of cash in the second quarter. Bert will go into greater detail about our financial results later in the call. Enphase by far the largest microinverter company in the world, there are currently more than 661,000 Enphase systems deployed in over 100 countries. Since inception, we shipped approximately 15 million microinverters representing more than 3 gigawatts of installed generating capacity. Enphase Systems have produced approximately 9 terawatt hours of clean renewable energy. After the market close today, we announced that I'm stepping down as President and CEO of Enphase. It's been my great privilege to lead the Company for more than 10 years. From the time, Martin Fornage and Raghu Belur presented me with our concept of the microinverter to spearheading Enphase's drive to becoming the world's leading supplier of solar microinverters and energy management systems. And Enphase's founding CEO, I'm incredibly proud of all of our accomplishment that helped change the face of solar from the development of the microinverter to originating the concept of per panel monitoring. And now with the introduction of the AC Module, Enphase accepts the change of the industry yet again. Enphase is now poised to execute on its future of sustained profitability and I'm committed to helping the Company as it transitions to a new CEO. I want to thank our customers, vendors, partners, employees, shareholders and Board of Directors for their continued support throughout the years. It has truly been an honor to be the President and CEO of Enphase, and I wish the Company much continued success. I have no doubt that Enphase's best days are ahead. With that, I would now like to turn the call over to Badri to provide the second quarter update on our operations, products and markets. Badri.
Badri Kothandaraman: Thanks, Paul. On behalf of all Enphase employees, I would like to thank you for your leadership during past decades. As Paul mentioned, we've been working hard on restructuring actions and optimization initiatives over the past several months with the focus on lowering the operating expenses and improving gross margin. As a part of our focus on operational efficiency, we introduced our 30, 20, 10 target operating model at our recent Analyst Day on June 19th. We're targeting 30% gross margin, the OpEx at 20% of revenue and operating income at 10% of revenue all by the fourth quarter of 2018. We intend on providing you with periodic updates on our progress, as we execute on these important financial metrics. We’ve been implementing new policies and procedures that will help drive gross margin improvement. We're focused on driving down cost. We're world class procurement and over ahead management. We’ve adopted a multiple sourcing strategy in addition to a cohesive supply of strategy and are in the process of optimizing all aspect of our overhead cost including freight, service and stocking. Moving to products, we’re pleased with the ongoing rollout of sixth-generation IQ Microinverter System which continued to gain traction during the second quarter. The IQ 6 microinverter has been engineered to enable simpler and faster installations while continuing to provide better economics for our customers. Importantly, we believe IQ 6 is the highest quality and the most reliable microinverter we've ever built. We expect to transition -- we expect to complete the transition to the IQ 6 microinverter system in the U.S. by the end of the third quarter of 2017. We're very excited by the recent launch of our Enphase Energized AC Module with LG Electronics. The product has begun shipping and is now in the channel and is available for sale. We expect demand to outstrip supply while the channel works to build up inventory. As a reminder, an AC Module is a microinveter integrated directly onto a solar panel. To accomplish this, Enphase has several patent pending innovations that optimize product and shipping costs while maximizing performance. The AC Module creates a consolidated solution that would simplify and optimize the entire business cycle for our installer partners from simplifying purchasing, optimizing working capital and of course reducing installation time and effort. When compared to competitive solutions, the Enphase AC Module cuts rooftop installation time by more than half. Once installation is complete, Enlighten our cloud-based monitoring software enables, the owner or installer to monitor both the inverters as well as the modules yet again simplifying operations and maintenance of the solar system. We're currently in discussion with many of the world's leading module companies and anticipate announcing additional AC Module partners soon. In fact, we're looking forward to the launch of Jinko's AC Module later this year. We believe the IQ Microinverter and our partnerships with module manufacturers will make the AC Module the default solution for the rooftop solar. We're working hard to continue delivering industry leading technology and products to our installers. In fact, our seventh-generation microinverter IQ 7 is on track for release in the first quarter of 2018. IQ 7 will further simplify the installation process and forward our goal of continuous quality improvement. In addition IQ 7's cost structure will drive increased gross margins for us. We continue to see competitive pricing for our AC battery solutions during the quarter and believe the total addressable market is developing slower than what we anticipated. However, we did see an uptick demand for the AC battery in Europe during the second quarter. While slow to develop, we expect the worldwide storage market will eventually grow as costs come down and as utilities better understand how to incorporate distributed storage onto the grids. So, to turning to our markets, the second quarter revenue in the U.S. was up 34% sequential. Our installer acquisition strategy continued to deliver results with multiple new wins. In fact, we've added approximately 200 new installers in the last six months. In the APAC region, revenue increased 9% year-on-year. We're starting to see progress in India as we established new partnerships with distributers, installers and module manufacturers. In Europe, revenue was up 66% sequentially and 77% year-on-year. The second quarter was a record quarter for unit shipments in the region, as we saw many new customer wins. We continue to be the market leader in France and saw our share growing both the Netherland and Switzerland during the fall. We also experienced significant momentum in the Latin America market during the second quarter where revenue was up sequentially and nearly doubled compared to the year ago quarter. We remain the leader in residential market both in Mexico and Puerto Rico with a record number of installations during the quarter. In closing, we're encouraged by our second quarter results and by what we're seeing in the third and beyond. We believe the continued ramp up of our IQ Microinverter System and the launch of our AC Modules will help drive long-term growth with new and existing partners. We remain committed to providing our customers with the features and quality, ease and simplicity of Enphase Energy solutions while working diligently to improve gross margins and achieve sustain profitability. Now, I will turn it over to Bert for his review of our financial results.
Bert Garcia: Thanks, Badri. I will provide more details related to our second quarter 2017 financial results, as well as our business outlook for the third quarter. As a reminder, the financial measures that I'm going to provide are on a non-GAAP basis unless otherwise noted. Total revenue for the second quarter of 2017 was $74.7 million, an increase of 36% sequentially and a decrease of 6% compared to the second quarter of 2016. Total net revenue for DC watt decreased to 2% sequentially from $0.34 to $0.33, reflecting relatively stable ASPs. On a year-over-year basis, total net revenue for DC watt decreased by 9% directly consistent with the broad reduction in ASP. We shipped approximately 193 megawatts AC or 224 megawatts DC in the second quarter of 2017, an increase in megawatts of 39% sequentially and an increase in megawatts of 4% on a year-over-year basis. The megawatt shipped represented 775,000 microinverters approximately 20% of which were our new IQ Microinverter Systems. We expect to complete the transition to the IQ 6 System in the U.S. by the end of Q3, 2017. Non-inverter revenue which includes our AC battery storage solutions and all accessories was consistent as a percentage of revenue with our prior quarter result. GAAP gross margin for the second quarter of 2017 was 18.1%. Non-GAAP gross margin was 18.4%. Non-GAAP gross margin excludes approximately $211,000 of stock-based compensation expense. As I mentioned during our last call, we anticipated seeing the full impact of recent restructuring actions reflected in our Q2 results. As expected, we saw our non-GAAP operating expenses decreased by $2.4 million sequentially and $20.2 million in Q1 to $17.8 in Q2. As compared to the year ago quarter, we reduced non-GAAP operating expenses by $9.7 million, reflecting the cumulative impact of restructuring actions that we've taken. Non-GAAP operating expense in the second quarter of 2017 excludes $3.6 million of restructuring charges and $1.4 million of stock-based compensation expense, our GAAP operating loss narrowed by $12.8 million from a loss of $22.1 million in Q1 to a loss of $9.2 million in Q2. Our GAAP net loss was $12.1 million in Q2 resulting in a loss of $0.14 per share compared to a net loss of 23.3 million in Q1 while also $0.30 per share. On a non-GAAP basis, our operating loss was $4 representing an improvement of $8.9 million in Q1. Our non-GAAP net loss was 6.6 million resulting in a net loss of $0.08 per share compared to a net loss of $13.6 million in Q1 or loss of $0.18 per share. On our last few calls, we've discussed a relentless focus on improving financial performance and fueling in profitability. As I just described, the restructuring actions that we've taken over the past year have significantly reduced our operating expenses, narrowed our operating losses and created a solid foundation upon which to accelerate our timeline to sustained profitability. While we continue to focus on improving operational efficiency below the line, as Badri mentioned, much of our focus has turned to expanding margins to several supply chain optimization initiatives already underway. We believe the combination of operating expense reduction, supply chain optimization, and the transition to our new IQ platform will make it possible for us to achieve non-GAAP profitability by Q4. These initiatives will also result in improvements in working capital, placing the Company on a much improved financial footing as we turn the corner in 2018. Now turning to the balance sheet, inventory levels were $20.8 million for the second quarter compared to $33.8 million in the first quarter and $39.3 million in the year ago quarter. Inventory levels decreased from Q1 as we improved our working capital management and to a lesser extent supply constraints created by industry wide component shortages. We expect these shortages to impact our Q3 margins by approximately 1% to 2% as we incur expedited freight to meet near term demand. We ended with 31 days of inventory on hand as of June 30th, down from 64 days last quarter and 55 days in the year ago quarter. Our target inventory level is 30 days and we've been working diligently as part of our supply chain optimization initiative to achieve this result. Our improving inventory management also helped contribute to positive cash flow results. During the second quarter, we generated approximately $1 million of cash and exited the quarter with a total cash balance of $31 million. Now let's discuss our outlook for the third quarter of 2017. We expect our revenue for the third quarter of 2017 to be within a range of $72 million to $80 million. Turning to margin, we expect GAAP and non-GAAP gross margin in Q3 to be within a range of 18% to 21%. Note that our Q3 gross margin guidance includes negative impact of higher expedited freight resulting, some industry wide component shortages. Non-GAAP gross margin excludes approximately $200,000 of stock-based compensation expense. We expect our GAAP operating expense for the third quarter to be within a range of $22.5 million and $24.5 million and non-GAAP operating expense to be within a range of $16.5 million to $18.5 million, excluding an estimated $1.7 million of stock-based compensation expense and approximately $4.3 million of additional restructuring expense. I'll now turn the call over to Steve Gomo, Member of our Board for some closing remarks before we open the line for questions. Steve?
Steve Gomo: Thanks, Bert. On behalf of Enphase Energy's Board of Directors, we've accepted Paul's resignation and would like to thank him for his many years of service at Enphase. Paul has led Enphase since its inception, more than a decade of hard work and many personal sacrifices. He along with Raghu and Martin built Enphase from scratch. I think it's safe to say that without Paul Nahi, there would not be an Enphase Energy. We appreciate the leadership Paul has provided over the years with the good times and the bad and value his many contributions to Enphase and the solar engine industry. We also appreciate his most recent effort to stabilize the Company's financial situation. Paul is committed to a smooth transition and will continue to assist Enphase as we transition to a new leader. The Board search for Paul's replacement is underway and significant progress has already been made. The search includes both internal and external candidates. It is our intention to name a successor by August 31, 2017. In the interim, the Board has created an Office of the CEO consisting of Badri and Bert to oversee and provide leadership for the Company's day-to-day activities. The Office of the CEO will report to the Board of Directors. We thank you for your continued support with Enphase. The Company remains committed to its decision to realize the global potential of solar to technology innovation. And with that, we'll now open the lines for questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Philip Shen with Roth Capital Partners. Your line is open.
Philip Shen: I'd like to start off with the AC Module. We've heard some encouraging comments out there in the field about the potential demand for the AC Module following SunPower's success with their SolarBridge. How many megawatts do you think you could sell in 2018?
Bert Garcia: So we've also heard and have been encouraged by the success that SunPower has had with their product offering. It's a bit early to project out in 2018, but I can say is that we expect our AC shipments to grow as percentage of our mix in Q3 and Q4, as we ramp and as we bring on additional partners. And we are equally optimistic about where we would see the ACM placing in the marketplace in 2018 and beyond.
Philip Shen: Okay, great. And in terms of the component shortage out there, we heard this now from a number of other players as well. Can you give us a sense for what the components are? I've heard it might be PCBs and that they are not IGBTs, but what is -- what's component are they that are in shortage?
Badri Kothandaraman: Yes, the shortage is across a broad range of components not necessarily restricted to one thing like the PCB. So, it's again -- the reality is the global shortage and yes, I can't name something specific there.
Philip Shen: Badri, can you talk about what the cause of the shortage is? And then how long it might take for the shortage to be released?
Badri Kothandaraman: Yes, I think, yes, I will answer the question on how long. I have no visibility right now. We expect Q4 to be similar and only time will tell. And with regarding the cost of the shortages that I think it is the industry wide and some of the consumer devices are ramping, some of these components are quite short. So that's the color I have.
Bert Garcia: Yes, I think, Phil. I think the broad perspective and we've heard this as well from some other players in the industry and I think that the broad thinking right now is that the component shortages will likely persistent into the second half of the 2018, but as Badri mentioned, it’s a little too early to tell. We're all very -- we're all watching it very closely of course and are of course like everybody else paying attention.
Philip Shen: Okay great. One more, if I may on storage. You mentioned Badri in your comments that worldwide storage will eventually grow. You guys have some experience now in Australia and elsewhere. Given the experience, when do you expect to see potential reflection to the upside of demand? And perhaps you can talk about what needs to be -- what factors need to come into place in order for documents be greater and become realized?
Bert Garcia: So, it's Bert. I think the most intelligent thing we can say about the storage market is that it's fiercely competitive. I think you guys have all seen that, the number of players just in the Australian market alone is staggering. So I think there are a couple of things that are going to drive, the development of those markets, certainly from certainty, certain key around price. I think the pricing environment has created a bit of near-term uncertainty of the part of many consumers because prices have been so fluid. And from the manufacturers perspective -- from our perspective, as costs to come down I think it will be a lot easier for the entire industry to start recognizing perhaps the long-term value from playing in that market. So, I think there are number of factors there that are out play.
Philip Shen: Thanks very much and one last comment here. Paul, it was great working with you and best of luck to you and your next steps.
Paul Nahi: Thank you very much. I enjoyed as well.
Operator: Your next question comes from Edwin Mok with Needham & Company. Your line is open.
Edwin Mok: Thanks Paul for your support through years and good luck for your next endeavor. First question I have on IQ 6. Just quickly, I think you mentioned that you expect U.S. to be fully IQ 6 by 3Q excluding the factor of component shortage. Are you already producing IQ 6 at your target cost? Or should we expect more incremental cost saving that can come beyond this quarter?
Bert Garcia: I think the short answer there is, we have hit our target cost on IQ 6. But bear in mind, just like every generation of product that we've ever generated from the beginning of time, the initial cost of any product will overtime come down and IQ perhaps is not terribly different with the exception that its lifecycle is going to be relatively short 12 month. So that price drop is very reflected in the next version of the IQ which is the IQ 7. As we introduced the IQ 7 as you guys know in the first quarter of 2018, that cost also continued to trend down over time. So, we have I think put a lot of effort into both IQ 6 and IQ 7, and I think the cost trajectory of those products will follow a very similar trajectory as products in the past.
Edwin Mok: Okay, great. That’s helpful color there. On the guidance, I wanted to ask maybe a question [indiscernible] guidance. It sounds like you had some very strong and actually U.S. has seen some pickup as well. So I am wondering, what's driving the cost flattish or just more sequential growth in the 3Q guidance. Could you give some color on that?
Badri Kothandaraman: While our Q3 guidance is, yes, it reflects us holding share in a flat time. It's important to also note that the guidance basically reflects the focus on profitable growth, consistent with our 30, 20, 10 operating model. In addition, our Q3 revenue is also impacted by the component, yes, shortages a little bit and while the market dynamics associated with our transition to the new products which is IQ 6 and ACM.
Edwin Mok: I think historically or seasonally 3Q should be a stronger quarter than Q2 right. Do you see this year it'd be different?
Bert Garcia: You're right, historically we've seen a little bit of an uptick in seasonality, but as Badri mentioned, we do see a relatively flat TAM in 2017. And so we're not seeing a big seasonal bump in Q3 relative to Q2.
Edwin Mok: Last question, I have is, if this kind of environment continues, pricing seems okay, but demand is not -- it's got flattish right. And you guys have some incremental cost savings, as you ramp for IQ 6, right. Can you help me understand, how you get to that non-GAAP breakeven number that you're talking about, maybe walk us through some numbers, if you can?
Bert Garcia: So, I think really what you're asking is, what's driving margin expansion because at the end of the day when you look at the work we've already done below the line, we get to profitability and certainly non-GAAP breakeven through margin expansion. So in general assuming out in 2017, there're really two main drivers of margin expansion, certainly the transition of IQ to our IQ and also the supply chain optimization initiatives that Badri had mentioned. Q2 is only about 20% IQ as he mentioned. And the timing of our supply chain optimization issues, we didn't have a big impact on Q2 margins, but our Q3 guidance will reflect a larger impact from both of these drivers as we get a bit deeper into IQ transition and has begun to see the positive impact on margins from the supply chain optimization initiatives. So, broadly we're getting there through margin expansion.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Colin Rusch with Oppenheimer. Your line is open.
Colin Rusch: Can you talk a little bit about the demand dynamics and the warranty dynamics in Europe? Obviously, with this licensing agreement with Flextronics, folks can feel a little bit more comfortable with security supply that -- can you talk a little bit about, if you can push back from folks and what they need to see to continue to see the growth they're seeing right now?
Bert Garcia: So, demand dynamics, I take that's euphemism for competitive dynamics. Yes, without a doubt [indiscernible] we've seen some competitive dynamics that have been something that we've been focused on. Our -- I don't think anybody is surprised that not only in Europe but in North America those dynamics have played a part in our -- certainly in our guidance and in our financial results last couple of quarters. That said, I think everybody also understands that we put our head down and we are working really-really hard to take those financial opportunities off the table. The work we've done so far in restructuring and the work that we continue to do supply chain optimization, in our mind, we will answer very clearly whether Enphase is going to be successful. And we believe off course very much so that we are and as we stated in our Analyst Day our 30, 20, 10 target operating models and expression of that confidence.
Colin Rusch: Great. And then obviously, it's nice to see the restructuring activity flow through the P&L. As you've gone through that process, are you seeing opportunities potentially from more cost savings at some point? Or you are going to wait for the new CEO so to come in and assess the situation. But how can we think about potentials for a bit more operating leverage as we go to the balance of this year and into 2018?
Bert Garcia: Yes, so as I've mentioned. We continue to look very-very critically at opportunities above and below the line. We are very-very much focused as we mentioned on margin expansion. But there are opportunities for us to continue to optimize across the Board in ways that are going to produce in our mind positive financial results. So, we are -- we had mentioned that we are doing a bit to push into new markets that's certainly going to help. India is part of that strategy, but I think whether it fairly doesn’t make sense to wait for a new CEO to come onboard I think. The work is in fight and it would be I think really difficult at this point to pause the work that we've been doing, we really are in midflight right now.
Badri Kothandaraman: We also mentioned in the Analyst Day on June 19th that our long-term target was $15 million a quarter, and that's a Q4 '18 target for us.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeff Osborne with Cowen and Company. Your line is open.
Jeff Osborne: Just two quick questions from me, I was wondering. Can you give us an update on what are, the lines of credit that you're having in your revolvers? How much facility you have left available and what was drawn to for the cash balance?
Bert Garcia: So we actually we don’t have a revolver and more we had settled that back in Q1, and all we have now is a term debt facility that is fully drawn at 50 million.
Jeff Osborne: Those are 15.
Bert Garcia: 50.
Jeff Osborne: 50, okay. And then what's the plan on working that down?
Bert Garcia: Well, I think first and foremost executing on our plan and generating cash is certainly the number one priority. We'd like to think and it's the certainly our intent as we execute on our plan our ability to revisit those economics on that term facility I think get better overtime, and we'd certainly like to think that we will be in a position to improve those economics on that term debt facility and begin to really reverse ourselves of that burden.
Jeff Osborne: Make sense. I did have a question on Paul's resignation. I enjoyed working with the Paul and shared similar opinion to others on the call. I guess I'm just confused though from a Board perspective, I think it was Steve that you said was in the room. First one, when did he resign and I guess why from a board perspective would you agree to hire someone by August 31st, it seems like you should take time and find the right person especially, if you're considering internal and external candidates, typically companies don’t find people in a couple of weeks?
Bert Garcia: So, you're right and it’s a good point. We've had discussions with Paul now for some time. I can't go into the exact dates or anything. But suffice to say that we've been talking to Paul for some time. So the Board got the process underway, sometime ago, we have robust set of candidates, it takes awhile to get them and you're right. And there is no guarantee that the 31st is going to happen as we expect, but we're in a position right now where we think we can pull that off given the candidates we have. By the way, they are highly qualified both the internal one and the external once. So we're fairly confident we can hit that date and we're putting our stake in the sands the sense and we’re going to do it.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Eric Stine with Craig-Hallum. Your line is open.
Eric Stine: Maybe we could just look at fourth quarter a little bit, so I just wanted to clarify. So thought process is that, you get there your goal of operating income in 4Q is due to margins and OpEx. Is there any, any impact, any benefit you're thinking from the overall market top line growth? And if so, what kind gives you the confidence that you will see that?
Bert Garcia: So, as we mentioned, we're seeing a relatively flat TAM in the balance of 2017. So our confidence really does from the work we're doing to, only hold cost down and expand margins through supply chain initiatives but also on the strength of the transitioned IQ.
Eric Stine: Got it. And maybe last one for me just, so at the analyst day I know you were talking about IQ 7 and that launching and that was key to gain a certain markets, and I think you mentioned Italy, Germany and now also is South East Asia. Can you just remind me is that a function of cost? Is it a function of features or how should I think about that?
Badri Kothandaraman: Well, we plan to introduce the IQ 7 in Q1 of '18, we will introduce North America first in early Q1, '18 and we will follow up with the rest of the world IQ towards the end of Q1,'18 and this rest of the world IQ is actually help us to fill the gaps like Germany. So, you’re right in finding that out, Germany, India and I think…
Bert Garcia: All of Europe, the beautiful thing about IQ 7 is that it is in fact a worldwide skew. So a direct answer to your question, the reason that we feel that the IQ 7 will allow us to expand into new geographies is one, it supports the regulatory requirements that these geographies have. Currently, we're not in countries like Germany because our current product doesn’t qualify there. And it also provides the right cost point that would enable us at the right price point to be competitive in these markets. So, yes, whether it's South East Asia, the Asia Pacific region, Latin America or Europe is now one skew that can support all of those geographies.
Operator: And your next question comes from Pavel Molchanov with Raymond James. Your line is open.
Pavel Molchanov: Kind of a two part question but focusing on battery product, it seems to me like the number of players that are entering or have entered the residential storage market is pretty vast. And so number one, do you agree that it's overly fragmented and perhaps due for a shake out? And secondly, as you talk to customers, how do you differentiate your product versus the dozens-upon-dozen of other residential storage solutions that are available today?
Bert Garcia: So, you're right, we would agree on the statement that the market is fragmented. I think there maybe some sub-selection going on there in terms of some of those competitors actually already calling out of the market. So, we know that in Australia for example there've been a number of sales already which kind of underscores the intense competitive marketplace. I suspect that we'll see similar dynamics in the rest of the world, as other markets start developing. In terms of differentiation of our product versus other competitive offerings, certainly the modularity and ease of installation simplicity is a huge differentiator in our mind. When you think about the folks that have to put these things into place, you can't discount that as being a really important factor. We've and do use what we consider the most stable and safest chemistry out there, and we think that's also important certainly to consumer to have these products in their homes, so that's something that is I think important not only from a consumers' perspective but also from installers stand behind those products, and certainly Enphase stand behind those products. So, I think there're a number of things that differentiate our products from competitive offerings.
Badri Kothandaraman: One other point is that the combination of solar plus storage functioning as an energy management system with tight coupling between the two in terms of the system; that gives us the unique advantage in addition to the software that we've for monitoring; so these -- so basically solar, then storage, continuous monitoring and tracking that's really the strength of EnPhase Solutions, it's a true IoT system, and I think that would not be possible if it were actually a fragmented case when one company supply inverter, one supply the storage solutions, one supply the software etc., so we believe in integration of software and hardware as an energy management in our solutions. That's well is our belief.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Vishal Shah with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
Vishal Shah: First, on the Q3 gross margin guidance. What kind of pricing assumptions are you making for Q3? I think you mentioned flat pricing in Q2. I just wanted to confirm as the case even, what are you seeing for Q3? And then secondly, what percentage of your current revenues, coming from the storage segment?
Bert Garcia: So, I'll start with the last question first. So, we don't breakout revenue on the storage side. So, we may choose to do that at some point in the future, but today it's a better early in our mind to break that out. In term of the pricing environment, what we've said is we are seeing about 10% AC erosion on the year-over-year in 2017. I think we're still comfortable that as a broad outlook for the year.
Vishal Shah: Okay, that's the tough call. So in terms of the IQ 6 mixed impact on the margins. Can you maybe talk about what kind of margins improvement you assume from the transaction to like IQ 6 and I think you've mentioned 20% erosion so far going to 100% by the end of Q3?
Bert Garcia: Yes, so I won't be able to give you an explicit number related directly to the IQ transition itself, but as I mentioned Vishal -- sorry, we're seeing a combination of things that are driving margin extension. One big one off course is the transition to IQ as we become more deeply transitioned in Q3 and Q4. But there is a significant amount of work being done on a supply chain optimization front we're start seeing the benefit of that initiative really play out in part of the ways in the P&L beginning in Q3 is really going into Q1 and Q2 of next year.
Vishal Shah: Okay, it looks fair. And then as far as the component shortages concerned, I mean is it fair to day that you are not able to pass on some of the extra cost to your end customers. In other words, you only get pricing cadence is still looking some year-over-year decline where as cost have gone up.
Bert Garcia: Yes, as I mentioned, we see a point or two impacts to gross margins from those shortages in the form of expedited freight precisely because we are not passing those costs along.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Brad Meikle [indiscernible]. Your line is open.
Unidentified Analyst: Three questions. First is, what would have been the gross margin you are offering in the third quarter without the legacy products price protection impact? And then just the other two are, what's the mix of the IQ 6 that you have seen in domestically? And in the third quarter, what that's ramping to you in the fourth quarter? Thanks.
Badri Kothandaraman: Okay, I'll answer the second question. So basically 20% of the worldwide shipments that we had for Q2 '17 is IQ and we expect the transition 100% to IQ by the end of Q2 '17.
Bert Garcia: Yes, I'll take a step at the first part of your question. If I can restate it as I understand it. Have we not shipped the legacy product and not had any price protection on that products in Q3, what might our margins look like, is that right Brad?
Unidentified Analyst: Yes, that's exactly right.
Bert Garcia: Yes, so good question that one I would be able to give you a direct answer on that other than it would be meaningful.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay and you near that down over.
Bert Garcia: [Multiple Speakers] I'm not able to give you a discreet answer on that story.
Unidentified Analyst: Right, but essentially the way the price protection works as if a new product is 15% less than the on the products that’s been inventory distribution they get for traction or whatever the new products, lower prices right.
Bert Garcia: That's exactly right, you understand it pretty well. There it is definitely true and it's fair to say that our Q3 results would have been better on the margin front, if we were fully transitioned to IQ and not providing price protection on the previous generation product. I think that’s a fair statement.
Unidentified Analyst: Thanks, Bert. And so if you look at to the fourth quarter and the first quarter, where the margins feel like are going, if they were a bit higher without the price protection in Q3 than as you -- you have this phase two of the IQ 6 coming out right in the second half and then IQ 7 in the first half? So how specific you want to be, but to what extent can you give us a sense for the direction of margins?
Bert Garcia: So I think the best thing I can tell you that as you know we only guide the quarter at time, but we did put a step in the ground with respect to our 30, 20, 10 target operating model. And we did say it by Q4, we expected to be at 30 points margin.
Unidentified Analyst: Q4 of '18.
Bert Garcia: Q4 of '18 sorry, so I certainly wouldn't draw a straight line from Q2 to Q4, margins, don't work that nature, but directionally that’s the answer. We do expect to see margin expansion and steady growth on the gross profit line, as we again execute on the transition to IQ 6 and 7 and as we start to see the benefit of the supply chain optimization initiatives hit the P&L.
Unidentified Analyst: So, it's not a straight line. Would you say that -- you do have a big impact from the IQ 6 and IQ 7 over the next few quarters? So, it sound like it would be somewhat frontend loaded as the ramp, does that sound right?
Bert Garcia: I am not going to characterize in terms of timing, but I think you got the idea. Directionally, it's up into the right.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Carter Driscoll with FBR. Your line is open.
Carter Driscoll: So it's clearly you have a footprint in India, Latin America and Europe now, but do you see in [indiscernible] more on one of these markets then the others nearly from the near term?
Bert Garcia: Yes, so, got you that. It's a bit of selfish [indiscernible]. All of those markets are important to us. I don’t know that we're going to necessarily focus on one over the other. I think they all represent really great opportunity. Our Lain America is really developing quickly and we saw a lot of potential there of course. India is a tremendous market opportunity and we're very focused there as well. So I don’t know that I would say that we're going to focus on one at the expense of the other now.
Operator: Thank you. I'm showing no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the call back to Bert Garcia, for closing remarks.
Bert Garcia: Thank you very much, operator, and thank you for joining us today. We do look forward to speaking with you again on our next call, next quarter.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program and you may all disconnect. Everyone have a wonderful day.

===== 2017 Q1  (2017-05-09 16:30:00) =====
Executives: Christina Carrabino - IR Paul Nahi - President and CEO Bert Garcia - CFO
Analysts: Colin Rusch - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc. Brad Meikle - Craig-Hallum Capital Tyler Goldman - Deutsche Bank
Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Enphase Energy's First Quarter 2017 Financial Results Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will have a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I'd now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Christina Carrabino. You may begin.
Christina Carrabino: Good afternoon and thank you for joining us on today's conference call to discuss Enphase Energy's first quarter 2017 results. On today's call are Paul Nahi, Enphase Energy's President and Chief Executive Officer, and Bert Garcia, Chief Financial Officer. After the market closed today, Enphase issued a press release announcing the results for its first [technical difficulty] conference call, Enphase management will make [technical difficulty] of the risks and uncertainties, please see the annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016, which is on file with the SEC, and the quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2017 which will be filed with the SEC in the second quarter of 2017. Enphase Energy cautions you not to place any undue reliance on forward-looking statements and undertakes no duty or obligation to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future events or changes in its expectations. Also, please note that certain financial measures used on this call are expressed on a non-GAAP basis, unless otherwise noted, and have been adjusted to exclude certain charges. The Company has provided reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to [technical difficulty].
Paul Nahi: [Technical difficulty] microinverters. The first quarter of 2017 turned out to be more of a challenge than expected and we’re disappointed with our financial results. Our revenue for the first quarter was impacted by the extraordinarily wet winter in California, where we’ve a significant presence than normal seasonality. According to Source Data, out of the 65 working days in California, only 21 were suitable for installations. We estimate that our California residential PV volume in January alone was down approximately 23% from the average monthly volume for all of 2016 as a result of the winter weather. GAAP gross margin was 12.9% and non-GAAP gross margin was 13.3%. Gross margin was lower than expected in the first quarter, primarily as a result of cost absorption on decreased revenue volume. While we continue to increase our presence in California, we’ve been successfully working to increase our market share in other parts of the U.S and continued additional strong market for Enphase is well positioned for growth. Enphase is by far the largest residential microinverter company in the world. There are currently more than 620,000 Enphase Systems deployed in over 100 countries. Since inception, we shipped over 14 million microinverters, representing more than 3 gigawatts of installed generating capacity. Enphase Systems have produced approximately 8 terawatt hours of clean renewable energy. On our last call, we discussed our relentless focus on pulling in profitability. This required [technical difficulty].
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, we are resuming the Enphase 2017 financial results conference call. Sir, the floor is yours.
Paul Nahi: We reported revenue of $54.8 million for the first quarter of 2017. We shipped approximately 138 megawatts AC or 573,000 microinverters. The first quarter of 2017 turned out to be more challenging than expected and we were certainly disappointed with our financial results. Our revenue for the first quarter was impacted by the extraordinarily wet winter in California where we’ve a significant presence and normal seasonality. According to Source Data, out of 65 working days in California, only 21 were suitable for installations. We estimate that our California residential PV volume in January alone was down approximately 23% from the average monthly volume for all of 2016 as a result of the winter weather. GAAP gross margin was 12.9% and non-GAAP gross margin was 13.3%. Gross margin was lower than expected in the first quarter, primarily as a result of cost absorption on decreased revenue volume. While we continue to increase our presence in California, we’ve been successfully working to increase our market share in other parts of the U.S and continue to target additional strong markets where Enphase is well positioned for growth. Enphase is by far the largest residential microinverter company in the world. There are currently more than 620,000 Enphase Systems deployed in over 100 countries. Since inception, we’ve shipped over 14 million microinverters, representing more than 3 gigawatts of installed generating capacity. Enphase Systems have produced approximately 8 terawatt of clean renewable energy. On our last call, we discussed our relentless focus on pulling in profitability. This required us to make some very hard decisions, but we understand the importance of creating a strong financial foundation and delivering consistent profitability to our shareholders. We believe that the actions we’ve taken over the past three quarters will result in a quarterly non-GAAP operating expense run rate of approximately $18 million, beginning in the second quarter and we remain committed to achieving sustainable profitability in the second half of 2017. Bert will go into greater detail about this and our financial results later in the call.  As we continue to look critically at ways to improve performance and drive profitability, one of our key initiatives was optimizing the organization and increasing efficiency. We’ve done this in part by streamlining and consolidating the organization. To help facilitate this, we recently created a new role of Chief Operating Officer filled by Badri Kothandaraman. Badri brings strong technical, operational and management experience that will be instrumental in helping us increase efficiency and profitability. On the product front, we began shipping our Enphase Home Energy Solution with IQ, our next generation integrated solar storage and energy management solution in the U.S towards the end of the first quarter and are very encouraged with our customers feedback. This solution features our sixth-generation Enphase microinverter system, which supports just about every 60 and 72 cell solar module and continues to simplify the design and installation process. The IQ 6 and 6 plus probably meet the cost targets we set back in late 2015. We will be discussing this in more detail at our Analyst Day in June. Our seventh-generation microinverter, the IQ 7 is on track to begin shipping at the end of this year. The IQ 7 will continue to meet our aggressive cost targets, while offering our customers the increasing quality, features, and functionality they’ve come to expect from an Enphase product. Continual innovation is part of our DNA at Enphase and our product roadmap is more exciting than ever. We are looking forward to the U.S launch of the AC module this quarter. We’ve already received purchase orders for tens of thousands of our microinverters, from our AC module partners and expect to start shipping them this quarter. Remember, the AC module is defined as a [technical difficulty] world and Jinko Solar. By integrating our microinverters onto modules directly, we are creating an even simpler, more consolidated, and more reliable solution. Quality and reliability continue to be driving forces at Enphase. Our pursuit of continued reliability improvement has resulted in industry-leading quality. Every generation of microinverter we introduced have the path evermore demanding quality and reliability tests, resulting in relentless quality improvements. Our design, manufacturing process, and quality testing are the results of the experience gained from millions of units deployed and monitored in real time globally over the past nine years. In fact, many of our quality tests are so stringent that it is unlikely that any other inverter manufacturer would even attempt them. As an example, before we ship a new product it must pass our unique water ingress test. This test requires the inverter and cable connected system to operate, that is convert power under 15-feet of water for three weeks, while undergoing thermal stress. This is just one example of the type of testing an Enphase microinverter must pass before it is approved for release to our customers. While this increases the complexity of development, it results in improved operations and maintenance for our installer partners and improved peace of mind for system owners. In addition to exceptional quality, Enphase has a history of developing products that offer our customers higher energy production rates and lower maintenance costs, as well as a simplified design and installation process. We announced during the first quarter that Sunnova Energy Corporation, a market leader in residential solar services and Enphase extended their partnership through an agreement making Enphase the preferred provider of inverters for Sunnova. Sunnova cited high reliability, ease of installation and compliance with NEC 2014 and 2017 rapid shutdown requirement as drivers first decision. We’ve been pleased with the positive feedback from our customers for our AC battery storage solution. The simplicity, ease of installation, modularity and performance of our AC battery is unique in the industry and has resonated well with the customers worldwide. However, we are facing a more competitive pricing environment and are actively working to reduce our cost in 2017. In addition, we believe the total addressable market is developing slower than anticipated. However, we expect to increase business in the markets we serve as the year progresses. Turning to our market, first quarter revenue in the U.S was lower than we expected due to the wet weather in California. We expect U.S revenue to return to normal seasonal levels in the second quarter. In the APAC region, we’ve been pleased with our overall progress in Australia and New Zealand, as revenue increased 75% year-over-year. We saw significant share growth during 2016 and look forward to increasing market share in 2017 as the Enphase grant has become well-known and respected in the region. In Europe, sales increased 58% year-over-year. We are the market leader in France and we saw our share grow in both the Netherlands and Switzerland during the quarter. Turning to our Latin America market, we believe we’re the largest residential inverter company in Mexico with more than 30% market share. We experienced significant momentum with Tier 1 installers in Mexico during the quarter and the improved regulatory framework continue to benefit Enphase. We are the market leader in Puerto Rico and remain optimistic about the rest of Latin America business as we anticipate long-term potential on the region. In closing, we’re encouraged by what we’re seeing in the second quarter and beyond. We believe the success of our home energy solution with IQ and the launch of our AC modules in the second quarter will help drive long-term growth with new and existing partners and increased market share. We remain committed to providing our customers with the features, quality, ease and simplicity of an Enphase Energy solution, while working diligently to achieve sustainable profitability in the second half of 2017. We will be hosting an Analyst Day on June 7 in New York and we look forward to providing more details on our upcoming products and our path to sustainable profitability. Now I will turn it over to Bert for his review of our financial results.
Bert Garcia: Thanks, Paul. I will provide more details related to our first quarter 2017 financial results, as well as our business outlook for the second quarter. As a reminder, the financial measures that I'm going to provide are on a non-GAAP basis unless otherwise noted. Total revenue for the first quarter of 2017 was $54.8 million, a decrease of 40% sequentially and a decrease of 15% compared to the first quarter of 2016. As Paul explained, our first quarter revenue was impacted by the extraordinarily wet winter in California. We shipped approximately 138 Megawatts AC or 161 Megawatts DC in the first quarter of 2017, a decrease in megawatts of 30% sequentially and a decrease in megawatts of 6% on a year-over-year basis. The megawatt shipped represented 573,000 microinverters, which included a mix of our fourth, fifth, and sixth-generation microinverter systems. Non-inverter revenue which includes our AC battery storage solution and accessories, was consistent as a percentage of revenue with our fourth quarter results. GAAP gross margin for the first quarter of 2017 was 12.9%. Non-GAAP gross margin was 13.3%. Non-GAAP gross margin excludes approximately $239,000 of stock-based compensation expense. Gross margins in Q1 were also negatively impacted by lower revenue and volumes as our fixed overhead costs represented a much larger percentage of our revenue than anticipated. As I will discuss later in our guidance, we expect gross margin to return to normal levels in the second quarter, Non-GAAP operating expense was $20.2 million for the first quarter compared to $23.4 million for the fourth quarter and $28.1 million for the first quarter of 2016. Non-GAAP operating expense in the first quarter of 2017 excludes approximately $7.2 million of additional restructuring charges and $1.7 million of stock-based compensation expense. The restructuring charges related to severance, restructuring related professional services, and the consolidation of our corporate headquarter facilities and related asset impairments. We’ve taken several restructuring actions in the past three quarters to significantly reduce operating expenses and accelerate the timeline to profitability. These actions combined have resulted in approximately $38 million of cost reductions on an annualized basis and we expect these actions will bring our quarterly non-GAAP expense run rate to approximately $18 million beginning in Q2. Our GAAP operating loss was $22.1 million for the first quarter and our net loss was $23.3 million resulting in a loss of $0.30 per share, on non-GAAP basis, our operating loss was $12.9 million and our net loss was $15.6 million, resulting in a loss of $0.18 per share. Now turning to the balance sheet. Inventory levels were $33.8 million for the first quarter compared to $32 million in the fourth quarter and $45.6 million in the year-ago quarter. Inventory levels increased slightly sequentially as we prepare for the seasonally stronger second quarter. On a year-over-year basis, inventories decreased significantly due to improved inventory and working capital management. We exited the first quarter with a total cash balance of $30 million. During the quarter, we raised approximately $26.5 million in equity financing and a net $14.1 million from the amendment of our term loan. As of March 31, we had a $50 million balance on our term loan net of deferred financing costs. In summary, we believe the financing actions and restructuring initiatives we’ve taken over the past three quarters have helped to improve our liquidity and to create an operating structure that we believe positions us well to achieve maximum operating leverage, and of course, we remain committed to our goal of achieving sustainable profitability in the second half of 2017. Now let's discuss our outlook for the second quarter of 2017. We expect our revenue for the second quarter of 2017 to be within a range of $72 million to $80 million. Turning to margins, we expect [technical difficulty].
A - Paul Nahi: So we actually think that we are continuing to [indiscernible] market share in the U.S. We have grown considerably outside of California whether it's in the Northeast, the Southeast, the Midwest or the Texas region. So we feel that we're on a consistent path towards market share gain across the board. I think what you are seeing is a slowdown of growth in the U.S., in general in the residential market and it's hard to know what’s going to happen the rest of the year, but we're anticipating somewhat in the neighborhood of, call it 5% to 10% growth in the market throughout the year.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay, got it. And then one final one for me here. Could you share what your mix of the IQ 6 inverter was in Q1, and how you see that mix changing in Q2 and then through the balance of the year?
Paul Nahi: Sure. So we introduced the IQ just this quarter. We're very excited about the reception that it's getting. We do anticipate a very smooth and soft transition from the current product from the M-series to the IQ series, and we expect that transition to be complete by the end of the year.
Unidentified Analyst: Great. Thank you.
Paul Nahi: Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Colin Rusch of Oppenheimer. Your line is open.
Colin Rusch: Thanks so much, guys. Can you talk a little bit about the sales dynamics with your distributor customers at this point? Are you seeing them asked for improved terms in terms of payment terms, are they looking for different sort of products at this point and how hard can they push the extra storage products?
Paul Nahi: So we’re not seeing any unusual movements or requirements or request from our distribution partners. I'd say the only thing that was different in Q1 was the slowdown in the market, I think spooked them as well, and they were more reluctant to take an inventory. They did not know how long the downturn was going to last. I think the increment weather, the range were very extreme and unique to California. So I think we were all taken a bit of back by the effect of it and unclear how soon it recover. We clearly have seen it start to recover in Q2, so we feel good about that. In reference to storage, it's really not a distributor issue. It's really more about finding the right tariff and regulatory framework that creates a -- an economic case for storage. In areas like Australia that exists to some degree. In Europe, it's been contemplated. In the U.S., there are some trials with some utilities, but it's still very experimental. And as you know when you're dealing with utilities, these things can take a while. So we're as bullish about the storage market as ever, but I think we have to give it a little bit of time to evolve and develop.
Colin Rusch: Okay. And then just changing gears to the data resources that you have, obviously you've collected off a lot of data over a number of years, you have some good products where you’ve been able to augment grid performance. Can you talk a little bit about where you're at with utilities, looking to access the data and potentially being able to monetize that?
Paul Nahi: Yes, it's true that we have a tremendous amount of data. We are still collecting everyday 3 to 4 terabytes of new data, and that data is -- tells us about the inverter, tells us about the module, and tells us about the grid. And we’ve been able to -- in the past monetize some of that data for to support some of our utility partners. I'd say right now those efforts are -- have slowed down a little bit as a result of the OpEx reductions we've undertaken. One of the casualties was areas like our utility engagement. And the reason for that is that those relationships take a very long time to develop and right now our capital is best used in the development of the IQ 7 storage, the home energy system. So we maintain that data and we actually maintain a dialog with many of these utility partners. But I would say that the developing a business that supports that is not a priority for Enphase at this time.
Colin Rusch: Okay. Thanks so much guys.
Paul Nahi: Thanks, Colin.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brad Meikle of Craig-Hallum Capital. Your line is open.
Brad Meikle: Hey, good afternoon. So, in terms of the guidance, regarding on revenues and gross margins, but maybe burning cash for many quarters now. Why not guide on the bottom line metrics that matters or can you give us some sense of what the free cash flow generation target would be for the second half of the year?
Bert Garcia: Yes. Hi, Brad. So, you're right. We do guide on revenue margin and OpEx. Of course if you extend that down, you can get the operating income middle of the range, it gives you of course about a $3 million loss on operating income again at the middle of the range. So as far as the outlook for cash and cash burn, we did burn some cash in the first quarter. When we look at Q2, we -- as we move into a seasonally stronger part of the year, we will burn a little bit of cash, but nothing on the order as we’ve seen in prior quarters. In fact, we’re down in the single-digit. We think that continues into 2017, the back half where we actually begin generating cash. So we’ve taken a lot of actions and a lot of work to make that possible. The restructuring effort that we've undergone so far, the $38 million certainly takes a lot of pressure for capital and cash. We're not done of course, but there has been a lot of work again towards the end of reigning [ph] in cash burn.
Brad Meikle: Okay. Well, I guess that do you feel like you’re going to need to raise more capital and is 10% free cash flow margin the right way to think about where your business can go as you rollout and fully the -- IQ 6 and IQ 7?
Bert Garcia: Yes. So on your first question, the need to raise more capital, there is nothing in the pipeline at this point. We think that the work we've done actually positions us pretty well to execute on a strategy for the balance of 2017 and into 2018. Thinking about the long-term model, I think that’s really what you're asking about is where do we see ourselves getting to from an operating income as a percent of revenue basis. I don't think 10% is overly optimistic. I think the benefit that we expect to see from not only the new products that we’ve introduced, but also the lower cost of products on the inverter side make that metric I think totally reachable again in a longer-term horizon, but we're talking quarters not years.
Brad Meikle: What percentage of the mix do you think IQ 6 will be in the second quarter?
Paul Nahi: In the second quarter, I think it still can be -- relatively small part of the problem is that demand has outstripped our ability to supply. There is some component shortages. And I think that we’re going to see, as I mentioned before, a gradual transition, so that we'd see -- would be entirely IQ by the end of the year.
Brad Meikle: Well, say for the second half, what percentage the shipments would be IQ 6 version 1 or version 2 or possibly IQ 7?
Paul Nahi: As we get to the end of the year, it's going to be close to a 100 …
Brad Meikle: Now just for the whole second half of the year.
Paul Nahi: A majority will be IQ. More than 50%.
Brad Meikle: And can you say in Q4 what percentage of your business was in California? Just how much it drops in the first quarter, so you’ve some sense of the -- what that -- with all the talk about the rain in California? I know I experienced it, but just wonder if you could quantify what portion of the business that is?
Paul Nahi: Well, so on average our business is about 40% in California. And we saw again that -- we saw a significant drop, a double-digit drop in Q1 as a result of the way with the rain.
Brad Meikle: What was the percentage decline in the California business?
Paul Nahi: I don't have the specific number, but Brad we will get it to you and we will get it and send it to you.
Brad Meikle: All right. Thanks. And for the Analyst Day coming up, are you going to provide some guidance on the full-year and some detail on source shipments and what the new business model might look like from a March standpoint?
Paul Nahi: Yes, we will be talking a lot about the new products. I don't know that we will be providing full-year guidance, but we will be giving you more indication, more clarity on cost and on revenue breakout.
Brad Meikle: Thank you.
Paul Nahi: Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Edwin Mok of Needham & Company. Your line is open.
Unidentified Analyst: Hi, everyone. This is actually [indiscernible]. Thanks for taking our questions. In terms of the competitive landscape in the U.S for your microinverters, can you talk about how maybe that has changed or if you’re seeing any new players entering the market?
Paul Nahi: So, in terms of specific microinverters we're not seeing much of a change. We did talk about in the last call that SunPower has introduced an AC module. And again by definition that must include a microinverter and its not ours. So -- but that hasn't changed quarter-on-quarter. The -- we did hear that there was going to be a new Chinese entrant as early as Q1, Q2. The latest data that we have on that is that that's probably its postponed to at least Q4, maybe Q1, and I believe that they’re actually going to come out with an optimizer solution not a microinverter solution. So, I don’t know of any other microinverter entrant either now or on the horizon. And I think the only significant new entrant in the rooftop inverter market is a new entrant from China, and I think that's been delayed by at least a couple of quarters.
Unidentified Analyst: Got it. Thanks for that color. In the past you’ve talked about good demand for your AC battery in Australia and have provided pretty robust shipment forecasts. Can you just provide some color on what you’re seeing in terms of demand in the market and [indiscernible] how -- have your expectations changed?
Paul Nahi: Sure. So we are very pleased with the reception that our product is getting. So we're probably one of the top three equipment providers in the Australian rooftop market. The value proposition certainly resonates, but the two issues which I mentioned in the prepared remarks are -- have definitely affected our view on the slope of the ramp. One is that we have seen competitive products come in at a greatly reduced price and also they have copied a little bit of our architecture. We introduced something called an AC coupled system, which originally we were the only ones doing it and now everybody is sort of adopted that architecture. So they've adopted the architecture and coming with a lower price and what we’re seeing is that the overall size of the market is very likely not as big as anybody had predicted at the end of last year. We had, maybe tens of thousands of preorders that had -- that we came into the year with. I don't think we’re going to see those materialize. I think the actual numbers are going to be substantially less. I think we’re executing well. I feel that from a market share and presence we feel good about it, but I think we should assume that the market is going to take a little bit longer to evolve than we had originally planned.
Unidentified Analyst: Got it. And last question is just on -- I think you talked about some initiatives to reduce the cost with the AC battery to combat ASP decline. Can you talk about what some of those -- what some -- what are some areas that you're looking at to reduce costs and what level or what -- to what extent we can think of a reduction in cost savings?
Paul Nahi: So I'm not going to provide any specifics on cost on the ACB, but I will say that, yes, we are -- we have a program right now that that will have a very material, a very significant effect on cost. Remember the ACB was the first product we've ever introduced of that category. And generally when that happens, you’re going to come in probably a little bit higher cost than you should for a whole host of reasons. But now that we have it, now that it's out there, now that we have that experience, we're looking at every aspect of it from the chemistry to the mechanical engineering to the inverter itself to a lot of the internal workings of the ACB, and we are going to come out with -- and we are going to continue to reduce price throughout the end of this year. And I think by the end of the year we will have yet again a far more cost-effective solution.
Unidentified Analyst: Got it. Is it fair to say that the cost reductions can outpace the ASP pressures?
Paul Nahi: Well the ASP pressures exist today. So I think that that’s the competitive environment we live in right now. But I do think that in a very short period of time, we will be able to see strong gross margins at pricing that can compete with any of the competitors out there.
Unidentified Analyst: Got it. Thank you.
Paul Nahi: Sure.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] our next question comes from the line of Vishal Shah of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
Tyler Goldman: Hi, guys. This is actually Tyler on for Vishal. Apologies, if you had addressed this already, but kind of going on the pricing point, just wondering what your pricing strategy is going forward in respect to wanted to gain some market share. Are you guys still selling at a premium SolarEdge?
Paul Nahi: So it's been our experience that we can charge 10% to 15% premium and win a majority of the deals. I think our customers appreciate the simplicity, the quality, the reliability of Enphase solution. And by the way, I think that is especially true with the AC module. So we do anticipate further reductions in ASP throughout the year. I don't think it's going to be as substantial as we saw in 2016. We think anywhere from 10% to 15% -- a 10% to 15% reduction throughout 2017 is probably more likely and then we do think that ASP is stabilized in 2018.
Tyler Goldman: Okay. Thank you.

Paul Nahi: Good afternoon and thanks for joining us today to discuss our fourth quarter and full year 2016 financial results. We reported revenue of $90.6 million for the fourth quarter of 2016. We shipped approximately 194 megawatts AC or 815,000 microinverters, an increase in megawatts of 50% compared to the fourth quarter of 2015. GAAP gross margin was 17.9% and non-GAAP gross margin was 18.2%. We have currently more than 580,000 Enphase systems deployed in over 100 countries. Since inception, we have shipped over 13 million microinverters, representing more than 3 gigawatts of installed generating capacity. Enphase systems have produced approximately 8 terawatt hours of clean, renewable energy. For the full-year 2016, we reported revenue of $322.6 million and shipped a record 726 megawatts AC or 3.1 million microinverters. GAAP gross margin was 18% and non-GAAP gross margin was 18.4%. Enphase has been executing on a business strategy detailed in late 2015. We are gaining market share by offering competitive pricing, enabled by aggressive cost reductions and providing a richer more comprehensive energy solution for our customers. In addition, we are committed to reduce our cost structure with a goal of enabling consistent profitability. Our lower pricing strategy put pressure on revenue and gross margin during 2016. As a result, we took several actions in the second half of 2016 and in the first quarter of 2017 to reduce our operating expenses in order to create a faster path to sustained profitability. Bert will go into more detail about these actions and our financial results later in the call.. We saw the effectiveness of our lower pricing strategy with new customer wins and an increasing share with existing customers. During the second half of 2016, we had significant market share growth in almost every geography in which we participate. Based on third-party estimates as well as our own data, we believe our market share in the United States increased from approximately 20% in Q1 to over 30% in Q4. In addition, we believe we are the residential market share leader in Mexico, Puerto Rico, France and New Zealand, and have gained significant share in the Netherlands, Switzerland and Australia. Our success in these regions has given us further confidence that our strategy is working. An important element of our strategy was to target approximately 50% product cost reduction over two years from the fourth quarter of 2015 to early 2018. During 2015, we continued to aggressively drive down the overall cost of our microinverter systems. As part of our commitment to deliver new products and technologies that provide additional functionality, reduce cost and enhance the simplicity for installers, we'll be launching our Enphase Home Energy Solution with IQ, our next generation integrated solar, storage and energy management solution, in the U.S. We're excited to have already received the purchase orders and expect the deliveries starting in March, on time and under budget. The Enphase Home Energy Solution with IQ features our sixth-generation Enphase Microinverter System, which supports just about every 60 and 72-cell solar module and continues to simplify design and installation process. Our cost reduction activity is underway for 2017 and we are well on track to meet our targets. The introduction of our seventh-generation microinverter, the IQ 7, is on track for the first quarter of 2018, thus further reducing our product cost while still offering our customers with quality, features and functionality they have come to expect from an Enphase product. We have been relentlessly focused on pulling in profitability. This required us to make some very hard decisions, but we understand the importance of creating a strong financial foundation and delivering consistent profitability to our shareholders. We feel that the actions we have taken should result in Q2 non-GAAP operating expense of approximately $18 million and will enable us to accelerate our path to profitability. In addition to our focus on cost reduction, our product roadmap is more exciting than ever. We along with our partners have developed a new generation of integrated AC solar modules for the worldwide market. The AC module is defined as a microinverter integrated directly on the solar panel and represents the ultimate integration of the inverter and the solar panel. We firmly believe AC module is the future of rooftop solar. There is a significant increase in demand from large solar distributors, installers and fleet owners for a reliable, cost-effective and high-performance AC module. Our sixth generation microinverters will be included in the AC modules from LG, SolarWorld and Jinko Solar. By integrating our sixth-generation microinverters onto modules directly, we are creating an even simpler, more consolidated solution. The AC module will reduce working capital requirements, simplify inventory management, reduce installation time and enable easier operations and maintenance. In addition, the AC module also enables a simpler warranty process, one-stop technical support, and other asset management advantages such as remote monitoring for both the microinverter system and the module. We expect these modules to be available in the U.S. during the second quarter of 2017. We began shipping our AC Battery storage solution to some U.S. markets during the fourth quarter and we are pleased with the initial reception and the feedback from our customers. We believe the simplicity, ease in installation, modularity and performance of our AC Battery is unique in the industry. We increased our presence in Europe during the fourth quarter by expanding existing partnerships and developing new ones, and revenue was up 34% sequentially. We introduced our AC Battery in Europe during the quarter and are pleased with its reception. In the APAC region, we continue to be pleased with our progress in Australia and New Zealand, where revenue in the fourth quarter was up 146% sequentially. The response to our AC Battery storage solution in Australia and New Zealand has been extremely positive and all of its advantages are clearly resonating with customers. Turning to our other markets, we continued to see growth in both the residential and commercial markets in Latin America during the fourth quarter, particularly in Mexico and Puerto Rico. We estimate our current market share to be over 30% in Mexico and over 75% in Puerto Rico. In fact, we just unveiled the world's largest microinverter-powered small utility-scale solar plant in Panama at 2.44 megawatts. We remain optimistic about our opportunities in Latin America during 2017 and are expanding our customer base and geographies we sell in into that region. The gains we have seen in our inverter market share in the U.S. and the global residential market, along with the positive reception of the Enphase Storage System in Australia, the U.S. and Europe, and the upcoming introduction of our AC module product, validate Enphase's vision to realize the global potential of solar energy through our technology innovation. I'll close my comments by noting we are excited about our opportunities in 2017 and are encouraged by our market share gains worldwide. We are working diligently on creating what we believe is a path to sustained profitability. I'd like to thank the entire Enphase team for their ongoing hard work, passion and dedication as we work together on developing new technologies by making energy more intelligent, more connected and more cost-effective than ever before. Now, I'll turn over to Bert for his review of our financial results.
Bert Garcia: Thanks, Paul. I'll provide more details related to our fourth quarter and fiscal year 2016 financial results as well as our current financial status and business outlook for the first quarter. As a reminder, the financial measures that I'm going to provide are on a non-GAAP basis, unless otherwise noted. Total revenue for the fourth quarter of 2016 was $90.6 million, an increase of 2% sequentially and an increase of 38% compared to the fourth quarter of 2015. Total revenue for 2016 was $322.6 million, down approximately 10% from fiscal 2015. We shipped approximately 194 megawatts AC or 225 megawatts DC in the fourth quarter of 2016, a decrease in megawatts of 5% sequentially and an increase in megawatts of 50% compared to the fourth quarter of 2015. The megawatt shipped represented 815,000 microinverters. All of them were our fourth and fifth-generation microinverter systems. Non-inverter revenue increased 22% sequentially, driven by increased penetration of our AC Battery storage solution. In 2016, we shipped a record 3.1 million microinverters, representing 726 megawatts AC or approximately 845 megawatts DC, a 3% year-over-year increase. GAAP gross margin for the fourth quarter of 2016 was 17.9%. Non-GAAP gross margin was 18.2%, sequentially flat from Q3. Non-GAAP gross margin excludes approximately $281,000 of stock-based compensation expense. For the full year of 2016, GAAP gross margin was 18% and non-GAAP gross margin was 18.4%. As discussed in our last call, at the end of Q3 we made the difficult decision to reduce our global workforce by approximately 11% and eliminate certain non-core projects, resulting in approximately $20 million of annualized non-GAAP expense savings, starting in the fourth quarter of 2016. This restructuring initiative was materially complete in the fourth quarter. As a result, non-GAAP operating expense was $23.4 million for the fourth quarter compared to $28.6 million for the third quarter. Non-GAAP operating expense for the fourth quarter excludes $1.1 million of additional restructuring charges related to the consolidation of corporate headquarter facilities and related asset impairments as well as the gain on the divestiture of our Services business and $1.8 million of stock-based compensation expense. Non-GAAP operating expense for 2016 was $107.6 million compared to $115.7 million in 2015. In the fourth quarter, R&D expense was $10.5 million, sales and marketing expense was $7.2 million, and G&A expense was $5.7 million. For fiscal 2016, our R&D expense was $46.8 million, sales and marketing expense was $36.5 million and G&A expense was $24.3 million. For the fourth quarter, our GAAP operating loss was $10.1 million and our net loss was $13.2 million, resulting in a loss of $0.21 per share. On a non-GAAP basis, our operating loss was $6.9 million and the net loss was $9.3 million, resulting in a loss of $0.15 per share. GAAP operating loss for the full year of 2016 was $62.7 million and net loss was $67.5 million, or a loss of $1.34 per share. On a non-GAAP basis, operating loss was $48.4 million and net loss was $52.4 million, or $1.04 per share. Before we move on, I want to take a moment to discuss the additional restructuring action that we announced on January 30th. As disclosed, this action impacted approximately 18% of our global workforce and will result in further non-GAAP OpEx reductions totaling approximately $18 million on an annualized basis, bringing our non-GAAP operating expense rate to approximately $18 million per quarter, starting in Q2. As difficult as the recent restructuring decisions have been, we believe these actions significantly improve our overall financial footing and advance us towards achieving near-term profitability. Now, coming to the balance sheet, we decreased inventory levels by over $7 million from the third quarter, ending the year with $32 million. We exited the fourth quarter with a total cash balance of $17.8 million. At the end of the fourth quarter, we had $10.1 million drawn on our credit facility and a $23.8 million balance on our term loan which is net of deferred financing costs. Based on our liquidity position at December 31, 2016 as well as our history of operating losses, we acknowledge there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. In light of the challenges that we faced in 2016, these concerns are understandable. However, it's important to note that we have taken a number of meaningful actions that we believe will directly address many of these concerns, and taken together will significantly improve our financial condition in 2017. On the financing front, these actions have included the secondary offering of our common stock in 2016, resulting in net proceeds of approximately $16.2 million as well as an At The Market Issuance ATM Sales Agreement that we entered into in December 2016, providing for up to an additional $17 million in gross proceeds from the sale of common stock. As of December 31, we had not sold any shares under the ATM. However, during the first quarter of 2017, we have realized net proceeds to date of approximately $11.3 million of common stock sold under the ATM. In addition, in January we announced a strategic investment from John Doerr and T.J. Rodgers. We believe this investment underscores the value of and confidence in our technology and vision. Finally, on February 16th we announced the extension and refinancing of our term loan facility from $25 million to $50 million. In connection with this refinancing, we consolidated our lender relationships by repaying the $10.4 million of principal and interest outstanding under our existing line of credit facility with Wells Fargo and closed that facility. On the restructuring front, as previously mentioned, the combined impact of the actions that we took in Q3 and more recently in January resulted in a $38 million reduction in operating expenses on an annualized basis. These actions have helped create an operating structure that more closely aligns with the scope of our business today and positions us well to achieve maximum operational leverage as the business continues to grow. Most importantly, we believe these actions significantly accelerate our timeline towards sustained profitability and positive cash flow. Finally, on the product front, we have made considerable investments to significantly drive down the costs of our sixth and seventh-generation microinverters, known as our IQ series. We delivered the cost reductions on the sixth-generation microinverter as promised and we're excited to begin shipping that product next week. I'm also extremely encouraged by the progress that we have made on our seventh-generation product, which will deliver even deeper cost reductions when it's released in Q1 of 2018, further driving margin improvement. In addition to the investments we have made in cost reduction, our focus on new product development has also begun to bear fruit. We launched our AC Battery storage solution in Australia during Q3 and in Europe and the U.S. in Q4. We believe our AC module, which is scheduled for initial shipments in late Q2, will fundamentally change the installation landscape. In summary, the steps that we have taken on the financing, restructuring, product development fronts, speak directly to our commitment to our customers, vendors, employees and shareholders. All of them continue to express their confidence in us. Now, let's discuss our outlook for the first quarter of 2017. We expect our revenue for the first quarter of 2017 to be within the range of $60 million to $65 million. While our first quarter results are typically impacted by normal seasonality, the extraordinarily wet winter in California, where we have a strong presence, has negatively impacted our first quarter revenues. We estimate that the residential PV market in California will be off by as much as 50% in Q1. However, we believe that the California market will recover in Q2 and return to normal growth rates. Turning to margins, we expect GAAP and non-GAAP gross margin in Q1 to be within a range of 16% to 20%. Non-GAAP gross margin excludes approximately $250,000 of stock-based compensation expense. We expect GAAP operating expense for the first quarter to be within a range of $27.5 million to $29.5 million, and non-GAAP operating expense to be within a range of $19 million to $21 million, excluding an estimated $1.5 million of stock-based compensation expense and approximately $7 million of additional restructuring expense.

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the Enphase Energy’s Third Quarter 2016 Financial Results Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference Christina Carrabino, ma'am you may begin.
Christina Carrabino: Good afternoon and thank you for joining us on today’s conference call to discuss Enphase Energy’s third quarter 2016 results. On today’s call are Paul Nahi, Enphase Energy’s President and Chief Executive Officer; and Bert Garcia, Chief Financial Officer. After the market closed today, Enphase issued a press release announcing the results for its third quarter ended September 30, 2016. During the course of this conference call, Enphase management will make forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, statements related to Enphase Energy’s financial performance, market demands for its current and future product, advantages of its technology and market trends. These forward-looking statements involve significant risks and uncertainties and Enphase Energy’s actual results and the timing of events could differ materially from these expectations. For a more complete discussion of the risks and uncertainties, please see the company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 and in Enphase Energy's quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 which will be filed with the SEC in the fourth quarter of 2016. Enphase Energy cautions you not to place any undue reliance on forward-looking statements and undertakes no duty or obligation to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future events or changes in its expectations.

Now, I’d like to introduce Paul Nahi, President and Chief Executive Officer of Enphase Energy. Paul?
Paul Nahi: Good afternoon. And thanks for joining us today to discuss our third quarter 2016 financial results. We reported revenue of $88.7 million for the third quarter of 2016. We shipped 204 megawatts or 869,000 microinverters at 10% sequential increase and the second highest number of megawatts and units shipped in the history of the company and the second sequential quarter of market share gains. There are more than 540,000 Enphase systems deployed in over 100 countries. Since inception, we shipped approximately 13 million microinverters representing more than 3 gigawatts of installed generating capacity. Enphase systems have produced approximately 7 terawatt hours of clean renewable energy. Enphase is by far the largest microinverter company in the world. It's important to remember that there are two classes of rooftop inverters microinverters and string inverters. Some string inverters have optimizers others have rapid shutdown devices, but the core architecture for both is a string inverter. The many distinct advantages of a microinverter solution; simplicity, reliability, ease of maintenance, productivity and safety are widely acknowledged by both installers and consumers and are driving demand around the world. In terms of simplicity, microinveters have reduced design and insulation time and do not require any high voltage expertise in fact. The install time from microinverters can be one third of the time required to install a string inverter system. On reliability, Enphase consistently set the bar for quality and reliability and can confidently provide a 25 year warranty versus a typically shorter warranty with string inverters. As for easier maintenance, aside from eliminating any single point of failure, the key to the ease of maintaining an Enphase system rests with our smart remote monitoring. The Enphase solution is more productive, it has been repeatedly proven that microinverters produce more energy than string inverters. Safety is becoming increasingly important. Microinverters are by definition low voltage devices, utilizing the same voltage and wiring techniques used in any home, whereas string inverters are unique high voltage devices requiring up to 600 volt DC wiring running through a residence. In fact Enphase microinverters have already made critical rapid shutdown requirements with no additional equipment necessary. As part of our commitment to deliver new products and technologies that provide additional functionality, reduce cost and enhance the simplicity for our installers, we recently announced our Enphase Home Energy Solution with IQ, our next generation integrated solar storage and energy management solution. The offering features our sixth-generation Enphase micoinverter system which supports just about every 60 and 72 cell solar module and continues to simplify the design and installation process. The IQ system includes our new lightweight cable and additional accessories to speed insulation including the new aggregator that enable fast and simple branch connections on the roof. We expect the Enphase IQ microinverter system to be available in the US in the first quarter of 2017. Heralding the next generation of solar installations will be the AC module and our IQ line of microinverters is a perfect fit. Our sixth generation microinverters will be included in the AC modules from LG, SolarWorld and Jinko Solar among others. By integrating our microinverters onto the module directly. We're creating an even simpler more consolidated solution that will yet again reduce insulation time and effort. The AC module also enables a simpler warranty process, one-stop technical support and other asset management advantages such as remote monitoring for both the microinverter system and the module. We expect these modules to be available in the US and Canada in the second quarter of 2017. We continue to successfully execute on our key initiatives by introducing new products that meet our cost targets and deliver on our total energy solution. We've stated that we’re targeting approximately 50% product cost reduction over two years from the fourth quarter 2015 to the end of 17. With the launch of the Sixth Generation micro-inverter, we are solidly on track to meet this aggressive exciting target. Turning to our markets, third quarter revenue in the US rose 14% sequentially as we continue to grow our share with existing customers and expand our customer base. Our market share has increased with both the tier 1 and tier 2 installers, as well as with thousands of smaller installers across the country. We increased our presence in Europe during the third quarter by expanding existing partnerships and developing new ones. We continue to see interest in France and the Netherlands and in fact, we believe we have the number one market share in the French residential market.  In the APAC region, revenue was up 21% sequentially. We started shipping our AC battery storage solution in Australia and New Zealand during the third quarter and the response for our solution has been extremely positive. The advantages of our AC battery solution are clearly resonating with customers. Our AC battery is fully integrated, simple to install and delivers superior reliability and safety. We believe we’re the only solution in the world that can be installed in under one hour. And unlike many competitive solutions, the Enphase AC battery is suitable for any home with or without an existing solar system, regardless of the brand of inverters or solar panels previously installed.  This eliminates a potential costly upgrade of an existing solar system. The AC battery is therefore a uniquely competitive solution for homeowners looking to add storage to their existing PV solar systems. Demand for our AC battery storage solution in Australia and New Zealand remain strong. After a successful launch of our storage solution in the APAC region, we’re looking forward to launching it in the US and Europe during the fourth quarter of 2016. Turning to other markets, we continue to see growth in Latin America during the third quarter. Enphase is currently the leading choice for residential installers in Puerto Rico, where we have a very significant lead over our nearest competitors. We’re very excited about this market as the need for affordable energy there is acute. Mexico is a very competitive and exciting market.  Leading installers there have a deep appreciation for our quality and reliability and value the simplicity of our solution. As a result, we believe we are currently the leader in the Mexican residential market. Just last week, I visited with current and potential customers and came away very impressed with the strong interest in our energy system in both the residential and the commercial markets.  Our third quarter revenue results and new product introductions demonstrate our success in delivering on the strategy we outlined last year. To regain market share by offering competitive pricing enabled by aggressive cost reduction and providing a richer, more comprehensive energy solution for our customers.  I'll close my comments by noting we’re excited about the future of the solar market and our vision to realize the global potential of solar energy through our technology innovation. We remain committed to providing our customers with the features, quality, ease and simplicity of an Enphase energy solution. We believe Enphase has a clear path to develop the world's only fully integrated solar storage and energy management solution. Now, I will turn it over to Bert for his review of our financial results.
Bert Garcia: Thanks, Paul. I'll provide some more details related to our third quarter 2016 financial results as well as our business outlook for the fourth quarter. Total revenue for the third quarter of 2016 was $88.7 million, in line with the outlook we provided last quarter and an increase of 12% sequentially. We shipped approximately 204 megawatts AC or 234 megawatts DC during the third quarter of 2016, an increase of 10% compared to the second quarter.  The megawatts shipped represented 869,000 [ph] micro-inverters, all of which where our fourth and fifth generation micro inverter systems. GAAP gross margin for the third quarter of 2016 was 17.9%, non-GAAP gross margin was 18.2%, flat as compared to the second quarter. Non-GAAP gross margin excludes approximately $300,000 of stock-based compensation expense.  GAAP operating expense during the third quarter of 2016 was $33.6 million, which includes approximately $2.7 million of restructuring charges. The restructuring charges are comprised of approximately $1.4 million of non-cash expense for asset impairments and approximately $1.3 million of cash-based severance and related benefits. Non-GAAP operating expense was $28.6 million [ph], which excludes the $2.7 million restructuring charges as well as $2.2 million of stock-based compensation expense.  In order to strengthen our financial position, at the end of the third quarter we made the difficult decision to reduce our global workforce by approximately 11% and eliminate certain non-core projects. This restructuring initiative will be completed in the fourth quarter of 2016 and we expect to achieve the full benefit of these actions approximately $20 million of annualized operating expense savings beginning in the first quarter of 2017. It's important to note that the restructuring did not affect our efforts on product cost reduction, product quality, the AC battery or the AC module. During the third quarter of 2016, R&D expenses on a non-GAAP basis were $12.2 million, sales and marketing expenses were $10.4 million dollars and G&A expenses were $6 million. These expense levels do not reflect the impact of reduced headcount as our restructuring actions were taken at the end of the third quarter. On a GAAP basis, third quarter operating loss was $17.7 million dollars and net loss was $18.8 million dollars resulting in a loss of $0.40 per share. On a non-GAAP basis the operating loss was $12.4 million dollars and net loss was $13.4 million dollars resulting in a loss of $0.28 per share. Turning to the balance sheet. We held inventory levels flat in the second quarter ending with $39.1 million of inventory as of September 30. I’ll note that inventory on hand at the end of the third quarter included inventory for our AC battery solution. Excluding this, inventory levels would have decreased sequentially. We ended the third quarter with a total cash balance of $24.1 million. At the end of the third quarter we had $12.5 million drawn on our credit facility, which is unchanged from the end of the second quarter. As discussed on our last call, on July 8 we entered into a $25 million term loan agreement that was fully drawn upon closing. In addition, on September 28 we closed on a secondary offering of our common stock generating net proceeds of approximately $14 million. After quarter end and early October, we received an additional $2.2 million dollars in proceeds from the underwriters full exercise of the overall allotment related to the offering. Combined total net proceeds from the offering were approximately $16.2 million. We believe that the proceeds from our capital raised and term loan coupled with our restructuring initiative and product cost reduction plans will strengthen our financial position and enable us to continue to grow our business and chart a path to sustained profitability. Now let's discuss our outlook for the fourth quarter of 2016. We are reaffirming the guidance we provided on September 22 in connection with the offering. We expect our revenue for the fourth quarter of 2016 to be within a range of $90 million to $100 million and GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins to be within the range of 16% to 20%. Non-GAAP gross margin excludes $300,000 of stock based compensation expense. We expect our GAAP operating expense for fourth quarter to be within a range of $22.5 million to $27.5 million and non-GAAP operating expense be within the range of $20 million to $25 million excluding an estimated 2.5 million of stock-based compensation expense. Now, I’ll open the line for questions.
Colin Rusch: Thanks so much. Guys can you for just a little bit more color on the energy storage bookings to-date and what you've seen since the quarter end, you have another month to look at bookings and if you could go into kind of total numbers plus geographically location for those offerings?
Paul Nahi: So we continue to see very strong demand from Australia and New Zealand primarily from Australia. As you know that we started shipping last quarter but it was late in the quarter and we were severely supply constrained. As we look to Q4, demand looked very strong, we are - as we had talked about we are going to be entering both the US and Europe this quarter, so we don't have any data on that yet. But I'd say our expectations are well met in Australia and it looks like we should be a leading if not the leading supplier of residential storage solutions in 2017.
Colin Rusch: And then when do you think of [indiscernible] migrated away from the Gen 4 solution and finally on the just selling Gen five?
Paul Nahi: So with the advent of our IQ product line which is coming out in Q1. It's very likely that we’ll migrate from Gen 4 and Gen 5 very rapidly into Gen 6 which is the IQ line and that will happen over 2016, sorry 2017.
Colin Rusch: Okay. Perfect. And then the final one for me is just, up take on the AC module solution obviously that's still in kind of early days, but what are you seeing right now in terms of demand and sell through. 
Paul Nahi: So the only thing I can give you there Colin is sort of anecdotal data, since we do not have -- we're not shipping a product yet. What I can say is that there is tremendous demand from installers frankly across the world, but we're very focused initially on the launch in the US. The recognition of the amount of time and labor it can save, basically it eliminates the entire effort and cost associated with the installation of an inverter. Takes it really effectively to zero. It's driving a tremendous amount of interest, but we’ll be shipping it in the first half and I'll be able to give you a better view on demand probably in the late Q1 timeframe. 
Colin Rusch: All right. Perfect. Thanks so much guys.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Philip Shen from Roth. Your line is now open.
Philip Shen: Hey, guys. Thanks for the questions. We've heard that some of your extremely good competitors have recently cut pricing aggressively in the US to the tune of 25% from Q3 levels. Have you started to see this impact your sales and how do you expect to respond?
Paul Nahi: So we've seen a continual decrease in pricing from the beginning of the year. We have been responding and in fact we have taken -- we took some fairly dramatic moves early on really basically starting at the end of ‘15 through much of ’16. As a result, we felt like we caught up, if you will, to market prices and as a result, we've seen our market share grow considerably from Q1 of this year through Q3. While we fully expect there to be additional cost reductions, sorry, price reductions going forward, we've fully baked that into our plans and we believe that as a result of our cost reduction efforts, we should be able to see margin expansion through 2017 as a result of that. So I’d say that what we're seeing is not unexpected and we've been well poised and well prepared to support that.
Philip Shen: Great, Paul. As a quick follow-up on that, do you expect any additional aggressive price actions that would be outside of the normal course of business, given how much pricing has fallen in just the recent weeks or months?
Paul Nahi: No, we don't expect. We don't see anything on the horizon that would cause us to do something that was vastly different than what we've been doing over the past number of quarters. 
Philip Shen: Okay, great. With California representing a third of your installation mix, the SDG&E region recently hit the NEM 1.0 cap, right and PG&E is set to hit their cap by year-end. SC will transition by mid-2017. How do you expect this to impact demand in California in general and how do you plan to address that potential slowdown in the state? 
Paul Nahi: So what we've seen in SDG&E is a good example of it. It's basically the canary in the coal mine. They did the transition from NEM 1.0 to 2.0 and we certainly did see a slowdown for about 3 or 4 months. It was a period of time it took for installers to understand exactly what the new economics were to be able to vent and convey that to the consumer, but once they got into that rhythm, once they understood what the new numbers were and were able to create the appropriate sales material to support that, sales resumed. I think the difference in economics between NEM 1.0 and NEM 2.0 is not that dramatic. And it still would engender I think a significant growth in solar sales in the state, especially when it's accompanied with the dramatic cost reductions of the hardware component. So I think it's going to create perhaps a bumpy year where as the transitions are occurring, the installers have to adjust to that to the new numbers, but I don't think it represents a fundamental shift in demand.
Philip Shen: Okay. One last question and I’ll jump back in the queue. What kind of operating cash flow do you see in Q4 and in Q1?
Bert Garcia: So we're obviously not providing cash flow guidance for Q4, but what I can say is *** Part7 *** Part8 Cash flow guidance for Q4 but what I can say is you won't see the kind of burden in Q4 that we saw in Q3 obviously. We do expect to burn a little bit of cash in the fourth quarter and then of course in the 2017 as we launch IQ 7 with the full benefit of the restructuring behind us that we expect to be cash flow positive in the back half of 2017.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Michael Morosi from Avondale Partners. Your line is now open.
Michael Morosi: First off Bert, I guess could you talk a little bit as to what's going on at the AR line, it seems we are up pretty significantly quarter on quarter and if you could just talk about any one time items there and how you'd expect that to track on forward?
Bert Garcia: So as you probably know the back half of our years seasonally stronger than first half of the year and so the strain on working capital is kind of seen on the balance sheet with the buildup of AR. So it's really just tracking with the volume of business between Q2 and Q3, it’s about $10 million increase. As far as any one time charges, there aren't any one time items in the AR balance itself. We did have a little bit of bad debt expense that is netted out of - against that balance but nothing material.
Michael Morosi: And Paul Nahi, if you could talk to us a little bit about the competitive environment obviously, pricing has been very aggressive, but specifically there seems to be a lot of interest in the market around. Potentially very aggressive pricing from new Chinese entrants, you talked a lot about what the rapid shutoff could mean, so are you seeing any tangible signs of impact from Chinese competition just specifically, and as we look out into 2017, how would you expect market share figures to evolve going forward.
Paul Nahi: So we have seen the multiple Chinese vendors enter the market and this is not necessarily recent, we've seen them for years now and they have provided a lower price point but we haven't seen any significant migration to those inverters in the rooftop space. We have and I think what you're alluding to is we certainly have heard that there are other Chinese entrants that will come in with an optimizer solution in the Q1, Q2 timeframe of ‘17. It's certainly too early for that to be affecting our current pricing. So we're not seeing that affect, but once again I would reiterate what I had said before which is that we fully expect pricing to come down in ’17. How much of that is going be driven by Chinese inverters, how much of it is that is going to be driven by normal competition it's a little too early to say, but we expect that to happen and we've built our operating plan and have focused resources on cost reduction very specifically to be able to address that and to be able to grow share while we are reducing pricing and getting to sustainable profitability and positive cash flow.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Edwin Mok from Needham & Company. Your line is now open.
Edwin Mok: First, Paul, just maybe a question on the overall market demand, you talk [indiscernible] gaining share but do you kind of see the marketing right now, there is lot of chatter, lot of slowdown [indiscernible] and what's your view of the market right now.
Paul Nahi: So in looking at market demand, especially out of ’17, I think it's very important to look at the specific segments. So in the segments that we really have focused on and I think that we resonate very, very, very dramatically with, which is the tier twos, tier threes and the long tail. I believe that there's a tremendous amount of optimism in that market for ‘17 and it gives us confidence that we are going to see growth in those areas and it's in part because lower hardware costs of providing better economics for the consumer. There is more and more financial products specifically loan product available to them that they're able to take advantage of. That combination I think has been a very positive influence on that market and I think it's going to result in growth in ‘17 and that again because we are very dominant in that space and because we address those customer needs very specifically, I think that should bode well for Enphase and our growth in ‘17.
Edwin Mok: On the core, I think you said US grew 14% which is greater than your company growth. So [indiscernible] national decline a little bit, where is that came from? Is that euro?
Paul Nahi: I'm sorry, Edwin. Can you say it again? I didn't catch all of that. 
Edwin Mok: Sorry in the pricing, you said US grew 14%, but the overall growth on this quarter is 4%. So they imply international sales decline a little bit this quarter? Can you tell me where that came from?
Paul Nahi: So I don't believe that there was any sales decline. I think we’ve seen growth or flat market in all segments. We clearly saw growth in Australia as I had mentioned. Latin America saw a significant growth. Latin America being everything from Mexico, Puerto Rico, Central America. And even in Europe, we saw some growth. So in terms of megawatts, I think we saw growth across all segments.
Edwin Mok: Okay, great. And then on the Gen 6, now that you guys similarly have started production, given that you plan to add a little in the first quarter. Now that you have kind of started production and start to really at least ramp some inventory volume, how do you kind of think about a cost reduction of that product and it was -- your target was to cut 50% cost when you reach Gen 7, how much can you get with this Gen 6 now?
Paul Nahi: So remember that we've been reducing costs since 2015, since the end of 2015. Well, certainly, we've been reducing costs well before that. We've been reducing our costs year-on-year, every year since we've been around, but we started a very dramatic focus on cost reduction at the end of ’15 and what we said was, between the end of ’15 or early ’16 and the end of ’17, we would see a 50% reduction in cost. So we've been well on that path during 2016, which is why we've been able to reduce our prices so precipitously and yet keep gross margins flat. As we have discussed in the past, for other transitions, every time we see the introduction of a new product, we will see a step function down in costs and then over the lifetime of that product, we continue to reduce costs. So the target of getting to 50% by the end of ’17, which meant about 25% at the end of ’16 and another 25% in ’17 is well on track.
Edwin Mok: Okay, that's helpful. Last question I have, I think, last Friday, Tesla made some announcement on the new battery product, which looks pretty impressive on a cost perspective, if you just take the numbers and face value. How do you kind of see competition in the storage space, have you seen more competitor entering the market and how do you kind of think about your position in space?
Paul Nahi: So what we're seeing in Australia, I would say, that there was a period of time when we saw an increase in competition. I’d say that right now some of that competition is winnowing out and that we're seeing more and more focus on fewer solutions. Clearly, our solution has resonated very strongly with both installers and consumers in Australia, in large part because it's a complete integrated device. It is one of the safest storage devices you can buy. It is the only device that we know of that you can install with one person in one hour, an entire energy system. And because of that we believe that the total installed cost of our product offering is going to be very competitive with anything else that -- anything else that's out there.  I think what we've seen is our competitors have certainly learned from our success and are trying to develop something that is also integrated and something that is also relatively simple, but we have to keep in mind that this is not a one-size-fits-all market that the modularity of the Enphase system is unique and is enabled only because of our micro-inverter. Every house, every resident is going to have a different demand for storage, a difference amount of storage. It’s going to be dependent on solar consumption and a whole host of other things. The modularity coupled with the safety and of course our entire energy management system, I think, set us apart.
Edwin Mok: It’s very helpful color. Thanks Paul.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jeff Osborne from Cowen and Company. Your line is open.
Jeff Osborne: Yeah. Good afternoon. Most of my questions have been answered, but I just had two, one in follow-up to Philip’s question about the pricing. What is the kind of, I guess, pricing expectations baked into the guidance when you came up with that on September 22, I assume it’s not to the magnitude that Philip was referencing.
Bert Garcia: No, it was -- that was what we had said in the previous calls, our pricing was relatively stable and for ’17 and we still feel very comfortable with that assertion. And then of course we have built in a price reduction through ’17 as well. So again fully anticipating that prices will come down and have built both the operating plan and our cost reduction plan around that.
Jeff Osborne: And I know you’re not giving formal guidance for ‘17 but just with the product cycle and assuming that by the back half of the year the product cycle kicks in is material is there a path in your eyes to kind of low 20s gross margin or do you see yourself kind of stuck here in the teens, I guess it’s sort of a million dollar question.
Paul Nahi: So what we have said is that we do believe we're going to see gross margin expansion and from where we are today that would certainly imply that we could be in the low to mid 20s by the end of the year. However, we're going to be very well aware of what the market does and be able to respond to it and regardless we expect to be sustainable cash flow and sustainable profitability levels by the second half.
Jeff Osborne: And the last question I had was just to, Paul, if you could flesh out a little bit more on Australia on the storage market. Do you have a sense of A, how many units per household people are putting in and then B, there's various different economic drivers of people putting in storage, Tesla seems to be more focused on the back of market with the size of their system but can you just talk about what people are actually using the storage for and how they're looking at the economics pros and cons of moving that way.
Paul Nahi: Sure. So the primary driver and when I say primary 99% of the reason that people are putting in storage in Australia right now is effectively rate arbitrage, they want to minimize their utility bill and there is an existing feed in tariff which will expire in certain parts of Australia, it will go from what is today approximately $0.50 to around $0.06. Yet the cost of energy in many cases is north of $0.30. So, while the feed in tariff was $0.50, it made a lot of sense to continue to produce as much energy as possible and get paid for that. Once it to drop to $0.06 then instead of selling it for $0.06 and then buying it back for the mid-30sm it makes a lot more sense just to keep it and use it. That is the fundamental driver for storage in Australia. Now that requires a storage device that can cycle multiple times a day, it means that at any given time of the day you're either powering up or powering down your battery and because of that and because of the cost of storage, backup we feel doesn't make a lot of sense for our battery. There are very, very inexpensive well understood generators that can provide very inexpensive backup for as long as you have like that can power an entire home. Chemistry as a backup is still very, very expensive and it is fundamentally at odds with the used case that most people are buying it for, if you're buying it for rate optimization you're not really you don't actually have a full battery for very long. You basically fill it up and then drain it, fill it up and drain it multiple times a day which means that it's not necessarily going to be there for backup when you need it. So I understand it’s a clever marketing message to give but unfortunately is not a practical message for the consumer.
Jeff Osborne: Makes sense, appreciate it.
Paul Nahi: Sure. By the way I will just answer the last part of your question as well. What we're seeing in Austria is on average two to four AC batteries for home and each AC battery is 1.2 kilowatt hours.
Operator:
[:
Pavel Molchanov: In the Australian market, are there any policy drivers that are stimulating the demand tax credits or anything along those lines?
Paul Nahi: So in general, no, there is talk in some areas like South Australia of something potentially helping to simulate the storage market but for the most part there is nothing out there that is targeting storage.
Pavel Molchanov: And similar to what we've seen in you know places like Nevada and so forth, with utilities running up against net metering, is there any pushback that you're seeing for rooftop solar and more specifically storage integrated rooftop solar in any of the Australian jurisdictions?
Paul Nahi: So right now what we're hearing from areas like Nevada is more demand has been pushed back when as a result of some of the actions that were taken in Nevada, clearly, it does create a potential market for storage. Whether or not the utilities or the regulatory bodies push back, it’s still a little too early to make that determination, but you're very correct in noting that in areas like that, they are either intentionally or unintentionally definitely creating a market for storage.
Pavel Molchanov: Okay, yeah, I was actually referring to Australia specifically, if there are any regulatory pushbacks that you're encountering there. 
Paul Nahi: No, nothing right now. 
Pavel Molchanov: Nothing currently. Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And I'm showing no further questions at this time. I'd like to turn the call back over to Paul Nahi, President and CEO for closing remarks.
Paul Nahi: So thank you for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you again next quarter.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference. This concludes the program. You may now disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.

Now, I’d like to introduce Paul Nahi, President and Chief Executive Officer of Enphase Energy. Paul?
Paul Nahi: Good afternoon and thanks for joining us today to discuss our second quarter 2016 financial results. We reported revenue of $79.2 million for the second quarter of 2016. We shipped 186MW or 796,000 microinverters a 30% sequential increase. Competitive pricing and the introduction of our home energy solutions are driving multiple customer wins and significantly increasing our global market share. At competitive prices we've been very successful in winning new customers based on our simplicity, quality and rich feature set. We have currently more than 500,000 Enphase systems deployed in over 100 countries. Since inception, we have shipped approximately 12 million microinverters representing more than 3 gigawatts of installed generating capacity. Enphase systems have produced over 6 terawatt hours of clean energy. In the U.S. market second quarter revenue rose 20% sequentially as strong demand for energy systems increased our share with existing customers and extended our customer base. Our solar acquisition strategy continued to deliver results with multiple new wins including 8 new installers that combined represents 70 MW of new business over the next 12 months. Our microinverter solution continues to gain interest in new and existing customers because we have been able to lower our cost of solar systems while providing the highest quality and most advanced features and functionality. We addressed the need to reduce costs in three ways. First, by providing a competitively priced microinverter system; second, our technology enables installers to reduce their operating costs by simplifying designs, installation and inventory management. In addition, our forthcoming AC module and next generation AC Combiner Box will provide for this simplicity. Third, our superior communications technology allows installers to quickly and accurately determine the health of the solar systems reducing time and effort of operations and maintenance. As the features and functionality, we continue to rapidly innovate. We're focused on providing our installer partners with a more compelling sales proposition and the consumer with exciting new solutions such as a fully integrated energy system seamlessly combining solar generation, storage, load control, consumption monitoring and an energy management system that ensures the best consumer experience with the highest possible return on investment. Importantly, we are the gold standard for quality and our newest microinverters are the highest quality and most reliable we've ever built. And the pace of innovations has accelerated. In addition to supporting our partners and consumers with new technology, we're also [indiscernible] with several utilities. We recently announced a program with PG&E in California to integrate and optimize microinverters into the grid. PG&E will evaluate how smart microinverters from Enphase used with distributor solar can be coordinated and controlled for grid management and voltage optimization. In fact, we've already been working with other utilities to integrate our smart inverters and to help transform the distributed energy resources into grid assets. We see utility integration as an ongoing service opportunity that we can address with our Enlighten platform. Ultimately cost effective smart inverter integration will enable faster and wider deployment of solar. We are excited to work with PG&E and believe that it has an energy technology provider we are uniquely positioned to support their requirements. Our unique value proposition as well as the superior quality and reliability of our energy system resonates with customers globally. In Europe, revenue was up 48% sequentially as we continued to gain share especially in France and the Netherlands. During the second quarter we expanded our distribution channel and our business with several major residential installers including four key distribution partners who will further strengthen Enphase's operations and influence in the Benelux region. We were pleased to receive the top TOP PV Brand seal of approval from EuPD Research for commendable brand management and brand awareness amongst installers and solar professionals in the Netherlands. The award of this respected industry seal offers more confirmation of Enphase's commitment to product innovation, quality and technology leadership. Latin America is another region where we are seeing tremendous growth in solar adoption and the Enphase system. The regions high energy prices, solar friendly weather and the increasing need for energy resource diversification is helping fuel this growth. In Australia revenue is up 43% sequentially continued to gain share in this market. We look forward to the launch of our AC Battery storage solution in Australia and New Zealand with volume shipments starting in a couple of weeks. In fact, we've already had multiple beta sites up and running for some time and the response to our solution has been extremely encouraging. Our strong solar and storage market combined with our formidable presence and growing market share make Australia a perfect location for the global launch of our AC Battery storage and home energy solution. Our partner network of more than 1000 installers located in the region will be the first in the world to have access to the Enphase AC Battery. We expect initial demand to be driven by installers looking to retrofit existing residential solar PV systems with the storage solutions as well as new system owners seeking a cost-effective energy solution that will support local regulatory requirements. We believe that with our AC coupled architecture we are uniquely suited to support both of these markets. The Enphase AC Battery storage solution has been very well received in the Australian market because of its elegance, simplicity, modularity with our 1.2 kWh building blocks, ease of design and installation and overall performance and architecture. In fact, a complete 4.8 kWh solution can be installed in less than one hour by just one technician in any retrofit or new installation. We believe this represents an unprecedented standard in installation simplicity compared to any competitive product on the market. And this is made possible only because of our latest microinverter technology. Installers have placed preorders with our key distributors in Australia and New Zealand for over 60,000 Enphase AC batteries for delivery in the next 12 months. After the initial launch in Australia, we plan to bring the storage solution to the U.S. starting in Hawaii and Europe with first shipments to both markets expected by the end of 2016. We continue to make great progress on our cost reduction roadmap and the development of our complete home energy solution. Our sixth generation microinverter with higher performance and new advanced features is on track to meet our aggressive cost target by the end of this year. In addition, cost reduction activities are well underway for 2017 and we're on track to meet next year's cost targets as well. Enphase has been executing on an effective business strategy detailed last year regaining market share by offering competitive pricing enabled by progressive cost reductions and providing a richer, more comprehensive energy solution for our customers. In fact, we believe the company has a clear path to develop the world's only fully integrated solar storage and energy management solution. We are seeing significant market share growth in almost every geography in which we participate, including the U.S., Mexico, Puerto Rico, Latin America, Europe, especially in France, the Netherlands and Switzerland, Australia and New Zealand. Our success in these regions gives us further confidence in our strategy. As for pricing, we currently believe prices will generally stabilize throughout the remainder of this year. However, we will continue to monitor the market. I will close my comments by noting we are encouraged by our sequential growth and market share gains worldwide. We are excited about the many opportunities ahead including the upcoming launch of our AC Battery storage solution. Now, I'll turn it over to Kris for his review of our financial results.
Kris Sennesael: Thank you, Paul. I will provide some more details related to our second quarter 2016 financial results as well as our business outlook for the third quarter of 2016. Total revenue for the second quarter of 2016 was $79.2 million in line with the business outlook we provided last quarter and an increase of 24% sequentially. We shipped 186 MW AC or approximately 219 MW DC during the second quarter of 2016 an increase of 30% compared to the first quarter of 2016. The megawatts shipped represented 796,000 microinverters, all of which were our fourth and fifth generation microinverter systems. GAAP gross margin for the second quarter of 2016 was 17.9% and non-GAAP gross margin was 18.2% approximately flat compared to the first quarter of 2016. As previously discussed, we have adopted a more competitive pricing strategy ahead of product cost reductions. As we continue to execute on our cost reduction roadmap and have year-over-year price erosion returns to historical levels we expect to see gradual improvements in gross margins going forward. GAAP operating expenses during the second quarter of 2016 were $29.9 million and non-GAAP operating expenses were $27.54 which excluded $2.4 million of stock-based compensation expense. During the second quarter of 2016 R&D expenses on a non-GAAP basis were $12.1 million. Sales and marketing expense were $9.4 million and G&A expenses were $6 million. We reported GAAP operating loss of $15.8 million and a net loss of $16.7 million in the second quarter of 2016 resulting in a loss of $0.36 per share. On a non-GAAP basis operating loss was $13 million and net loss was $13.9 million resulting in a loss of $0.30 per share. Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. During the second quarter we improved our cash flow and reduced inventory levels substantially resulting in $7.3 million of positive cash flow from operations. Inventory decreased from $45.6 million at the end of the first quarter to $39.3 million at the end of the second quarter. Capital expenditures during the second quarter were $4.8 million. We started the second quarter with $13 million in cash and $20 million draw on our credit facility. During the quarter, we paid down $7.5 million on the credit facility and ended the quarter with $8.2 million of cash and $12.5 million draw on the credit facility. Cash net of borrowings increased by $2.7 million sequentially. To facilitate our continued growth we entered into a term loan agreement on July 08, and borrowed $25 million that was fully drawn upon closing. The second lien term loan facility has a term of four years with interest only during the first year and monthly repayments in equal installments during the last three years. Terms and conditions are in line with the market for this type of facility. There are no warrants preferred or common shares or other equity rights given with this facility. We believe our current cash balance as well as the cash available through our working capital facility and debt financing is sufficient to fund the growth of our business. Now let's discuss our outlook for the third quarter of 2016. We expect revenue for the third quarter of 2016 to be within a range of $87 million to $93 million as we continue to see the expansion of our business with wins at new and existing customers worldwide and include some incremental revenue from our AC Battery storage solution. We expect GAAP and non-GAAP gross margin to be within a range of 17% to 20%. Non-GAAP gross margin excludes approximately $300,000 of stock-based compensation expense. We also expect GAAP operating expense for the third quarter of 2016 to be within a range of $30 million to $32 million and non-GAAP operating expenses to be within a range of $27 million to $29 million which excludes approximately $3 million of stock-based compensation expense. Now, I will open the line for questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Edwin Mok from Needham. Your line is now open.
Edwin Mok: Hey guys, thanks for taking my question. Congrats on a good quarter. So, first question I have, Paul you mentioned a few international areas where you guys see really strong growth revenues in Europe of 48% sequentially. I was wondering how much international aggregate is now as a percent of total sales? And with these kind of stronger growth do you is sustainable that this growth rate is extending during the second half of the year?
Paul Nahi: So, international markets represent approximately 15% of our total revenue. While they are growing very dramatically, it is also true that the U.S. market is growing. So it makes it a little bit difficult to sort of catch-up and get ahead. However, we still maintain our view that we expect the international markets to be a larger portion of our total revenue than they are today. In reference to the ability to maintain the rate of growth in those markets, it is a little hard to say and it is going to be a little bit complicated by the fact that in several of these markets, specifically in the Asia-Pacific region and in Europe we are going to start introducing the AC Battery storage solution and the total energy management solution. That will obviously have a positive effect on revenue and is going to I think distort the total revenue relative to the U.S. market. But I do believe that we are going to be able to continue growing share in all these international markets, both this year as well as next.
Edwin Mok: Okay that's helpful. So maybe shifting gears to the U.S. market, we've seen, I guess more talks, at least about kind of reasonable costs, or lower pricing Chinese company entering kind of smaller scale side of the market we saw them going in the utility side. I was just wondering how is their environment like, I think you mentioned on the quarter you see pricing being more stable? With the Chinese entering are you seeing that starting to have an effect? And also kind of in terms of the market push towards more rapid shutdown in several states has that helped you guys because they were all high costs so if you can kind of give some color on that?
Paul Nahi: Sure, so you bring up a very good point. With rapid shutdown it does certainly change the equation. In part, because it does increase the cost of a string inverter and also it requires that now there are – there's electronics put on a roof and that has its own complications. Clearly Enphase is very experienced with this, with our warranty and our quality. But I can tell you from experience that getting the kind of quality that you need to have something sit on a roof for multiple years in very adverse conditions is extremely challenging. And that now represents a single point of failure for the string inverter. So I think it is going to add both cost and complexity to those designs. In reference to whether we are seeing those, the low cost offshore string inverters in the current U.S. marketplace, I think it is important to keep in mind that they've been here in one form or another for many years now and we haven’t seen them take a very large foothold in the residential market. We're not seeing that change that dramatically today, that dramatically if at all. However, we are keeping a very close eye on it and we will monitor it very tightly, but as of today we're not seeing that.
Edwin Mok: Okay, that's helpful. Last question I guess I have for Kris, just talk a little about kind of your capital structure, you talked about kind of new term loan which will obviously give you guys more capital to work with, but in terms of working capital this quarter you guys have working capital improvement do you expect to kind of fill back up inventory for second quarter ramp and is there more room you can work that down? I also noticed payable is up quite a bit, is that kind of the higher note where you can bring payables or do you think you can extend that?
Kris Sennesael: Yes, so first of all I'm pleased with the fact that we generated $7.3 million of positive cash flow from operations during the second quarter. In big part that was driven by a drastic reduction of inventory of approximately $6 million. I do believe that we can continue to further improve our inventory turns and actually further reduce inventory levels in absolute dollars as well at least in the next couple of quarters. Of course as the business continues to grow multiple quarters out there, there will eventually be an increase in optional doors of inventory levels, but still improvement in terms of inventory turns. Turning to the payables, keep in mind that Q2 volume in megawatts or unit shipments was up 30% sequentially and so as a result of that you do see somewhat of an increase in the payables as well, although slightly more than 30% and that has to do with some of the timing of the payments of certain of those vendors. Overall, I feel comfortable with the balance sheet as it is right now. As you know, we ended with $8.2 million of cash on the balance sheet. We have our working capital facility with Wells which is a up to $50 million working capital facility with a $25 million accordion feature on top of that and then after closing of the quarter we added $25 million of cash to the balance sheet with the term debt facility that we entered into.
Edwin Mok: Okay, great. Can I just squeeze one more, and I noticed that gross margin declined 60 basis points sequentially, so your plan is only down 5% is that something to do with the mix of individual versus also any product or any kind of color you can report on that?
Kris Sennesael: No, the mix was relatively stable between inverter and accessories for the last three quarters in a row. We did see a little bit of a shift back to the 215 instead of the 250 and so there was a little bit of a mixed shift there that was putting some pressure on the margins. But I would say in general the margins have bottomed out in the high teens, 18, 18.2 going forward as we execute on our product cost reduction roadmap. And of course depending on were pressing will go over, we do definitely see a little bit of a slowdown in terms of year-over-year price erosion and so, when you combine that we do expect some gradual improvements on the margins in the next couple of quarters.
Edwin Mok: Great, very good color. That’s all I have. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Philip Shen from ROTH Capital Partners. Your line is open.
Philip Shen: Hey guys, thanks for the questions. I would like to follow up on a topic you just mentioned Kris, you mentioned that the mix of M215 was greater in the quarter. There appears to be a strong trend in the industry where installers and developers are demanding higher powered panels and the premiums required in those panels are coming down. Do you expect on a go forward basis a greater demand for the M250? Can you share what the mix of 250s versus 215s was in Q2 and then perhaps how that might trend in Q3 and Q4?
Kris Sennesael: Right and definitely over the last couple of quarters we have seen a shift from the 215 to the 250, I believe it was roughly 50-50 and going forward we definitely continue to see that shift to higher power modules being paired with higher power microinverters. Due to some customer mix and other shift in Q2 the mix shifted slightly more towards 215, but I do not believe that this a trend. On the contrary, I think the trend is definitely a shift towards higher power modules and higher power microinverters in the next couple of quarters.
Philip Shen: Great, I think we see 80-20 or something that start as soon as the next couple of quarters or do you think it will be a more leisurely or slower pace?
Paul Nahi: So I don’t think it's going to be, so this is Paul. I don’t think it's going to be that dramatic that fast. We completely agree with your comment and are seeing both from the suppliers more and more higher power modules and more of a demand for higher power modules from the installers. However these transitions can take a little bit of time. So I would caution against assuming too rapid a shift, but if you look at our next generation microinverter which is coming out end of this year or early next, that will be yet again even higher power to support the even larger modules that are coming out. So, I think that certainly over the next number of quarters we’re going to see a shift, a fairly dramatic shift away from the lower power inverters to the higher power inverters.
Philip Shen: Great, thanks Paul. Kris you mentioned earlier that you expect inventory turns and the absolute dollars to come down over the next couple of quarters, anyway you can quantify that at all?
Kris Sennesael: No, so in second quarter it was a reduction of $6 million over the next couple of quarters we're looking at $1 million or $2 million per quarter.
Philip Shen: Okay, good that’s helpful and with the new term loan your interest expense on an annualized basis should be now close to the $4 million plus. Can you talk about what kind of operating cash flow we should see in Q3 and Q4?
Kris Sennesael: So, that the interest is not $4 million a quarter, right? Did you say $4 million a quarter?
Philip Shen: Sorry if I said that, I mentioned $4 million a year.
Kris Sennesael: Right, right, so yeah, so we obviously have dialled in interest. By the way the term loan first year is interest only and then in the last three years it is a straight amortization and equal installments. So that obviously is all dialed in, into our cash flow.
Philip Shen: Great. And then what kind of operating cash flows could we see in Q3 and Q4?
Kris Sennesael: So again, we were pleased with the fact that we generated cash in the second quarter, in part of course, because of the inventory reduction of approximately $6 million. So when I look at the second half of 2016, we are not going to repeat $6 million per quarter inventory reduction. So it is going to be less than that $1 million or $2 million a quarter as I indicated. As a result of that, there is still going to be cash burn in the second half of 2016, although when I look down to the first quarter of 2017, in part due to the seasonality of the business, we do expect to generate cash in the first quarter of 2017.
Philip Shen: Great, thank you, Kris. Thank you, Paul.
Kris Sennesael: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Justin Clare from ROTH Capital Partners. Your line is open. If your phone is on mute, please unmute. If your phone is on mute Justin, please unmute. And our next question comes from Tony Wayne [ph] from ROTH Capital Partners. Your line is open.
Kris Sennesael: All three of them were from ROTH. So I think we should move on to the next one.
Operator: And our next question comes from Michael Morosi from Avondale Partners. Your line is now open.
Michael Morosi: Hi guys. Thanks for taking the question. First, just to clarify with respect to 3Q guidance, does that include any revenue from the AC storage products which you will be shipping in the quarter and going forward do you anticipate breaking out revenue across products?
Kris Sennesael: So the guidance does include a couple million dollar revenue from AC battery storage solution in Q3. Obviously we are just starting to ship that product and that solution, we do expect a very steep ramp in more meaningful revenue in Q4 of 2016 and beyond in 2017.
Michael Morosi: Very good, yes with respect to the overall market obviously you are a large player in the U.S. residential segment who continues to walk down guidance. And there is some debate as to how much is company specific or whether it is attributable to your broader slowdown in demand, what are you guys seeing in terms of overall growth in the back half of the year in conversations with your customers and any indications of how the growth outlook is tracking into 2017?
Kris Sennesael: It is actually a very good question, one that we are bit wrestling with ourselves. Clearly, the market itself is very fragmented. We are seeing perhaps a slowdown in the California market, but burgeoning markets in other areas like Texas however still a much smaller market. Our view still remains fairly consistent that year-over-year, we expect 25% to 28% increase in 2016 over 2015, but we are going to remain cautious a little bit right now until we get a few more data points.
Michael Morosi: Okay. That is helpful and then with respect to the pilot that you have at PG&E, are you recognizing any revenue from that and just bigger picture did you view this as pretending essentially new products line and what are you seeing in terms of your incremental revenue from this utility segment longer term, and how are you thinking about the potential for utilities to even potentially rate base inverters as essentially part of their smartgrid investment programs?
Paul Nahi: Right. So I think I would start by saying that it seems inevitable that utilities need to be a participant in the solar market for us to continue to grow. It is in part because we need to find a business model that accommodates both utilities as well as the solar industry and it is important simply for grid stabilization. We partnered with HECO in Hawaii to help address some of the challenges they had, because of our smart inverters down there and because of our ability to remotely, both provide monitoring capabilities of the grid itself, as well as and an ability to change operating characteristics of our inverters, we were able to help them stabilize their grid. And we have – we do have a revenue contract with HECO to help sort of continue that. In reference to PG&E, we're still in the very early stages of establishing what the technologies need to be in order to provide the same services. And then the second phase of that would be a deeper understanding of the exact business models. So right now it is, PG&E doesn't have a lot of experience yet with the remote management and monitoring of solar inverters. We're helping provide both the Power Electronics to make that happen as well as the communications and the big data analytics that together give PG both a visibility on the grid and the ability then to make certain requests, which we would then implement on the inverters themselves. We are also seeing similar requirements or similar explorations in the Asia-Pacific region as well with some of the utilities down there. So I think overall, it's almost inevitable that there needs to be a deeper integration between the utilities in the solar industry. And through that – through the course of that I think that the opportunity to rate base either the product or the service certainly exists. We have had some initial discussions about that as well and it's very much aligned with our current strategy, so strategy both and core competencies. So we're going to – we're going to stay very active and engaged on this, and as we develop the business models with our utility partners we will keep you up to speed and up to date.
Michael Morosi: Great thanks for that Paul. And then just one last one, with respect to the guidance that you expect pricing to stabilize in the back half of the year, what's giving you confidence in that outlook? Is it that you've been kind of in control of your pricing all along and Enphase as the aggressor is deciding to take a step back based on where your market share is leveled out or what are other factors that are driving that outlook?
Paul Nahi: Well, quite a few factors, clearly the biggest one for us is just looking at the market itself and looking at the empirical data that we're seeing. As we had spoken about in the prepared remarks, we have seen that once we get to competitive pricing, we do believe that we can win a majority of the deals, and we've seen that empirically because of the advantages of our solution, the simplicity, the ease of design installation, the extra energy production, the holistic solution. And we took some very aggressive pricing actions, both the latter part of 2015 as well as the first half of 2016. And in speaking to our customers in the markets we're seeing that the pricing environment seems to have generally stabilized, that doesn't mean that it is exactly stable, it just generally stabilized. And we're going to continue to monitor it and then obviously, if we see things change we will respond accordingly. But we’ll stay abreast of that and adjust our operating metrics based on our target market share numbers and net income and cash flow management.
Michael Morosi: Great, thanks guys.
Paul Nahi: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Vishal Shah of Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.
Vishal Shah: Yes, hi, thanks for taking my question. Paul, in the conference call one of the larger EV [ph] companies mentioned that they have advanced power electronics capability and that were looking to make a new order themselves. I guess my question is, what do you think about new entrants getting into the space, what do you think about some of the large EV [ph] companies getting into the new order space and then how do you see some of the Chinese competitors also reacting to the marketplace right now?
Paul Nahi: Sure. So as I mentioned before, in terms of the offshore inverters, they've been around for quite some time. That's nothing new. We are hearing more about them and I think they're making a lot of noise right now. We're not seeing a very dramatic shift in our customer base to the offshore manufacturers, but we'll stay abreast of that and if it changes we'll certainly let you know, but we're not seeing that shift right now. In reference to other people getting interested in Power Electronics I think there are those companies that have - that may have that expertise and we may or may not see them as successful in this space. Remember that in order to produce a successful product, you need three distinct technologies. You need the Power Electronics, which in the case of a microinverter it also includes deep semiconductor expertise. You need a communications technology, and you also need big data analytics, cloud based analytics. We've said many times that we're collecting today somewhere in the neighborhood of two or three terabytes of data every day, and we're using this data to provide analytics to our partners and we have a very robust and very heavily used API that our partners use all the time to extract the data for their use. On the Power Electronics side, we talked about all the capabilities that are now required in a microinverter. They go far beyond DC to AC conversion. And communications, is a vastly complex subject that involves not just communications from the inverter to the gateway device, but then an understanding of the division of labor if you will in compute power between what's being done at the inverter, what’s being done at the gateway and then what's being done at the cloud, and then managing that. So and then obviously, I'm not even, I haven’t even begun to talk about the manufacturing requirements. In order to get to the kind of quality levels we've achieved. So I'm sure that there are people who are interested in this space, and I think new entrants are healthy and they may bring some new technologies, but I feel very comfortable that we have a very strong and defensible position that it would be very challenging for a new entrant to match at this time.
Vishal Shah: That's helpful. Can you maybe talk about your assumptions that you’re baking into your guidance for positive cash and cash generation in Q1 of next year and what kind of margins do you to expect, you assume – are you assuming just margin improvement? And then, you mentioned pricing is stabilizing cost reductions will improve, can you talk about what kind of cost reductions we should assume over the next 12 months with existing portfolio and new product as well?
Kris Sennesael: So, yes, I can talk a little bit about that. We have laid out an aggressive, but realistic cost reduction roadmap during our Analyst Day in November of 2015 and the target there was to go and drive down the cost 50% over the time period of two years. So towards the end of 2017, and in the meantime, we continue to drive down the cost of our fourth generation product, which is the majority of the shipments that we do right now towards the end of 2016. And then ramping in 2017 we will introduce our sixth generation product that we will then also continue to further cost reduce and then towards the end of 2017 ramping up in 2018 we will bring our seventh generation product to the market there and that will be on or about 50% cheaper from a cost point of view than where we were at the end of 2015. So we feel really good about the execution on that product cost reduction roadmap. A lot of progress has been made. Our sixth generation product is up and running has been placed on roofs, is going through the long term quality and reliability testing right now. And we feel really good about our product. The cost of that product is on target even slightly below were we targeted that, and we feel good as well on the execution towards the seventh generation towards the end of 2017 as well. So I think that is great execution in driving down the cost. When you talk about margin there again you have to bring the other side of the equation pricing into it, and I think Paul has talked about that. We do expect to return to more historical levels in terms of year-over-year price erosion and so the combination of those two will help us to gradually improve the margins in the next couple of quarters.
Vishal Shah: Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Colin Rusch from Oppenheimer. Your line is now open.
Colin Rusch: Thanks so much. You guys have talked a little bit about the inventory, but not so much about the receivables levels or the payable levels, payables are up pretty substantially for the quarter. Can you give us a sense of where you expect that to level out and is that’s going to be drag on cash at all as we go into the back half of the year?
Kris Sennesael: Yes, as I stated before payables are up sequentially, but again take into account that unit shipment was up 30% sequentially and so that definitely drove a lot of the increase in payable. And so as we continue to grow the business and continue the unit shipments and megawatt shipments, you can expect that the payables will continue to grow as well. Now there is sometimes, some seasonality to that as well and depending on certain payments to certain vendors, you will see some fluctuations there quarter-to-quarter. So definitely Q2 is somewhat on the higher end in terms of payable and so that will not repeat itself in Q3 and Q4, and that's why as I answered the previous question, I do believe that there will be some cash burn in the second half of 2016. But again, as revenue improves, as margins start gradual improving, as we continue to manage our operating expenses and drive improvements on the bottom line and continue to work on the balance sheet as well by further inventory level reduction you will see the cash burn to reduce over time and get back to positive cash flows into Q1 of 2017.
Colin Rusch: Okay, great. And then as you start [ph] out the energy storage product, what is your expectation here in the first couple of quarters on the impact to gross margins? I understand it's a fairly small amount of revenue, but that product profitable at the gross margin level and is it enhancing or really dragging a little bit on the overall gross margin?
Paul Nahi: So the steady state volume production of the storage unit is going to be at corporate gross margin. So we feel very good that it's going to be a very positive influence both on the bottom line as well as cash. And as I said it will be at corporate gross margin. Initially in our first shipments it may be slightly less, but that's just some issues associated with ramp up in Q – it just in this quarter.
Colin Rusch: Okay, thanks guys. I'll take all the rest offline. Thank you.
Paul Nahi: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Jeff Osborne from Cowen and Company. Your line is now open.
Jeffrey Osborne: Great, I just had two questions and a clarification. Just maybe a clarification on Colin's question there on the corporate gross margins, obviously the corporate gross margins have changed a lot over the past year and a half. So if I'm hearing right do you expect them to be in the high teens for storage or 30% where you used to be?
Paul Nahi: Well, I think it's going to fall our corporate gross margin. So I think you can assume that as our corporate gross margins increase it will increase with it for the same reasons at the corporate gross margin will increase.
Jeffrey Osborne: Got it. So that's just because of the – I guess, I was just trying to figure out, because there's a lot of third party content in the storage product. Obviously you’re making a microinverter component as part of the feature set that maybe the third of the value of it, but that third party content won't be a drag on that at steady state year from now?
Paul Nahi: So the AC Battery consists of obviously all the mechanicals, all the cabling, the microinverter itself, several other controller boards are go inside the – inside the AC Battery. And all of these as we ship our first generation product are exactly that our first generation products. So there is going to be a tremendous amount of opportunity to continue to reduce everything other than the chemistry itself. The chemistry itself, again the industry, the residential storage industry is very nascent, it's just starting. So we fully expect to see significant reduction in cost on the batteries themselves, which should also help in gross margin. So you're exactly correct that there is more third party content in the AC Battery than there is in just the microinverter, but there's still a tremendous amount of room and everything that we add value to around that to reduce costs and we expect to stay ahead of the cost reduction curve on the chemistry itself.
Jeffrey Osborne: Got it. It’s helpful, I appreciate that Paul. Just two other ones, so if I'm hearing you right kind of reading between the two waves it sounds like the inventory levels were maybe a bit bloated on the M215 side, and then you substantially discounted those this quarter during the first half of the year to kind of clear that out. Is it right to think that the bulk of the finished goods inventory is more at the M250 level, which better aligns yourself with what the industry wants or do we still have some 215s that need to be cleared out?
Paul Nahi: No, there was no – we didn't do anything on pricing to clear out either to 215s or to 250s. We - this was just sort of good inventory hygiene that's all. In terms of mix, the mix is – the mix that we have in inventory right now remains very similar to the mix we had prior to the quarter starting, just less of it.
Jeffrey Osborne: You might not know this, [indiscernible] there was the 215 demand outside of the U.S., I mean it's just a very low watch system [ph]?
Kris Sennesael: No, no it's both inside and out. Again, because we are tied to a particular module, we will fluctuate a bit based on the volatility of the module market. So if there is an influx of lower power modules at may be very low cost, we may see an increase in the 215s. I think as was brought up before the general trend is very clear, it is up into the right in terms of module power. And we're seeing costs come down on the higher power modules very significantly. So we – there’s no question that the trend is towards higher power microinverters, but in the short term quarter-on-quarter you're going to see fluctuations.
Jeffrey Osborne: Got it. The last question I had is just, as you’ve undertaken this pricing strategy the past couple of quarters, what is your sense after speaking with customers and then seeing the elasticity of demand which is certainly playing out based on the unit shipments on a pennies per watt or percentage premium so to speak for all of the advantages that you mentioned of ease of installation and other items Paul, that people are willing to pay, is that 10%, 20%, just how do you think about what the right premium pricing strategy is going forward relative to string or optimizers, obviously it was much higher before, but looking forward how do we think about what that premium should be?
Paul Nahi: Right. So yes exactly correct. Before it was much higher, but the reality of the environment today is that our customers are facing a very competitive environment themselves. And while they have expressed a desire to use Enphase, some of them have he felt that they just simply can't afford the premiums that they used to have to pay for it and that and so some of them had moved away to a cheaper product. Now that we are more price competitive, we're seeing them come back and we're gaining new customers all the time. In reference to your question about how much of a premium, it is very hard to say, because it really depends on any individual installer. I would say that it could be anywhere between 10% and 20% that we see that we will win the majority of those deals. Some installers are going to be far more sensitive to pricing, others place a greater value on our future set and simplicity, and are partnering with us on some other software initiatives as well. So I know it's a relatively broad range, but the market itself is rather fragmented in that respect.
Jeffrey Osborne: I appreciate it, thanks guys.
Paul Nahi: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Krish Sankar from Bank of America-Merrill Lynch. Our line is open.
Chirag Odhav: Hi this is Chirag Odhav on for Chris. So some people are forecasting a potential over capacity on the module side, which could lead to prices going lower for modules, do you see this having any impact on inverters, DC like a decline on the module and softening any expected price declines for inverters?
Paul Nahi: I think the inverters have their own price decline that’s been going on. I don't think that lower cost modules will have any significant impact on the pricing front on inverters. I do think, again to point out a previous caller's remarks, I think that does mean that there's going to be a fluctuation in mix that as the prices come down we may see one quarter more 215s, another quarter more 250s, I think that there may be some volatility there, but I don't think it's going to have a significant impact on an inverter pricing.
Kris Sennesael: Yes, and so obviously the panel market or the module market is 60 gigawatt worldwide and is used in utility scale projects and commercial projects and residential projects. The inverter market is much more fragmented and string inverter or central inverter for utility scale has nothing to do with a inverter for a residential system in the U.S. market, a totally different market.
Chirag Odhav: All right, got you, thanks.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Pavel Molchanov from Raymond James. Your line is now open.
Pavel Molchanov: Thanks for taking the question guys. I wanted to kind of dive down into the Australian storage opportunity. You clearly seem very optimistic about customer adoption, but there are a lot of companies chasing that market, you know from Germany, from China, from the U.S. and some local players as well. What gives you the confidence that your individual solution versus all of the other battery solutions in Australia will be capturing the relatively limited demand that there is?
Paul Nahi: Right so it is hard to gauge, let me address the last part of your question first, I don't know what the demand is yet. We have our own estimates, but it could be very significant depending on several factors. We know that the economic case for storage is very different in different parts of Australia. In New South Wales it is more about rate arbitrage and Queensland is more about power export limiting and I think those will drive different demand profiles. As to our confidence, it was very clear that we actually haven’t installed an AC battery yet. So all of our thoughts, all of our confidence comes from the fact that we have multiple beta sites already in Australia. The people who have installed our systems have also installed competitive systems, whether it is from China or whether it is from the U.S., whether it is from Germany or Europe and 201 [ph] we have heard that our solution is not only the simplest, but its modularity provides an ability to customize that solution for that particular consumer. Remember, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, one person can install approximately 5 kWh in one hour. I don't believe that there is a competitive solution around that can make any claim anywhere near that and yet we are seeing that happen. So, on one hand we are very competitively priced just from a CapEx perspective. We have far and away the simplest installation process. So we reduce installation costs. Our communications technology and our big data analytics allows us to extract the data and then provide an energy management system to appropriately manage that source. Remember, the minute you add storage to a solar system, you must have now an energy management system. You need to know what you're generating, what you are consuming, what is the state of charge of the battery is, what the weather is, what the rate structure is, what the regulatory requirements are. So that you can then decide how to manage that battery when to charge and discharge to provide the highest return on investment for the consumer. We are today the largest residential solar marketing company in the world. We know data and data management very likely better than any other solar company, so we have that aspect of it as a core competency. Our microinverter gives us the ability to provide the modular solution so you can have 1.2 kWh blocks so you can tailor that system, the size of the system because it is AC coupled we work in retrofit markets. Many of the existing systems don’t work in retrofit markets and are only working in new systems and yet it is our belief that a large portion of the Australian market is going to be retrofit, specifically New South Wales. And again, so that combination of simplicity, cost effectiveness and providing that totally integrated symptoms is what is enticing and providing the excitement for our customers and it is what is driving our confidence.
Pavel Molchanov: Okay, given that you haven’t, as you said, haven’t sold any commercial deliveries yet, conceptually how even are we pricing this? It is a brand new market. You are a new player in that market. So what's the price calculation like?
Paul Nahi: So the current pricing is very competitive with similar parts on the market. I would say it is middle to low end of the range which is just pure CapEx. What we did is, we looked at it two ways, one was obviously evaluating the competitive environment and two, was looking at the current rate structure to provide the economics that would make the solution in general very interesting. That is sort of what led us to the existing pricing where we are. Obviously over time we will be reducing our cost and our price and getting more and more competitive and looking at larger and larger markets, not just in Australia, but in Europe and in Hawaii and other locations as well. But we feel that we have a good balance right now to address the existing market and our customers have told us and I think that the backlog that we currently have would be indicative of finding that right price point. Again, we know we are going to have to over time reduce it and that's the nature of the business, but I think for the time being we feel that we've found a sweet spot.
Pavel Molchanov: All right. I appreciate it guys.
Paul Nahi: Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from Carter Driscoll from FBR. Your line is open.
Carter Driscoll: I appreciate you taking my questions gentlemen. I wanted to get a sense of the amount of share that you think you've regained since you instituted your aggressive pricing cuts late last year, do you feel that you've regained and maybe even taken share in the U.S. residential market? How do you think about that quantitatively? And then I have a followup.
Paul Nahi: So, we think that between Q1 and Q2 we've gained around 6 percentage points which is approaching around 30% share.
Carter Driscoll: Very helpful, thank you. In terms of your comments which I thought was very interesting, your pilot with PG&E and future kind of growth in those market hike with the utilities really adopting DG or becoming more comfortable with it, you mentioned some other utilities that or maybe with the solution maybe have recent pilot stage, can you talk about the geographies that are outside of which you had mentioned was Hawaii and then California, are there other states that you think? I'm trying to get a sense of which utilities might be more forward thinking or acceptable moving forward in helping push DG forward outside of the traditional territories?
Paul Nahi: Right, right, it is actually a very good question. Unfortunately I am not at liberty to talk about the specific utilities that we're talking with right now, but they are not in – well in addition to the utilities we are talking about in Hawaii and California there are definitely other utilities both in the Central, Midwest and Northeast United States that we are in discussions with. I think the larger point here is that and Enphase has never taken a confrontational stance with the utilities. We understand that they have to find business models to make this work and they need to make sure that the application of distributed resources does not disrupt the grid. We believe that there are multiple ways to find not just the right technologies but the right business models and as an energy technology provider we thing we're in a very good position to help them work through some of these issues.
Carter Driscoll: And how long do you envision the pilot phase with PG&E will last? I mean has it really come up to whether it can be rate based or what types of other qualitative issues they have to work through to accelerate the pilot program if you can?
Paul Nahi: I don’t know that the target goal of this pilot is to get to a rate based solution, although I think that getting to a rate based solution is certainly a lot of a goal and it is one that we're after. The initial goal of the PG&E engagement is really to test out the different technologies, try to understand how PG&E can work with distributed energy resource provider like Enphase to both monitor the grid as well as provide the appropriate controls and then this is on a limited basis initially and then we will follow up with discussions on how to go wider, how to institutionalize the process and then of course what the right business model is which of course would include the potential to rate base it
Carter Driscoll: I appreciate you answered my question. I will get back in queue.
Paul Nahi: Great, thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And this does conclude our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the conference back over to Paul Nahi for any further remarks.
Paul Nahi: Well, thank you for joining us today and we look forward to speaking with you again next quarter.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This concludes today's program. You may all disconnect. Everyone have a great day.

Now, I’d like to introduce Paul Nahi, President and Chief Executive Officer of Enphase Energy. Paul?
Paul Nahi: Good afternoon and thanks for joining us today to discuss our first quarter 2016 financial results. We reported revenue of $64.1 million for the first quarter of 2016. We shipped 143MW or 611,000 microinverters and 11% sequential increase resulting from the expansion of our existing worldwide customer base and new customer wins that drove our market growth during the first quarter. Enphase continues to be a leading choice for residential and commercial installers in the U.S. and a growing number of installers in our international markets. There are currently over 460,000 Enphase systems deployed in over 100 countries. Since inception, we've shipped approximately 11 million microinventers representing more than 2.8 GW of installed generating capacity. Enphase systems have produced over 5 TW hours of clean energy. As we discussed last quarter, the second half of 2015 proved challenging as pricing pressure in our U.S. and international businesses increased affecting our year-over-year revenue growth. However, we continued to drive the adoption of the microinverter technology by providing our customers with more features and functionality and ever-increasing quality and reliability, all while we continue to simplify design and installation and we did all this at very competitive prices. In fact we're seeing the effectiveness of our new pricing strategy with multiple new customer wins increasing share with existing customers. We're currently selling to seven of the top 10 tier one installers in the U.S. residential market and in addition our market shares increased with tier two installers as well as with thousands of smaller installers across the country. We also continued to drive revenue from other go to market channels including the new homebuilder segment, roofers, HVAC installers and new alternative financing providers. In addition, our work with multiple module manufacturers to develop an AC module, a solar module with an integrated microinverter is progressing very well and we're looking forward to its introduction in early 2017. As anticipated our revenue and gross margin results for the first quarter impacted by lower pricing, but we're very encouraged by wins at new and existing customers and are confident they will continue to contribute to our growing market share. While the decline in gross margin is challenging as expected our pricing strategy is working and we believe that we will see gradual improvements to our gross margin going forward. We continue to make great progress on our cost reduction roadmap and the development of our complete home energy solution. Our next generation microinverter with higher performance and new advanced features is currently going through a rigorous quality and reliability testing and is on track to meet our cost target by the end of this year. In addition, cost reduction activity is underway for 2017 and we are well on track to meet next year's cost target. The development of our Home Energy Solution is progressing very well. Our storage solution is in trials in Australia and is being very well received. We're seeing excellent results and are looking forward to the launch of the AC Battery solution in Australia this summer. We're more enthusiastic about battery storage than ever before. The simplicity, ease of design and installation, modularity and performance of our AC Battery is unique in the industry and the advantages over competitive solutions are becoming increasingly clear. The dynamics of the residential solar market in Australia make it one of the most storage ready regions in the world. The robust market as well as our strong presence and growing market share make the Australian market the perfect place for the global launch of our AC Battery and Home Energy Solution. We will also be providing our unique technology to other markets as we see strong interest in a complete energy solution in many countries worldwide. I recently visited with current and potential customers in the EMEA region and came away encouraged and impressed with the strong interest in our Home Energy Solution in Europe. The Enphase energy management system addresses regulatory requirements, increases the economic benefits of solar systems and enables more energy independence. The solar industry in France and the Netherlands is expanding and Enphase continues to grow its market share in these countries. Our success in market share growth in Europe and the Asia-Pacific region contributed to GTM Research recently naming Enphase as the number one provider of monitoring software for residential PV segment globally while remaining the leader in the same segment for the Americas. I will close my comments by noting we are encouraged by the positive industry outlook and are excited about the many opportunities ahead. We remain committed as ever to enhancing our core products and services that have the ability to change the face of energy production, storage and management. Now I'll turn over to Kris for his review of our financial results.
Kris Sennesael: Thank you, Paul. I will provide some more details related to our first quarter 2016 financial results as well as our business outlook for the second quarter of 2016. As a reminder, the financial measures that I'm going to provide are on a non-GAAP basis unless otherwise noted. Total revenue for the first quarter of 2016 were $64.1 million in line with the business outlook we provided last quarter. We shipped 143 MW AC or approximately 168 MW DC during the first quarter of 2016 an increase of 11% compared to the fourth quarter of 2015. The megawatts shipped represented 611,000 microinverters, all of which were our fourth and fifth generation microinverter systems. Gross margin for the first quarter of 2016 was 18.8%. As we have previously discussed, we have been reducing our prices ahead of product cost reductions. Revenue per AC watt for the first quarter of 2016 was $0.45 down 16% year-over-year and down 12% sequentially. Revenue from accessories during the first quarter of 2016 decreased 15% from the fourth quarter of 2015 contributing to the sequential decrease of our revenue per watt. Operating expenses during the first quarter of 2016 were $28.1 million including $500,000 of bad debt expense. During the first quarter of 2016 R&D expense were $11.9 million, sales and marketing expense were $9.6 million and G&A expenses were $6.6 million. Total non-GAAP operating expenses excluded $2.7 million almost all of which was stock based compensation expense. We reported non-GAAP operating loss of $16 million and a net loss of $15.7 million in the first quarter of 2016 resulting in a loss of $0.34 per share. On a GAAP basis net loss for the first quarter 2016 was $18.8 million or a net loss of $0.41 per share. Turning to the balance sheet, we exited the first quarter of 2016 with a total cash balance of $13 million. We ended the first quarter with a $20 million draw on our credit facility. We believe our current cash balance as well as the cash available through our working capital facility is sufficient to fund the growth of our business. We exited the quarter with $45.6 million in inventory. We will continue to take actions to drive down days of inventory outstanding during 2016. Current inventory levels are high but we continue to run the production lines in anticipation of the expected revenue and unit growth in both the second quarter and the second half of 2016. During the first quarter, capital expenditures were $3.3 million and depreciation and amortization were $2.7 million. Now let's discuss our outlook for the second quarter of 2016. We expect revenue for the second quarter of 2016 to be within a range of $76 million to $82 million. As we are seeing the expansion of our business we have wins at new and existing customers worldwide. At the midpoint of the range revenue is expected to be up 23% sequentially and megawatt shipments are expected to be up 32% sequentially, demonstrating further market share gains. We expect gross margins to be within a range of 17% to 20%. We also expect non-GAAP operating expenses for the second quarter of 2016 to be within a range of $27 million to $29 million. And now, I will open the line for questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Philip Shen with ROTH Capital Partners. Our line is open.
Philip Shen: Hey guys, thanks for taking my questions. In terms of your competition, can you talk about how your competitors are reacting to your recent price cuts? Have you seen corresponding price cuts from them and can you break out the, I guess in so far as you can break out the answer between string inverters and DC optimized inverters that would be helpful?
Paul Nahi: So, as you've correctly noted, we are taking very pricing actions and we’ve been tremendously successful with it in terms of gaining market share. What we've seen as a result of that, is that the microinverter architecture is definitely the preferred architecture that we can be at or slightly above competitive pricing. In doing so, we have seen some very aggressive moves from our competitors. The good news is that despite those moves we continue to win share with our current pricing as it is. So I think the existing pricing strategy is working very well. I think the thesis is playing out nicely. In terms of the specifics between string inverters string inverters with optimizers we actually don't make that distinction. For us it's micros and then our competitors are one form of string or another, so we're seeing the reaction to our pricing sort of across the board.
Philip Shen: Okay, thanks Paul. And in terms of ASPs, can you talk about how you expect them to trend perhaps beyond Q2, so we saw down 16-ish percents year-on-year in the first quarter, how do you guys see the ASPs evolving throughout the rest of the year? And when do you expect you may need to take your next price action?
Paul Nahi: So we are again very encouraged by the success of the pricing action, and while we do not guide to future price moves, what we can say is this, the confidence that we have in the cost reduction roadmap, today we have the product that will be introduced at end of this year. It is up, it is running, it is in trials. It is going through our QA testing as we speak. It is on track at the target cost. That provides the confidence for us to be able to continue to be aggressive on pricing throughout the end of the year. The specifics as I mentioned I am not going to be able to provide for you, but I can say that we are very well positioned and poised to continue on with the current strategy.
Philip Shen: Okay great. One last question here from me. In terms of the balance sheet Kris, you just talked about how your existing line of $20 million plus the existing cash and so forth can - is enough to get you guys through this process. I was surprised that cash kind of fell to $13 million in the quarter. Can you just walk was through in more detail on how you manage through in the next few quarters?
Kris Sennesael: Yes Phil, definitely happy to answer that question and I'll take maybe a little bit more time. The way I look at it is three basic parts to that question. First of all, we are improving the financial performance of the company. Secondly, we are driving further working capital improvements especially on the inventory side and then thirdly, it's all cash and having access to cash. And let me start with the first one, improving the financial performance of the company. First of all, we continue to see strong overall growth of the total available market and the markets that we play. The U.S. residential market continues to be strong as well as many other markets that we play in. So the strong overall growth and since we've adopted our new pricing strategy we are back to gaining market share in markets that are growing very strong, so that results in top line growth as you can see by the guidance that we provided for the second quarter. We do expect the revenue to continue to grow and further improve not only in the second quarter but also in the second half, also in part because in the second half of 2016 we will start adding revenue from the AC battery storage solution that will go on sale there as well. In addition to that, as Paul just pointed out we see some good production on our cost reduction roadmap that will over time gradually result in margin improvements and of course we will continue to manage our operating expenses as we have done now and have got a couple of quarters in a row now by keeping them relatively flat. And so I do expect over time, here quarter after quarter top line improvements and bottom line improvements and that will help to reduce the cash burn. Secondly, it is about working capital and especially inventory. We ended Q1 with approximately $45 million of inventory, approximately $5 million from where it was at the end of 2015. Current inventory levels are too high, but we felt comfortable with the inventory levels in anticipation of the increased revenue and increased unit growth that we expected and that we are seeing in the second quarter and beyond that. Having said that, we are working on improving our inventory turns and bringing down the absolute dollar amount of inventory that we carry on our balance sheet. And then thirdly, it is all about having the cash and access to cash. As you know, we ended the quarter $30 million of cash. In addition to that or we do have a working capital facility with Wells Fargo of $50 million. In addition to that we have an accordion feature of $25 million on top of that. And yes, we will continue to look at opportunities in the capital markets, especially the debt market. As you know, we do have universal shelf of $35 million available to us. However, our point of view hasn’t changed on that. We currently do not have any intention to go and raise equity because again, we believe that a combination of improving the financial performance, driving down inventory levels and the cash that we have, plus the access to cash that we have currently is sufficient to grow inventory, grow the business.
Philip Shen: Okay, thank you Kris. Thank you Paul. I'll pass it on.
Kris Sennesael: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Osborne with Cowen and Company. Your line is open.
Jeffrey Osborne: Hey good afternoon. I just want to follow up on that line of questioning. Is there any covenants that we need to be aware of, I can look it up later tonight, but on the line of credit or the accordion and in the cash balances minimum margins, anything like that?
Kris Sennesael: No, on the working capital facility there is a $15 million minimum liquidity of which $5 million is coming from availability under the line and so that's the major and I would say only covenant that we have under that $50 million working capital facility.
Jeffrey Osborne: Go it. And then Kris you've called out, you've done a very nice job on the OpEx control over the past couple of quarters you highlighted, but you've called out inventory being high for a couple of quarters in a row. Can you just talk about in hindsight what the issue has been and what you are doing to rectify it?
Kris Sennesael: On the OpEx?
Paul Nahi: Inventory.
Jeffrey Osborne: No I was saying you've done a nice job on OpEx, but you've also for the past three quarters highlighted inventory being a bit higher than normal and unfortunately it is still moving in the wrong direction. So can you just talk about in hindsight what actually transpired and then what are you doing about it to accelerate the coexists? Are these just new customers that don't pay their bills or it the people in financial distress. I'm just trying to understand what the actual variables at play are?
Kris Sennesael: So if we talk about receivables of course as the business goes up receivables will go up as well. we don’t see any major issues in terms of collectability or anything like that. So that's receivable as the business goes up the goals of the business goals up receivables will go up as well we don't see any major issues in terms of collectability or anything like that. So that's on the receivables side and as I said as business will go up receivables will go up. On the inventory side, we definitely saw some softness in the second quarter of 2015, but we also adopted this more aggressive pricing strategy which is resulting now in market share gains. And so we currently have too high of inventory, but we are going to burn that off as the unit growth and the revenue growth now starts in the second quarter and then the second half of 2016.
Jeffrey Osborne: Got it, and the last question I had is just can you explain the 9% delta on the revenue guidance and he megawatt shipment guidance, is there an acceleration of pricing or is there a mix shift to accessories, I mean just what are the dynamics at play as it relates to the guidance?
Kris Sennesael: There is no real shift there in the guidance Q2 versus Q1. Obviously megawatts is always grower faster than revenue as there is ongoing price erosion.
Jeffrey Osborne: Got it, so accessories should be pretty consistent. There is no one-time items like you've called out in the past?
Kris Sennesael: There is always some fluctuations on accessories, and so some quarters are stronger and other quarters are a little bit less, but for the second quarter we don’t expect any major shift there.
Jeffrey Osborne: Thank you very much. I appreciate it.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Edwin Mok with Needham & Company. Your line is open.
Edwin Mok: Hi thanks for taking my questions. So follow up to Jeff’s question, last question, so I noticed your gross margin is also guiding top flattish sequentially, so does it imply that you are expected to drive your cost down by manipulating [ph] my math tells me down 7% sequentially for you to hit the mid-point of gross margin and I thought that all your cost reductions comes through new versions, so what helps you to drive that cost down?
Kris Sennesael: Yes, so your math is somewhat in the ballpark there right, so we definitely have been able to drive down our cost per watt in the mid teens on a year-over-year basis and sometimes you see some acceleration when you look at one quarter versus another quarter. So we definitely continue to see some major improvements in driving down our product cost. Keep in mind that the vast majority of the products that we ship right now is our fourth generation and we have done in driving down the cost on that fourth generation. We continue to drive down and execute on product cost reduction on the fourth generation as well as the introduction of the fifth generation in the fourth quarter where we continue to drive down the cost and then later on the sixth generation which will become available late 2016 and then eventually the next generation in 2017 as well.
Paul Nahi: To underscore Kris’s point that what he just described has been sort of the process of cost reduction for us from day one where with the introduction of a next generation product we will often times see a step function decrease in price, but then throughout the life of that product we will continuously refine it and pull costs out and that is exactly what we are seeing right now with the fourth generation product.
Edwin Mok: Okay, great that is helpful Paul. Paul, in your prepared remarks you talked about gaining share and I think you call out international is an area that is of strength, can you guys give us roughly where, how much of revenues come from international right now and amounted to various markets you are selling to which market are you seeing the strongest strength or share gain you seeing?
Paul Nahi: So our share in the international has remained relatively stable around 15%, but that is in large part because we are seeing good growth in the U.S. market. But if we look at individual markets like Australia, we saw we doubled our market share from 2014 to 2015 and we expect to see something very dramatic this year in terms of share gain as well. In France I think we are likely the number one residential inverter with market share in the low 30s, so those are very strong markets for us, we are seeing very good growth in the Netherlands right now as well. So in terms of the European markets I think France, Netherlands and then we’re looking at some other countries. We have seen strong growth in Latin America as well. Mexico is doing very well for Enphase as well as the Caribbeans. I think in Puerto Rico we’re again the number one residential inverter down there and we are seeing good share growth in both of those geographies as well as other Latin American countries like Panama and Central America and others. And if you look at different growth areas for us in the Asia-Pacific region, we’re looking north to some of the island nations as well as potentially Southeast Asia. I mentioned that we’re moving sort of looking at different European countries and different Latin American countries. So I would say good, well balanced growth in all the major geographies.
Edwin Mok: Okay, great. That is helpful. Any updates on the commercial product you have?
Paul Nahi: So we continue to see good success with our commercial product. In fact, you may have heard about the NRG win with Whole Foods that is a very significant commercial design win that NRG Renew will be using Enphase for, it is something we are very excited about both our partnerships with NRG as well as the Whole Foods agreement. I think it is certainly exemplary of the type of projects that we are winning on the commercial side. Now that is in the U.S. We are also winning multiple commercial deals in international countries as well, so again a sort of a well balanced approach to resi versus commercial.
Edwin Mok: Okay, great. Last question I have on the AC Battery, I think you guys talking about launching product summer of this year in Australia and potentially other markets sometime next year. Is there any way you – have you guys done some estimates in terms of sizing the opportunity for how much you expect, how much food you expect initially in the second half of 2016 or anywhere you can size opportunity any color would be helpful? Thank you.
Paul Nahi: So it’s a difficult question to answer because the market is very nascent. Now clearly storage is going to be an instrumental part of this total energy solution. You are not going to be able to see the penetration in solar as we expect without commensurate increase in storage. The storage product is part of the larger home energy solutions for us which includes the generation to solar cells, the storage, load control and energy management system that manages that system for the consumer. For obvious reasons I can’t give any forward-looking numbers on specific battery sales. What we can say is this, that we’re getting an increasing amount of demand from our installer and distributor customers to start taking free orders because the demand is certainly increasing. The demand is increasing I think for two reasons, one is that the overall demand for storage is increasing and two, now that we have some competitive products that are out there in trials the clear differentiation between Enphase system in terms of our simplicity, modularity, ease of installation, ease of use is more pronounced than ever which is driving up demand. So while I expect to see significant demand this year in the second half in the Australian region, we do expect that the storage revenue and the revenue from Home Energy Solutions to be meaningful in 2017.
Edwin Mok: What kind of margins that you expect to generate from the storage products once it is ramped up, is it similar to corporate average or above or below?
Paul Nahi: We expect initially to be at around corporate average.
Edwin Mok: Okay, great. That is all I have. Thank you.
Paul Nahi: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Morosi with Avondale Partners. Your line is open.
Michael Morosi: Hi guys, thanks for taking my questions. Are you seeing any changes in the competitive dynamics coming from the lower end of the market, I’m thinking specifically of Chinese competitors?
Paul Nahi: We are definitely seeing the competitive dynamics changing. What I would say though is that in the residential segment, we are not seeing as much in the way of offshore products. I think we are seeing that more in the commercial segment, but in the residential segment while there is plenty of pricing pressure it is coming from either domestic or European products.
Michael Morosi: And then to the extent that you’re beginning to ship the AC Battery solution in the second half of the year and that should help with margin absorption, how likely is it do you think that Q1, Q2 will represent your gross margins bottom for the sale?
Paul Nahi: As we talked about I’m not ready to provide longer term guidance on gross margin. What I would repeat is that we are gaining more and more confidence in our cost reduction roadmap. As I mentioned the product for this year is already in test, so we have a very good view on that. There is a lot of great work that has been done on the cost reduction activities that we will see in 2017 which is providing yet again more confidence in our ability to meet the 2017 targets. Both of these targets by the way as we noted before are very aggressive. So meeting these targets is very exciting and it gives us the ability to use pricing as necessary to maintain and grow our share in the markets that we’re in. So it’s hard to predict exactly where pricing is going to land. But for us with the success that we’re having on the cost production and the success we’re seeing in gaining market share as a result of more aggressive pricing, we’re confident that we’re going to be able to continue to gain share, while we over time increased gross margin.
Michael Morosi: Thanks and then finally do you have any exposure to SunEdison?
Kris Sennesael : Right, so SunEdison is less than 2% customer of which the majority of that is actually outside of the U.S. mainly in Australia which is not part of the Sun Edison bankruptcy. So our exposure is limited. We did take some reserves and we will if we are appropriately reserved for any remainder exposure that we have on SunEdison.
Michael Morosi: Thanks guys.
Kris Sennesael : Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Vishal Shah with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
Unidenified Analyst: Okay. Thanks for taking my questions, this is [Rakesh] on behalf of Vishal. Just wanted to check on the Chinese string and order size, do you see these companies offering remote disconnect options and if so how does this impact the market share of microinverter and optimizer companies?
Paul Nahi: So it is very clear the remote shut off is a necessity right now in the Northeast and it will very soon be a necessity across the continental U.S. It is a safety feature, it's the right answer for solar. For string inverters, the vast majority of them do not currently support that remote shut off and that has kept them out of the market for the most part. There are various potential solutions to that that we are - that we've seen and heard of. All of them are really quite expensive. They are rather clunky. They require additional hardware on the roof which is something that string inverters are not used to. So I think that they are going to have to respond if they want to play in the U.S. market. However, it is something that is very foreign to them. Their current architectures or current systems were never built to support that. So I think we're going to see sort of a clunky perhaps a bit of some clue solutions to it. It is certainly going to increase pricing. It's going to increase the labor cost. It's going to force them to increase their reliability because now they have units on the roof that need to last the duration of the warranty. I think it's going to be interesting to see how this plays out, but clearly with products like end Enphase that are correct by construction, not only do we comply to all the other current regulations, but we comply with regulations that will be in place all the way through 2019 because of the architecture of the microinventor, that it is correct by design. So for us it's just natural evolution of where the market is going.
Unidenified Analyst: All right, thank you. Would it be possible to quantify the cash flow you expect to see in the next few quarters just a ballpark figure?
Kris Sennesael: We don't provide guidance from a cash flow point of view, but as I stated before combination of improving top and bottom lines working on the working capital side and reducing inventory will result in further reduction of the cash burn.
Unidenified Analyst: All right. That’s helpful. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from line of Colin Rusch with Oppenheimer. Your line is open.
Colin Rusch: Thanks so much guys. Can you to talk a little bit about how you're totaling pricing and margin as we go forward, obviously you're talking about cost reduction, but if you for some reason are going to pass all that cost reduction down and maintain gross margins, we have to see revenue nearly double a little bit more to get your breakeven level even on a non-GAAP basis. So as you guys go through the balance of the year can you talk about how that decision making process is happening and kind of what the response time is versus market signals to when you can respond?
Paul Nahi: Sure. So the strategy hasn't really changed. That we are focused on top line growth, market share growth, while moving as aggressively as we can tend towards profitable growth which means that we need to moderate our pricing to ensure that we are competitive that we can pull market share away from competitors, again both domestically and internationally. And because of the confidence we have in our cost reduction efforts we – it is a tool in our tool box and we'll use it as necessary. It's impossible to know how aggressive that pricing will need to be. I think we are very well positioned to address whatever comes up. We as I mentioned before we've already seen some very, very aggressive counter moves by many of our competitors. The good news is that it hasn't been successful and we've been able to with our new pricing continue to grow and take market share. But the goal right now is profitable growth which means top line growth, market share growth and heading towards profitability. So, that strategy, which we outlined back late last year has not changed.
Colin Rusch: Okay then on the far side are you seen any of your suppliers get nervous about it did the cash burn or look for letters of credit or anything like that changing with the suppliers?
Kris Sennesael: Not in a particular way. I mean we definitely need to address that and I've talked about it already today. I think we have the right plan in place and we feel that the cash we have as well as access to cash we have as well as all the other stuff that we're working on are sufficient and that is not the major issue for our suppliers.
Colin Rusch: Ok great, thanks a lot guys.
Kris Sennesael: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes the line of Krish Sankar with Bank of America-Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.
Krish Sankar: Yes, hi thanks for taking my question. I had couple of them. Paul I'm just kind of curious if look at your pricing I mean obvious it is done like 15% last year delivered $0.45 cents a lot. I mean is this a race to the bottom at what point you say that you know we can cut our price anymore or is there any kind of bogie for that with maybe it gets like $0.10 or $0.15 of what or lower than that where you say below than that sale like doesn't make sense.
A – Paul Nahi : So is the pricing extremely competitive right now? You bet. And I think we're going to see a very competitive environment throughout rest of this year. However, we have to recognize that the $0.45 of what that you noted is really not representative of our actual price and is that includes or could include many of the peripherals, the envoy [ph] the AC combiner box, cable and whatever else. The actual inverter price is actually considerably less than that. It is very much our belief that as we approach the cost/pricing of string inverters and now I am talking about low cost string inverters that the decision becomes very, very simple for our customers that for pricing that it at or nearly at string inverter pricing they can have a quality the reliability of an Enphase system, the extra production that Enphase provide the simplicity of design installation, the simplicity of working capital management for our customers they get all of that with the Enphase support for a normal increase. So while we see and have seen a sort of a rather precipitous drop in ASPs we do think that it definitely does start to ask them to start to flatten out as we get as we get lower on price. At that point the full benefit of the Enphase system can be realized for a very, very marginal premium. And more importantly, I think we're moving into an era where it's not about the inverter it's going to be about the energy system, and the Enphase system is not only going to be the highest quality the most sophisticated system out there, but it will also be one of the most competitively priced.
Krish Sankar: Got it. All right. So how big is the gap today between you guys and string inverter guys in terms of absolute pricing?
Paul Nahi: It's a really hard question to answer. The range is very, very broad. And remember that with remote shut off now all of a sudden the string inverters have to add a lot of complexity more products they have to significantly change their design in order to simply comply with the regulations that are occurring. So again it is varied, it's hard for me to give you a specific answer, but as we've said before we believe we've got to cost parity or maybe slightly below cost of optimizers by the end of this year by the second half of this year and then significantly below that and approaching for at low cost string inverters by the end of 2017.
Krish Sankar: Got it, got it. All right that's all I had, thank you very much.
Paul Nahi: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Pavel Molchanov with Raymond James. Your line in open.
Pavel Molchanov: Sorry to mention other troubled companies, but following up on the SunEdison question, talking about Vivint, this was 12% of your revenue last year. Obviously there's quite a bit of turbulence at that company can you give an update on where the business relationship currently stands?
Paul Nahi: I probably would take issue with the comment other troubled companies. What I would say is that the market is undergoing a great deal of volatility right now. That shouldn't be terribly surprising given that the solar market is really a very disruptive force on a long term energy market and in the process businesses and business models need to be adjusted to accommodate what is a growing and evolving market. We have an outstanding relationship with Vivint. We think very highly of the company and were have a great deal of confidence that they're going to be able to continue to see success. We also have a great deal of this fact for all the other companies out there. We recognize that the environment right now is challenging. Whether it's pricing or whether it's a customer acquisition cost, there's just a lot of change going on, but the dynamics of this market simply gets better. We can't forget that there's an underlying foundation to solar, the solar market and that people are buying solar today because it is less expensive than utility energy and we know that solar prices keep coming down and we know that utility prices are going to continue to rise, though the amount, the number of people that are for whom solar will become a more interesting product will continue to increase. What we need to do is make sure that we build our businesses around that evolving market which means getting our cost down, keeping our OpEx low, so we can compete very competitively with existing forms of energy which is coal and gas, but that is occurring. That is occurring worldwide and we see a very, very strong evolving market. But in the meantime it is going to be a little bit volatile and I think that's what we are experiencing right now.
Pavel Molchanov: And along those lines, can you share what percentage of your Q1 sales came from Vivint?
Paul Nahi: Yes, it is less than 10% consistent with what it was last quarter.
Pavel Molchanov: Okay, I appreciate it guys.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] This concludes today's Q&A session. I would now like to turn the call back over to Paul Nahi for any closing remarks.
Paul Nahi: Thank you all for joining us on our call today. We look forward to speaking with you again next quarter.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program and you may all disconnect. Everyone have a great day.

Now, I’d like to introduce Paul Nahi, President and Chief Executive Officer of Enphase Energy. Paul?
Paul Nahi: Good afternoon. Thanks for joining us today to discuss our fourth quarter and year-end 2015 financial results. We reported revenue of $65.6 million for the fourth quarter of 2015. As we discussed during last quarter’s earning call, our fourth quarter revenue was impacted by a reduction of inventory in our distribution channel. During the quarter, we significantly lowered channel inventory and ended the fourth quarter with normalized inventory levels. We reached another impressive milestone for Enphase Energy during the fourth quarter, we shipped our 10 millionth microinverter. Total Enphase systems represent more than 2.5 gigawatts of installed generating capacity, and it produced approximately 5 terawatts of clean energy. There are currently over 430,000 Enphase systems deployed in more than 100 countries. We are very proud of these accomplishments as we move into our 10th year as a company. During the fourth quarter of 2015, we started shipping our S family of products, the fifth generation S-Series Microinverter that comes in two power versions, the S230 and the S280. The fifth generation microinverter is the first-ever bidirectional microinverter that includes the most demanding advanced grid functions, as well as improved power conversion efficiency. We also started shipping our new Envoy-S gateway with some exciting new features, such as consumption monitoring, revenue grade metering and cellular connectivity. In addition, we started shipping our AC Combiner Box, which is the most effective way to maximize the features and benefits of the Envoy-S, decrease installation labor time and reduce the cost of the system. Our Installer Toolkit mobile app for smartphones and tablets makes it yet again simpler and easier to install and commission an Enphase system. 2015 was an exciting year for Enphase, although the second-half proved challenging as pricing pressure in our U.S. and international business increased, affecting our year-over-year revenue growth. However, during the year we continued to drive technology and took big steps forward in our evolution from a microinverter systems company to an energy technology company. We announced new partnerships with LG Electronics and SolarWorld during 2015 to develop a new generation of integrated AC solar modules for the worldwide market. There is a significant increase in demand from large solar distributors, installers and fleet owners for a reliable, cost effective and high performance AC module to reduce product and installation costs, while streamlining the supply chain. Of course, all our new product and features are supported by Enphase’s world-class customer support and O&M services team. We also continue to leverage our cloud-based energy management system, Enlighten, and partnered with utilities such as Hawaiian Electric, helped strengthen and enhance grid quality while also illustrating the broader smart grid capabilities that Enphase can provide. On the execution front, we’re making great progress on our cost reduction roadmap and the development of our complete Home Energy Solution. As previously discussed, we’ve adopted a more aggressive pricing strategy and are seeing its effectiveness with multiple new customer wins and an increase in share with existing customers. Our next generation microinverter with lower cost, higher performance and new advanced features is on track for release by the end of the year. In addition, our storage solution is in trial and development is proceeding very well. The simplicity, ease of installation, modularity and performance of our AC Battery is unique in the industry. In fact, we’ve demonstrated that 5 kilowatt hour of our AC Battery storage solution can be installed by one person in less than two hours. We believe this is the fastest install time in the entire industry. The combination of more aggressive pricing and the introduction of our total energy solution give us great confidence in our ability to grow market share worldwide. We continue to roll out new components of our Home Energy Solution and are looking forward to launching the AC Battery storage system this summer in the Australian market followed by other regions as we see huge interests in complete energy solutions in many countries worldwide. We’re passionate about developing new technologies that make energy more intelligent, more connected and more cost-effective than ever before. I would like to thank our entire Enphase team for the ongoing hard work, passion and dedication as we work together on bold initiatives that will change the face of energy production, storage and management. I’ll close my comment by noting 2016 is off to a good start. We’re encouraged by the positive industry outlook and are excited about the many opportunities ahead. The total available market in the U.S. residential segment will continue to grow in 2016 and beyond, supported by the five-year extension of the federal investment tax credit as well as some favorable net metering rulings, including the recent favorable decision by the California Public Utilities Commission. Now, I’ll turn it over to Kris for his review of our financial results.
Kris Sennesael: Thank you, Paul. I will provide some more details related to our fourth quarter and full year 2015 financial results. And then, I will provide the business outlook for the first quarter of 2016. As a reminder, the financial measures that I’m going to provide are on a non-GAAP basis unless otherwise noted. Total revenue for the fourth quarter of 2015 was $65.6 million, in line with the business outlook we provided last quarter. Revenue during the fourth quarter of 2015 was impacted by the reduction of inventory levels in the distribution channel which have now returned to normalized levels. We shipped 129 megawatts AC or approximately 152 megawatts DC during the fourth quarter of 2015. The megawatts shipped represented 547,000 microinverters of which 90% were our fourth generation microinverter systems. During the fourth quarter, we began shipping our fifth generation microinverters, the S230 and the S280, which ramped up nicely and accounted for 10% of all our inverter shipments during the fourth quarter. Gross margins for the fourth quarter of 2015 was 24.5%, also in line with the business outlook that we provided. Revenue per AC watt for the fourth quarter was $0.51, down 13% year over year, but up 9% sequentially from the third quarter. The sequential increase in revenue per watt was driven by a larger part of revenue related to our accessory products, such as the cabling system, the Envoy gateway as well as the new AC Combiner Box. This new combiner box includes our new Envoy with revenue grade metering, other electrical components and a cellular connection. This also drove a sequential increase in cost of goods sold per watt. Operating expenses during the fourth quarter of 2015 were $27.8 million. As previously discussed in our last earnings call, we took some restructuring actions during the fourth quarter and brought down the operating expense level well below $30 million per quarter. We made sure that we maintain the necessary resources to execute on our product cost reduction roadmap as well as our energy solution strategy. During the fourth quarter of 2015, R&D expenses were $11.2 million, sales and marketing expenses were $10.2 million and G&A expenses were $6.4 million. Total non-GAAP operating expenses excluded $3.1 million, of which $2.8 million were stock-based compensation expenses. We reported non-GAAP operating loss of $11.7 million and a net loss of $11.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2015, resulting in a loss of $0.25 per share. On a GAAP basis, net loss for the fourth quarter of 2015 was $15.8 million or a net loss of $0.35 per share. Turning to the balance sheet, we exited the fourth quarter of 2015 with a total cash balance of $28.5 million. At the end of the year, we had a $17 million draw on our credit facility, which was renewed and extended until November 2019 on more favorable economic terms. Cash flow from operations in the fourth quarter was $8.1 million, mainly driven by a significant reduction in accounts receivable and despite a further increase of our internal inventory levels. We exited the year with $40.8 million in inventory. We will continue to take action to drive down days of inventory outstanding during 2016. During the fourth quarter, capital expenditures were $2.8 million, and depreciation and amortization was $2.8 million. Now, let’s discuss some of our full year 2015 highlights. Revenue grew 4% year over year to a record level of $357.2 million. Excluding one of our largest customer, revenue increased 20% year over year. International revenue was 16% of total revenue and was up 14% year over year, driven by strong growth in Australia. We shipped a record 706 megawatts AC or approximately 830 megawatts DC, a 23% year over year increase. Units sold in 2015 increased to 3.1 million. Again excluding one of our largest customers, megawatts shipped increased 37% year over year. Gross margin for the year was 30.6% with revenue per watt down 15% year over year and cost of goods sold per watt down 12% year over year. Operating expenses were $115.7 million in 2015. Non-GAAP operating loss for 2015 was $6.3 million and non-GAAP net loss was $8.1 million or a net loss of $0.18 per share. GAAP net loss was $22.1 million or $0.49 per share. In summary, 2015 was a challenging year for Enphase, but we continue to grow our revenue in megawatt shipped on a year over year basis, further driving the global adoption of the Enphase microinverter technology in our key markets, while continuing to drive technology innovation towards a complete energy solution. Now, let’s discuss our outlook for the first quarter of 2016. We expect revenue for the first quarter of 2016 to be within a range of $63 million to $69 million. We expect gross margin to be within a range of 18% to 21%. The lower gross margin reflects our more aggressive pricing strategy. We also expect non-GAAP operating expenses for the first quarter of 2016 to be within a range of $27 million to $29 million. Finally, before turning the call over for questions, I want to point out that on February 12, the universal shelf that was filed with the Security and Exchange Commission was declared effective. We do not have any immediate plans to use the shelf. It’s just a tool in a CFO toolbox and we believe it is good corporate housekeeping to have an effective shelf on hand. Our current cash balance as well as the cash available through our working capital facility is sufficient to fund to grow of our business. And now, I will open the line for questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Edwin Mok of Needham & Company. Your line is open.
Edwin Mok: Hey, guys, thanks for taking my question. First question I have is for your 1Q outlook. I guess two quick questions. First is, did you have any kind of a year-end jump in UK sales in the fourth quarter? And that - should we expect some kind of digestion in UK, and that is factored in your first quarter guidance? And also, on the first quarter guidance I assume you factor in some price decline. So as I look at midpoint being flat, it should be implied that you expect warranty increase. Are those two correct?
Paul Nahi: So, Edwin, there was not much of a year in jump in UK for us. As you correctly note, the UK market has been severely affected by a reduction, almost elimination of the feed-in tariff. We’ve seen a slow decrease once that announcement was made throughout the end of the year in 2015, so nothing dramatic there. And in reference to price declines, yes, we have been aggressively reducing pricing really since Q4 of 2015. So certainly that would be accounted for in the Q1 revenue.
Edwin Mok: Okay, great, great. That’s helpful. And then maybe talk beyond first quarter, just on the Gen 5 kind of a target or how do you think about Gen 5? So you mentioned on a call that 10% of your sales were your fifth generation microinverter. Any kind of - how do you kind of think about a crossover from fourth generation to fifth generation? How much time do you think we take before a market adopt more fifth and fourth generation? And then, I think previously you guys laid out some cost reductions roadmap for fifth generation. Any update to those roadmaps?
Paul Nahi: So in reference to the last question, the cost reduction initiatives are going extremely well. The product that we will be introducing the end of this year is already in alpha testing, is up and running in the lab. We are filling very, very confident in our ability to achieve the cost reduction target, while increasing reliability, while increasing performance with that product, so increased confidence there. And increased confidence in the work we are doing for the product that will come out in 2017 as well. So the guidance we gave about 25% this year and 25% next year is well on track. In reference to the transition from the one generation to the next, it’s a very smooth long-term transition. A lot of it is dependent on the availability of higher power modules, which is something that we really can’t predict. We don’t expect any dramatic shift at one time or the other, but just a soft transition over the next number of quarters.
Edwin Mok: Okay, great. Last question I have and I’ll let other guys ask. On the storage, you mentioned you are in trials right now already and had planned for mid-year launch. Is that mostly focused on Australia right now, regarding the trials and the plan for initial launch? Or have you started to work in auto markets as well? Any update there?
Paul Nahi: So the demand for storage is coming from pretty much every geography we’re in, whether it’s Latin America, obviously America, Europe, as well as Asia-Pacific region. We have been in very clear that we are launching initially in Australia. So by the end of this year, I expect to have products both in Europe and in the U.S. as well. So for us, it’s a matter of just managing the engineering resources we have to get the product certified and available in the new geographies. The fundamental architecture is the same. The fundamental product is the same, just a minor of modifications and certifications necessary for the different regions. I will take this time to point out the fact and reiterate the fact that, to our knowledge the ability to install 5 kilowatt hours of storage, not just battery, but the entire storage system by one person in under two hours is simply unprecedented. And installers and customers worldwide are clamoring for this product right now, in part because of its modularity and simplicity.
Edwin Mok: Great. That was very clear. Sorry, I missed one part of the Gen 5. I was wondering with the Gen 5 got now launched, right, does it allows you to target more European markets that historically might not - you might not have the grid connection feature that you can target?
Paul Nahi: So the answer is that our next generation product absolutely does provide some of the feature that allows us to move into more and more European countries. However, the decision to move and the decision on timing to move into new countries is not just dependent on the technical applicability, but also the application of our human resources. So we are planning to move into new geographies this year. Certainly, the new products that we are introducing will help accelerate that. But we are going to look at doing it in a way that keeps our OpEx under a very manageable level.
Edwin Mok: Great. That’s all I have. Thank you.
Paul Nahi: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Michael Morosi of Avondale Partners. Your line is open.
Michael Morosi: Hi, guys, thanks for taking the question. I guess, first of all, flat quarter over quarter in 1Q is a good result, if you look at typical seasonality of down 15% to 20%. How should we think about seasonality going forward? Is this kind of a new base of which the business might conform to more typical seasonal patterns?
Kris Sennesael: Yes, Michael. First of all, Q4 and Q1 this year are somewhat abnormal, because in Q4 we went through this inventory correction in the distribution channel. But thinking about seasonality, yes, Q1 is our softest seasonal quarter and so we do expect the business to grow sequentially in the second and third quarter. And then, the fourth quarter is kind of flat to slightly up. So we do expect the same seasonality going forward.
Michael Morosi: Okay. And then, looking at the competitive landscape and maybe even from your customer standpoint, one angle of the bear-case was always that Enphase is kind of overexposed to the Tier 2 and Tier 3 customer base. But in a lot of respect, those customers benefited the most from the ITC extension. So what are you seeing in terms of the competitive dynamics among that part of your customer base and how do you see that to evolve going forward?
Paul Nahi: So that’s actually a very good point and I would agree with you that the Tier 2s and the Tier 3s certainly do benefit tremendously from the ITC extension. And in many cases what we’ve seen that the Tier 2s and Tier 3s have, for the most part, very strong business model themselves. They are using - they have access to multiple forms of financing, and we’re seeing whether it’s a cash, whether it’s leases, whether it’s loans. And we’re seeing that segment of market grow in a very healthy manner. So I think we’re certainly - we certainly have a great presence in the Tier 1s with the exception of one customer, Solar City. We are in every other Tier 1 and in many cases growing sharing those Tier 1s. At the same time to your point, the simplicity of an Enphase system, the ease of design, ease of installation has definitely attracted a lot of the Tier 2s and Tier 3s. And we’re seeing their businesses being very, very healthy right now and growing considerably.
Michael Morosi: Okay. Thank you. And then, thanks for calling out the international sales. What was C&I as a percent of overall shipments? And how do you expect this number to evolve overtime as you roll out the next gen products?
Paul Nahi: So C&I right now is give or take 15% of our total number. We see that to stay relatively stable over time. We’re doing very well in the commercial market. We are - we are getting some new design wins all the time. We have some things happening in Latin America that are very, very exciting in that avenue as well. At the same time, we are very focused on the development of a residential energy system, which includes storage and load control and energy management. We see that as a huge potential that leverages a lot of our capabilities, a lot of our strengths. So while we continue to exploit the commercial channel, we’re going to focus most of our R&D dollars right now on the residential energy system.
Michael Morosi: Okay. And one more if I may and this is a little bit of a higher level question. But I found the beginning of the monetization of the utility data stream as being a pretty significant milestone for Enphase. So how do you see that evolving going forward in terms of your materiality, when could we expect that to start to move the needle in terms of actual revenue recognition? And then, does this at all open up what some in the industry, Greentech Media, have referred to as inverter as a resource?
Paul Nahi: Right. It’s a great question. We have long been a proponent of leveraging the solar systems out there as grid assets and leveraging that for both increased visibility on the grid as well as more and more control and stability. To your point, our relationship with One Electric [ph] has proven to be very beneficial I think to both parties. And it did represent the first time we’ve been able to monetize those features. We just recently presented at DistribuTech and the result there was probably just short of overwhelming. We are now engaged with multiple utilities all across the U.S. in many different ways, whether it’s to help in terms of grid stabilization, whether it’s to work with them on the rollout of solar programs in their regions. The solar systems there will also act as resources for the grid, to help stabilize the grid. So there is a tremendous amount of work going on within groups inside of Enphase to accelerate that. The only challenge there is that utilities by definition tend to move a little bit slower. So I think that in terms of materiality we are looking at probably 2017. But there is a tremendous amount of work going on today and there is work - we were going to be in trials with multiple utilities across the U.S. both for storage as well as solar as assets and as controllable assets on the grid this year.
Michael Morosi: Great. Thanks a lot for taking the questions.
Paul Nahi: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Jeffrey Osborne of Cowen and Company. Your line is open.
Jeffrey Osborne: Hey, great. Good afternoon. I have a couple of follow-up questions. I was wondering if you can just touch on the ASP in the fourth quarter. Do you happen to have, Kris, what that was excluding the accessory benefit that you talked about? Just trying to get an apples-to-apples perspective.
Kris Sennesael: Yes. So historically ASP per watt has come down on or above 10% year over year. But in the second-half of 2015 we’ve adopted a more aggressive pricing strategy. And so currently, let’s say, second-half of 2015, you are looking more at mid to high teens in terms of ASP reduction on a price per watt basis.
Jeffrey Osborne: I assume that declines are more acute in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter, just given the pace of being aggressive.
Kris Sennesael: Yes, slightly more in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter.
Jeffrey Osborne: Got you. And then, just with the guidance on gross margins for Q1, obviously I assume that the margin profile of accessories is better than the kind of 20% that’s you’re guiding for. But is that kind of flow through of the next gen Envoy and other racking equipment? Is that largely played out and so you’ll revert back to a normal mix with that piece of the business? And then, a follow-up to that, are you kind of stepping on the gas one extra degree here in the first quarter, just given the gross margin guidance?
Kris Sennesael: So let me answer maybe the first part of the question on accessories. So quarter to quarter we see some fluctuations there. In some quarters it has been as low as 20% and other quarters it has been as high as 35% of total revenue, but it tends to fluctuate a little bit. It’s obvious that Q3 of 2015 was on the low-end of that range, Q4 was on the high-end of that range. Looking forward, we do believe it will be more at the high-end of that range, because we have added a lot of additional features and functionality to our accessory product offering. We have now an Envoy including a revenue grade meter. We have the AC Combiner Box. We offer a cellular connection and so on and so on. And so that definitely helps to increase the revenue from the accessory part.
Paul Nahi: And in reference to the last part of your question, yes, we are being very aggressive on price for all the reasons we’ve said. That coupled with the total revenue number, the total unit number, which would mean a slightly higher fixed cost absorption may account for some of that. But we are being very aggressive on pricing.
Jeffrey Osborne: Got it. So sequentially further downtick versus the aggressive stance you had in the fourth quarter then is what I’m reading between the lines there, Paul?
Paul Nahi: Yes.
Jeffrey Osborne: Okay. And then, how do we think about the inventory in the channel and just your kind of reach into that knowledge base? Are you - you factored that into Q4 guidance. Is inventory still an issue at any of your customers or has all that played through and you have high confidence in that for Q1 and looking forward?
Paul Nahi: No, all that’s played through. We are looking at - we ended Q4 with a very normal inventory level, and we fully expect to end Q1 with very normal inventory level. So that shouldn’t affect our numbers.
Jeffrey Osborne: And as both at the end customers as well as on your own books, which as well high this quarter, is that right, Kris?
Kris Sennesael: Well, of course, we recognized revenue on a sell-in basis and so inventory in the distribution channel is important for my revenue level. The inventory on our own books doesn’t have any impact on revenue level. As stated before there, we ended Q4 with $40.8 million of inventory, which is still a little bit on the high-end. But as I explained before, Q1 is a seasonally softer quarter. We do expect some substantial revenue growth in the second quarter and the third quarter. And that will help us to improve our inventory returns or reduce the inventory days outstanding.
Jeffrey Osborne: Got it. My last question I had is just - I understand for full year you can’t give revenue and margin comments for obvious reasons. But OpEx is something you can control to a much better degree. Is the plan still to stay flat kind of in this $27 million to $29 million level or $30 million range over the course of calendar 2016 on a quarterly basis?
Kris Sennesael: That is correct, that is correct. So we did some restructuring in the fourth quarter, brought it down below the $30 million per quarter. While at the same time, of course, making sure that we have the adequate resources to go and execute on our two main focus items: the first one, execution on our product cost reduction roadmap; the second one, delivering on our energy solution strategy. And we believe we have those resources, and will enable us to go and execute on those two key focus items while keeping the operating expenses below the $30 million per quarter.
Jeffrey Osborne: Got it. Thanks so much. I appreciate it.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Colin Rusch of Oppenheimer. Your line is open.
Noah Kaye: Hi, gentleman. This is Noah Kaye on for Colin. Thanks so much for taking the question. Maybe if we could just start with the energy storage side. Thinking about the battery technology and battery itself specifically, what are you seeing now on pricing? What kind of a room is that potentially giving you? You’re looking at a downward trend pricing, both in terms of addressable market and margin. Thanks.
Paul Nahi: So I think I understand your question. Right now, when you look at the storage system, really by far the most expensive component in that is the chemistry itself. And the chemistry itself is still expensive, in part because the market that we’re talking about fixed storage is still brand new. We are in the very, very early days, really in the infancy of this industry. So I think there is a tremendous amount of headroom for the cost of the chemistry to come down in the coming years. And if I understand your question correctly, I think the supposition you’re making is exactly correct, that there is going to be significant elasticity in this market. And as that pricing comes down and I think it can down in terms of hundreds of dollars per kilowatt hour. It is going to open up new markets and it is going to make storage more viable for a larger part of the population. Having said that, we are also working on cost reduction in the storage arena both on the inverter side obviously, as well as well on the mechanical design as well. It is worth at this point I think pointing out that, and I’ve said it once before so forgive me for repeating myself, but for one person to be able to install 5 kilowatt hours of storage in under two hours is in it of itself a tremendous cost saving for installers. So the combination of the architecture that we have that allows for that modularity and simplicity coupled with the headroom we have on the chemistry pricing coming down, I think will open up the markets very dramatically in 2017 and 2018 and beyond.
Noah Kaye: Right. And just as a follow up there, I mean, to be specific about kind of the range of chemistry sell pricing that you’re seeing right now, I should think about that integrating into your solution.
Paul Nahi: So we really can’t speak to the specific cost of the chemistry as a component of our system. But what I can say is that the cost will be coming down in the range of hundreds of dollars per kilowatt hour in the coming years. So it is a little bit expensive right now, but still creates a cost-effective solution and will be getting more cost-effective over time.
Noah Kaye: Sure, sure. Could we briefly just touch on the subject of warranty and maybe any potential customer concerns that you’re hearing about warranty rates? Maybe just speak to where failure rates are trending potentially alleviating those concerns?
Paul Nahi: So we’re not seeing anything about warranty issues with our customers. Our RMA rates right now are the lowest they’ve ever been in the history of Enphase. And I would venture to say that we are most probably the most reliable product in the market, period. So I think if you talk to our customers, and these are our customers worldwide, one of the hallmarks of an Enphase system is its quality. We invest a tremendous amount to ensure that every unit that goes out is that represents Enphase in terms of its quality and reliability. And we’re seeing the results of that with the units in the field.
Noah Kaye: Right, right, understood. And finally, you talked about it before, there’s a questioning about the role of the inverter and managing DERs, where also at DistribuTECH spoke that a lot of folks who are doing work on this right now, many utilities doing work on it. I guess, the main question is, recognizing it’s still fairly early, do you have a sense of what the revenue model might actually look like for the services that you’re providing? Do you have any kind of early conversation with anyone about potential contracting, length of contract, kind of how that all get structured, again recognizing it’s very early days?
Paul Nahi: Right, right, right. I am glad you said that, because it is very, very early days. And I think any level of specificity would be premature right now. I can share with you some general discussions that we’ve had, and nothing has been contracted yet. So these are really more discussions about intent and ideas as opposed to an actual business model. But utilities are looking at wanting to control these resources, again for both visibility on the grid, as well as stability on the grid, and whether it’s done through a discount of the system itself to the homeowner, while allowing the utility to control it for some number of hours or some period of time a day, that’s one option that’s being bantered around. And another one is that the system will go - the system will be installed and that the consumer will be paid a certain amount for its usage by the utility, which would be contracted to be no more than a certain number of hours in a period of time, which is more of a sort of a several revenue potential for the consumer. In either of these cases, Enphase’s role would be that of the DER resource controller. So we would be managing the actual resources, taking cues from the utility; and then through our software, through our communications technology making the appropriate provisions to those asset to either deliver VArs, to change a profile, whatever is necessary to help stabilize and enhance the grid.
Noah Kaye: Right. Well, we look forward to seeing those business models evolve. Thanks so much.
Paul Nahi: Sure. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Philip Shen of ROTH Capital Partners. Your line is open.
Philip Shen: Hey, guys. I am jumping between calls here. So apologies if some of this has been addressed. I wanted to get back to ASPs for a moment. What is the rate of ASP decline that you may expect through 2016 and by quarter?
Paul Nahi: So what we have said in the past, Phil, is that we are anticipating at 25% costs reduction. We haven’t really telegraphed anything about pricing yet. That depends on a lot of other factors, everything from competition through geography and many others. So I am not comfortable right now telegraphing that. What I will say is that we are putting ourselves in a position to be more and more aggressive on pricing to take further and further market share. And we plan to do this not just in 2016, but in 2017 as well.
Philip Shen: Great, okay. And then, in terms of international markets, I know - it sounds like it was 15% in the quarter. Can you talk about what kind of mix you see between domestic and international in 2016? And then, also talk about the mix of commercial as we go through 2016?
Kris Sennesael: Yes. So, Phil, so U.S., non-U.S. is roughly 85-15. I think in the quarter, we were getting to 16% by now international business. We definitely expect to grow our U.S. business. There is a lot of timed growth and we feel good about our ability to go and gain market share in that U.S. residential market. But at the same time as well there is plenty of opportunity for us to continue to grow our share in the international markets. As you know, we are doing pretty well in Mexico and some other Latin American countries. In Europe, we are doing very well in France. We are probably the number one player there with 25%, 30% market share. We are growing our share in the Netherlands. There is a little bit of a setback in the UK, because of the feed-in tariff reduction there. And that will hurt all the players in that market. And then, last but not least, of course, our business in Australia and New Zealand and some other Southeast Asian countries there, but especially Australia is growing very well. We are getting into double-digit market share there in a very attractive market. And so, when you put it altogether, I do expect in 2016 our international business to grow faster than our U.S. business. In terms of commercial I think, Paul, already addressed that. But it’s approximately 15% of our revenue. We continue to see some good demand for our dedicated commercial product as well as addressing that commercial segment with our normal microinverter. We see that in the U.S., we also see that in Australia and then some in Latin America and in Europe as well. It is definitely somewhat opportunistic, because we are making a lot of investments in our home energy system, but we do believe that also in commercial we will - that business will grow at or about the same speed as our residential business. And so, we’ll maintain at or about 15% of our business.
Philip Shen: Great. That’s helpful, Kris. A couple of other quick ones here; in the quarter, can you share with us the number of customers that were greater than 10%? And then, insofar as you can address, your targeted installed watts of storage or watt hours in 2016? Thank you very much.
Kris Sennesael: So in Q4 it was only one customer and it’s our largest distributor, of course, which is serving hundreds of installers. So I don’t really look at that as being a customer concentration there. It’s a distributor that is serving multiple installers. And that was the only - that one distributor was the only one customer more than 10%.
Paul Nahi: And in your reference to your last question about storage, we’re not ready yet to give sort of guidance on that. The demand is tremendous. And as I said, the demand is coming from almost every region we’re in right now. But it’s very early days and we are still trying to explore what the real demand actually is. So I think more to come on that.
Philip Shen: Great. Paul and Kris, thank you very much.
Paul Nahi: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Brian Lee of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Hank Elder: Hi, guys. This is Hank Elder from Goldman Sachs on for Brian Lee. Could you guys talk about your U.S. rooftop growth expectations in 2016 versus what they might have been just three or four months ago before the extension? And then, what are your discussions with customers suggest?
Paul Nahi: So you’re asking about our market share, Hank?
Hank Elder: No, just the overall rooftop growth.
Paul Nahi: So we’re very bullish on it. I think what the ITC extension did is it took some of the pressure off of 2016. So perhaps the backend of 2016 won’t be as great as it was. But we’re still anticipating something north of 40% this year, year over year. And what will hopefully be a more stable growth in 2017 and 2018 and beyond. So the mix of customers may very well change, but I think we’re seeing just in general very healthy growth.
Hank Elder: Okay. Thanks. And then on the credit facilities - Fargo, under what scenarios would you guys kind of lean on that facility versus the cash generation, which looks good in this quarter on lower revenue?
Kris Sennesael: No, we’re already tapping into that working capital facility with Wells Fargo. It’s in up to $50 million working capital facility that is committed. We have accordion feature or uncommitted $25 million in addition to that. And we extended the maturity date till November of 2019. That facility is available to us. We are tapping into it. At the end of 2015 we drawdown $17 million out of it, and they end up, so that’s basically what we do with the line there.
Hank Elder: All right. Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Krish Sankar of Bank of America. Your line is open.
Unidentified Analyst: Hi, this is Shiragodev [ph] calling in for Krish. Just had a quick question regarding the megawatt shipments, through 2016, I wanted know what your guidance was for the full year 2016 on shipments and any seasonality you see going forward?
Paul Nahi: So we don’t guide full year megawatt shipments. So you wouldn’t have heard that from us. And in terms of seasonality I think there is nothing necessarily unusual that’s going to happen in 2016 that’s different than years past. The only thing that could have disrupted that was, if the ITC had not been extended. But given this extension, I don’t think we are going to see any abnormal patterns this year.
Unidentified Analyst: I see. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question is from Pavel Molchanov of Raymond James. Your line is open.
Pavel Molchanov: Thanks for taking the question, guys. So you are looking at three straight quarters including Q1 of margin compression, as you are pushing very hard on pricing. Given what you’ve said at the Analyst Day about seeing a long-term margin outlook, 30% to 40%, what’s the kind of implied math to get there if you have to cut costs by 50% and nearly double your margin from where you are correctly?
Paul Nahi: Right. So what we have said, what we’ve reiterated, is that our target gross margin is 35% to 40%. That target is not changed. Clearly in a very aggressive pricing environment, we have to get in front of cost with price, which is adversely affecting our gross margin right now. But having said that, we believe that our cost reduction coupled with the additional features and the benefits of an Enphase system will allow us to see gross margin expansion in a more meaningful way, perhaps sometime in 2017. What we have seen repeatedly is that if Enphase is at or even slightly above competitive offerings, the customer will choose Enphase. And they’ll choose Enphase because we are easier to design, easier to install, more reliable, far easier back-end logistics. We just make the system lot easier. And that simplicity is doing nothing but getting better with the advent of the AC modules. It does nothing but get better with the advent of an AC Battery and the AC Combiner Box. We have effectively reduced all the elements of a system to its most basic, to turn a solar system into a plug and play system. So with that and with our cost reduction, we feel that - we still feel very comfortable in the target gross margin. However, for the next number of quarters we are not focused on gross margin. We are going to continue to focus on market growth, on customer acquisition, and going into new geographies and so it’s really more about top line and market share.
Pavel Molchanov: Okay. Then one more, I think going back to one of the earlier questions about the storage opportunity, you talked about starting to ship, I believe, into the Australian market in Q2 of this year. Is that still the case and are there any other geographies where you may have commercial-scale storage shipments by the end of 2016?
Paul Nahi: By the end of 2016, so, yes, we are on track to ship to Australia, no change there. As we’ve said, beyond Australia we plan to be both in Europe and the Americas, with storage this year in 2016. So I expect to be in multiple countries by the end of the year. Again, the fundamental system doesn’t change, but there is an issue of certification and there are some localization that has to occur for each country and we are just trying to manage our engineering resources to best leverage them and moving to as many countries as possible.
Pavel Molchanov: All right. I appreciate it, guys.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] One moment for questions. At this time, I see no other questions in queue. I’d like to turn it back from Mr. Paul Nahi for any closing remarks.
Paul Nahi: Okay. Thank you very much for joining us on our call today. And we look forward to speaking with you again next quarter.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today’s conference. This concludes your program. You may now disconnect. Everyone have a great day.

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen and welcome to Enphase Energy's Third Quarter 2015 Financial Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, today's program is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's program Christina Carrabino. Please go ahead.
Christina Carrabino: Good afternoon and thank you for joining us on today's conference call to discuss Enphase Energy's third quarter 2015 results. On today's call are Paul Nahi, Enphase Energy's President and Chief Executive Officer and Kris Sennesael, Chief Financial Officer. After the market closed today, Enphase issued a press release announcing the results for its third quarter ended September 30th, 2015. We are providing an accompanying presentation with our earnings call that you can access in the Investors section of our Company's website at www.enphase.com. During the course of this conference call, Enphase management will make forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, statements related to Enphase Energy's financial performance, market demands for its microinverters, advantages of its technology, market trends, future products and future financial performance. These forward-looking statements are based on the Company's current expectations and inherently involve significant risks and uncertainties. Enphase Energy's actual results and the timing of events could differ materially from those anticipated in such forward-looking statements as a result of these risks and uncertainties. Factors that could cause results to be different from these statements include factors the Company describes in its press release of today, especially under the section entitled Forward-Looking Statements, as well as those detailed in the section entitled Risk Factors of the Company's report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014. Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2015 and Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2015, which will be filed with the SEC in the fourth quarter of 2015. Enphase Energy cautions you not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements and undertakes no duty or obligation to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future events or changes in its expectations. Also, please note that certain financial measures used on this call are expressed on a non-GAAP basis and have been adjusted to exclude certain charges. The Company has provided reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures in its earnings release posted today, which also can also be found in the Investor Relations section of its website. Now, I'd like to introduce Kris Sennesael, Chief Financial Officer of Enphase Energy. Kris?
Kris Sennesael: Good afternoon and thanks for joining us today to discuss our third quarter 2015 financial results. I'll start by providing some details related to the third quarter and provide the business outlook for the fourth quarter. As a reminder, the financial measures that I'm going to provide are on a non-GAAP basis unless otherwise noted. After that, Paul will provide an update on the state of the business and we will open up the call for Q&A. Total revenue for the third quarter of 2015 was $102.9 million, an increase of 4% compared to the third quarter of 2014 and an increase of 1% compared to the second quarter of 2015. We shipped 219 megawatt AC for approximately 258 megawatt DC during the third quarter of 2015. An increase of 28% on a year-over-year and an increase of 12% sequentially. The 219 megawatt shipped represented approximately 950,000 microinverters all of which were our fourth generation microinverter system. The Enphase M250 represented approximately 45% of all units shipped up from 35% last quarter, as we see an industry shift towards the adoption of higher power modules. Revenue from Vivint was approximately 8% of total revenue, down 45% compared to the third quarter of 2014. All over revenue excluding Vivint was up 18% compared to the third quarter of 2014. International revenue was 16% of total revenue and was up 26% year-over-year driven by strong growth in Australia and Continental Europe and despite some headwinds in the UK. Pricing pressure during the third quarter further increased as a result of this, and in order to continue growing our business. We have adopted a more aggressive pricing strategy. In the third quarter, average selling price decreased approximately 18% year-over-year on a price per watt basis. Including approximately 2 points due to Forex headwinds. The large year-over-year price reductions were largely offset by product cost reductions of approximately 16% year-over-year on a cost per watt basis. As a result, gross margin for the third quarter of 2015 was 30.9% down 210 basis points compared to the third quarter of 2014. Operating expenses during the third quarter of 2015 were $26.9 million, a reduction of approximately 11% compared to the second quarter of 2015 and much lower compared to the business outlook that we provided last quarter. The decreased was primarily driven by a $4 million decrease in incentive compensation expenses of which, $2.5 million represents a reversal of amounts accrued in the first half of this year. During the third quarter of 2015, R&D expenses were $10.9 million. Sales and marketing expenses were $9.9 million and G&A expenses were $6.1 million. Total non-GAAP operating expenses excluded $3 million in stock-based compensation expenses, $500,000 in severance cost and $700,000 from a favorable revaluation of reacquisition related contingent consideration liability. Non-GAAP operating income for the third quarter of 2015 was $4.9 million compared to non-GAAP operating income of $4.8 million in the third quarter of 2014. For both the third quarters of 2015 and 2014 non-GAAP net income was $3.8 million or $0.08 per diluted share. On a GAAP basis, net income for the third quarter of 2015 was $600,000 or $0.01 per diluted share compared to GAAP net income of $800,000 or $0.02 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2014. Turning to the balance sheet, we existed the third quarter of 2015 with a total cash balance of $22.5 million which included $17 million from our working capital facility. Cash flow from operations was an outflow of $6 million driven primarily by a sequential increase in accounts receivable of $8.3 million as a result of the timing of shipments during the quarter. Cash flow from operations was also impacted by $2.7 million increase in inventory to $36.7 million. Given the business outlook for the fourth quarter, I do expect a significant reduction in the accounts receivable level by year end. However, inventory will remain at an elevated level and we will drive down days of inventory on hand during the first half of 2016. During the third quarter, capital expenditures were $3.4 million and depreciation and amortization was $2.7 million. I remain confident that a combination of our net cash position and the availability of our $50 million working capital facility as well as our focus on working capital reductions will be sufficient to fund operations. Now let's discuss our outlook for the fourth quarter of 2015. We expect revenue for the fourth quarter 2015 to be within a range of $62 million to $70 million. The fourth quarter revenue decline is driven by a correction of higher inventory levels in our distribution channel and softer overall market demand. We expect gross margins to be within a range of 23% to 26% as a result of a more aggressive pricing strategy. We also expect non-GAAP operating expenses for the fourth quarter of 2015 to be within a range of $28 million to $30 million. As we begin to adjust our operating expenses to our lower gross margin profile. Now I will turn it over to Paul, who will provide an update on the state of the business.
Paul Nahi: Thank you, Kris. The second half of 2015 is turning out to be more challenging than expected. Pricing pressure on US business continues to increase. Forex is putting pressure on our international business margin and pricing and a share loss of our largest customer continues to affect our year-over-year growth. To accelerate the expansion of our business, we've adopted a more aggressive pricing strategy. Until recently, we've been able to outpace price reduction with cost reduction. With our new strategy, it will be more difficult to keep pace with cost reductions. As a result, we expect our gross margin to drop to the mid-20s. However, I'm confident that over the next 24 months we'll be able to drive down our product cost even more aggressively than ever before. As we stated on our earnings call last quarter, we firmly believe that because of our advanced design, semiconductor-based technology and proven cost reduction track record. The cost of our microinverter system will approach that of string inverters. We will be providing more details about product to cost reduction roadmap during our Analyst Day in New York City on November, 17. As we execute on our cost reduction roadmap over the next 2 years and gradually improve gross margin over time towards our target long-term model. We'll adjust our operating expenses to accommodate, a more aggressive pricing strategy. This will require a further optimization across the whole company. Each and every member of the leadership team is dedicated to this and is actively working on reducing expenses, where the target to bring down the quarterly operating expense level below $30 million. Over the next couple of years, we'll focus our efforts on product cost reduction. Geographic expansion and importantly our Home Energy Solution which includes our AC Battery storage system. In addition, we'll continue to drive efficiency improvement and leverage the entire company. Despite the near term challenges, we remain confident and more determined than ever. We know from direct experience that customers valued Enphase solution over competing products. The initial response to our AC Battery storage system and Home Energy Solution has been very exciting and we have confidence in our ability to dramatically reduce cost over the next couple of years, to be at the cost of string inverters. Now with a more aggressive pricing strategy, we can provide our customers with the features, quality, ease and simplicity of an Enphase system at very competitive pricing. During the third quarter, we announced some significant new partnerships including our agreement with SolarWorld to develop a new generation of integrated AC Solar modules for the worldwide market. As a reminder, an AC module is defined as a solar module with an integrated microinverter. There is been a significant increase in demand from large solar distributors, installers and fleet owners for a reliable, cost-effective and high performance AC module to reduce cost and streamline their supply chain. The pairing of our S-Series Microinverters and SolarWorld's Sunmodules will reduce capital and labor cost, as well as simply supply, chain and logistics. We anticipate announcing more AC module partnerships in the near future. Also during the third quarter, we took a major step towards delivering the Enphase Home Energy Solution with a launch of our next generation Envoy-S. Our Home Energy Solution is an integrated, scalable platform for solar generation, storage, control and total energy management. Designed to work with all Enphase microinverters, Envoy-S features consumption monitoring for energy usage insights, revenue grade metering, integrated Wi-Fi, flexible networking options, remote update capabilities and optional cellular connectivity. We also introduced the AC Combiner Box, during the third quarter. The most effective way to maximize the features and benefits of the Envoy-S. The device helped cut the Envoy installation time by as much as 50% and reduces interconnection and communications equipment cost by as much as 20%. To improve operational efficiency and Enphase now offers installers toolkit mobile app for smartphones and tablets. Using the toolkit installers can quickly and easily configure an Enphase System commission the Envoy-S and confirm a successful solar installation. This quarter, we started shipping our fifth-generation microinverter, the S230 and S280. This fifth-generation microinverter is an entirely new platform that enables advanced bridge functions, higher power conversion efficiency, pairing with higher power modules and the first ever bidirectional microinverter and as the first ever bidirectional microinverter. It will power our revolutionary AC Battery storage system. We believe storage will be a multi-billion dollar market. And will be essential in helping solar gain broader acceptance and higher penetration. Enphase is bringing the same technological innovation to storage, that we brought to Solar by pairing our innovative distributed architecture and system design, with what we believe is best-in-class battery chemistry in the industry. Recently, we announced that Australia and New Zealand will be the first markets to receive the Home Energy Solution. The dynamics of the residential solar market in Australia make it one of the most storage ready regions in the world. And our large and growing presence in the Australian solar market, make it a perfect place for the introduction of our Home Energy Solution. In addition the Australian Government recently announced that it wants to accelerate the deployment of battery storage in Australian households. Mainly as a means to mitigate peak demand, reduced cost for consumers and cut emissions. Homeowners in the region, want total control of their homes energy because of the combination of electricity rates, high solar penetration and declining feed-in tariffs. Our Home Energy Solution facilitates needs with compelling economics and sets the stage for an evolving energy market. We're joining with SA Power Networks in South Australia and Genesis Energy in New Zealand to test the systems. We're confident that our AC Battery storage system with its modular architecture and seamless integration into enlighten will be unique in its simplicity, ease of installation, performance and cost effectiveness. We will be rolling out the components of the Enphase Home Energy Solution in Australia and New Zealand starting in December. And the Enphase AC Battery storage system will be available in Australia and New Zealand during the second quarter of 2016. It's important to note, that interest in our AC Battery storage system is not limited to the Asia Pacific region. We've been in discussions with customers in Europe, The United States and other countries. And they're looking for, to offering the Enphase AC Battery storage system and Home Energy Solution in their markets. As an example, we're cautiously optimistic about the potential storage opportunities in Hawaii as a PUC recently issued a ruling to end net metering for all new solar customers in the state. Well this could prove challenging for the Hawaiian solar market in the near term. We believe it creates an opportunity for an Home Energy Solution that includes storage, to lower energy costs for all consumers. In closing, we're working diligently our cost reduction roadmap as well as new products including our fifth-generation microinverter system, the AC module, the AC Battery storage system and the Enphase Home Energy Solution. These will all help drive further long-term growth, with new and existing partners worldwide. Since inception, our vision has been to realize the global potential solar energy through our technology innovation. We're confident, we can overcome the near term pricing challenges and are more excited than ever about the new opportunities ahead. And now, open up the call for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Edwin Mok from Needham & Company. Your question, please.
Edwin Mok: I guess first question just, Paul talk about the near term. I think on your prepared remarks, you talked about all the challenge you need to work on inventory. How fast do you think that could happen and is that just in the US market or you're seeing some got work down in the international markets as well?
Paul Nahi: So we believe that we have a couple of weeks of inventory that we want to work our way through and we should be done with that in the fourth quarter and it's primarily in the US.
Edwin Mok: I see, okay and then, on the pricing front. You guys said, you talked about being more aggressive in pricing analysis, that has a negative effect on gross margin. And I think last quarter you said that, pricing was down 18% year-over-year, is that kind of the range that you guys are looking at pricing the product at this juncture and that caused to this pressure in gross margin or even more aggressive than that. And on the cost side, I remember you guys have finally have cost down version of your Gen four and Gen five, can you give us some rough timeframe and when those product can be available, will be helpful.
Paul Nahi: Sure, so as to the pricing itself, so yes, we've seen approximately 18% to 20% price reduction year-on-year between the second half of 2015 and the second half of 2014 and that obviously is going to have some downward pressure on gross margin and on revenue itself, however we've recognized that this is a very price competitive market. We also feel very comfortable given the empirical data that we have, that at or around competitive pricing, our customers will chose Enphase. So because of that, we've made the decision to become very aggressive on pricing. In fact, slightly ahead of cost which is where you see some of the challenges on gross margin? Having said that, we have a lot of experience and a great track record on cost reduction really since the inception of the company. The 18% price reduction you're seeing this year may very well be exceeded next year as a result of our potential cost reductions that we'll talking more about on our Analyst Day on November 17. So we're going to be sharing with you the details of our cost reduction roadmap over the next 24 years, which will show and hopefully provide the confidence that we can get very near string at or near string pricing costing which would put us in a very strong position globally to grab it even larger market share.
Edwin Mok: Okay that's helpful and last question I have, on the cost side kind of OpEx side. If I look at the model right now, where it's running at and kind of your revenue level, even just with some, [indiscernible] inventory that you talked about and it [indiscernible] one time actually you talked about for the last quarter. It seems like you guys are probably burning some cash on a kind of normalized run rate perspective. So my question I guess is, you have a number of programs to expand into Home energy management, right as well as development of microinverter. How do you kind of balance your cost, how you balance investment into all these programs versus cost control to try to maintain positive cash flow for business?
Kris Sennesael: Yes, there is a lot there in your question and so first of all, we are going to drive down our operating expenses and as Paul already mentioned, to whole executive team including me are diligently working on that and we will take some actions in the fourth quarter and so you will see, we guided $28 million to $30 million of OpEx in Q4. The full impact of all our actions you will see that in the first quarter of 2016. And so obviously, we going as deep as we can, but there are a couple of limiting factors. Of course, we want to make sure that we can and will execute on our product reduction roadmap and that we deliver our AC Battery storage solution as part of our Home Energy Solution, on time to launch it in 2016 in Australia. So that are two very important things that we will continue to make major investments in it and because they're critical for the future of the company. We do believe that we will bring down operating expenses to in line with the lower gross margin profile of the company and that will result in a, I call it, approximately breakeven level from a cash flow point of view. Absent any working capital situations. As you probably know we have a very big seasonality in the business. Even sometimes within the quarters, we see fluctuations and so we will continue to have seasonal fluctuations there, that will impact our working capital, but absent working capital. We're at approximately breakeven level. So as you know probably know, we ended the quarter with $22.5 million of cash, we have and that included $70 million drawn down on the working capital facility. We have a working capital facility up to $50 million and so the combination of driving the business at breakeven, with better focus on managing our working capital, I feel confident that we cash and access to cash to go and run the business.
Edwin Mok: I see but the breakeven that you talk about, is not about what you guide for quarter end?
Kris Sennesael: Sorry, can you repeat that Edwin?
Edwin Mok: Yes, sorry the breakeven, the approximate breakeven that was [indiscernible] normalized revenue levels, right not the fourth quarter revenue with guidance that you guys provided, right?
Kris Sennesael: Yes, I mean it's clear that Q4 is a little bit of abnormal quarter and so it doesn't, you can't build any run rate or anything like from the fourth quarter. I was speaking about our expectations for 2016 and beyond.
Edwin Mok: Okay, great that's all I have. Thank you, appreciated.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Colin Rusch from Oppenheimer. Your questions, please.
Colin Rusch: Can you walk us through a little bit more detail with the cash flow in the fourth quarter, obviously you're talking about drawing down receivable levels, where do you think you can get that to and actually in the quarter something like 50 days or do we, have to expect you to draw down further on that credit facility?
Kris Sennesael: No and I typically don't guide on cash flow, but we had $6 million cash burn from operations during the third quarter, mainly driven by an increase in accounts receivable as well as still a slight increase in inventory levels. As I mentioned during the prepared remarks, we definitely do expect the accounts receivables to come down towards the end of 2015. Inventory, it will take some more time there. We need to reduce the build plans that will take some time and there is more work to be done there in the first half of 2016. But the combination of bringing down the accounts receivable level and other working capital elements that we have, I do expect to generate positive cash flow from operations in the Q4 of 2015. We will see, where we and [ph] today we have $17 million draw down on the working capital facility, we might pay back some of that depending on how much cash, we generate in the fourth quarter.
Colin Rusch: Okay and then as you look at right sizing the business. How should we think about that and when do you think, you'll make final decisions on which areas you're going to see the bigger cuts and how those are flow through?
Paul Nahi: So we're taking actions right now, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks. The entire executive team is very, very focused on this. You'll see the beginning of this in Q4, but you'll see I think most of the change is reflected in our Q1 operating expense. As Kris had mentioned, there are certain areas that we are very keen to protect mainly on the R&D side. The response that we're receiving to our storage solution, to our Home Energy Solution has been tremendous. We also have a lot of cost reduction activities that are going on, as well as things like the AC module, which is receiving a great deal of attention. So we're going to make sure that we continue to invest aggressively in all of these areas and in geographies where we're seeing expansion in growth, we're going to continue to invest there. However, there are definitely efficiencies that we can look to capitalize on and the rest of the company and we're going to evaluate that and as I mentioned, work on it both this quarter and you will see the effects of this mostly on Q1, 2016.
Colin Rusch: All right. I'll hop back in the queue and take some things offline. Thanks a lot, guys.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] our next question comes from the line of Philip Shen from Roth Capital Partners. Your question please.
Philip Shen: I'd like to touch on some far topics on, in terms of pricing and margins. Historically, your ASP declines have been in the 10% to 15% year-on-year decline level. What is the rate of ASP decline that you expect for 2016?
Paul Nahi: Phil, we're not - I'm not going to give you a specific number right now. What we will be doing is, on the 17, we'll share with you our cost reduction roadmap, which I think will provide a lot of visibility into our ability to reduce prices going forward. What I have said earlier, that we've seen an 18% to 20% price reduction, this year second half over second half. We will likely accelerate back in 2016.
Philip Shen: Okay, that's helpful. So with the initial acceleration of price cuts. It seems like margins are in the mid-20s level. Let's see if the accelerating again, suffice to say, how low are you prepared for gross margins to go in 2016?
Paul Nahi: Well we're not getting any guidance as to gross margin, but we had mention had we, pricing actions we've taken will land us somewhere in the mid-20s and we think that, what we aspire to do is keep pace with that, throughout 2016.
Philip Shen: Okay, thanks Paul. One other one here. In terms of the warranty and we've heard, that some inverter manufacturers out there, are exploring the possibility of reducing the length of time for warranties, as they reduce ASPs. What's your view on this in general and does that help alleviate some of the ASP declines?
Paul Nahi: So, well reducing the warranty, we'll certainly reduce the warranty reduce which could help on ASPs. I think the changes that we're talking about are really more substantial and more innovative. We - through our semiconductor development, we're able to reduce the part count, able to change things on the mechanical side, on the cabling side, we can uniquely take advantage of the new higher power modules that are out there too, yet again reduce cost. So we're not looking at addressing this problem through financial means, we're looking at addressing the increasing interest in lower prices to help our customers become more competitive through technology innovation.
Kris Sennesael: And Phil, I think it's clear that for Enphase, quality and reliability is a key element of our value proposition. We're not willing to compromise on that. Maybe some of our competitors might be willing to do that, that is not what Enphase is doing. Quality and reliability is key. We continue to further improve our reliability of our product which is world class already and we're not willing to compromise on that.
Paul Nahi: I'm sorry to underscore Kris's point. The nature of some of our cost reductions actually will help in the reliability by reducing a number of components and increasing the content of our semiconductor devices, we also reduce a number of solder [ph] joints and make the device smaller. So much of what we're doing is going in the direction of increased reliability, while we increase our testing and performance as well.
Philip Shen: Great, one more if I can. Did you guys take any revenue reserves perhaps for price protection?
Kris Sennesael: We have our normal accounting practice that we apply rigorously every quarter and so there was nothing up normal there in Q3, this time.
Philip Shen: Okay, great. Thank you, Kris. Thank you, Paul. I'll jump back in the queue.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Morosi from Avondale Partners. Your question please.
Michael Morosi: With respect to fourth quarter guidance in addition to the inventory build. You called out market weakness and that's different than the message that we got from, one of the leading players in the space the other day. So I just wanted to see, if you can elaborate on what you're seeing and any specific end markets or geographies that may have impacted that comment?
Paul Nahi: So what we've seen is that, some of the initial expectations for the growth of the US residential market. I think may have been call it 10% to 20% more than what we're seeing right now. I think the reality of the market growth year-over-year is probably closer to 40% to 60% not necessarily 60% to 80%. So we're definitely seeing good growth, solid growth but may be not the growth that was originally anticipated. As for its application across the US. I wouldn't say there is anyone area particularly affected except perhaps Hawaii.
Michael Morosi: Okay and then, you're digging a little bit more into the, the shipment guidance and the inventory picture. It seems like inventories might be 10% or 15% drag and even if, it were to go to zero, that's only limited downside from here. So it still seems like there might be somewhere else, where there has been some growth slippage and you never know that's in C&I or in, Tier 2, Tier 3 customers. So what you're seeing, on the competitive that's kind of outside of the inventory and the pricing that you guys referred to.
Paul Nahi: Sure. So part of the guidance is, as we talked about due to the inventory correction. So we've got a couple weeks that we want to, we want to burn through in the channel. In addition to that, we talked about the fact that we've seen a slightly softer market than expected. And then remember, year-on-year the second half of 2015 has seen an 18% to 20% price reduction over the second half of 2014. So you've got price reduction which is putting downward pressure on margin coupled with some of the other elements that I just mentioned, that collectively is definitely effecting Q4. In terms of market share in general, it's a mix bag and market share is rather difficult to come by. We do believe that, as you had mentioned in the Tier 3, the price delta between us and some competitors had gotten quite large and while in the past, that there was a tremendous. People are willing to pay a tremendous premium for Enphase, the pricing environment with our customers has gotten rather challenging. So we have to reduce that delta and that was the impetus behind the very aggressive pricing moves that we've taken to-date including in Q3 and what we're going to continue to do in the ensuing quarters.
Michael Morosi: All right and one more then I'll hop off. Can you share, what percentage you expect of Gen 5 shipments in Q4?
Kris Sennesael: We're just ramping up our Gen 5 shipments and so I believe this will be around 10% to 15% of total shipments.
Michael Morosi: And then heading into first half of 2016.
Kris Sennesael: You have to think about the vast majority of our shipments all of them [ph] in 2016 will still be the fourth generation. But fifth generation there will then as I said like starting from 10%, 15% probably going to 20%, maybe 25% towards the end of 2016.
Michael Morosi: Okay, very good. Thanks for taking the questions.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Lee from Goldman Sachs
Brian Lee: And sorry to harp on the theme, but it seems pretty important here. Just first question from me would be, where are you seeing the most softness in demand trends. Is it mostly in the distribution channel or is it in direct sales? And related to that, is there any geo [ph] where you've seen more of an impact. I know you outlined Hawaii and anything else that you think is worth highlighting?
Paul Nahi: Nothing, outside of Hawaii, we're not seeing anything specific. And then when you're talking about market segmentation. We're not seeing at localized at any one particular segment. We're seeing it at sort of across the board.
Brian Lee: So you're seeing within your distributor channel, where it sounds like you're making the most inventories just been fear [ph] that weakness is just as, I guess is equal to what you're seeing your direct sales with some of the larger customers, is that fair?
Paul Nahi: I think as a general comment, I say that's true. Obviously customer-to-customer you're going to see different trends. But as an example, one of things that we've seen in the distribution is some of the Tier 1s, some of the very large customers have made inroads and have actually started to have gained a bit of share, which is actually putting pressure on some of Tier 3s, which may have slowed some of that growth, again still growing but maybe not as fast as we had anticipated.
Brian Lee: Okay, fair enough. Maybe switching gear towards the pricing pressure. Similar to the first question, where are you seeing the most acute pricing pressure. Is it really just across the board or have you seen it more concentrated at the larger installers. I know you guys have been making a more concerted effort and have been vocal about that in recent quarters, but wondering if that's, if you're seeing a differential in the pricing pressure from the different customer segments you're targeting here.
Paul Nahi: It's a good question. We - I think originally the pricing pressure started with the larger customers, but it really can never stay isolated there. It's just a matter of time before it trickles down into the Tier 2s and Tier 3s, so what we're seeing now is that pricing pressure, I think across the market. Although, as I mentioned it may have started with the larger customers. And our strategy has been to address that with the larger Tier 1s, with the Tier 2s. We've made we've had several Tier 2 design wins that we're very excited about, many of which we haven't announced yet. But I think the pricing move that we've made in the middle Tiers had a tremendous effect and now we're applying that same strategy to the Tier 3s as well.
Brian Lee: Okay, thanks guys.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Osborne from Cowen and Company. Your question please.
Jeffrey Osborne: Just a couple of questions on my end. I was wondering, if with the new price points that we're talking about here, if there is any opportunity to gain share at the Tier 1s, given your comments that they seem to be taking share versus your bread and butter, Tier 2 and 3 customers historically.
Paul Nahi: It's very hard for me to give you definitive answer on that, but yes we do, we are, our intention is to get to a price point, where yes we can gain share across the board from the Tier 1s, continue to success revenue in the Tier 2s as well as the long-tail.
Jeffrey Osborne: It sounds like at Analyst Day you'll be talking about the cost roadmap, I think you've typically in the past talked about all the fifth gen products, having a 20% to 25% cost reduction. It was a bit unclear if that's what you're seeing with the initial units or is that a volume or some kind of version two of it, that would come out at a later date, can you just kind of flush out from a high level what the cost reduction potential is with that and as a follow-up. If you're blowing out the inventory here, why wouldn't you accelerate the shift to gen five at a faster rate than what we saw with the M250 transition from the 215. It seems like that would be a good opportunity to move the market this way faster, as oppose to slower.
Paul Nahi: Sure. So let me address your first question. So what we're seeing right now, what we have said is, that we see significant cost reductions with each subsequent generation of product. However, we don't necessarily see it when we introduce the product. We see it, we introduce the product and then it gets cost reduced over time and we eventually see it. Again we'll provide more detail on the Analyst Day. But no, we're not seeing a 25% cost reduction with the introduction of the fifth generation. Again more details on that to come and again, we'll take you through not just 2016 but all the way through 2017 as well, so you can see the larger narrative. In reference to us moving more aggressively on the fifth generation, the S230 and S280. A lot of this is driven by module power, the higher power modules while you do see some in the market, it's still not the most prevalent modules out there. We expect to see a much higher prevalence of higher power modules towards the end of the year. So I think, our fifth generation inverter will certainly pick up market share as we move into the second half of the year and then again there is that coupled with the cost reduction actions that we are embarked on, will result I think in much quicker transition towards the back half of the year.
Kris Sennesael: And Jeff as, the vast majority of our ship was in 2016 will still be the fourth generation, we will continue to drive down the product cost of that fourth generation as well. We've not hit the bottom there either, so we'll continue to drive down cost of Gen four as well.
Jeffrey Osborne: Got it and just for the Analyst Day, will you be giving an updated target model? I think in the past you've talked about 40% gross margin that's probably optimistic at this point, but is that something in the mid-term you mentioned 2016 and 2017 formal targets that just, longer term what the company can look like, is that something you're either willing to share now or at that point?
Kris Sennesael: Yes, we definitely at the Analyst Day, we'll talk a bit more about our financial models and all of that. Having said that, we see that margins are now dropping to the mid-20s, however and we said that during the prepared remarks as well. Our long-term target levels remains 35% to 40% and we believe that, once we will hit the bottom of the cost curve, given our unique value proposition, we will be able to command a premium and a margins into 35%, 40%. You have to think about that in a slightly different way. Today, our premium is probably $0.20 or $0.25 per watt. Once you get to the bottom of the cost curve, the premium might be $0.02 or $0.03 or $0.04 per watt or maybe a $100 or $200 per system. And that will pay off way much compared to the value of proposition that we provide in terms of higher energy production, lower design and installation cost, ease of installation and lower operations and maintenance cost.
Jeffrey Osborne: Got it, thanks Kris for the detail.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] and our next question comes from the line of Vishal Shah from Deutsche Bank. Your question please.
Vishal Shah: So Paul, I wanted to better understand how this near term demand environment is shipping up. And you've talked some seasonality in Q1. I mean, should we assume demand will continue to remain soft until early Q2 and will that have an impact on margins?
Paul Nahi: So well, there's certainly the market seasonality that we expect in Q1. I think that some of what's happening in Q4 is unique to Q4. So I'm not expecting to see the same level of seasonality that Enphase has seen in the past, in Q1.
Vishal Shah: Okay, but it's fair to say that sequentially your revenues and volumes will not necessarily grow and your margins may continue to remain under pressure at least until you're able to see some volume growth in the second half.
Paul Nahi: Again, we don't, we're not guiding to 2016 but with the pricing actions that we have taken and will take, I do expect to see that generate more demand and higher revenue growth.
Vishal Shah: Okay, that's fair and then in an environment, where 2016 US market let's say is up 30% to 40% from a volume standpoint. How should we think about, your volume growth next year, would you think you will be. I mean first of all, do you think that the adoption rate for microinverters is increasing or do you think, this year finally the revenues are going to be flat. Do you think, you're going to see some market share changes next year and how should we think about overall volumes next year?
Paul Nahi: Sure. So again, I think to-date we have been at a considerable price premium over our competitors. The strategic decisions that we're making right now is that, we know that and we have seen that when we're at or near competitive pricing, we will win more customers then not. So I fully expect that, this new pricing strategy will resolve in higher revenue. Again I'm not going to guide towards 2015. But we've already seen tremendous success, we've seen that in customers like Sunrun, we became a customer there for the first time as result of the extra energy harvest, the stability and quality of the product as well as the pricing. We've seen the same thing happen in Tier 2s, many of which we haven't, many of which designs We haven't announced yet, designs win we haven't announced yet and I'm fully expected to see the same thing in the Tier 3s. Now we're just talking about the US, we're also seeing tremendous growth in EMEA, in the APAC region. So I think there is a lot of growth and a lot of market penetration for microinverters yet to come.
Vishal Shah: That's helpful and just to clarify the $0.25 premium that you mentioned, is that after the price actions that you take, you'll be taking in Q4 or is it of Q3?
Kris Sennesael: No that's historical.
Vishal Shah: Okay, with some of the recent satisfaction that you've taken, where do you think your premium is versus both the string and also with versus the leading competitor.
Paul Nahi: So we're not guiding to price, what we are saying is that, we're going to show you a cost reduction roadmap that will get us to the at or very, very near the cost of string inverters. What we do and how much of that we take to price, we'll have to see, it's going to be based on market conditions at the time. But we'll be in a position, where we could compete with a broader and broader piece of the market.
Vishal Shah: That's helpful. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. This does conclude the question-and-answer session of today's program. I would like to hand the program back to Paul Nahi for any closing comments.
Paul Nahi: Thank you for joining us on the call today and we look forward to seeing you on November 17 at our Analyst Day in New York.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect. Good day.

===== 2015 Q2  (2015-08-04 16:30:00) =====
Executives: Christina Carrabino - IR Paul Nahi - CEO Kris Sennesael - CFO
Analysts: Philip Shen - Roth Capital Partners Michael Morosi - Avondale Partners
Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen and welcome to Enphase Energy’s Second Quarter 2015 Financial Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. We will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I like to introduce to you today's host for your conference Ms.Christina Carrabino. Ma'am, you may begin.
Christina Carrabino: Good afternoon and thank you for joining us on today’s conference call to discuss Enphase Energy’s second quarter 2015 results. On today’s call are Paul Nahi, Enphase Energy’s President and Chief Executive Officer; and Kris Sennesael, Chief Financial Officer. After the market closed today, Enphase issued a press release announcing the results for its second quarter ended June 30th, 2015.

Now, I’d like to introduce Paul Nahi, President and Chief Executive Officer of Enphase Energy. Paul?
Paul Nahi: Good afternoon and thanks for joining us today to discuss our second quarter 2015 financial results. I'll provide some key highlights and Kris will take through the second quarter financials and the outlook for the third quarter. After that we'll open up the call for Q&A. We delivered financial results for the second quarter of 2015. Demand for our solar energy systems was strong in our core US residential markets as well as in Europe and Australia resulting in a quarterly record of a 195 megawatts shift, an increase of 48% year-over-year. We reported revenue of a $102.1 million for the second quarter of 2015 an increase of 25% year-over-year and non-GAAP margin of 32.7%. We also reported solid bottomline results including positive non-GAAP operating income and net income along with non-GAAP diluted earnings of $0.06 per share. Since inception we've shipped approximately 9 million microinverters or 2 gigawatts of Enphase microinverter systems. There're currently over 340,000 Enphase systems in 97 countries. In the US market second quarter revenue was up 22% year-over-year as we saw continued strong customer demand for our microinverter system and the expansion of our customer base. Our market share in the US residential market excluding [indiscernible] continues to be strong and growing and with our customers and partnerships such as our recently announced strategic supply agreement with Sunrun we expect this trend to continue. As a preferred supplier of solar energy systems to Sunrun for its home solar installation business, Enphase will provide its microinverters to Sunrun's direct installation services business for the first time. Sunrun recognizes that Enphase offers a smart, differentiated and financially compelling approach to clean energy generation that delivers strong economics, excellent system performance over the life of the project. We look forward together with Sunrun not only as a preferred supplier but as a partner in delivering intelligent energy solutions.  During the second quarter, we signed an agreement with REPOWER by Solar Universe that establishes Enphase as the primary solar energy system supplier for REPOWER’s unique integrated solar power and smart home energy system. In the commercial sector, we continue to make headway with our C250 commercial product solution. During the second quarter, Enphase and My Generation Energy completed and commissioned a 900 kilowatt commercial project featuring our C250 microinverter system. My Generation Energy and other commercial installers recognize and appreciate the Enphase C250 value proposition of optimal performance, less wiring and fewer balance of system components and significantly reduced design, labor and overall construction cost.  Turning to our international business, revenue was up 37% year-over-year mainly driven by strong growth in Europe and APAC region. In Australia and New Zealand, second quarter revenue increased nearly 200% year-over-year. We continue to view the APAC region as a significant growth area. In addition, we are seeing increasing global interest for energy management system which consist of our microinverter, AC batteries and load control, all managed by our cloud based application Enlighten. I recently visited with current and potential customers in the UK, Europe and Australia and came away very impressed with the strong interest in our energy management system to address regulatory requirements, increased economic benefit of the total system and enable more energy independence.  Interest in our AC battery solution is especially robust. After discussions with customers all over the world, we are confident that our AC battery with its modular architecture and seamless integration into Enlighten will be unique in its simplicity, its ease of installation, performance and cost effectiveness. It's important to note that the anticipated growth of energy storage will continue to increase the value of an energy management system. A home, building or grid including a system comprised of solar generation, energy storage and load management will require an energy management system to create a total solution. With hundreds of thousands of customers already using Enlighten, the path toward total energy management for Enphase customers has already been paved. We will start testing and begin certification activities of our AC batteries source solution later this year as we prepare for our market launch in early 2016. Now I will turn it over to Kris for his review of our financial results. 
Kris Sennesael: Thank you Paul. I will provide some more details related to our financial results for the second quarter of 2015 and then I will provide the business outlook for the third quarter of 2015. As a reminder, the financial measures that I am going to provide are on a non-GAAP basis unless otherwise noted. Total revenue for the second quarter of 2015 was $102.1 million, an increase of 25% compared to the second quarter of 2014 and an increase of 18% compared to the first quarter of 2015. The large year-over-year growth was driven by strong overall demand for Enphase energy microinverter systems in our core U.S. residential and commercial markets as well as further market share gains in our international markets.  As you all know, our revenue growth has been affected by Vivint's transition from a single sourcing strategy with Enphase to a multi-sourcing strategy using multiple other inverter vendors. As a result of this headwind, our customer concentration with our historically largest customer has been reduced from approximately 30% of our total revenue in the second quarter of 2014 to approximately 14% of our total revenue in the second quarter of 2015. Due to this strategic shift, revenue from Vivint was down approximately 40% year-over-year but the revenue excluding Vivint was up over 50% on a year-over-year basis.  Our impressive top-line growth outside of Vivint speaks to the continued strength of our business and value proposition. We have many large, medium and small customers in the residential and commercial solar markets worldwide.  We shipped a new quarterly record of 195 megawatts AC or approximately 225 megawatts DC during the second quarter of 2015, an increase of 48% on year-over-year basis and an increase of 21% sequentially. Megawatt shipped excluding Vivint were actually up approximately 80% on a year-over-year basis.  The 195 megawatt shipped represented approximately 859,000 microinverters of which substantially all were our fourth generation microinverter systems. The Enlighten M250 represented approximately 35% of all units shipped, up from approximately 30% last quarter. Inverter prices on a price per watt basis were down slightly at approximately 2% sequentially and down approximately 10% year-over-year on a constant foreign exchange basis, in line with our historical pricing trends. Gross margin for the second quarter of 2015 was 32.7%, exceeding our outlook of 30% to 32% provided last quarter. During the quarter, our engineering and operations team continue to execute very well on our product cost reduction plans. Operating expenses during the second quarter of 2015 were $30.3 million, a reduction of 1% compared to the first quarter of 2015. During the second quarter of 2015, R&D expenses were $11.6 million, sales and marketing expenses were $11.5 million and G&A expenses were $7.2 million. We have been able to keep operating expenses at the same level for three quarters in a row at approximately $30 million. While continuing to make great progress on many of our R&D projects; which including the development of our AC battery storage technology and energy management system; the fifth generation microinverter system; further product cost reductions; and other new and innovative next generation technology building blocks. Going forward, we will continue to practice rigorous discipline in managing our operating expenses. Total non-GAAP operating expenses excluded $3.3 million in stock based compensation expenses and $1 million in severance cost, offset by a favorable $1 million revaluation of the acquisition related contingent consideration liability. We reported another quarter of non-GAAP operating income with $3 million of operating income in the second quarter of 2015, a major improvement compared to non-GAAP operating income of $6,000 in the second quarter of 2014. For the second quarter of 2015, non-GAAP net income was $2.8 million or $0.06 per diluted share compared to a non-GAAP net loss of $400,000 or a net loss of $0.01 per share in the second quarter of 2014. On a GAAP basis, net loss for the second quarter of 2015 was $600,000 or a net loss of $0.01 per share compared to a GAAP net loss of $3 million or a net loss of $0.07 per share in the second quarter of 2014. In summary, I am pleased with our financial performance in the second quarter of 2015. The combination of strong top line growth, solid gross margin and flat operating expenses drove significant improvements to our bottom line and profitability. Turning to the balance sheet. We exited the second quarter of 2015 with a total cash balance of $31.9 million. Cash flow from operations was an outflow of $11.8 million, driven primarily by a sequential increase in accounts receivable of $21.4 million as the business was ramping up during the second quarter and as a result of the timing of shipments during the quarter. Inventory remained approximately flat sequentially at the level of $34 million. We will continue to take actions to drop down inventory levels during the remainder of the year. During the second quarter, capital expenditures were $2.6 million and depreciation and amortization was $2.5 million. Cash flow from financing activities was $19.1 million, which included a $17 million draw down on our working capital facility. During the remainder of the year, based on the seasonal patterns in our business and as we drop down accounts receivable and inventory levels, I expect to generate positive free cash flows and repay any outstanding amounts on our working capital facility. Now, let’s discuss our outlook for the third quarter of 2015. We expect revenue for the third quarter of 2015 to be within a range of $100 million to $105 million, which is an increase of 1% to 6% compared to the third quarter of 2014. In this outlook, we expect that the revenue was driven will be down to approximately $5 million in the quarter, which is a decrease of approximately 75% year-over-year. The non-driven at the midpoint of the outlook range is up approximately 25% year-over-year. We expect gross margins to be within a range of 30% from 32%. We also expect non-GAAP operating expenses for the third quarter of 2015 to be flat to up 3% compared to the second quarter of 2015 as a result of certain onetime development project expenses during the current quarter. And now I will turn the call back to Paul.
Paul Nahi: Thanks Chris. Before we go to Q&A, I’d like to take a moment to highlight the Enphase value proposition and our competitive strengths. We continue to grow our business in every geography and every segment. We have an impressive customer list worldwide and the demand for our products is strong and continues to grow. Our unique value proposition as well as the superior quality and reliability of our energy system resonates with customers globally. In the U.S. residential market, we currently have strategic partnerships with four out of the five top installers, NRG, Sunrun, SunEdison and Vivint. We also have strategic partnerships with many new and upcoming players, and in fact are seeing increasing momentum and growing market share with them. These customers continue to execute well on their growth strategies in the U.S. residential and commercial markets, as well as internationally. It's clear that with its ongoing inverter diversification strategy is putting downward pressure on our topline growth but despite this Enphase continues to grow. We believe that our share of Vivant's business will normalize this quarter after which we expect to continue to see overall growth. Our current customer portfolio is well balanced with large Tier 1 customers as well as with midsized and smaller installers and no one customer accounting for a disproportionate share of our revenue. Recently there's been a great deal of discussion about competitive pricing, we certainly recognize the increased pressure on inverter pricing that is affecting all suppliers. Pricing has been and will continue to be very important. While we've said this before it's worth restating that because of our advanced design semiconductor based technology and proven track record we have great confidence that the cost of our microinverter system will approach that of common string inverters and be lower than string inverters with optimizers. Enphase has an exceptional track record of cost reduction and we will continue to reduce costs even further. In fact our current cost reduction roadmap is more aggressive than ever. In addition to driving down product costs through innovation and semi conductor integration a microinverter is uniquely able to leverage its scale as well as the growing availability of higher power models to further accelerate costs and price reduction. We will be providing more details about our product cost reduction roadmap in the coming months. The combination of continued solid growth, aggressive cost reduction, ever increasing performance and reliability and the delivery of a complete energy management solution is proving to be very powerful and will continue to drive further growth with new and existing partners worldwide. We're more excited than ever about the many opportunities ahead. Now I'll open up the line for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] At this time I am showing no questions, I would like to turn the call back over to Paul Nahi for closing remarks.
Paul Nahi: Well thank you very much for joining in the call today. There may be a mistake, I think there may be some questions on line.
Operator: Our first question comes from the line of Vishal Shah with Deutsche Bank.
Unidentified Analyst: Hey guys it's Jeremiah on the line for Vishal. Thanks for taking the question. I was just hoping you could expand a little bit more on the cost reduction front, I know you'd said that at some point you hope to be lower than inverter plus optimizer and you know competitive with inverters, is there any kind of general commentary you can give around that.
Paul Nahi: Well what we said is that we are going to be providing a lot more details about that in the coming months at a high level, what I would say is if you look at the history of silicon valley it is all about cost reduction as a result of semiconductor integration and innovation. Our device our microinverter is based on a very complex and sophisticated semiconductor design and I think that what we are seeing right now in terms of cost reduction is nothing dissimilar that we've seen for many years with many other products in Silicon Valley, so we're going to continue that trend and as I said we're going to be sharing with you a lot more details about this in the very near future.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay great, I'll look forward to seeing that and maybe on a separate topic, as you're expanding more internationally, I know you highlighted Asia Pacific specifically as a growth area, could you talk about the markets that are being more or less successful there and where the future growth may come from in A-Pac.
Paul Nahi: Well we have a very strong team that's actually doing extremely well in Australia and we've already expanded into New Zealand and we are still very early in that region so there's a tremendous amount of market growth specifically in Australia and a growing market share in New Zealand. Having said that and we do not preannounce the introduction of our product into new geography but I will say that as you look north in the Asia Pacific region there are up and coming markets that we are very excited about that our microinverter solution is extremely well suited for and we'll keep you informed as we have more details about that.
Unidentified Analyst: Great, thanks guys.
Operator: Thank you, our next question comes from the line of Edwin Mok with Needham Company.
Edwin Mok: Great, thanks for letting me ask a question so, first one, she's a fall on the A-Pac sorry on the international front. Two part question I guess, first is, there's recently some change in policy in UK, have you seen or do you expect to see any impact to your business there and then relate to Australia and New Zealand that you highlight, I note that you guys had announced commercial version of the inverter in the international market, did that help drive some at least small commercial growth in those markets.
Paul Nahi: So the answer to your first question there has been and I believe still will continue to be some policy shifts occurring in the UK, however it is not significantly impacting our business, where again, it's -- we are relatively young in these markets and there is a lot of market share ahead of us. So we are seeing tremendous success. The brand is growing. The teams are executing very well and I expect to see continued growth in the UK market. As for Australia and New Zealand and the commercial markets there, we are actually very active in both the residential and the commercial markets in Australia and New Zealand. The -- we have a slight advantage there and that the product is the same product as opposed to what's required in the U.S., so we are able to take advantage and leverage the technology we have, leverage the customers base that we have to see continued growth.  So as we mentioned on the call, we have seen a 200% year-over-year increase and we expect to see continued growth in the Australian market.
Unidentified Analyst: Great, that’s helpful. And then, Kris I have a question OpEx. You mentioned that there was some one-time government expense on the third quarter. Is that we can quantify that? And also SPIs this quarter, did that also contribute to increased OpEx in this quarter?
Kris Sennesael: Yes, and that’s why we guided operating expense to be flat to up 3%. And so it's not a huge amount but there are some one-time expenses in the third quarter that result in a potential small increase of the operating expense.
Unidentified Analyst: But do you expect that to reverse by the time we get to the fourth quarter then?
Kris Sennesael: Potentially, yes, yes.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay. That’s helpful. Last question then I will let the other guys ask. In the U.S. market you guys announced a fewer new customer like Sunrun and Solar Universe, right? I was wondering those bigger contracts. Do you have to give any price concession for those contract and as those ramp-up, do you expect that to have some impact on your gross margin, any way you can give us some color on that?
Paul Nahi: So we are not going to comment on specific pricing for specific customers. We have a very competitively priced product and there is a recognition that the value of a microinverter is unique that a microinventer does produce more energy it's easier to design, easier to install, it's the most reliable product out there, and that value is recognized by our customers. The gross margin that you see reflects the tier 1 customers as well as tier 2s and tier 3s and I think we are going to continue to be able to extract the value of a microinverter as we attract both larger customers as well as smaller ones.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay, great. That’s all I have. Thank you.
Paul Nahi: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Philip Shen with Roth Capital Partners.
Philip Shen: Hey guys, thanks for taking my questions. 
Paul Nahi: Good.
Philip Shen: First off, why did you raise the 17 million debt in the quarter and what do you see ahead, what kind of share do you see of the U.S. residential market in 2016?
Kris Sennesael: Well Phil first on the $17 million debt, as you know, we ended last quarter with $27 million of cash at the end of Q1, at the end of the second quarter we had $16 million of net cash, it's actually $30 million of cash with $17 million of debt. As you can see in the second quarter accounts receivable increased approximately $21 million mainly driven by the ramp of the business in the second quarter as well as the timing of shipments during the second quarter and we kept inventory approximately flat. And so as a result of that, that definitely have an increase in working capital requirements and we had a working capital facility there and we used it. As I said before, I do expect in the second half given the seasonality of the business and given that I expect to drive down accounts receivables as well as inventory levels to repay any of those outstanding amounts on the working capital facility.
Paul Nahi: In reference to the market share question, what I would say is that we are not going to guide to market share for 2016 but if you look at the existing performance we have been increasingly successful with small and medium size installers. We have added Sunrun most recently as a large installer customer and that trend we believe is going to continue.
Philip Shen: Great. I have one more question and then I will jump back in queue. There has been a lot of discussion among investors comparing your storage solution with other offerings in the market place. Can you talk about the advantages and disadvantages of your offering versus competitors' since yours requires multiple stages of power conversion while others may only have one stage of power conversion? Thanks.
Paul Nahi: Sure. There certainly is quite a bit of noise about this. Let me start by saying that the modularity of our solution is very unique and incredibly valuable, when you talk to customers Australia, in the UK and Continental Europe, the ability to right size the storage solution for that specific application, for that specific customer is critical in optimizing the return on investment. With an Enphase solution you have the exact amount of source that you need, no more, no less. In addition the simplicity of our solution because we are not encumbered by being tied to the solar system, for an Enphase solar solution you simply one person can hang one device on a wall, plug it in and you now have storage. With our solution one person can install an entire storage system in just a few hours and because it’s not coupled with the solar solution, our installers can and are extremely interested in retrofitting existing installations with an Enphase storage device. So, the simplicity and the ease for the installer and the consumer I think are very pronounced and unique to our solution. In addition to that, there are other solutions out there and there are as an example some optimize their solutions there that in fact have seven stages of conversion. So if you look at the efficiency of our solution, we will always be more efficient and generate more energy than another solution out there. In fact, if you look at everything from the performance of our battery, which is north of 96% and close to 97% round trip efficiency compare that to some recently announced battery solutions that are down to 92% round trip efficiency. If you look at the number of cycles that we have over our lifetime somewhere in the neighborhood of 11,000 versus 5K for competitive solutions, it speaks to the support of our system to be able to do multiple cycles every day. So I think in terms of efficiency, we’re going to be far more efficient than any other solution. We’re going to be far easier to install and manage. And on top of everything, we will very likely be one of the most effective solutions out there. So our discussions with customers around the world are really very exciting and very positive and we’re very-very optimistic about the success of our storage solution.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Morosi with Avondale Partners.
Michael Morosi: If I look at the revenue guidance that you imply with Vivint being down 75% year-over-year and your other customers being up I believe you said 25% or more, and Vivint flat, or Vivint’s share being flat in third quarter. What does that imply as far as fourth quarter? Should we expect that fourth quarter revenue should be up sequentially and would we think in same terms for margins?
Kris Sennesael: Michael we typically only guide one quarter at the time. And so I am not going to make a change here. But historically if you look at our seasonal trends, we have seen that the fourth quarter is up slightly, flat to slightly up versus the third quarter. And so, based on the information that we have today and based on what we believe will continue in our Vivint business, as well as the non-Vivint business, that’s what we expect for the fourth quarter as well.
Michael Morosi: And then maybe just taking a step back, with respect to cost, you talk about potentially intersecting or bidding traditional inverter technologies. And as we look at the quarter, and if we just annualize your run rate of say 200 megawatts, we get to about 800 megawatts. And so that’s implying somewhere below 2% of the global installation run rate. So how do you think about just the segment of module level electronics and where segment market share should go over time, so just focusing on overall segment as opposed to share, maybe within the segment?
Paul Nahi: So it’s a good question. I think if you look at the advantages of microinverter and you look at the fact that we’ve had such tremendous success despite the fact that we have been priced at a premium and sometimes earlier on at a significant premium over string inverters, it’s clear that our customers value the microinterver and value what it brings to the table. As we talked about more energy production, simpler to design and install, the most reliable product out there, it has tremendous value. The only thing that has really held back yet again more market share adoption, has been pricing. And as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we get it. That pricing is becoming increasing important. However, as we are able to close that gap and get closer to just playing another string inverters to get under string inverters with optimizers. We think that the penetration of microinverters in the overall market should increase very dramatically, not only with new markets and new segments open up but we should see a very significant increase in market share even in very well entrenched markets. So we’re very-very bullish that this is the future. And the microinverter, as you know, is also a precursor to an AC module where you have a microinverter attached to the back of the module, which will simplify the installation process yet again. So, you couple that with a complete energy management system, I think you have the foundation for the development of a very large portion of the market moving to microinverter solution.
Operator: Thank you our next question comes from the line of Krish Shankar with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Unidentified Analyst: Hello this is [indiscernible] [indiscernible] speaking on behalf of Krish Shankar. I have a couple of questions. For starters, can you speak a little about the margin differential between your domestic and international sales?
Kris Sennesael: We've stated before that our margins on the international business specially taken into accounts some of the Forex headwinds that we've recently seen are slightly below average but there is not a big difference but it's I would say slightly below average.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay and moving forward, would you be willing to sacrifice profitability for growth or are there any situations where you would choose one over the other. 
Paul Nahi: I would view that as these are business decisions that we make every single day that we're constantly looking to optimize the business which means growing the topline as hard as we can while maintaining profitability and increasing profitability year-on-year. Because of our aggressive cost reduction task, because of the value that we produce, because of the multiple markets that we're in we're able to go in and surgically make that decision on a customer by customer basis and we have done that. As a result you've seen the share growth that we’ve had while increasing profitability so I guess the short answer is absolutely we make those decisions every day and I'm very confident that we're going to be able to continue that path of profitable growth in the future.
Unidentified Analyst: And just one more on [indiscernible] your September revenue has improved sequentially from June and I have a question as to why this next quarter's guidance the mid point is kind of flat in comparison to this quarter seeing the sequential revenue has increased over the last three quarters.
Kris Sennesael: Right and I think we try to explain that on the call, it’s mainly driven by Vivant's revenue that is down 75% year-over-year as well as drastically down sequentially as well, if you look at the non Vivant part of the business you can see that we expect strong year-over-year growth as well as sequential growth in the third quarter versus the second quarter. 
Unidentified Analyst: Thank you, awesome quarter.
Operator: Thank you, our next question comes from the line of [indiscernible] [indiscernible] with Raymond James.
Unidentified Analyst: Hey guys, so you've talked about the headwinds relating to Vivant's still sourcing, now that they're getting acquired what do you think will be the impact of the new ownership.
Paul Nahi: We have a long standing relationship with Sun Edison that goes back years, they have been a great partner for us and we're working with them both domestically and internationally, as you know we have a very good relationships with Vivant as well, so we're optimistic that the, that the joint company that post the acquisition we should be in a very strong position to continue to grow both with the joint company as well as within, so our job right now is to make sure that we are supporting them both again domestically and internationally and providing whatever support we can, but we are very optimistic about the relationship going forward with the joint company.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay and in relation to the kind of broader inverter landscape and you mentioned that the pressure on pricing, how much of that is a reflective of the industry pushing to squeeze out costs in advance of the ITC cliff at the end of next year versus your just general competitive dynamics among the different vendors. 
Paul Nahi: I think it is a little bit of both, I think there's clearly a sense that people want to take advantage of the ITC as long as it’s around and leverage their strength in the market. But I don't know that what we're seeing is necessarily just unique to the ITC, I think we're, I think the -- the nature of this market given the fact that we're effectively competing with coal and gas fired power is going to be cost competitive, is going to be, I think is going to challenge suppliers to be very consistent and very aggressive in the [indiscernible] deposits and price reduction strategy going forward. We don’t think it’s going to be necessarily uniquely a US phenomenon, we're going to see this worldwide and for us we welcome it, we think this is, we believe that as prices come down markets open up, as markets come down the overall TAM for the solar market will continue to increase. And we are better positioned than most to be able to leverage technology to help reduce cost, so I think just all in all I think you're going to see it globally and then I think certainly over time we will see prices sort of [indiscernible] to a particular level but I think that's probably a year or two out.
Unidentified Analyst: Right, appreciate it.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Andy Natso with Dougherty & Company.
Unidentified Analyst: Hi, thanks for taking my call. I am calling on behalf of Andrew James. I was wondering if you could expand on the excitement you describe for the AC battery solution and also are there any plans to develop some kind of a solution that would allow Enphase's microinverters to connect to non- Enphase batteries?
Paul Nahi: So the excitement is really quite palpable. We are seeing it in Australia in Queensland, in New South Wales we are seeing in the UK, we are seeing in Continental Europe. What's exciting about it is that there is in these areas a real economic case for storage whether it's a zero export rule that's happened in Queensland, whether it's a reduction of the Feed-in-Tariff in New South Wales, whether it's taking advantage of the FIT program in the UK, the demand and the desire for self consumption in Continental Europe, all of this requires the coupling of solar generation -- to solar generation with storage. And because our solution is so simple, so cost effective and modular that can fit exactly the right place at the right time as we talk about the demand is just really stunning. And the demand coming for new systems we build as well as the desire to retrofit existing solar solutions with solar. That's very true in a lot of the regions we are in.  In those areas we could very well be retrofitting or our partners could be retrofitting a solar system that's not Enphase with an Enphase storage solution. In fact we expect to see quite a bit of that. Obviously new installs will likely be a total Enphase solution but there are plenty of installs out there that don’t use Enphase that could benefit storage and because we are not coupled to the solar we can augment those solutions. You asked about the Enphase microinverter with other batteries, the fact is that we have a great battery partner but we are chemistry agnostic. There is no -- we don’t have to be with a particular chemistry. There are going to be multiple chemistries out there, some are going to be outstanding. There is going to be -- I think it's going to be a very contested space. I think we should see significant cost reductions, price reductions overtime. We want to stay nimble and loose. So while we have an outstanding partner right now that we are very excited to launch with, we are very much agnostic to the battery itself.
Unidentified Analyst: Great. Also on cost reduction, do you have a timeline on that end goal of being able to beat those traditional string inverters or at least be competitive with them and beat the DC optimizer based systems?
Paul Nahi: We are going to be providing a lot more data and a lot more specifics in the upcoming months.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay, great. Thank you.
Paul Nahi: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Robert Sanders with Jet Equity Partners.
Unidentified Analyst: Hi guys. Thanks for taking my call.
Paul Nahi: Sure.
Unidentified Analyst: Just to follow on, on the last question about the cost reductions and the coming announcement. I had in my notes that the Gen 5, the bidirectional inverter should be coming to market some time second half '15, is it fair to assume that those cost reduction conversations will come alongside the launch of the Gen 5 product?
Paul Nahi: Not necessarily along the launch of the Gen 5 but leveraging the Gen 5 platform to get to those costs, absolutely.
Unidentified Analyst: And anything you can tell us about the early customer trials of that Gen 5 and how it's going and maybe the progress and timeline for the launch this year?
Paul Nahi: We are very much on track. The testing certification is going extremely well. We plan to launch in the second half of this year and we are right on track to do that. I think it represents a huge leap in technology for Enphase. And as you noted its bi-directionality is what allows for the creation of an AC battery storage solution. But in addition to that it has all of the advanced grid functions that we haven’t had in the past that now allow us to enter markets like Italy and Germany and a whole host of new markets as well. So we are obviously very excited about it and it's right on track.
Unidentified Analyst: Thanks so much guys.
Paul Nahi: Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Morosi with Avondale Partners.
Paul Nahi: Michael?
Michael Morosi: Yes, yes, thanks for taking my follow on. In the quarter, Kris called out a working capital drag and it looks like there is a lot of cash tied up in inventory quarter-over-quarter, I wondered if you guys can just provide a little more detail around the nature of that, I know you specified to online letter in the back half but pretty more color there would be appreciated?
Kris Sennesael: Yes, so I have talked about that during the last call that as a result of the port issues we ended up with slightly higher than expected inventory levels in the first quarter. We have started to work inventory levels down in the second quarter but only little bit of a reduction it was less than $1 million. And so we expect to continue to do that in the second half and see further drastic reductions there on the inventory levels in the second half. The other reason of course was the increase in the accounts receivable which was actually a bigger impact on the increased working capital requirements there. But there as well given the seasonality of our business, we expect to drive down accounts receivable in the second half of the year. And as a result of that, generate positive free cash flows and repay all the outstanding amounts under the working capital facility.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Peter Geis [ph].
Unidentified Analyst: I missed the first part of the call. Maybe you addressed this earlier. But why was the patent infringement lawsuit drop versus Enbridge?
Peter Nahi: I didn’t catch that question.
Unidentified Analyst: You may have addressed this earlier, why was the patent lawsuits drop versus Enbridge?
Peter Nahi: I don’t know where Enbridge is, so I think you may have the -- you made the wrong company.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay.
Operator: At this time, I am showing no further questions. I would like to turn the call back over to Paul Nahi for closing remarks.

Paul Nahi: Good afternoon, and thanks for joining us today to discuss our First Quarter 2015 Financial Results. As usual I'll start with my opening remarks and touch on some key highlights and this Kris will take us through the first quarter financials and the outlook for the second quarter. After that we'll open up the call for Q&A. After our groundbreaking year in 2014 we started 2015 with solid performance and continue to experience strong business momentum with all our customers in the domestic, residential, and commercial markets as well as international markets. During the first quarter we shipped 162 megawatts of microinverter systems, an increase of 74% year-over-year. We reported revenue of $86.7 million for the first quarter of 2015 an increase of 50% year-over-year and non-GAAP gross margin of 32.6% despite the fact that we lost approximately $1 million in revenue and one full percentage point of margin due to unfavorable foreign exchange fluctuations. Enphase continues to be the leading choice for residential and small commercial installers in the US and a growing number of installers in our international markets. In fact Enphase in installed in more than 90 countries worldwide. Since inception we've now shipped more than 8 million microinverters representing more than 2 gigawatts of installed generating capacity. Enphase Systems have reduced over 3 terawatt hours of clean energy. The demand for solar in the US remains very robust, according to GPM Research 2015 is expected to be another year of significant growth in the US with a forecast of 1.8 gigawatts of residential PV up approximately 50% year-over-year and a forecast of 1.5 gigawatts of commercial PV up 40% year-over-year. In addition outside the US solar continues to take a bigger share of the energy market and continues to grow. According to IHS Research the global solar including all residential, commercial and utility scale PV installation is expected to be 56.5 gigawatts in 2015 up 30% year-over-year. Our continued success in the US and global markets is a result of several factors, one of which is the unique value proposition of our microinverter systems. Our proposition benefits the entire eco system. We address the system owner by providing a lower levelized cost of energy and therefore a better return on investments and their ease of design installation and management helps our installers to create a more efficient and profitable business. By providing better economics to all our customers, we've been able to see a dramatic rise in revenue and market share over the past several years. Our value proposition is predicated on quality and reliability. The quality and reliability in every component we select, every product we manufacture and every system we monitor. Our system offers high performance, safety, reliability, simplicity and intelligence. In addition, our distributed networked architecture will make mainstream access to clean affordable energy a reality. Last year, we discussed our commitment to local job communities and job reservation through our American size microinverters, which were assembled in America. We're pleased to our recently partnered with PetersenDean Roofing & Solar, the largest privately held the roofing and solar company in the U.S. to provide products assembles in America. Under the agreement Enphase will supply American size microinverters for deployment in PetersenDean residential and commercial installations. The partnership brings together two leaders in the fast growing U.S. residential and commercial solar market, who share a strong commitment to American technology, domestic job creation and the emerging clean energy economy. We began shipping our C250 microinverter systems to commercial solar customers in the U.S. during the first quarter and seeing strong interest from both new and existing customers. This C250 system delivers optimal performance and enables installers to use less wiring and few our balance of system components thus significantly reducing labor and overall installation costs. The C250 launch was accomplished by the growth of our Enphase Energy services business, which provides system owners, operators and installers with scalable asset management and O&M services. We've recently increased geographic coverage adding service teams in the Northeast region of the U.S. along with Arizona and Florida. Turning to our international business, revenue was up 52% year-over-year. In the U.K. we extended our distribution channel and grew our business with residential and commercial installer, including Pretty Green Energy. We're working with Pretty Green Energy, a leading installer of PV systems to offer high end solutions in the residential and small to medium commercial PV market. Relationships such as this are critical to ensuring that customers have access to the unsurpassed value and quality both company is offered. In continental Europe, we've recently enhanced our local sales operations and added resources in the Netherland to provide leading edge services and support to our expanding base of Dutch customers. Also in Europe we continue to build our customer base and we're working with partners such as MyLight Systems a company in the solar self-consumption space based at France, good partnership focused on advanced energy management will integrate the Enphase envoy, the intelligent networking half of the Enphase system into MyLight monitoring systems bringing installers a new level of energy management integration for residential and commercial buildings. In the APAC region, we've been pleased with our progress in Australia and New Zealand where first quarter revenue increase was over the 300% year-over-year. During the quarter, I visited with several customers in Australia and New Zealand and came away with confident that we are poised for continued success in these markets. Our market share continues to increase and the Enphase brand is becoming more well-known and respected in the market we've entered. As an example, we formed the partnership with EnergyAustralia, one of the country's leading utility to provide microinverter systems to Australian customers. This is a big win for APAC operation because it is not only the first strategic partnership with an Australian utility but also offers Enphase access to approximately 10% of the Australian market. As we discussed last quarter, Enphase took big steps forward in our evolution from microinverter Systems Company to an energy technology company with the announcements of our distributed network energy management system. This system will not only be able to generate, store and manage energy, it will also collect and utilize valuable grid level data, this data will provide impressive inside into the grid and will help us work for the utility to strengthening it. An Enphase system provides the best return on investment for the owner and the most of for corporate grid operators. A great example of this is a recent work in Hawaii were our data, software and grid edge analytics saved Hawaiian electric company tens of millions of dollars by improving the stability of the grid. As a service provider, we worked with Hawaiian Electric, to clean the backlog of solar customers awaiting inter connection on the island of Oahu. We're very proud with part of Hawaiian Electric’s pioneering work in developing the blueprint for the next generation electrical grid and the mass adoption of solar. This is just the beginning of our exciting collaboration with utilities and it demonstrates how utilities and innovative solar technology companies such as Enphase can work together to the benefit of rate payers while making the large sale grid integration of solar a reality. As the density of solar grows in any particular utility area, the necessity to work well with the grid and take comply with the other increasing complexity as grid requirement will becoming increasingly critical. We were honest to be recently named as to Greentech Media is Grid Edge 20 for the second consecutive year as one of the most innovative companies work into architect, the electric power industries future. Awardees were selected based on the contribution to Grid Edge technology, which has increasingly important at of time when utility business models are [indiscernible] and more distributed energy resources are coming online. As solar energy continues to thrive storage will become an increasingly important part of the total solution and it's important to note that storage must be accompanies with an energy management system to control the charging and discharging of the battery while taking into account energy generation and usage. In discussions with customers all over the world the Enphase AC battery is being extremely well received and we are well over subscribe for our initial system tests to begin later this year. We are increasingly confident that our AC battery with its modular architecture and seamless integration into Enlighten, our energy management system will unique in its simplicity, ease of installation performance and cost effectiveness. I'll close my comments by noting 2015 is off to a great start for Enphase. We're encouraged by the positive industry outlook and are excited about the many opportunities ahead. We are as committed as ever to enhancing our core products and services and moving forward with bold initiatives that will trend the face of energy production storage and management. Now I'll turn it over to Kris for his review of our financial results.
Kris Sennesael: Thank you, Paul. I will provide some more details related to our financial results for the first quarter of 2015 and then I'll provide the business outlook for the second quarter of 2015. As a reminder the financial measure that I'm going to provide or on a non-GAAP basis unless otherwise noted. Total revenue for the first quarter of 2015 was $86.7 million an increase of 50% compared to first quarter of 2014. The large year-over-year growth was driven by overall strong demand Enphase energy microinverter systems in our core U.S. residential and commercial markets as well as further market share gains in the international markets. We have been able to grow our top line by an impressive 50% year-over-year despite the reduction in customer concentration. A year ago in the first quarter of 2014 our largest customer accounted for 22% of our total revenue and in the first quarter of 2015 this was reduced to 17% of our total revenue. This speaks to the strength of our business not only with our largest customer but even more so with many other large, medium and small customer in the residential and commercial solid markets. On a sequential basis [indiscernible] down 18% from the fourth quarter 2014 which is better than the 20% to 25% seasonally decline that we have historically experienced during the first quarter of each year despite the fact that there were some harsh winter conditions this year with a lot of snow especially in the North Eastern United States. We shipped 162 megawatts AC or approximately 186 megawatt DC during the first quarter of 2015, an increase of 74% on a year-over-year basis. The 162 megawatt shift represented approximately 719,000 micro inverter of which substantially all were our fourth generation micro inventor systems. The Enphase M250 represented approximately 30% of all unit shipped. Gross margin for the first quarter of 2015 was 32.6% despite the fact that we lost approximately one full percentage point of margin compared to the fourth quarter of 2014 as a result weaker euro, British pound and Australian dollar. Our engineering and operations teams continue to execute very well on our cost reduction roadmap and we incurred less than expected freight and expedite cost. Inverter pricing came in as expected. Revenue from accessories during the first quarter of 2015 was soft resulting in a decrease of our total revenue per watt but this was offset by a similar decrease in total cost per watt. Operating expenses during the first quarter of 2015 were $30.7 million approximately flat when compared to the fourth quarter of 2014 despite the fact that we continue to make major investments in research and development not only to support the development and further cost reductions of our microinverter systems but also to make significant investments in the development of our AC battery storage technology, energy management system and grid edge analytics. R&D expenses were $12.3 million, sales and marketing expenses were $11.1 million and G&A expenses were $7.3 million. Total non-GAAP operating expenses excluded $2.8 million of which $2.7 million are stock based compensation expenses.  We reported a non-GAAP operating loss of $2.5 million in the first quarter of 2015 compared to non-GAAP operating loss of $3.8 million in the first quarter of 2014. On a GAAP basis the operating loss for the first quarter of 2015 was $5.5 million compared to a GAAP loss of $5.8 million in the first quarter of 2014. For the first quarter of 2015 the non-GAAP net loss was $3.2 million or a net loss of $0.07 per share compared to a non-GAAP net loss of $4.1 million or a net loss of $0.10 per share in the first quarter of 2014, on a GAAP basis the net loss was $6.3 million or a net loss of $0.14 per share compared to a GAAP net loss of $6.2 million or a net loss of $0.15 per share in the first quarter of 2014. Turning to the balance sheet, cash flow from operations during the first quarter of 2015 was a negative $11.5 million; cash flow was impacted by 2014 bonus payments during the first quarter of 2015. Inventory increased to $34.7 million as the labor dispute in the Port of Oakland was resolved quicker than expected resulting in a temporary increase of our inventory levels. Capital expenditures were $3.6 million and depreciation and amortization was $2.5 million. We exited the first quarter with a total cash balance of $27.1 million and continue to have access to our working capital facility of up to $50 million. At the end of the quarter the facility remained undrawn and the company remains debt free. Now let's discuss our outlook for the second quarter of 2015. We expect revenue for the second quarter of 2015 to be within a range of $100 million to $105 million. We expect gross margin to be within a range of 30% to 32%. As foreign exchange rates continue to deteriorate we have included in this outlook a negative impact on revenue of approximately $2.5 million to $3 million and a negative impact on gross margin of approximately 2 percentage points. We also expect non-GAAP operating expenses for the second quarter of 2015 to be flat to up 2% compared to the first quarter of 2015. And now I will open the line for questions.
Operator: Thank you sir, [Operator Instructions] our first question comes from Krishna Shankar of Bank of America, your question please.
Krishna Shankar: Two quick ones, Paul or Kris. First one, how do you see some of your smaller customers who have a much higher cost structure position themselves for the post ITC world, what do you think the implications are for them for a high [AFC] product because post ITC the attention is going to turn to cost. And I had a follow up after that.
Paul Nahi: True, so I would say our smaller customers today are focused on cost, I don't think a whole lot's going to change post ITC, the advantage that some of our smaller customers have is that they have an intimate relationship with their customers, they have an ability to sell the value proposition. It's interesting when you look at the bifurcation of our customer base it is actually the smaller customers that are asking us for more and more features, more and more functions and more and more things that they can sell to their customers. So I think actually the post ITC world from a pricing sensitivity standpoint is going to look the same as it is now with a deep focus on making sure that we continue to reduce our prices but I think the smaller customers are going to be able to leverage their relationships with their local customers and provide more and more services and more and more features.
Krishna Shankar: Got it, and then as a quick follow up you guys introduced your storage technology last October at SPI. You didn't disclose the cost of kilowatt hour, I'm just kind of curious, do you have any updated thoughts around it, is there any number you can give or if you cannot disclose this how do think the battery system compares to what some of your competitors have announced of late?
Paul Nahi: So, the, you're absolutely right, we announced our storage solution back in October, it was very well received and has since been increasingly more enthusiastically received. We have a very modular approach, one kilowatt hour systems, they're very simple to install, you basically take -- one person to hang them up on the wall and just plug it in. It seamlessly integrates and automatically integrates into the Enlightened Energy Management system. So because of all that we feel that the installation -- the ease of installation, the cost of installation is going to be much less than with some potentially competing solutions. In addition to that as we look at the total system cost we are very-very comfortable that we'll be extremely cost competitive with what's out there.
Operator: Thank you, our next question comes from Colin Rusch of Northland Capital, please go ahead.
Colin Rusch: Can we just get a little more detail in terms of the accessory sales? What I'd like to really be able to back into is, your cost on a per watt basis and it looks like the cost program has actually been more aggressive than we might have expected in going from late last year into this year so just give us a little bit more color on those accessories so I could start to triangulate those numbers.
Kris Sennesael: Yes, Colin this is Kris here so, in the past we have not disclosed or given a breakdown of our revenue between inverters and accessories and we are not planning on doing that going forward either, but we have seen some big fluctuations quarter-to-quarter, just to give you a range of fluctuation you have from, on the low end 17% revenue towards the high end more like 25% of revenue. So we definitely have seen some fluctuations there quarter-to-quarter part of that is seasonal as well. Q1 2015 was definitely a soft quarter in terms of accessory revenue and as a result that you see a substantial drop in the revenue per watt having said that pricing of inverters as I mentioned before pricing of inventor is our normal trends that we have disclosed before of approximately 10% on a year-over-year basis.
Colin Rusch: And then just can you just give us the currency assumptions that you're working with for the second quarter guide? Just so we have a sense of how that might trend through quarters the currencies most. 
Kris Sennesael: Foreign exchange is definitely something that we watch very closely and there has been hefty fluctuation starting beginning of the year. But it was much worse in March and April. We have based our forecast on euro exchange rate of approximately 1.10; currently we're trading a little bit better there, so that is good news. But of course we have to see how that all plays out for the rest of the quarter.
Colin Rusch: And then just quick question on the inventory. How long do you think it will take you to clear of that and then get back to a more normalize level? Is that something that just a matter of weeks or is it going to take quarter or two to kind of work all that through the system.
Kris Sennesael: We target to finish that by the end of the second quarter there might still be a little bit of spill over there into the third quarter. But most of it will be clear by the end of the second quarter.
Operator: Our next question comes from Edwin Mok of Needham & Company. Your question please.
Edwin Mok: First actually a housekeeping can you have any other [10%] customer view on the last one?
Paul Nahi: I'm sorry can you repeat that.
Edwin Mok: Did you have any other 10% customer beyond the first and the largest customer?
Paul Nahi: So we do and interestingly enough the other large customers are all distributors. So in fact you could look at those customers as proxy for the thousands of small, medium and large installers that we currently support. 
Edwin Mok: Actually that’s good point there. And then in terms of this impact of the port strike that we saw last quarter. Does that cost rechanneling is going to go up a little bit also in the quarter. Can you get some color on that?
Kris Sennesael: The port issues was definitely a big issues and just to put out in little bit perspective as we know we ship our product from Flextronics in China to the port in Oakland and normal transportation time before the labor issues was approximately 30 days, that’s stretched out all the way up till almost 90 days. So that was definitely causing some balancing act there to manage our inventory levels. The issues got resolved late February as a result of that 10,000 of microinverter that was floating around on board go off loaded and become part of our inventory and so that resulted in spite of the inventory levels as reported at the end of Q1 and as I’ve stated before we expect to bleed that off towards the end of the second quarter.
Edwin Mok: I see so no impact on general -- thanks for the color on the international market, looks like you guys are doing really well especially in Australia. Can you give us some idea about your percentage of revenue coming from those markets right now I was little surprised frankly kind of the magnitude to FX impact, because I thought international is only been 10% or 15% of U.S. sales. So maybe give us some color and how do we kind of think about that because it seems like it’s growing faster in the company. If that’s got the growth driver, but impact by FX it might be [indiscernible].
Kris Sennesael: Our mix between U.S revenue and outside of the U.S our international revenue has not really changed, it's still 85 to 15 split or 85 in the U.S 15% outside of the U.S. Despite the fact that our international revenue is growing extremely fast in Q1 we had 52% year-over-year growth. But obviously our U.S. business continues to grow also extremely fast and so it's difficult for now to outpace the revenue that we see in U.S.
Edwin Mok : Last question on I'll let other guys to ask. Your commentary around PetersenDean and your partnership with them right kind of led me to think that maybe on this some of these non- traditional solar installers could be a growth area for you guys. How do you kind of think about those customers? Is it an area that you believe is will allow you to drive more growth in U.S is there any way that you think you can target more? That’s all I have, thank you. 
Kris Sennesael: Our current customer base really ranges from the largest Tier 1 all the way to the smallest installers. It is true that the environment is very volatile right now, they're lot of new entrance and I think they've been lot more new entrance in the upcoming years. Some of these are going to be may be specialty in solar; some of them may be more generalist. What is very clear is that the ability with an Enphase system to a very quickly get up and running to be able to simplify they're backend office logistic, the simplicity of the design, the simplicity of the installation, the simplicity of O&M does enable a lot more people to get into solar and then they could have before and that is a unique characteristic of microinverter. So certainly we're going to do our best to attract to those customers as well. But I would view that as one part of our much broader initiative to continue our market share growth in the U.S. residential market.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is come from Philip Shen of ROTH Capital Partners. Your question please
Philip Shen: First one is on pricing. I think, I heard you mentioned that pricing outlook has not changed and you still expect 10%, can you extend on that and talk about the current competitive dynamics in the market place potentially and provide some additional color what you're seeing out there?
Paul Nahi: So the competitive environment today it doesn't look very much different than it did last year, the year before. Our competition is primarily [string] inverters with or without DC optimizers and we continue to increase our market share against the [string] inverters; again because of the value proposition of a microinverter, as Kris has mentioned, we've been on it fairly consistent price reduction path year-on-year for pricing time now, it's a bit variable but I’d say that we're pretty much on that same path as we look forward to 2015 and even 2016. There is a result of where we are in the technology curve on microinverter, there is tremendous amount of room in front of us for further cost reduction, we're actively engaged in that, that's helping us to reduce our prices very aggressively, while maintaining very healthy gross margins. And in addition to that we're adding new features, new functions that are unique and [generic] to microinverter that will also help us I think on the pricing side. So we have -- there is a lot of work going on both in the area of cost reduction and future enhancement to help support the current and the future pricing expectations that we have.
Philip Shen: And then shifting here to your, Kris, I know you mentioned international outlook or the international mix of sales is about 15%. I was wondering if you can comment on the full year 2015, so what do you expect the mix of international sales to be as well as commercial sales.
Kris Sennesael: So as you pointed out the breakdown between U.S. and international is 85:15, the breakdown between residential and commercial is also 85:15. We of course continue to grow our business in the U.S. residential market which is 75% of our business. We see a tremendous amount of growth of the total available market and we continue to defend, grow ourselves in that market and that is fueling a lot of the overall growth. In addition to that of course we have a strong focus on growing internationally; U.K. and Australia and many other markets from Canada, Mexico to other continental European countries and other countries and APAC region. As a result of that we do expect our international revenue to grow faster than the U.S. revenue and so we will probably move more towards an 80:20 towards the end of this year from that perspective. And then if I look beyond that 2016 and 2017 of course we will continue to look at entering into new countries and there is a lot of action going on within the company to prepare for that. Similar on the commercial side, as you know, we have launched our dedicated commercial product the C250 that has 480V, three-phase, 60 cell and 72 cell. So now we have a dedicated product to go and attack the commercial markets, that product is very well received in the market. It's a little bit of longer sale cycle. But as I said, the product is very well -- we expect that as well to grow towards the end of the year closed to 80:20 relationship rising commercial than currently 85:15.
Philip Shen: Great. So, it sounds like direct 85:15 split today, but as you transition through the year or quarter by quarter your end, potentially end up in Q4 at that 80:20 split?
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Vishal Shah of Deutsche Bank. Your question please.
Vishal Shah: May be Paul, can you talk about, you are assuming the largest customer, I believe there has been of transition -- that customer from maybe one supply to two, I mean that's been a busy headwind in your sales. Do you expect that headwind to continue or you going to think that your market share that customers stabilized in the near term?
Paul Nahi: So we've been talking of this for well over a year now. They’ve indicated that they were go to move very likely to beyond two vendors or more than that that is on track. It's very hard for me to comment on what's going to happen in the future, we need to talk about one large customer. But I can say is that despite the fact that our percentage share in that customer has decreased the actual revenue dollar has increased, but the revenue dollar outside of that customers has increased even faster. It's very easy to forget that there are many worldwide customers that we have not yet selling to. As Kris just noted we have far more markets in front of us than we're currently selling in. So while we are -- and we treat every customer very, very importantly and we recognized how the importance of our larger customers at the same time we also are very focused on growing our presence not just in the U.S residential market but the U.S commercial market which is a very fragmented market and in international market as well. So all of the number that we’re giving for Q2 take into account the fact that we're assuming that there is going to be more and more vendors in our top customer.
Vishal Shah: And just one of the question on the margin. As we think about the rest of the year second half do you expect your margin to stabilize to these levels or how should we think about the product mix, particularly the fourth gen product impacting margins and where you think margins can go from here?
Paul Nahi: So what we've said is that we have a financial strategy of balanced profitable growth which means we're to push the top line as far as we can while increasing profitability year-on-year. We've been doing that for many years consistently we're going to continue to do that. Our target gross margin of 35% to 40% remains our target gross margin and we are more confident than ever that we can achieve that; however that is not our focus right now. We said that gross margin are going bounce around in the low 30 and we very comfortable with it, we're not trying to optimize the gross margin number right now. What we are very focused on is that the continued development of new technologies is increasing the features and functions of the energy system which includes the microinverter cell, storage, energy management providing an aggressive cost reduction roadmap to our customers and doing all of this while increasing the profitability. Remember that our R&D expenses include a lot of new product that we're not shipping. As Kris had mentioned things like our AC battery solution, things like Grid Edge analytics, our energy management, even some services that are part of the Enphase Energy services offering, our under development that we're not shipping and we're able to invest in this and increase in profitability because of the growth in revenue and because of the healthy gross margins. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Michael Morosi of Avondale Partners. Your question please.
Michael Morosi: Obviously there is some pretty big news recently as it relates to the store’s opportunity in the industry and I just like to see if you guys can walk us through on how you're thinking about Enphase within the storage market and how the microinverter technology stacks up against other technologies yield in the resource context.
Paul Nahi: We certainly share other company's optimistic view on the global storage market. In fact would be accurate to say that as per our growth storage will become an essential part of the total energy mix. We have often said that in the future we will not be selling sold systems, we'll be selling energy system which will consist of generation, storage and energy management all wrapped into one package. Having said that it's clears that storage needs to be important part of the mix and it is because of our fifth generation microinverter that is uniquely capable of bidirectional power flow that we’re able to create the AC battery solution. This is a solution that’s around 40 pound you literally hang it on a wall very much like a picture frame, you plug it in and both the chemistry the battery itself as well as the invertors all in that box. There is no additional material that’s needed. So you hang it on the wall, you plug it in and because it's our communication system Enlighten will automatically see it, automatically configure it and come up with a charging and discharging profile for it. That simplicity of installation and simplicity of design we think is extremely unique and it's going to be extremely valuable. But having said that they're going to be a multiple solutions out there and we welcome all of it, we believe firmly that the storage market is a tens of billions of dollar market in the making and there certainly is going to be more than one competitor. But the enthusiastic response that we have receive from customers all over the world has really given up a great deal of confidence that we are on the right track. In fact if you look at the market that we are currently in let's say Australia specifically, the demand for storage there is robust and it's driven by a very clear economic model. Our current presence in Australia is going to give us a tremendous launching platform for the AC Battery solution as well as other countries included.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Paul Coster of JPMorgan, your question please.
Paul Coster: Thank you for taking my questions, it's probably a pretty naïve one since this is my first around but clearly your nearest competitor with the DC Optimizers solution has claimed a very significant cost advantage and I'm just wondering if the improvements that you have in mind, of course the year -- next year or so close the gap materially. Do you even accept that the gap is as wide as they say and -- let's leave it at that for now? But there's sort of a second question really is, is it -- are you tempted to lower your gross margins a bit to recapture some market share? 
Paul Nahi : To address the first part of the question, it's not at all clear to me that they have a cost advantage today. I do not have any data to support that today, but that I do have doesn’t support it. What's interesting is that if you look at our cost reduction roadmap going forward, it is extremely aggressive; it addresses every part of the system. As I said earlier in the call we're still in the very early days of technology development for a microinverter, there's a lot of work in front of us in terms of semiconductor development, semiconductor integration, system levels design, cabling, mechanical engineering and we are investing heavily in all of these areas. The decision that we have to make is where do we apply our R&D dollars. I could certainly apply all of them on cost reduction and get there sooner rather than later but at the same time we are looking at some very new and exciting markets. Japan, is one of them. We said many times that we're very excited about the potential for Enphase to enter Japan and we are right now going through the certification process. We're looking at as we talked about already at length the AC Battery solution, the energy management system. So we're balancing our development dollars between ongoing cost reduction coupled with feature enhancement and we believe that that balance that we've struck between the two will allow us to maintain or increase our cost competitiveness against string inverter and continue to increase the features and functions that we believe consumers all over the world are going to be demanding.
Paul Coster: Does the [inspection] of fifth generation products actually reduce the cost significantly or is it all part of a smooth curve here?
Paul Nahi : What we have seen in the past and what we don't guide specifically to cost in the future, but I can tell you what we did in the past, is that when we introduced a next generation product we generally see a cost reduction but it, maybe marginal, and then that gives us a new platform with which to apply a lot of cost reduction activities, to continue to get that cost down. We've seen that four generations in a row and I don't see any reasons why that would stop.
Paul Coster: Okay, thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you, [Operator Instructions]. As there are no further questions in the queue I'd like to turn the call over to Paul Nahi for any closing remarks, sir.
Paul Nahi : Thank you. I'd like to close by acknowledging our recognition as one the 2015 best places to work in the San Francisco Bay area by the San Francisco Business Times and the Silicon Valley Business Journal. We’ve always been proud of our corporate culture of creativity, collaboration and technology innovation and believe our employees are truly best in class. I want to thank our entire Enphase team for their continued hard work, passion and dedication. We look forward to speaking with you again next quarter.
Operator: Thank you Mr. Nahi and thank you ladies and gentlemen for your participation that does conclude Enphase Energy's First Quarter 2015 Financial Results Conference Call. You may disconnect your lines at this time, have a great day.

Paul Nahi: Good afternoon and thanks for joining us today to discuss our fourth quarter and year ended 2014 financial results. We closed 2014 on a high note with an exceptional fourth quarter. We reported record financial results including revenue of $105.2 million an increase of 57% year-over-year. We also reported record non-GAAP gross margins of 33.5%. The combination of accelerated top-line growth and further gross margin expansion resulted in another quarter of positive operating income and net income along with non-GAAP diluted earnings of $0.07 per share. For the full year of 2014 we reported record revenue of $343.9 million up 48% over 2013. Non-GAAP gross margin was a record 33.1% and we recorded our first full year of non-GAAP profitability with non-GAAP net income of $2.7 million or $0.06 per share. Kris will review the fine points regarding our fourth quarter and 2014 financials, but I will say that I'm extremely pleased with our financial results. The revenue growth of almost 50% year-over-year was driven by strong demand in the U.S. residential and small commercial markets where Enphase is the leading inverter company, as well as market share gains in the UK and Australia. And Enphase has made great strides in positioning itself as a leading energy solutions company. In the U.S. market fourth quarter revenue was up 57% year-over-year as we continue to experience significant demand for our microinverter systems from both current and new customers. During 2014 we continued to increase our U.S. residential and small commercial market share which we estimated to be in the low-to-mid 40% range based on megawatts shipped and substantially higher based on revenue. We've been growing our business with our key customers and further diversifying our customer base with the addition of multiple large, medium and small accounts. We're currently selling into the seven out of the top-10 Tier 1 installers in the U.S. residential market. In addition, our market share is increasing with the Tier 2 installers as well as with the thousands of smaller installers across the country. We're also engaging with new entrants attracted to the fast growing U.S. market. As we continue to drive revenue from new go-to-market channels, including the new home builder segment, roofers, HVAC installers and new alternative financing providers. On the international front, we've made great progress in executing on a diversification and growth strategy as our fourth quarter revenue was up 59% year-over-year, primarily due to strong performance in the UK and Australia. In the UK, fourth quarter revenue increased $87% year-over-year as we continue to expand our distribution channel and grow our business with several major residential installers. We've also been very pleased with our progress in Australia and New Zealand we posted strong fourth approval with revenue up 25% sequentially At the beginning of 2014 we announced the expansion of our business in the Australian residential and commercial solar market. The local team executed extremely well and our market share has grown to an estimated 6%. We're excited about the growth prospects in this region and are targeting double-digit market share by the end of 2015. In addition, we continue to work on further geographic expansion within the APAC region. From an end market point of view, we're very pleased with our residential business which accounted for approximately 85% of revenue in 2014 and with the continued progress in our commercial business. We recently began shipping our C250 Microinverter Systems to commercial solar customers in the U.S. The C250 delivers on Enphase's successful track record of leading the microinverter market with unique and innovative systems that provide clear economic benefits for our customers including a better ROI and lower levelized [ph] cost of energy. The system offers both the technology as well as the O&M services capable of taking a commercial scale system from concept through implementation for long-term O&M. Now that we've started shipping the new system as part of Enphase's comprehensive commercial offering, we're seeing strong interest from both new and existing customers. Looking back, 2014 was a year of unparalleled technology innovation for Enphase as we took big steps forward in our evolution from a microinverter systems company to an energy technology company. During the year, we announced some groundbreaking and exciting new products and services including our distributed network, Enphase energy management system. This energy management system is built upon our fifth generation microinverter with groundbreaking new features including research including bidirectional power flow that enabled the development of our revolutionary AC Battery storage solution. The new system also includes improved Envoy-S Gateway with increased network, metering and control functionalities and new energy management capabilities through the Enphase Enlighten software platform. Also during 2014 we demonstrated that our high technology business model with outsourced manufacturing scaled very well. Our world-class operations team in close cooperation with our manufacturing partner Flextronics increased production volume of our microinverters from approximately 400,000 units per quarter in the fourth quarter of 2013 to over 1 million units in the fourth quarter of 2014. We are continuing to set ever increasing standards for quality and reliability. As a result of our technology innovation, Enphase is very well positioned to become a leading global energy technology company in the residential, commercial, utility scale and micro grid markets. In addition, all of our new products and features will be supported by Enphase’s world-class operations and maintenance services team. Enphase is leading the efforts to streamline solar PV asset management and O&M services while preparing for the broader based maintenance and productivity services requirements of future energy management systems. We recently announced a strategy initiative to accelerate the expansion of our Enphase energy services or EES program. With over 450 megawatts under management EES works with system owners, operators and installers to protect their solar investments with a scalable asset management and O&M offering. As part of this strategy initiative, we acquired the assets of Next Phase Solar, a leading provider of O&M services for the U.S. solar PV industry. Next Phase Solar offers comprehensive solar O&M and asset management services to owners, equipment manufacturers, financiers, installers and EPC contractors. This acquisition strengthens our existing capability to proactively operate and maintain residential, commercial and utility scale PV power plants within the U.S. regardless of manufacturer or brand. We'll also continue to leverage our data management cloud-based system Enlighten and are partnering with utilities to help strengthen and enhance good quality. As an example, we partnered with Hawaiian Electric to successfully upgrade the operating behavior of approximately 800,000 of our smart software defined microinverters and sold in Hawaii to better integrate the PV systems into Hawaii’s changing island grids. This unprecedented technological accomplishment came as a result of an ongoing collaboration between Enphase, Hawaiian Electric and other industry partners to find technical solutions for integrating high levels of PV in Hawaii at low costs to end customers. This collaboration provides a quantifiable example of how our distributed network’s technology with its robust bidirectional communications and software control can provide immense value and save rate payers millions of dollars in upgrade costs. By working closely with our utility partners like Hawaiian Electric, we are able to move the industry closer to achieving the full integration of solar on to the grid while illustration the broader smart grid capabilities that Enphase can provide. Our technology leadership was further validated when Frost & Sullivan recently awarded Enphase with its 2014 Global Award for technology leadership. Frost & Sullivan presents this award annually to the company that has demonstrated uniqueness in developing new technologies that raises the bar for product functionality and customer value. I will close my comments by acknowledging our outstanding results for the fourth quarter and full year 2014. We had a great year, marked with many milestones including record financial performance resulting in our first full year of profitability on a non-GAAP basis, many new customers and partners, global expansion, the announcement of our energy management systems, further leveraging of our data management cloud-based system, successful partnering for enhanced utility grid management and groundbreaking new product announcements. I'm very proud of what we accomplished which was made possible by the ongoing hard work and dedication of our entire Enphase team. Now, I’ll turn it over to Kris for his review of our financial results.
Kris Sennesael: Thank you, Paul. I will provide some more details related to our financial results and then I will provide our business outlook for the first quarter of 2015. As a reminder, the financial measures that I'm going to provide are on a non-GAAP basis unless otherwise noted. As Paul already indicated we finished 2014 with a very strong fourth quarter. Total revenue for the fourth quarter of 2014 was an all-time revenue record of $105.2 million, an increase of 57% compared to the fourth quarter of 2013. We exceeded our revenue outlook of $98 million to $103 million that we provided last quarter. The large year-over-year growth was driven by overall strong demand for Enphase energy microinverter systems in our core U.S. residential and small commercial markets as well as further market share gains in the international markets, especially in the UK and Australia. We shipped 180 megawatts AC or approximately 207 megawatts DC during the fourth quarter of 2014, an increase of 67% on a year-over-year basis. The 180 megawatt shipped represents approximately 799,000 microinverters of which 88% was our fourth generation microinverter system. The Enphase M250 represented approximately 28% of all units shipped. Gross margin for the fourth quarter of 2014 was 33.5%, an increase of 120 basis points compared to the fourth quarter of 2013. Our gross margin of 33.5% was better than expected and exceeded our outlook of 31% to 33% that we provided last quarter, mainly driven by a stronger product mix including more M250 microinverter systems. In addition, the engineering and operations teams continue to execute very well on our cost reduction roadmap and we incurred less than expected freight and expedite costs as our operations team successfully handled the labor dispute at the port of Auckland. Pricing during the fourth quarter came in as expected. Operating expenses during the fourth quarter of 2014 were $30.4 million compared to $28 million in the third quarter of 2014. Operating expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased from 32% in the fourth quarter of 2013 to 29% in the fourth quarter of 2014 demonstrating the leverage we have in our business model in line with our balanced profitable growth strategy. R&D expenses were $12.1 million, sales and marketing expenses were $11.1 million and G&A expenses were $7.2 million. The increase in operating expenses was driven by higher R&D expenses in support of multiple projects, including the development of our AC Battery storage technology and energy management system, the recently launched commercial microinverter system, our fifth generation microinverter system and several new and innovative next generation technology building blocks. We also made further improvements to our Gateway and communications technology and continue to drive and focus on cost reductions. The increase in sales and marketing expenses was mainly driven by geographic expansion and a build out of our commercial sales team. In addition, during the fourth quarter we have some increased marketing spend resulting from our participation at SPI the largest solar trade show in the U.S. Total non-GAAP operating expenses excluded $2.5 million in stock-based compensation expenses and $176,000 of acquisition related charges. We reported record non-GAAP operating income of $4.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2014 compared to $400,000 in the fourth quarter of 2013. On a GAAP basis operating income for the fourth quarter of 2014 was $2 million. For the fourth quarter of 2014 net income was $3.5 million resulting in earnings per diluted share of $0.07 compared to a net loss of $725,000 or a net loss of $0.02 per share in the fourth quarter of 2013. On a GAAP basis net income was $400,000 or $0.01 per diluted share compared to a GAAP net loss of $2.8 million or a net loss of $0.07 per share in the fourth quarter of 2013. The financial results for the fourth quarter of 2014 illustrate our balanced profitable gross strategy. Strong top-line growth of almost 60% year-over-year combined with gross margin improvement and operating expense leverage resulted in bottom line improvement from breakeven during the fourth quarter of 2013 to an approximately 5% operating margin in the fourth quarter of 2014. At the same time, we were able to continue to invest in the future of the company focusing on R&D investment, technology innovation and the global expansion of our sales and marketing team. Turning to the balance sheet, we continued to see strong cash generation. As a result of improved profitability and focus on working capital management cash flow from operations during the fourth quarter of 2014 was $8.9 million. Capital expenditures were $4.2 and depreciation and amortization was $2.3 million. Capital expenditures increased from historical levels, but remained below 4% of revenue. The increase was mainly due to an increase in equipment needed to support the growth in production volumes as well as some technology driven capital expenditures that were required for the development and manufacturing of our next generation technology. During the fourth quarter of 2014 we paid $5.8 million to extinguish our term loan. As a result of this the company is currently debt free. Also during the fourth quarter we acquired substantially all the assets of Next Phase Solar for an initial consideration of $2.5 million. We exited the fourth quarter with a total cash balance of $42 million and continue to have excess to our working capital facility of up to $50 million. At the end of the year, the facility remained undrawn. Let's wrap up by looking at some of our full year 2014 highlights. 2014 was a great and amazing year. We had very strong growth for Enphase. Revenue grew 48% year-over-year to a record level of $343.9 million. We shipped 575 mw AC or approximately 660 mw DC, a 62% year-over-year increase. Units sold in 2014 increased to 2.6 million, which is 1 million more than the number of units sold in 2013. Since inception, we have shipped more than 7.2 million units. Our full year gross margin was 33.1%, up 400 basis points year-over-year. Our ability to expand gross margin based on our balanced pricing action and continued focus on cost reductions through innovation in our semiconductor based product platform is a clear differentiator for Enphase. During 2013 we held the line on operating expenses with very minimal year-over-year growth. In 2014 we made some significant investments in R&D and sales and marketing to further support the growth of the company. For the full year operating expenses were $108 million representing a 31% increase over 2013. However, operating expenses as a percent of revenue came down from 35% in 2013 to 31% in 2014 demonstrating the leverage in our business model. The combination of strong top line growth, margin expansion and operating expense leverage resulted in our first profitable full-year on a non-GAAP basis. We reported record non-GAAP operating income of $5.9 million in 2014 compared to an operating loss of $14.7 million in the prior year. On a GAAP basis, the operating loss for 2014 was $4.4 million compared to an operating loss of $22.2 million in 2013. Non-GAAP net income in 2014 was a record $2.7 million or $0.06 per diluted share compared to a net loss of $18 million or a loss of $0.43 per share in 2014. Finally, turning to the cash flow, we realized significant improvements and generated $24.2 million in cash from operations in 2014 compared to a negative $900,000 in 2013. In summary, I'm very pleased with both our fourth quarter and full-year 2014 financial results. Our record top line growth, record gross margin and operating expense leverage resulted in record non-GAAP profitability and EPS expansion. Now let's discuss our outlook for the first quarter of 2015. In line with normal seasonality we expect revenue for the first quarter of 2015 to be within a range of $84 million to $88 million. We continue to see strong business momentum and year-over-year growth in all our segments and geographies. At the midpoint of the revenue outlook range revenue would be up 49% compared to the first quarter of 2014. We expect gross margin to be within a range of 31% to 33%. As previously indicated, we do expect the gross margin to fluctuate in the low to mid 30% range depending on several factors including the timing of pricing actions, timing of cost reductions, mixed shifts, fluctuations in expedite and freight charges and changes in foreign currency. During the past few months, the U.S. dollar strengthened versus the euro, British pound and Australian dollar. Although we only have 15% of our revenue in those foreign currencies, it is expected to have a negative impact on our overall gross margin of approximately one percentage point. We also expect non-GAAP operating expenses to be up 2% to 5% compared to the fourth quarter of 2014 as we to continue to invest in research and development and sales and marketing to support the development of innovative new products including the Enphase Energy Management System and AC Battery storage solution, while further expanding our fast growing Microinverter Systems business into new markets and geographies. As the fourth quarter was a strong finish to a great year, the first quarter of 2015 is expected to be a strong opener to another great year for Enphase Energy. All the markets that we sell in are fundamentally healthy and expected to show strong growth. U.S. residential market remains on fire and is predicted to experience strong year-over-year growth. We are excited about our global opportunities in a strong U.S. commercial market, especially with the introduction of our commercial system offering. We expect to gain market share in the international markets that we currently sell in, especially in the U.K. and Australia. We also expect our gross margins to fluctuate in the low-to-mid 30% range and we remain confident in our ability to achieve our gross margin long-term target of 35% to 40%. We will also continue to make major investments in R&D and sales and marketing, adding new and innovative technology building blocks in support of our segments and geographic expansion strategy, all on our way to become the leading energy technology company. Paul, the management team and myself are committed to drive our balanced profitable growth strategy in which we continue to growth the top line as hard as we can while driving bottom-line improvements. I'm excited about our opportunities in 2015 and I'm looking forward to it. Now, I will open the line for questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Colin Rusch of Northland Capital. Your line is now open.
Colin Rusch: Thanks guys. Can you just walk us through the guidance for 60% revenue growth year-over-year roughly or I should say unit growth in your expectations and I know you are not guiding for the full year, but you've talked historically around kind of 30% to 50% growth, how do you reconcile that, are you expecting a slowdown through the balance of the year or given the weather in the Northeast you're expecting some sort of acceleration in end market segments throughout the balance of the year?
Paul Nahi: Well, as Kris just mentioned Colin, we are expecting all the markets that we currently play in to continue to remain strong, clearly seasonality has an effect and it has a disproportionate effect in the Northeast, but nevertheless we're seeing strong growth in the U.S. residential market. That's to be obviously offset by the normal price declines that we've seen year-over-year, but good strong growth in the U.S. residential market, strong growth in the commercial market as well as in our international markets. So, I think that as we look forward into 2015, we feel very good about the year in the different markets and the different segments and that's especially true when you consider the move towards a total energy management solution with the advent of the AC Battery storage solution as well as the load management capability. So, I would say just in general, we remain bullish on the year in every segment and in every geography.
Colin Rusch: Great, and then if we just take a clear look at pricing quarter-over-quarter it looks like you're about flat on a megawatt basis or a per watt basis. Can you just talk a little bit about the value sale that you guys are seeing right now? I think there's a lot of concern around competition with relatively low gross margin starting to chip away at pricing, but you guys have done a better than expected job with holding up pricing over the last several years. Can you just talk about the sale dynamics and how you're negotiating pricing with your customers and nearly continuing to capture what looks like a very healthy planned competition?
Paul Nahi: Well, there clearly is a class of cheap inverters out there whether generally string inverters with or without DC optimizers that have traditionally put a lot of pricing pressure on the market. But the value proposition that Enphase brings to the table and that is specifically the fact that we can provide a better return on investment for the owner of a system and we can create a simpler more efficient business model for an installer by simplifying the design, the installation and the operations and maintenance of solar system, that value proposition continues to resonate. Now that doesn't mean that we don't need to be aggressive on pricing, we certainly do and we're working very closely with many of our customers to make sure that we're providing them a solution that enables them to thrive, that helps them be and stay competitive in their environment. But let's remember while we have a very keen eye on costs and making sure that we're providing them with a very cost-effective solution, we continuously add features and functions. As an energy technology company, we are very much in our sweet spot when we're developing and innovating new products. So whether it is, we just talked about the AC Battery storage solution, which is absolutely revolutionary in its concept and initial interest and demand is far exceeding our expectation, whether it's the advent of more energy management solutions, now for both the commercial as well as the residential space. We're continuously driving our business by looking at both costs and future enhancements and building a more holistic energy solution so that our customers, our installer partners have the best solution that they can sell.
Colin Rusch: And then one just final quick question. Can you just talk about the growth prospects for the service business? Obviously, you know, with a growing fleet of systems out there and their growing capabilities that looks to us like a relatively high end margin segment that could be exceeding the overall growth of the company, can you just walk us through that opportunity?
Paul Nahi: Sure. So it is accretive to gross margin. It is definitely a very well-run business and we're very excited about what that means for Enphase. Remember that we provide what we believe to be world class, best in class service to our customers, whether that's the end customer or whether those are our installer partners and we fully expect to continue upon that and build upon that reputation. And as we move into more of an energy system as opposed to a solar system the OEM requirements are going to do nothing but grow. Even if you look at the numbers today, if we are around 500,000 solar roofs in the U.S., residential roofs in the U.S. we're moving to a point in time where there will be millions of solar roofs in the U.S. alone. And we are building an infrastructure that can support that, that can provide the services our customers, both the end-user and our solar partners need and want and we want to do so in a very profitable manner and I think that's the path that we're on will allow us to do that.
Colin Rusch: Great, thanks so much guys.
Paul Nahi: Thanks Colin.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Edwin Mok of Needham & Company. Your line is now opened.
Edwin Mok: Great, thanks for taking my question. Congrats for the great quarter. So first question I have is maybe touch on the U.S. commercial side of the business. I guess two part question. First is, it seems like based on your commentary, U.S. commercial grew in a similar rate as the U.S. residential or your total U.S. revenue which grew like 50% this year. Am I correct on that, or is it still growing at lower rate than that? That's the first part and the second thing is, with the C250 now commercially available right? Can you give us some color in terms of upticks on that product and if you expect that product is not start conquering growth in this quarter?
Kris Sennesael: Sure. So the growth rate in the small commercial market, where we are the dominant inverter today with again somewhere in the low 40% market share range has grown at approximately the same rate as the residential market, give or take there are obviously fluctuations quarter-on-quarter, but we're definitely seeing some similar growth rates. The C250, very excitingly presents an opportunity for us to move into the large commercial market and the discussions that we've had with a lot of existing and new installers are really proving out the fact that we can provide a better LCOE, a better ROI for customers than the traditional string inverters, not to mention that we have a O&M package that makes the entire backend much simpler and we can take the entire solution from concept through installation through with the aid of Enlighten. The challenge in this market is that it is a fragmented market and the design cycles are longer than they are in the residential market. So the fact that it's a fragmented market is a good thing. It represented I think a very healthy business dynamic, but it does take a little bit longer to reach more installers and because the design cycles are longer that will naturally increase the amount of time between when we start some of the product and we start seeing meaningful revenue. So what we've said is that we are shipping today the C250. The reception has been outstanding. We expect to start seeing significant installs by the end of this year and then we expect to have the revenue to be very meaningful in 2015.
Edwin Mok: Okay, great and then I guess I'll have two questions to that and in terms of pricing on the ASP or blender ASP as well as gross margin, has that ramped, do you expect that to have some headwinds on your blender ASP, EPS versus your gross margin of your business?
Paul Nahi: Yeah, we've said before that the commercial product is at a slightly lower gross margin than the residential product, but again we have multiple cost reduction initiatives underway that are addressing that and when you look at the blended gross margin there's a lot to take into account there. And Kris enumerated many of these factors whether it's 4x whether it’s the product mix, whether it's freight and expedite charges, so clearly this - the gross margin on the commercial are today somewhat lower, but again we're working on that both on the cost level and as I said when you look at it inclusively, the aggregate gross margins our view doesn't change.
Edwin Mok: I see okay. I guess one more followup question on gross margin. You mentioned that M250 was 20% of unit shipment. Should we just ask forward a year or two for now that we expect that to be maturity or when do you expect that to become maturity
Kris Sennesael: No, there will be a continuously gradually move to the higher power M250 is not going to jump in the next couple of quarters. We've seen a slow move to that higher power microinverter. It all depends on the availability of the higher power modules and the rate of our customers shifting to pay t o those higher power modules and so it will continue over the next multiple quarters.
Edwin Mok: I see. One last question, I'll let you guys go. On the OpEx increase this quarter, meaning sorry, in the fourth quarter as well as in the first quarter, is there any kind of one time that rate increase or anything that one time things that we should bake or put into our assumption?
Kris Sennesael: In the fourth quarter we definitely have some one-time expenses related to SPI, the solar trade show and looking into Q1 of course you have the start of the social charges that pick up again, but absent of that there is no abnormal one-time elements in that.
Edwin Mok: Great, that's all I have. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Philip Shen of ROTH Capital. Your line is now opened.
Philip Shen: Paul, Kris, congrats on a great quarter.
Paul Nahi: Thank you.
Philip Shen: Hey, I'd like to talk about or explore the international opportunity. It sounds like you guys had a nice growth in the quarter there for UK and Australia, can you tell us what the actual mix was of international sales in Q4 and then importantly, how you expect that to trend throughout 2015?
Kris Sennesael: Yeah, Phil, So currently our U.S. versus international mix is 85:15, that has been for a couple of quarters and that was also the case in the fourth quarter. As you know, our U.S. business is growing so fast that it's really hard to outpace that growth internationally, but having said that in 2015, I do expect that mix to shift from currently 85:15 towards 80:20. And that of course you know that our longer term target model three to five years down the road is to further move that shift to a 50-50, meaning 50% from the U.S., 50% outside of the U.S.
Paul Nahi: And just to elaborate on that, I would say that the success that we're experiencing in these markets, whether it's the UK, whether it's Australia or France, where we're the number two residential inverter already, I think further validates the value proposition resonates in every country we're in. The question that we ask ourselves internally is, what is the rate of expansion that's still keeps in step our profitable growth strategy? But we're looking at several new countries for this year and for next. I'm going to continue that global expansion for the next couple of years.
Philip Shen: Great and then I have a quick follow-up on pricing, historically you've experienced 7% to 10% year-over-year ASP decline. We actually saw some a sequential potential strength in ASP in Q4. Can you just talk about what you see for pricing throughout the year? Should we expect a 7% to 10% decline, I know you've addressed it in parts earlier, but any color on that would be helpful?
Paul Nahi: Right, so again, I would caution everyone not to over think fluctuations on a quarter-to-quarter basis, because as we talk about there's so many factors that go into that. It's hard to use that as an appropriate proxy for anything else. What I would say is, that to your point, we've seen, call it 8% to 12%, 8% to 14% price reductions over the past some number of years. Given the current environment we don't see that the general trend of price reduction is going to change and our job is to stay ahead of that through cost reduction as well as future enhancement.
Philip Shen: Great. One last question, I'll jump back in queue. In terms of the next-generation I think it's the S275, can you give us an update on how that development is coming along and do you still expect a mid 2015 launch? Thank you.
Paul Nahi: The progress on our next generation, our fifth generation microinverter is going along extremely well. It is as you know the most advanced microinverter on the planet with full advanced grid functions, bidirectional power capabilities. It is really quite a little powerhouse and we are expecting to launch it on time.
Philip Shen: Great, thanks Paul, congrats again.
Paul Nahi: Thanks Phil.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Krish Sankar of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now opened.
Andrew Hughes: Good afternoon guys. This is Andrew Hughes on Krish and congrats on another strong quarter.
Paul Nahi: Thank you.
Andrew Hughes: Just quickly on the competitive landscape, curious if you're seeing it evolve at all in your favor as I think we've all seen SMA encounter some headwinds recently and AEIS looking to at least diminish their focus on that part of the businesses as well, have you seen it evolve in your favor or are you expecting it to as you look at towards 2015?
Paul Nahi: Well, we definitely see it evolving and clearly I think if we just look at the historical evidence we've been growing. We've been getting new customers. We've been growing in every market, every channel and every geography. And you're absolutely right. I think some other inverter companies are facing some very significant challenges. In the end I think what we provide, which is a very simple, straightforward design installation and operations and maintenance of a product allows that installer to have a more functional, a more profitable business, at the same time providing a consumer with a better return on investment. That value proposition definitely does resonate and we're definitely seeing customers, more and more customers interested in that, for exactly those reasons. Now at the same time your question about what we're seeing in 2015 and let's go out to 2016, we have to be very well aware that this market is very dynamic and it is changing and as proud as we are of the product and the solution and the presence that we have, we have to continue to innovate, that the energy market is changing and that storage will become an essential part of that energy mix. And with storage you have to have a comprehensive energy management solution on top of that. So, I do feel that we're in a very, very good position to leverage the brand and the technologies that we've developed so far and we accelerate our technology innovation to make sure that we are one or two steps ahead of where the market is going to be at any given time so we can continue to lead that space.
Andrew Hughes: Great and then just another one on the O&M business. Can you give us a sense of who your customers are, whether there are any of the big integrators, installers or sort of the smaller group and where you, where that revenue is sort of percentage of the total is today, where you see it going and how big it might get before we see it broken out as a separate line item?
Paul Nahi: Sure, so I'll take the first part of that and I'll turn over the second part of your question to Kris. So the mix on O&M is really quite broad. We have some of the largest hardware manufacturers and developers. We also have a whole set of smaller ones and they expand the residential, the commercial, and even some beginning of utility scale business. We see it definitely very broad-based and we do see it growing. And I'll turn it over to Kris to talk about the specific financials.
Kris Sennesael: Yes. So with the NPS acquisition, Next Phase Solar, their revenue was approximately $4 million during 2014 and growing fast substantially. So for Q1 we expect approximately $1 million of revenue. That number is actually too small to break it out separately, but we will in the next couple of quarters continue to provide some more color as the service business continue to grow and add more strategic value to our global offering.
Andrew Hughes: Great, thanks guys. I'll jump back in the queue.
Kris Sennesael: Good.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Pierre Maccagno of Dougherty & Company. Your line is now opened.
Pierre Maccagno: Hey Paul, Kris, congratulations on such a great quarter.
Paul Nahi: Thank you.
Pierre Maccagno: So, a little more feedback there on the O&M business, can you give us some idea of what type of the operating margins you have for that?
Kris Sennesael: We haven't. We'll disclose that, but gross margins are slightly above Enphase Company average and the whole business is accretive to the bottom line from day one.
Pierre Maccagno: Yeah, but it requires R&D or is it just SG&A would you say?
Kris Sennesael: No, it's they have approximately 30 employees service people. There is a very small management layer on top on that, but there is very, very minimal OpEx that goes with that business.
Paul Nahi: And part of the beauty behind this is that it does very exactly specifically leverage the R&D that we're already doing. When you look at what Enphase does right now, Enlighten is very likely one of the largest if not the largest solar O&M ecosystems on the planet. By leveraging Enlighten, by leveraging the O&M infrastructure that we already have we are actually developing products and software to support an O&M infrastructure. What Next Phase will do as part of EES is be able to leverage that both in the U.S. and globally.
Pierre Maccagno: Okay, then following up on Vivint, any feedback on them under second source, what are your thoughts there?
Kris Sennesael: That's the same thing that we've been saying for well over a year now. They made it very clear that they are going to bring on a second source. We fully understand. I believe they're well on the way to doing that and we feel very comfortable about our position now. And importantly, if you look at our broader customer base, it continues to grow both domestically in the U.S. residential market, in the commercial market, internationally. We are feeling very good about the breadth and growth of our, both residential and customer installation base. In fact if you think about it, by entering the U.S. commercial market we really are effectively doubling our TAM and we're just trying to penetrate that market.
Pierre Maccagno: Great. Regarding the residential market, your opportunity there for further growth is about 10% to 15% of the market correct? I mean, do you believe you are going to capture a large share of that within a short timeframe?
Paul Nahi: Well, what we've said there is that we're obviously very proud of the market share that we currently have and we do believe that we're going to be able to increase market share, but at the same time with a finite amount of OpEx we're going to apply those resources where we feel we can get the most amount of leverage. So while we continue to grow share in the residential market, we are looking at getting to that same level of market share in the large commercial market in the UK and Australia and areas that we believe we can see more leverage with the OpEx. But having said that, remember that the U.S. market is growing and there are lot of new entrants entering this market. There are still customers that are outstanding customers for Enphase, but we may not be 100% of their revenue and we can work hard to earn their trust and become a larger percentage of their business as well. I would say even in the U.S. residential market there is a lot happening, it’s very exciting and we are continuously staying aggressive.
Pierre Maccagno: Great. And my final question is regarding the battery storage business, what is your estimate of the market size there and when do you think you are going to start shipping and what type of market shares do you think initially you might get?
Paul Nahi: Right. The storage market is a tough one, because it doesn’t really exists yet, and you can make the case that in the U.S. residential market today, there isn’t an economic case forward because we have that metering and I think that’s certainly true. At the same time we know that storage is not just about, there is not just, simple economic cause, but it’s also about grid stabilization, it’s about grid resiliency. It is very possible that we see in some areas of the U.S. people will adopt storage in order to be able to have a higher penetration of solar. We are seeing something very similar happen in Queensland in Australia. There are different initiatives going on in the UK as well. So, it’s a burgeoning market, it will require policy changes, it’s going to require different ways to look at financing. But having said all that, we do believe very strongly that the growth of renewables have to be associated with a storage solution and for the reasons that I've outlined in the past, we believe that our AC Battery solution is an absolutely revolutionary product in storage and I'm extremely confident that with that we will lead the storage market. In terms of how big it is, hard to say, as I said, but I'd would be surprised if it wasn’t in the tens of billions of dollars in the next five to ten years.
Pierre Maccagno: And do you think initially it’s going to be the U.S. and say you have net metering that’s a difficulty; could it be some other country that you start growing or any ideas there?
Paul Nahi: Oh, absolutely. I think, you know again, in the U.S. as you mentioned the economic case in the residential market is harder to make; however, there is an economic case in the commercial market, so it may be that the U.S. commercial market starts first. But then you are exactly correct, we are looking internationally for the storage solution and we are seeing demand for it come from the Asia Pacific region or EMEA so it is certainly not a U.S. only product.
Pierre Maccagno: Right. Thank you very much.
Paul Nahi: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Vishal Shah of Deutsche Bank. Your line is now opened.
Vishal Shah: Thanks very much. Paul, do you may be talk about your targets economics of storage product that you are working on, your longer term targets that you may have in terms of cost per kWh of the solution and given the point you are making about the growth expectations of that product?
Paul Nahi: So, we're not announcing either cost or pricing yet, but what we have said is this, that we believe it can be margin accretive. We believe that the system itself can very likely be the simplest the most plug and play, the most cost effective solution for our installer partners and our customers and because of that we believe that we can take a very dominant position with the storage solution. Having said that, we are not really, we are not guiding either to price or to cost yet.
Vishal Shah: Okay, but you know some of the targets out there you know call for $150, $200 per megawatt hour, are you looking at that kind price range or are we looking at a much different number?
Paul Nahi: So as I said, I'm not guiding any specific prices, but I will say this, that you have to look at the entire system. You have to look at, if you like looking at a solar system and making a new judgment on the cost of solar system by the cost of the solar panel. You have to look at the storage, the chemistry. You have to look at the inverter technology. You have to look at the integration into the rest of the system. You have to look at mounting. You have to look at it holistically. No one element will drive this. And even when you look at, even when you look at chemistry, remember we're in the very, very early days of storage. Chemistry is going to change a lot. There is a lot of largest battery companies in the world are bringing on lot of capacity and there is some amazing young company some startups that we are tracking very closely with some technology that technology that could present could be quite revolutionary. So very early days and we have a lot to learn, but there is a lot happening here. But if you look at the entire solution, not just the chemistry, the entire solution, I do feel very, very confident that we can provide a vey cost effective solution.
Vishal Shah: That’s helpful. Can you may be talk about the mix of residential versus commercial products and then the guidance for the first quarter or may be even fourth quarter and what kind of margin differential you see right now?
Paul Nahi: So, resi versus commercial today is somewhere in the 85%-15% range. And again, remember the vast majority of that is small commercial. The C250 the product we just introduced is the product that is purposed built for large commercial market, it has the features and functions that we haven’t had before to address that. So, that will certainly change our presence in the large commercial market. And again, we said that gross margins on commercial are slightly lower, but blended with the rest of the company, coupled with the cost reduction plans that we have in place doesn’t change our view on our corporate gross margin.
Vishal Shah: That’s helpful. And then you know, when you think about OpEx you guys have done a good job on reducing the OpEx percent of revenue last year, how should we think about this year’s trajectory are we looking at further reduction in terms of absolute percentages in OpEx in 2015?
Kris Sennesael: Yeah, absolutely Vishal, driving leverage in our operating expense remains big part of our balance profitable growth strategy. And we have an internal rule that we have communicated to the investor community as well where we allow our operating expense to grow at half the speed of revenue growth. And we are going to try to stick to that rule. It is a challenge because we have lot of opportunities to go and continue to further develop new technology building blocks and invest in the future of the company and we will not hesitate doing that, but we're also going to do it in a financially responsible way and stick to our guideline in terms of OpEx growth that we have communicated before.
Vishal Shah: That’s great, and one last question. I think you mentioned 80:20 U.S. versus international revenue mix in 2015, are you seeing any slowdown in any particular international markets such as the UK or are you seeing similar strong growth in all markets and what are the new markets are you guys looking at this year? Thank you.
Paul Nahi: Well, in general we are seeing strong growth in all these markets. Clearly, when you get to continental Europe it’s a country-by-country, but even there we are seeing good growth in the Netherlands and although France, the France residential market I think is a little bit subdued. The French commercial market looks like it’s getting some stem. We play in all these markets of course, so that’s what makes us confident that we can continue seeing that growth. And as we've said in the past we won’t announce a country before we land in it with one exception of Japan. Japan is definitely a country that we are very focused on. We are working away through the regulatory requirements. The progress there is looking very good and we're engaged in multiple discussions with multiple potential partners to help expedite their go-to-market strategy. So, Japan is definitely on our radar as are other countries, both in EMEA as well as APAC, but we'll be making those announcements throughout this year and next.
Vishal Shah: Thank you.
Kris Sennesael: Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Pavel Molchanov of Raymond James. Your line is now opened.
Pavel Molchanov: Hey guys, thanks for taking the question, first just a kind of a small housekeeping item, warranty obligations on the balance sheet barely budged from a year ago despite the revenue increase and I recall of course that you guys had the accounting change. Going forward, would you expect the trajectory of warranty to kind of follow the revenue number?
Kris Sennesael: No, going forward we expect similar pattern as we had in 2014 so continuously small increase of the amount on the balance sheet.
Pavel Molchanov: So, it’s slower than revenue growth?
Kris Sennesael: Yeah, absolutely.
Pavel Molchanov: Okay and then just quick follow up to the prior question specifically about the UK, as I understand that the UK ring new obligation credit come to an end March 31st,so how big a headwind is that kind of beyond Q1 as far as that market goes?
Paul Nahi: We're not seeing much in the way of that expression being a headwind. I think the UK actually has a very sensible policy. There is a regular reduction based on megawatt shipped every six months that policy has enabled the growth of the UK market. Oil prices continue to drop and oil subsidies continue to drop, so in fact if anything, it gives us confidence that the UK represents a very stable long-term market.
Pavel Molchanov: All right, I appreciate it guys.
Paul Nahi: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. At this time, I’m not showing any further questions. I’d like to turn the call back to Paul Nahi for closing comments.
Paul Nahi: Thank you for joining us on our call today. Strong execution across the board in 2014, helped achieve our growth. We're carrying this momentum into 2015 and I'm very excited about the enormous opportunities in front of us, including the further growth of our microinverter systems business as well as the transition towards becoming a major energy technology company. I'm looking forward to speaking with you again next quarter.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today’s conference. This does conclude today’s program and you may all disconnect. Everyone have a wonderful day.

Now, I’d like to introduce Paul Nahi, Chief Executive Officer of Enphase Energy.
Paul Nahi: Good afternoon and thanks for joining us today to discuss our third quarter 2014 financial results. As usual I’ll start with my opening remarks and touch on some key highlights and then Kris will take us through the third quarter financials and the outlook for the fourth quarter. After that, we will open up the call for Q&A. We are extremely pleased with our financial results for the third quarter of 2014. We reported record financial results including revenue of $99.1 million, an increase of 60% year-over-year and up 21% sequentially. We also reported gross margin of 33% and impressive bottom-line results including positive operating income and net income and non-GAAP diluted earnings of $0.08 per share. Kris will review the fine points regarding our third quarter financials but I will stay that I’m thrilled with our record breaking results. These results reflect the increase in global demand for Enphase microinverter systems and our ability to execute on our balanced profitable growth strategy. Our overall strong business momentum included the continued surging demand in our core U.S. residential market, as well as market share gains in the residential and commercial solar markets in the UK and Australia. During the third quarter of 2014, we shipped the 170 megawatts AC an increase of 81% year-over-year. Since inception, we shipped over 1.3 gigawatts of Enphase microinverter systems. We are the highest volume inverter company in the world with more than 6.4 million units shipped. Enphase Systems have produced over 2.4 terawatt-hours of clean energy. The global demand for solar continues to grow rapidly according to the International Energy Agency or IEA the world added more solar PV capacity during 2013 than in the previous four decades. The total global installed capacity was over 150 gigawatts in early 2014. The IEA envisions solar to be a dominant source of power generation in the world by 2050. The U.S. solar market is especially robust. According to GTM Research the U.S. installed approximately 2.5 gigawatts of solar in the first half of 2014. The U.S. solar market remains a huge opportunity for Enphase as currently solar is less than 1% of the energy mix. We believe the future will soon see a world in which solar is out standard as any other major home appliance. In our core U.S. residential market, we saw significant demand for our microinverter system from our current and new customers. As a result, our third quarter U.S. revenue was up 63% year-over-year. On the international front, we continue to be pleased with the top-line contributions as international revenue was up 41% year-over-year, primarily due to strong performance in the UK and Australia. In the UK, revenue increased 18% sequentially and 92% year-over-year as we continue to gain share in this attractive market. During the third quarter, we expanded our distribution channel with the addition of five new partners and expanded our business with some major residential installers. We entered the UK PV market less than two years ago and our rapid growth and market share gain are examples of our commitment to international presence and expansion. Our UK market share is now estimated to about 10%. In Australia and New Zealand, we made great progress and posted strong third quarter results as well. Revenue was up 73% sequentially as we continue to expand our reach and penetration in the residential and commercial solar markets throughout this region. We also expanded our distribution channel by partnering with some well regarded industry players, including YHI New Zealand to distribute our microinverter systems to the New Zealand Solar seller community. New Zealand’s solar market holds great potential for Enphase. Since inception, our vision has been to realize the global potential of solar energy through our technology innovation. With 125 active patent families Enphase is committed to developing the most innovative solar energy systems in the world and protecting the intellectual property embodied in those systems. We take tremendous pride in how we’ve revolutionized solar power generation through technology innovation and focused our R&D efforts on a smart, distributed networked architecture that helps solar energy scale. Our residential business which accounts for approximately 85% of revenue is very solid and our commercial business accounting for the remaining 15% of revenue is getting a strong boost. According to GTM research, the U.S. commercial PV market is poised to grow by 21% annually to over 1.3 gigawatts in 2014 and is expected to grow from approximately 30% of the U.S. solar market in 2015 to approximately 40% in 2018. In September, we announced a new solar energy solution for the commercial market that offers both the technology and operations and maintenance services solution capable of taking a commercial scale system from concept through implementation to long-term O&M. The system offers clear economic benefits and reduces the overall balance of system costs, while delivering optimal performance and driving a better return on investment and lower LCOE than competing inverters. This new commercial-grade system to be available in early 2015 includes the C250 Microinverter, the ongoing Communications Gateway, the cloud-based Enlighten monitoring system and our Enphase Energy Services solution. Enphase is already powering around 7,000 commercial systems across a wide variety of market segments, from schools and corporate offices to baseball and football stadiums, as well as agricultural sites. Our new commercial system provides developers, installers and owners a robust solution from maximizing the performance of their solar assets. We believe this will help us to further drive the adoption of the microinverter system technology in small, medium and large commercial projects. Two weeks ago, we were in Las Vegas at the Solar Power International Trade Show or SPI, it was a great show this year, very well attended and a clear indication that solar is a very attractive and fast growing business. Our Enphase booth was overflowing with customers, partners, suppliers and investors. While at SPI, we announced some ground-breaking and exciting new products and services that represent our vision for the future of solar, connected, intelligent, simple, and designed to support mass solar penetration on the grid. With our announcement of the connected, intelligent Enphase Energy management system to be available in 2015, we’re taking a big step towards our ultimate goal enabling mainframe solar adoption. Our energy management system is built upon our fifth generation microinverter and intelligently integrates the critical technology to solve solar energy challenges at scale. Smart grid intelligence, communications, big data analytics and storage, it’s an innovative system for energy management that delivers on the vision of enabling large scale implementation of solar power integrated with the grid. This system offers powerful energy generation, plug and play storage, advanced control capabilities and load management to provide a better return on investment for system owners, to expand the range of profitable business models for installers and provide broad insight into and control for the utilities. The foundation of the Enphase Energy management system is our fifth generation microinverter the Enphase S275, which combines a leading edge performance and reliability with the ground-breaking new features including smart grid functionality, reactive power control and for the first time ever, bidirectional power flow. It is this bidirectional power flow that enables the development of our revolutionary AC battery, an advanced energy storage solution with a modular plug and play storage device fully integrated with the Enphase Energy management system. The AC batteries are safe, reliable and easy to install storage solution designed for residential and commercial applications. We believe storage will be a multibillion dollar market and will be essential in helping solar gain broader acceptance and higher penetration. Enphase is bringing the same technological innovation to storage that we brought to solar by pairing our innovative, distributed architecture with what we believe is the best-in-class battery chemistry in the industry. The AC battery and Enphase Energy management system will provide new opportunities for our sales channels. As part of the AC battery rollout, we’ve engaged with several partners for pilot projects including Lennar Homes, Hawaii Energy Connection and Vivint Solar in the U.S. Pretty Green Energy, CJ Solar and Domuneo in Europe, and Metro Solar in Australia. We also have a completely redesigned networking hub as part of the new system. The Envoy S Gateway expands from energy monitoring into full revenue grade metering of solar production, metering of home consumption and storage management, ruggedly constructed and suitable for installation outdoors the Envoy S offers a full range of networking connectivity options including built-in cellular capabilities. We believe the S275 combined with the Envoy S is the most advanced and highest quality microinverter system ever made. Enlighten, our cloud-based energy management platform displays and manages generation, storage and build-in consumption data in an intuitive interface enabling customers to monitor system performance from any PC tablet or smartphone. It’s a one-stop interface for energy production, storage and consumption management that optimizes the use of solar, grid and stored energy. As with all Enphase products, we remain committed to quality and reliability, quality of innovation, quality of design and production, quality of support and quality in everything we do. We are pleased to achieve the ISO 9001 and ISO 14001 certifications during the third quarter. Both are internationally recognized quality management and environmental management system standards. These certifications underscore Enphase’s unwavering commitment not only to quality, but also to continuous improvement and environmental stewardship. We’ve long believed that our high technology business, world-class products and superior customer support will help sustain our long-term growth and allows us to continually develop new and innovative products and systems. With the new announcements, we’re taking a big step forward in our vision of realizing the global potential of solar energy through connected, intelligent technology innovation. I’ll close my Q3 comments by acknowledging our outstanding financial results and our excitement about Enphase and the future of solar. Our quarterly top-line growth of 60% year-over-year, a record profitability and a solid positive cash flow from operations all point to our continued strong execution track-record that could only be achieved thanks to the hard work day in and day out from all our dedicated Enphase employees. Now, I’ll turn it over to Kris for his review of our financial results.
Kris Sennesael: Thank you, Paul. And I fully agree, the third quarter financial results are a remarkable achievement and prove that our business model works very well. I am proud, happy and excited to be part of the Enphase family that is able to deliver those strong financial results and we’re all committed to continuing to drive further improvements. Let’s first get into some of the details related to our financial results for the third quarter of 2014 and as a reminder the financial measures that I am going to provide are on a non-GAAP basis, unless otherwise noted. During the third quarter, we saw continuous strong growth in the overall solar market, as well as an increase in demand for Enphase microinverter systems, resulting in the acceleration of our revenue growth. Total revenue for the third quarter of 2014 was $99.1 million, an all-time revenue record. With $99.1 million revenue, we exceeded our revenue outlook of $93 million to $98 million that we provided last quarter. Revenue for the third quarter of 2014 increased 60% compared to the third quarter of 2013 and was up 21% compared to the second quarter of 2014. As Paul mentioned, the large year-over-year and sequential revenue growth was driven by strong overall demand for solar in our core U.S. residential markets, as well as the growing demand for Enphase microinverter systems and increased contributions from the UK and Australian markets. We shipped 170 megawatts AC or 195 megawatt DC during the third quarter of 2014, an increase of 81% on a year-over-year basis. The 170 megawatts shipped represents approximately 760,000 microinverters, of which, 90% was our fourth-generation microinverter systems. We also continue to see a stronger adoption of higher power panels that are being paired with our higher power microinverters. As a result the Enphase M250 represents approximately 25% of all units shipped during the third quarter of 2014. Gross margin for the third quarter of 2014 was 33%, an increase of 470 basis points compared to the third quarter of 2013, as our product cost reductions continue to outpace price reductions. The third quarter of 2014 gross margin was consistent with the record gross margin achieved in the second quarter of 2014. Operating expenses during the third quarter of 2014 were $28 million compared to $27 million in the second quarter of 2014. Operating expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased from 33% in both the third quarter of 2013, as well as the second quarter of 2014 to 28% in the third quarter of 2014 demonstrating the leverage we have in our business model in line with our balanced profitable growth strategy. R&D expenses were $11.3 million, sales and marketing expenses were $9.3 million and G&A expenses were $7.3 million. These non-GAAP operating expenses excluded $2.3 million in stock-based compensation expenses and $365,000 of expenses related to the secondary stock offering that we completed during the third quarter. The combination of accelerated top-line growth, strong gross margin performance and operating expense leverage resulted in a record operating income of $4.8 million in the third quarter of 2014 compared to breakeven in the second quarter of 2014 and an operating loss of $2.9 million in the third quarter of 2013. The $4.8 million of operating income resulted in an operating margin of 4.8%. I’m very pleased with this level of profitability, but of course we will continue to drive our business towards our long-term target model that calls for operating margins to be in the 15% to 25% range. For the third quarter of 2014, net income was $3.8 million resulting in earnings per diluted share of $0.08 compared to a net loss of $3.6 million or a loss of $0.09 per share in the third quarter of 2013. During the third quarter of 2014, we achieved positive GAAP net income for the first time. GAAP net income was $800,000 or $0.02 per diluted share compared to a GAAP net loss of $6.3 million or a net loss of $0.15 per share in the third quarter of 2013. In summary, while looking at the income statements on a year-over-year basis I’m very pleased with our top-line growth, gross margin improvements and operating expense leverage resulting in a significant improvement to our bottom-line and EPS expansion. Turning to the balance sheet, cash flow from operations during the third quarter was $11.2 million, while our net cash flow was $6.9 million. This illustrates that our business model not only drives profitability but also generates cash as we combine profitability with continued focus on working capital management and relatively low capital expenditures. In terms of working management, we have our days sales outstanding at 46 days during the third quarter, as well as excellent inventory management, we’ve inventory on-hand at 21 days. Capital expenditures during the third quarter of 2014 were $5.5 million, up from the last couple of quarters as we added additional proprietary test equipment and factory automation equipment to support the large volume ramp in the Flextronics factory. Keep in mind, that last year we shipped approximately 1.6 million units and this year we expect to ship over 2.5 billion units, an increase of more than 55% year-over-year. In the third quarter of 2014 depreciation and amortization was $2.1 million. We exited the third quarter with a total cash balance of $44.5 million and $5.9 million of term debt. We repaid approximately 670,000 of our existing term debt during the third quarter. And as a reminder, our working capital facility remains undrawn. We remain confident that our cash position and credit facility, combined with our focus on working capital management and profitability provide adequate liquidity to support the growth of our business. Now, let’s discuss our outlook for the fourth quarter of 2014. In line with normal seasonality, we expect revenue for the fourth quarter of 2014 to be within a range of $98 million to $103 million. At the midpoint of the revenue outlook range, revenue would be up 50% compared to the fourth quarter of 2013. We expect gross margin to be within a range of 31% to 33% and we expect non-GAAP operating expenses to be up 8% to 10% compared to the third quarter of 2014, as we continue to invest in research and development to support new and innovative products and systems. And now, I will open the line for questions.
Question: 
and: 
Operator:  Thank you. (Operator Instructions) And our first question comes from Phil Shen. Your line is open.
Philip Shen :  Although you have guidance for 2015 perhaps you can provide us your view of 2015 and what do you see in Q1 so far and what do you expect as we go through the year?
 ROTH Capital Partners:  Although you have guidance for 2015 perhaps you can provide us your view of 2015 and what do you see in Q1 so far and what do you expect as we go through the year?
Kris Sennesael:  So Phil we only provide guidance one quarter at a time, so I’m not going to provide any specific guidance for 2015. In general of course we do expect that the normal seasonality that we have seen in the last couple of years will continue during 2015 meaning that Q1 is typically a seasonally down quarter, followed by a strong sequential growth in the second quarter, more growth in the third quarter and then kind of a flattish quarter going into the fourth quarter. So, we definitely expect seasonality to be the same in 2015 as 2014.
Philip Shen :  As for my follow-up, can you give us a sense for what your expectations are for the ramp of the commercial product in 2015 and perhaps you can speak in terms of megawatts or unit volumes or mix?
 ROTH Capital Partners:  As for my follow-up, can you give us a sense for what your expectations are for the ramp of the commercial product in 2015 and perhaps you can speak in terms of megawatts or unit volumes or mix?
Paul Nahi:  I can’t really speak in terms of megawatts or unit volumes what I can say is this that, in the small commercial market we already have close to a 38% market share. I think our commercial customers have been waiting for this product. We finally have for the first time a purpose-built commercial inverter, so I’m very optimistic about its reception and its uptake, but I’m going to refrain from giving any specific megawatt data.
Operator:  Our next question comes from Josh Baribeau of Canaccord. Your line is open.
Josh Baribeau :  I was wondering if you could just help us out with some of the moving pieces in the gross margin guidance with revenues basically flat year-on-year at the midpoint down about 100 bps, just wondering if you could like I said kind of provide a little bit more via moving pieces there?
 Canaccord Genuity:  I was wondering if you could just help us out with some of the moving pieces in the gross margin guidance with revenues basically flat year-on-year at the midpoint down about 100 bps, just wondering if you could like I said kind of provide a little bit more via moving pieces there?
Kris Sennesael:  Yes, Josh let me start with just reiterating that I’m very happy with the progress we’ve been making on gross margins over the last couple of years moving margin from 10% to 20% to 30% now two quarters in a row being at 33%, I’m really happy with the progress that we’ve been able to make there. You know that our long-term target model is 35% to 40% and we are committed and confident that we will make and continue to make progress towards that long-term target model. Having said that, the progression between today and hitting our long-term target model might not be linear, the road might be bumpy and so there might be quarter-to-quarter certain fluctuations there. The main reason for that is when you look at gross margin of course there is two sides to the equation, one of them is pricing the other one is product cost. On pricing, we definitely see some increased pricing pressure in the market there and of course we’re going to be smart about that, but we also if pricing pressure is becoming too high we would definitely will continue to take pricing actions. On the other hand, we’ve product cost reductions, we will continue to innovate and to innovation we’ll continue to add features and functions to our product while at the same time continuing to drive down the product cost. The key here is that the timing of the pricing actions and the timing of the product cost reductions of course does not necessarily fall in the same quarter and as a result of that the road going forward might be a little bit bumpy.
Josh Baribeau : And then can you just also address some of the issues of potential customer concentration, as well as the effect of them potentially using other technologies, as well as the microinverters and just your overall share expectations?
 Canaccord Genuity: And then can you just also address some of the issues of potential customer concentration, as well as the effect of them potentially using other technologies, as well as the microinverters and just your overall share expectations?
Paul Nahi:  Sure. So, clearly there are some customers who -- we’ve many customers who are 100% Enphase some of these Enphase with other products and it would not be surprising to us and we’ve I think signaled for quite sometimes that one of our biggest customers has indicated that they wanted to bring on a second source. So there is nothing here that’s either new or surprising. I think what’s very important for Enphase is that, when we look at the universal customers that we’re addressing, we’re increasing the number of customers that we’ve everyday both U.S. domestically as well as internationally and now with the advent of the commercial product we’re addressing yet an entirely new customer segment. So, I think that if we look at customer concentration it’s actually going down considerably from Q2 to Q3 and we expect that trend overtime to continue.
Josh Baribeau : Okay, and then lastly for me, can you help us out with maybe sort of which directionality of how you think the Gen 5 residential inverter or, as well as the margin profile of Gen 5 as well as some of the commercial products that’s you’ve introduced that might look relative to corporate average?
 Canaccord Genuity: Okay, and then lastly for me, can you help us out with maybe sort of which directionality of how you think the Gen 5 residential inverter or, as well as the margin profile of Gen 5 as well as some of the commercial products that’s you’ve introduced that might look relative to corporate average?
Paul Nahi: Sure, so what we’ve said in the past and what continues to be true is that with every subsequent generation of microinverter we see a cost reduction and that’s during the course of the development and of course to the life of that microinverter we don’t see that trend changing anytime soon, that’s really part of the high-tech story and this is very similar to what Kris was saying that we fully expect with every generation of product we’re going to introduce new features and new functions such as bidirectional power flow, such as reactive power and we’ll see cost reduction as well and again overtime we expect that to be accretive to gross margin.
Operator: And our next question comes from Colin Rusch of Northland. Colin your line is open.
Colin Rusch : Guys can you just give us an update on two things, one what percentage of your sales came from the Gen 4 products and then also just a clarification on the price pressure, are you seeing that from microinverters or are you seeing that from straining orders or a combination of both?
 Northland Capital Markets: Guys can you just give us an update on two things, one what percentage of your sales came from the Gen 4 products and then also just a clarification on the price pressure, are you seeing that from microinverters or are you seeing that from straining orders or a combination of both?
Kris Sennesael: So Gen 4 was approximately 90% of our total [Audio Gap] converted now and I do expect in the fourth quarter to have close to 100% of our revenue coming from the 4 generation. Within the 4 generation, we have two products 215 and 250. The 250 was approximately 25% of that 4 generation mix.
Paul Nahi: And in reference to the second part of your question about sort of where the competitive pricing pressure is coming from, we still haven’t seen a viable microinverter competitor. We also know that there have been several variance of microinverters from both large and small companies, but none of yet posed a very significant competitive challenge. However, there are a lot of other products string inverters that are competing and several of them are competing by lowering their price that will pose some competition in the future, but it’s primarily from standard string inverters.
Colin Rusch : And then just a follow-up in terms of the percentage of your sales that your fine sizing ways to the cabling products as well as Envoy, can you just walk us through any changes there and then kind of an absolute percentage in terms of the cabling solution, was there some sort of anomaly this quarter in terms of the cabling session given the 6% price decline and I think there is a lot of folks that who want to understand the nitty-gritty on where those price declines came and all of that contributed to that?
 Northland Capital Markets: And then just a follow-up in terms of the percentage of your sales that your fine sizing ways to the cabling products as well as Envoy, can you just walk us through any changes there and then kind of an absolute percentage in terms of the cabling solution, was there some sort of anomaly this quarter in terms of the cabling session given the 6% price decline and I think there is a lot of folks that who want to understand the nitty-gritty on where those price declines came and all of that contributed to that?
Kris Sennesael: No, I think the third quarter was pretty much in line with previous quarter in terms of inverters and cables and Envoys in terms of the mix there.
Operator: Our next question comes from Edwin Mok of Needham & Company. Your line is open.
Edwin Mok : First question I have is in terms of channel additions in the inventory have you seen any change with strong demand, are you seeing through tying up in the channel or do you think that channel comp within the inventory?
Needham & Company: First question I have is in terms of channel additions in the inventory have you seen any change with strong demand, are you seeing through tying up in the channel or do you think that channel comp within the inventory?
Paul Nahi: So as you know Edwin, we monitor the channels very-very tightly by skew and we do this all over the world. I would say in general we have kept the channels fairly stable. I don’t think you would see a significant from this quarter to last.
Edwin Mok : So not much change there, and then I guess a question on strong growth in UK and Australia, there it looks like it was a pretty great numbers and then maybe you can give us some idea in terms how we kind of think about those markets as we go in 2015 or in this level growth is sustainable and certainly in Australia, are you talking about Australia driving the growth or is it because of your expansions in New Zealand that was driving that growth maybe you can give some color on that would be great? Thank you.
Needham & Company: So not much change there, and then I guess a question on strong growth in UK and Australia, there it looks like it was a pretty great numbers and then maybe you can give us some idea in terms how we kind of think about those markets as we go in 2015 or in this level growth is sustainable and certainly in Australia, are you talking about Australia driving the growth or is it because of your expansions in New Zealand that was driving that growth maybe you can give some color on that would be great? Thank you.
Paul Nahi: Sure, so let me take that last question first. In the APAC region, Australia was primarily driving the growth. We are still relatively new to New Zealand and New Zealand is going to be a bit of smaller market, but our penetration and our market share growth in Australia has been very-very impressive. In response to the question about do I expect that to continue into 2015? Without giving any direct guidance, we really have spent a good part of 2014 building up the infrastructure in Australia making sure the right people were in place and making sure we have the distribution channels established, making sure that the installers were being trained. We’ll continue doing a lot of that in 2015 but I feel a lot of the ground work has been completed. So I expect to see some very significant growth in Australia in 2015 and I would say something very similar about the UK as well. The UK growth as you have mentioned is very impressive. We have a great team out there which is doing extremely well. And we do now have much stronger brand recognition great relationships with installers and distributors and will be able to leverage a lot of this in 2015.
Operator: And our next question comes from the Krish Sankar of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.
Krish Sankar : A couple of them, Paul or Kris, what do you expect the mix of where the resi, commercial to be in Q4?
 Bank of America Merrill Lynch: A couple of them, Paul or Kris, what do you expect the mix of where the resi, commercial to be in Q4?
Kris Sennesael: Currently, that is still 85, 15 and I don’t expect that to be drastically changing in Q4. We are really excited about the new commercial product that we have available and we will more aggressively target the commercial market not only small commercial but also medium and large commercial. Having said that it will take some time until we will be able to drive meaningful revenue there, the sales cycles are pretty long and so you have to make sure you get designed-in in some of those larger projects and so that will take some time. So far we are in beta testing and the product is being installed, its very well received by the market the installers and players in commercial market have been waiting for this product for the long time and we will start shipping it beginning 2015.
Krish Sankar :  And then I mean I understand that you guys are definitely doing a lot of good work in cost reduction, but look at your Q3 or your Q4 revenue 85% resi, 15% commercial how will the gross margin look if at that revenue run rate the split was more like 70% resi and 30% commercial, will the gross margin be how many like a rough estimate how many basis points higher or lower?
 Bank of America Merrill Lynch:  And then I mean I understand that you guys are definitely doing a lot of good work in cost reduction, but look at your Q3 or your Q4 revenue 85% resi, 15% commercial how will the gross margin look if at that revenue run rate the split was more like 70% resi and 30% commercial, will the gross margin be how many like a rough estimate how many basis points higher or lower?
Paul Nahi:  We can’t give specific guidance like that however, what I can say is we have as a Company we are still in the very early days in terms of technology development for microinverters. There is a tremendous amount of innovation that we are currently working on and will be working on that as I mentioned will not only increase features and functions but will also reduce cost. So overtime I expect as Kris have said we are more confident than ever that our target gross margins and that aggregate corporate gross margins 35 to 40 points will be met. In the short-term will you see some bumps in the road absolutely that to be expected but I think when you look at our cost reduction road map and if you look at where we are estimating prices to be we remain very confident that the long-term potential 35 to 40 points has never been as clear as it is today.
Krish Sankar :  And then last question from my end I understand that you did say that from a microinverter standpoint there is really no one who is as good as you guys I’m just kind of curious so look at your ASP on a dollar per watt basis I mean both year-over-year and sequentially it is down quite a bit. So I’m kind of curious like are you actually cutting prices to gain more share or there is something that’s going on a pressure from your customers to cut the pricing.
 Bank of America Merrill Lynch:  And then last question from my end I understand that you did say that from a microinverter standpoint there is really no one who is as good as you guys I’m just kind of curious so look at your ASP on a dollar per watt basis I mean both year-over-year and sequentially it is down quite a bit. So I’m kind of curious like are you actually cutting prices to gain more share or there is something that’s going on a pressure from your customers to cut the pricing.
Paul Nahi:  That’s a difficult question to answer what the nature of this market is that prices will come down year-on-year that’s not Enphase specific I think that is true for every part of the channel whether it’s customer acquisition cost whether it’s racking, whether it’s modules, whether it’s inverters. We certainly do our part to continue that. Will we use pricing strategically in some accounts, sometimes, will we always respond to pricing pressure from competitors, not always, but what we’re trying to do is keep a balanced portfolio that allows us to overtime continue to increase gross margins while growing our share as much as possible. This really underscores the balanced profitable growth strategy that we have. A decision to go big on growth at the expensive of gross margin would be a very easy one to make. A decision to get to our target gross margins at the expensive of growth is equally easy. What we’re faced with everyday it is a balance between the two and making decisions on growing our top-line as much as possible while seeing growth in the bottom-line as well. 
Operator:  And our next question comes from Vishal Shah of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. If your phone is on mute, please un-mute your line, if you are using speaker phone please lift your handset. I’m not receiving any response from the Shah line. I’m going to go to the next question. Our next question comes from Carlos Newall of Raymond James. Your line is open Carlos.
Carlos Newall :  I am speaking in for Pavel clearly your pricing seems to be holding up quite well despite the pressure in the U.S. inverter market related to the U.S. trade war with China, what do you see enabling the residential inverter market to sustain such high pricing when utility grade pricing is under such pressure?
 Raymond James:  I am speaking in for Pavel clearly your pricing seems to be holding up quite well despite the pressure in the U.S. inverter market related to the U.S. trade war with China, what do you see enabling the residential inverter market to sustain such high pricing when utility grade pricing is under such pressure?
Paul Nahi:  Well I think the residential pricing has been under a lot of pressure, it’s a different price point obviously than the utility scale inverters, but I think we’re seeing pricing pressure and we’ll continue to see pricing pressure, again not just in the inverters but along the entire value chain for resi, commercial and utility scale. The fact is the dynamics of the utility scale market are different than the residential market, the type of products and technologies are different which lends itself to a different cost point and the different price point. But I think we can assume that going forward as we have over the past seven-eight years that we will continue to see prices in all segments continue to come down.
Operator:  And our next question comes from Pierre Maccagno of Dougherty.
Pierre Maccagno : So, regarding most of your growth could you characterize it as mostly from your established customers or from new customers or how would you divide that?
Dougherty: So, regarding most of your growth could you characterize it as mostly from your established customers or from new customers or how would you divide that?
Paul Nahi: That’s actually a great question, it’s actually very exciting for us that our existing customers particular the ones in the U.S. residential market because the U.S. residential market is doing so well really are experiencing some tremendous amount of organic growth, it’s very exciting to watch their success and that’s certainly has been great for Enphase but in addition to that in the U.S. residential market in the U.S. commercial market in overseas, we continue to add new customers every single day. Big customers and small customers really in the residential space, in the commercial space our rate of increase in new customers continues to impress us and continues to grow and as we move into new geographies as we continue to go deeper into the geographies we’re in, I expect that rates to actually increase. So, it’s a bit of a mix bag but the good news for us is that both existing customers are doing extremely well and we’re adding to that customer list every day.
Pierre Maccagno : At this point how many customers do you have more or less?
Dougherty: At this point how many customers do you have more or less?
Paul Nahi: I actually don’t have a count but it’s in the many thousands.
Pierre Maccagno : Also regarding your SG&A, it was down as a percentage of revenue quite significantly, and so any explanation for that or going forward are you just seeing lower SG&A as a percentage of revenue?
Dougherty: Also regarding your SG&A, it was down as a percentage of revenue quite significantly, and so any explanation for that or going forward are you just seeing lower SG&A as a percentage of revenue?
Kris Sennesael: Well, it’s clearly the leverage in our operating expenses that we’re seeing here at work we had nice sequential revenue growth year-over-year revenue growth and we were able to leverage the infrastructure that we have especially in G&A but also to a certain extent in sales and marketing.
Pierre Maccagno : And my last question here is regarding the transition to the M250, when do you expect that to be fully transitioned and in terms of ASPs or gross margins is there a much of a difference between the 215 and the 250?
Dougherty: And my last question here is regarding the transition to the M250, when do you expect that to be fully transitioned and in terms of ASPs or gross margins is there a much of a difference between the 215 and the 250?
Kris Sennesael: Yes, it will take multiple quarters till that transition is fully completed. The main driver there is the adoption of higher power modules which is progressing but at a slow speed. So, we expect that adoption to continue over the next couple of quarter. For us that is a gross margin tailwind because the gross margin profile of the M250 is slightly higher than with the M215 and so we would benefit from the adoption of the higher power microinverter.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) I’m showing no further questions on the phone line. I’d now like to turn the call back over to Paul Nahi, CEO of Enphase Energy.
Paul Nahi: Thank you all for joining our call. The solar market represents an enormous growth opportunity. Our proven high technology business model combined with a balanced profitable growth strategy allows us to take advantage of this explosive market. Enphase has the technologies required for the next generation solar. I’m very proud of our third quarter financial results. And I’m looking forward to speaking with you again next quarter.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today’s conference. Thank you for your participation and have a nice day.

Paul Nahi: Good afternoon, and thanks for joining us today to discuss our second quarter 2014 financial results. As usual, I’ll start with my opening remarks and touch on some key highlights for the quarter and then Kris will take us through the second quarter financials and outlook for the third quarter. After that, we will open up the call for Q&A. We are very happy with our financial results for the second quarter of 2014. We reported record revenue of $82 million, an increase of 41% year-over-year and up 42% sequentially. This top-line performance was mainly driven by surging demand and strong business momentum in our core U.S. residential market, where Enphase is the leading inverter Company as well market share gains in the residential and commercial solar markets in the UK and Australia. The non-GAAP gross margin for the second quarter was also a Company record at 33%, representing a 490 basis point improvement over the second quarter of 2013. The combination of accelerated top-line growth and further gross margin expansion resulted in another quarter of positive non-GAAP operating income for Enphase. Kris will review the fine points regarding our second quarter financial results, but I will say that I am extremely pleased with our continued progress and momentum. The second quarter’s financial results reflect the growing demand for Enphase microinverter systems and our ability to execute on the key initiatives critical to our success. These key initiatives include, providing superior technology, reducing system costs, growing market share, expanding our geographic presence and continuing to chart our path to profitability and sustainable positive cash flows. I am pleased to share tangible evidence of the progress we’re making in these areas, and I am very proud of the entire Enphase team for their continued hard work and dedication. During the second quarter of 2014, we shipped a 132 megawatt, an increase of 54% year-over-year. Since inception, we’ve shipped over 1.2 gigawatts of Enphase microinverter systems. We are the highest volume inverter company in the world with more than 5.7 million units shipped, and Enphase Systems have produced over 2 terawatt-hours of clean energy. The global demand for solar continues to grow rapidly and is expected to be 49 gigawatts in 2014, an increase of over 30% compared to 2013. The U.S. solar market is especially robust. According to GTM Research, 2014 is expected to be another year of significant growth in the U.S. with a forecast of 6.6 gigawatts of PV installed, up 39% over 2013 and nearly double the market size in 2012.
 : To Enphase systems combines advanced hardware and software solutions to get solar professionals a competitive edge in their business. Installers are leveraging our Enlighten software to streamline the installation process, provide billing information, monitor those sites, as well as optimize operations and maintenance through automated fleet management. We made tremendous progress in many areas of our U.S. business during the second quarter as we continue to support our existing customers as well as look to new partners and markets and channel expansion as ways to accelerate our growth. We are very proud of our existing partnerships with the leading solar, installers and financing companies. They have been doing an amazing job in driving solar adoption by providing clean renewable energy hitting the consumer money every month. The solar financing landscape is evolving rapidly and Enphase is supporting our installers by developing partnerships with the most respective and innovative plans and companies in the world. We’re helping our residential and commercial installers by working with companies offering many different solar financing options, including leases, loans and innovative programs that offer system owners even more choices. For the U.S. commercial solar market, we recently announced our partnership with Technology Credit Corporation, a financial products and services firm, to offer financing packages for installer, integrators and customers in the small to medium size commercial solar PV market. Financing for the small to medium size commercial markets can be challenging and has been underserved. TCC’s experience in providing attractively priced, greater restructured financial packages to commercial installers and customers helps to fill a notable gap in the market. The new home market is another example of a relatively untapped channel in which Enphase is thriving. Lennar homes 20/20 program is a big success and they’re now expanding it into more in our communities. In addition, we’re partnering with other installers to address this growing market. For instance, Leonard Roofing, a regional California roofing and solar PV contractor, partnered with Bischoff Homes in Grover Beach, California and with California Home Builders, a Southern California real-estate development company, to install Enphase microinverter systems in their new housing developments. Projects such as these are further evidence that solar and Enphase Systems are being incorporated as a standard new home feature alongside LED lighting and energy efficient appliances. The reliability and ease of installation makes our microinverter systems uniquely suited to non-traditional markets as well. We’re partnering with local installers and financing companies in many island regions to promote the deployment of Enphase microinverter systems in those areas. As an example, we expanded our partnership with Sunnova by launching into the U.S. Virgin Islands, where Enphase microinverters will be Sunnova’s exclusive inverter for this region. We are proud to work with Sunnova to be the first to bring affordable energy to home-owners in the U.S. Virgin Islands. We recently formed a strategic agreement with North State Solar Energy, naming the company as an Enphase American Pride Partner for the installation of Enphase’s new American Pride Microinverters in commercial and residential solar installation, within key agricultural counties throughout Northern and Central California. As an American solar success story ourselves, we value North State Solar’s commitment to local communities and communities job preservation. An important attribute of our microinverter system is our ability to generate more energy than traditional inverters, providing our customers with a better return on their investment. This advantage have been recognized across the solar industry and is embedded in many solar calculators. As another example of this, we worked with ModSolar in a new partnership to further increase efficiency in the solar industry. Their software will incorporate Enphase Energy’s production calculations into the ModSolar platform so that proposals will reflect at the production boots their customers can achieve by installing an Enphase system. This partnership to get another way to advance solar growth as our technology masses solar installation more productive and easier to manage. Turing to our international business, we continue to be pleased with the top-line contribution as revenue in Canada, Europe and Australia was up 38% sequentially. During the second quarter, we started offering our fourth-generation Enphase system, the M250 Microinverter to the U.K., our core European markets and Australia. By leveraging the successful introduction of our fourth-generation system in the U.S. last year, we continue to raise the bar for inverter quality, performance and reliability in these regions. In Europe, we increased our market share and presence by leveraging existing partnerships and developing new ones. During the second quarter, I visited with several customers in Europe and came away more confident than ever that Enphase is posed for success. Our market share continues to increase and the Enphase brand is becoming very well known and respected in every market we are in. In Australia, we made great progress and post the strong second quarter results. Revenue in Australia was up 184% sequentially and we gain market share with some major residential installers and expanded our distribution channel by partnering with some well regarded industry players, including Australian Micro Inverters and Solar + Solutions, a subsidiary of L&H Group. We placed great importance on our distribution strategy and are pleased to partnering with companies such as these, who have the commercial breadth and depth needed to support our increasingly sophisticated installer network. Our market leading technology has been well received in both the Australian and New Zealand markets with our products being installed in a host of high profile sites such as the Richmond Football Club's iconic Punt Road Stadium, and a national New Zealand landmark, the Auckland War Memorial Museum. I’ll close my Q2 comments by acknowledging our outstanding financial results. Our quarterly top-line growth of 41% year-over-year, record gross margins and the healthy balance sheet highlight the success of our business model and our ability to execute. We have long believed that our high technology business model, world class products and superior customer support will help sustain our long-term growth, margin expansion and allow us to continually develop new and innovative products and systems. Now I will turn it over to Kris for his review of our financial results.

We have long believed that our high technology business model, world class products and superior customer support will help sustain our long-term growth, margin expansion and allow us to continually develop new and innovative products and systems. Now I will turn it over to Kris for his review of our financial results.
Kris Sennesael: Thank you, Paul. First, I will start by providing some more detail on the financial results for the second quarter of 2014, and then I will turn to the business outlook. As a reminder, the financial measures that I am going to provide are on a non-GAAP basis, unless otherwise noted. During the second quarter, we saw explosive growth in the solar market, resulting in accelerated demand for Enphase microinverter systems. Total revenue for the second quarter of 2014 was $82 million, exceeding the high-end of our revenue outlook of $69 million to $73 million that we provided last quarter. Revenue for the second quarter of 2014 increased 41%, compared to the second quarter of 2013. On a sequential basis, revenue was up 42% from the first quarter of 2014. As Paul mentioned, the large year-over-year and sequential revenue growth was driven by strong overall demand for solar in our core U.S. residential markets as well as growing demand for Enphase microinverter systems and increased contributions from our international markets, including the UK and Australia. We shipped 132 megawatts AC or a 152 megawatt DC during the second quarter of 2014, which is an increase of 54% on a year-over-year basis. The 132 megawatt shipped represents approximately 598,000 microinverters, of which, over 85% was our fourth-generation microinverter systems. We have now completed the switch to the fourth-generation system in U.S. and started the transition process in Europe and Australia as well. The U.S. market accounted for 85% of our total revenue in the second quarter, while international revenue was approximately 15% of total revenue. We saw a nice growth in the international markets, especially in UK and Australia, but currently our business in the U.S. driven by the strong business momentum in the residential markets, is growing slightly faster than our international business. Gross margin for the second quarter of 2014 was a Company high of 33%, an increase of 490 basis points compared to the second quarter of 2013 and an increase of 30 basis points compared to the first quarter of 2014, as our product cost reductions continue to outpace price reductions. Operating expenses during the second quarter of 2014 were $27 million. R&D expenses were $10.4 million. Sales and marketing expenses were $9.8 million and G&A expenses were $6.8 million. The increase in operating expenses was mainly driven by the higher R&D project expenses and compensation related costs, including an increase and catch-up of incentive accruals as well as certain new hires in support of the acceleration of our top-line growth and consistent with our balanced profitable growth strategy. These non-GAAP operating expenses excluded $2.3 million in stock-based compensation expenses. Our non-GAAP operating income for the second quarter was $6,000, resulting in our second quarter of positive operating income and in line with our breakeven model that we introduced one and a half years ago. For the second quarter of 2014, the net loss was $400,000 or a net loss of $0.01 per share compared to a net loss of $4.8 million or $0.12 per share in the second quarter of 2013. On a GAAP basis, the net loss for the second quarter of 2014 was $3 million or a net loss of $0.07 per share. Looking at the income statement on a year-over-year basis, I am very pleased with our top-line growth and gross margin improvements as well as a significant improvement to our bottom line. Turning to the balance sheet, cash flow from operations during the second quarter was almost breakeven while our net cash flow was negative $2.3 million. Day sales outstanding was 52 days and inventories on hand was 26 days. Capital expenditures during the second quarter of 2014 were $2.2 million and depreciation and amortization was $2 million. We repaid approximately $1.3 million of our existing term debt. We exited the second quarter with a total cash balance of $37.6 million and $6.5 million of term debt. As a reminder, our working capital facility remains undrawn. We remain confident that our cash position and credit facility, combined with our focus on working capital management and drive towards profitability, provide adequate liquidity to support the growth of our business. Now, let’s discuss our outlook for the third quarter of 2014. We believe the strong demand for our microinverter systems and favorable industry conditions provide the foundation for a strong third quarter. We expect revenue for the third quarter to be in the range of $93 million to $98 million. At the midpoint of the revenue outlook range, revenue would be up 54% compared to the third quarter of 2013. We expect gross margin to be within the range of 32% to 34% and we expect non-GAAP operating expenses to be approximately flat to up 4% compared to the second quarter of 2014, as we continue to invest in the Company’s growth. And now, I will open the line for questions.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) So we’ll take our first from Philip Shen from ROTH Capital Partners. Phil, please go ahead.
Philip Shen - ROTH Capital Partners: So you guys provided some great Q3 guidance. What are you seeing Q4 and how do you see it evolving given your discussions with your customers today?
Kris Sennesael: Well Phil, as you know, we only provide one-quarter at a time guidance. So I’m not really going to provide guidance here for the fourth quarter. Having said that just in general, if you look at the last couple of years and at the normal seasonal trends, we have seen anywhere -- fourth quarter is kind of a flattish quarter in terms of sequential growth compared to the third quarter, sometimes that has down 5% sequentially sometime it has been up 5% sequentially. And again I’m not providing any specific guidance for the fourth quarter, but that’s a normal seasonal trend.
Philip Shen - ROTH Capital Partners: Okay, great. And this one is for Paul, thank you Kris. Paul, can you walk us through your vision of how Enphase shapes involved solar financing, what is your view of how the no money down loan, for example, shapes the demand in the industry as we go forward here?
Paul Nahi: Sure. Well, I think it’s important to remember is that first of all, Enphase is completely neutral as to the forms of financing. We encourage all forms of financing available and are encouraged by the different unique and creative products that are out there. One of the advantages of an Enphase system is that we provide more energy for the owner of the system, so whether it’s a residential owner or a leased owner, the return on investment is simply going to be better with Enphase. The other advantage of Enphase system as it relates to alternative forms of financing, let’s say, non-leased or PPA forms of financing, is that the O&M, the operations and maintenance, associated with Enphase is much lower than it would be with a traditional inverter. As a result, it’s well within reach of a lot more people. As an example, the most recent announcement we made or one of the most recent announcements we made with Mosaic, included EES or Enphase Energy Services, which is where we will actually provide the support, the O&M, support for the customer. But our view, our long-term view, and this is true not just domestically but internationally, is that we will see a variety of financing options and they will likely change post the ITC expiration and what’s important for us is to make sure that we support each and every kind to make sure that our customers have every options available to them.
Philip Shen - ROTH Capital Partners: Great. One more and I’ll jump back in queue. Changing gears to the international exposure that you have. Can you talk about the market share that you had in UK and Australia in the quarter?
Paul Nahi: So, it’s too early for us to talk about specific market share numbers in those countries. What I can say is that they are increasing. We feel very good about the progress we’re making in terms of market share, in terms of brand recognition, in terms of our reach towards installers and distributors. What’s becoming very clear is that the value proposition that is resonating so well in the United States resonates equally with customers in the APAC region or the EMEA region. So, we remain more confident than ever of our ability to succeed and perform in these countries.
Operator: Okay, thank you. And we’ll take our next question coming from Colin Rusch from Northland Capital. So Colin, please go ahead.
Colin Rusch - Northland Capital Markets: Could you walk us through what’s going on with these accrued liabilities, it’s a pretty big jump there. Could you also give some detail on what’s happening there as well as with accounts receivable growing so much quarter-over-quarter?
Kris Sennesael: So first on the accrued liabilities, as you can see our operating expense came in at $27 million, that included some catch up on incentive accruals that end up in the accrual line. I think that was driving most of the increase there. In terms of receivables, obviously our top line was up 42% sequentially. That of course results in a higher receivable balance as well it’s slightly more than the 42% sequentially the receivables, some of the sales was in the second half of the quarter as the business continued to grow. We don’t see any collection issues with our one class customers that we have. So I think it’s part of growing so fast. We will have to continue to invest in working capital going forward.
Colin Rusch - Northland Capital: And then as you’ve continued to invest in R&D and the platform. Can you talk a little about what you are expecting to see come out of those efforts and spend obviously 20% on that R&D spend. Can you talk a little bit out the cost out programs and the cadence that you are expecting out of that? And how that is going to impact your gross margins going forward? And then what other programs you have on horizon that you can talk about now?
Paul Nahi: Sure. So it’s important to remember that we are first and foremost a high technology company in the solar space. As are result, innovation creation, this is very much a part of our DNA. What we have in the R&D pipeline right now are products that are very much along the lines of the microinverter itself, as it’s applied to the commercial space as it’s applied to the utility space. We obviously have next generation microinverters for the residential space that add features and functions as well as reducing costs. So there is a tremendous amount of work going on in all of these areas, all of its very, very exciting. And then there is a lot more that I am not at liberty to talk about at this moment. But what we’d love to do is just invite everybody to the Solar Power International Trade Show that’s occurring at the end of October, where we will be announcing some new products and introducing some new services. But it’s a mix of products along the lines of cost reduction, performance in future enhancements and looking at new areas, new spaces that round out energy management.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question is coming from Josh Baribeau from Cannacord. So Josh, your line is now open.
Josh Baribeau - Cannacord Genuity: Obviously given the strong guidance it doesn’t look like you are seeing any push outs of projects from the anti-dumping or countervailing measures that has come out. Just curious to hear your general thoughts on that and how it may affect you going forward?
Paul Nahi: Sure. So clearly pricing going up is not good for anybody in the industry. We all have a responsibility to continue to reduce prices, to make solar more affordable and more available to more and more parts of the world. However, what’s happening right now is certainly being recognized by Enphase and the entire solar industry. I think what’s important to note here is that industry in the United States is very robust, it has tremendous momentum and while it might be slightly affected by some of these numbers, I think overall we should not expect a very material difference to demand. Based on the latest data that we have, we think that the effect of these pricing changes could mean somewhere in the neighborhood of $0.10 a watt on the module side, which well meaningful is very likely not catastrophic. So we need to work hard to continue to reduce prices all of us, all the actors in the space. But I think again the industry and companies are mature enough and have enough momentum that they can withstand something like this.
Josh Baribeau - Cannacord Genuity: And back towards some of the discussions you were having on the different types of financing; do you have the level of visibility to either quantify the risk premium or ideally the decrease in the risk premium in the interest rates of Enphase solar systems? Do you have that level of granularity?
Paul Nahi: I don’t have that level of granularity available off hand right now. What I can say is that in many of these cases, the fact that Enphase produces more energy allows for a better rate of return for the both the owners of the system whoever that maybe, either the lease provider or the actual consumer. And because of the reliability which we have embedded many times with some of the largest financing companies in the world, allows for a better financing option at better financing terms for an Enphase system. So, I think we are in very, very good shape but I can’t quantify it exactly that you are asking for.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question is from Vishal Shah from Deutsche Bank. Vishal, please go ahead.
Jerimiah Booream-Phelps - Deutsche Bank: Hi, this is Jeremiah on the line for Vishal. May be just wanted to touch again on the international side of things. It sounds like you are progressing well there. Would your focus going forward be more along the lines of expanding market share in the existing international markets or potentially expanding the tank? Paul Nahi Both. We are very focused on establishing and growing the beach as we currently have in the APAC region in Australia as well as in EMEA which is both in the UK as well as France. We’re going to be expanding our market share in all the countries we are currently in but we really just started our expansion into Continental Europe, there are many countries, significant countries that we are not in. So we’re going to continue that geographic expansion as well. It’s important to note that Continental Europe especially is a bit of challenge to solar environment right now. So you are going to see some ups and downs there. However, we very firmly believe in the long-term potential of that market. So, we are going to continue to invest and grow the infrastructure there while we gain share, grow markets and then we can advantage of the growth that we see coming in the next few years.
Jerimiah Booream-Phelps - Deutsche Bank: And I guess along the same lines you are starting to get involved more in commercial. If you could speak of to the opportunity there, and kind of time horizon?
Paul Nahi : I can speak a part of that. So we definitely see a very large opportunity for Enphase in the commercial market, we already have a very sizable market share in this small commercial market. We have not really entered the large commercial market yet. Although we do have some large commercial installations, those and even the small commercial installations are effectively being done with our residential product. While we’ve said that several times now, is that we are well underway in the development of a purpose build commercial microinverter and not just the hardware sales but the entire system to support the commercial market. We have not announced the timing of that yet but the initial discussions with potential and solar partners as well as the progress we are making the engineering are both very positive.
Operator: Our next question comes from Pavel Molchanov from Raymond James. Please go ahead.
Pavel Molchanov - Raymond James & Associates: I know that you are not breaking out revenue by product or by segment. But can you give us a sense of kind of what percentage of your mix currently is hardware versus software or the new O&M revenues?
Paul Nahi: So, we don’t break that out, and part of the reason we don’t break that out is because we view it as a system. That when you are buying an Enphase System, you are buying the hardware; you are buying the monitoring platform. And in many cases for the installer they are leveraging our monitoring platform for their O&M infrastructure for filling for host of different reasons. So we don’t separate the two right now, we view it as a single system. And if you are referring to Enphase Energy Services that is still very young in development and as that progress we’ll provide more data on that.
Pavel Molchanov - Raymond James & Associates: And along the same lines, I know you’ve talked directionally in the past about potentially having some kind of additional revenue opportunity from selling analytics to utilities that kind of thing big data. What’s kind of latest on that front?
Paul Nahi: So there is actually a lot of work going on there. Again it’s interesting to note that at 500 gigabytes of data everyday Enphase collects and manages more data on a daily basis than Twitter does. So we actually have a tremendous IP infrastructure to support the data collection and analytics as well as the data itself. And we are exploring multiple ways to leverage that data into new customers and new markets. Again it’s a bit too early to have that discussion but I can say there is a lot of internal work going on to leverage this tremendous resource that we have.
Pavel Molchanov - Raymond James & Associates: So in other words you haven’t monetized that yet, but you hope do in the future?
Paul Nahi: Again I would quantify that, I think that the data has been monetized everyday through the microinverter itself. But if you are referring to the data only, that’s exactly correct.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Pierre Maccagno from Dougherty. Please go ahead.
Pierre Maccagno - Dougherty & Company: Do you have any comments on possible penetration into China?
Paul Nahi: So our first target in that region will very likely be Japan and we are still early in the exploration of that market itself. We are working through the technical issues; we are working through the go-to-market and partnership issues. We’re feeling very confident, but we’re not ready to making these specific announcements there yet. We do not as of now have any direct plans to get into China, clearly over time that will be an important market for us. But in the foreseeable future there is a lot of other low hanging fruit that we’ll be going after first.
Pierre Maccagno - Dougherty & Company: And then any comments on the SolarCity? I understand that you don’t use microinverters and can you expand on the possibility of this changing in the future or what are your thoughts there?
Paul Nahi: That sounds more like a question for SolarCity than it does for Enphase. What I can say is that we have the majority of the largest, most successful, the fastest growing companies in the U.S. and in the world right now use Enphase Microinverter Systems. They use it because it generates more energy, because it simplifies the installation process, they can become more efficient and of course in all the O&M ease of doing business on the operations and maintenance side as well. So we are very, very comfortable with the growth and customers that we have, the breadth of customers that we have and candidly the quality of customers. When you look at what we are doing with the very large vertically integrated installers that are just doing tremendously it’s very exciting. We have a two tier distribution strategy, and our distribution partners are also doing very, very well. Interestingly electrical distribution is really doing well, it’s really taking off and that’s addressing the small-to-medium size installers, which is growing also. So it’s a very wide and broad market and we are I think executing quite well and being able to attract the best from all these different segments.
Pierre Maccagno - Dougherty & Company: And my last follow up, touching again on the anti-dumping duties. Have you gotten any type of feedback from customers for any pricing pressure or these conversations, I mean are they taking place at all or not?
Paul Nahi: Are you referring to pricing pressure with Enphase or with the modules?
Pierre Maccagno - Dougherty & Company: For Enphase Microinverters.
Paul Nahi: So we have pricing discussions with all of our customers every day, that’s been going on for a seven, eight years now. Is there anything new happening there? No. The dynamics change year-to-year, quarter-to-quarter, but the fact is that we have to continuously work to reduce our costs. We’ve recognized that as our responsibility. And if you look historically, we have been able to significantly reduce our prices somewhere in the neighborhood of 10% plus on a year-over-year basis. So we take that responsibility seriously and we feel very good about our ability to maintain the pricing level that our customers are demanding.
Pierre Maccagno - Dougherty & Company: So as of now there is no effect of the anti-dumping duties then?
Paul Nahi: Again I am not sure how to answer that question. I think that there is very likely an effect. How big an effect that is probably questionable and how big of an effect that would have on overall demand is yet again different than how much of an effect that would have on Enphase. As far as we are concerned, as I mentioned earlier I do think that prices going up is not good and could have an effect on demand. However the industry is robust and strong and I think we can overcome this.
Operator: Thank you sir. (Operator Instructions). Our next question comes from Steve Baughman from Divisar Capital. Please go ahead.
Steve Baughman - Divisar Capital Management: Kris just a quick one. What’s the diluted share count going to be next quarter? It looks like you guys are probably going to be even GAAP profitable?
Kris Sennesael: So the basic share count is more like 42 million shares. If you add in the dilutive impact of equity instruments which are out there, you are looking more to like 47 million shares.
Operator: And that actually concludes our Q&A session for today. I’d like to turn it back to the host for any concluding remarks.
Paul Nahi: Thank you all for joining our call. All of us at Enphase are committed to developing successive generations of microinverter system expanding our technology leadership position growing our business in our core markets. All of us are looking forward to expanding into new geographies, new segments and exploring untapped market opportunities. Enphase is going to be exhibiting exciting new products at the Solar Power International Trade Show in Las Vegas on October 20th through 23rd and we hope to see you there. Thank you and we look forward to speaking with you again next quarter.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen at this time this does concludes our conference for today. Everyone have a great day. You may now disconnect.

Paul Nahi: Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today to discuss our first quarter 2014 financial results. We’re going to follow our usual format. I’ll start with my opening remarks and touch on key highlights for the quarter. Kris will go over the financials and business outlook, and then we’ll open up the call to Q&A. Enphase is off to a great start in 2014. By leveraging the business momentum upon entering the year and executing well on our global business strategy, we were able to deliver record first quarter results. Our revenue of $57.6 million, up 26% year-over-year was the highest for any first quarter in our company history and exceeded the top end of our financial outlook. In addition, we shipped 93 megawatts, which was an increase of 37% year-over-year. Demand was strong in our core North American residential markets, despite the severe weather conditions in Canada and the Northeastern United States. On the international front, our geographic expansion continues to go very well, as revenue in Europe and Australia was up 41% on a year-over-year basis. We’re pleased to see the meaningful top line contributions from our international expansion efforts. During the first quarter of 2014, we completed the initial resourcing of our Australian office, and recently announced the opening of our Melbourne headquarters, along with the appointment of our new General Manager for the Asia-Pacific region. We now have a solid beachhead to address the very promising Australian market, and we’ll use it as a springboard to address other opportunities in the region as well. Last month, I was in Australia and New Zealand as part of our media tour announcing Enphase’s increased presence and investment in the APAC region, along with our long-term commitment to these markets. To-date, we’ve received a great deal of positive feedback and enthusiasm from microinverter system, which is evidenced by the fact that we’re currently working with 11 of the top 25 installers in Australia. During my visit, I met with several of these installers and gained a better understanding of the market and legislative dynamics facing the Australian solar industry. So I came away encouraged that we’re poised to make great strides there. In the U.K., we made great progress and posted strong first quarter results. We expanded our distribution channel with the addition of five new partners, gained market share with some major residential installers and built out our sales team with the addition of some key personnel to address distribution, strategic accounts, inside sales and project development. These actions enabled us to gain significant traction in this rapidly growing solar market. Our revenue in the U.K. was up over 60% sequentially from the fourth quarter, and our market share now is estimated to be 7%. In Continental Europe, we’re doing well in a challenging market. We continue to build our customer base, recently adding five large vertically integrated installers in France. In the Netherlands, we recently celebrated our second year in the Dutch solar market with there now over 3000 Enphase systems installed. The Dutch market provides an excellent example of how quickly Enphase can grow in a region. We have extensive experience working with and providing the education and training for our distribution and installation partners, enabling them to quickly and efficiently design, install and manage their Enphase microinverter systems. On the whole, we’re very pleased and encouraged with the progress we’re making in expanding our geographic footprint, particularly in a rapidly growing Australia and U.K. markets. This has been one of our key initiatives and we expect a meaningful contribution from international markets during 2014 and beyond. Turning to the U.S., we’re making great progress with our North American financing initiatives. We continue to work with multiple financing partners providing loans, leases and other alternate forms of financing. In fact, last week we announced a significant milestone in our relationship with HERO or Home Energy Renovation Opportunity. HERO is the leading residential energy efficiency financing program, which enables homeowners to receive solar financing through Property Assessed Clean Energy or PACE. This allows them to pay for their solar system through their property taxes with tax deductible interest. More than 1,200 Enphase solar systems have been financed with the HERO program over the course of two years in Southern California by 131 different solar installers. Using Enphase’s Enlighten platform, HERO monitors production and reports the participating cities and counties. Due to the program success, it will be expanding beyond Riverside and San Bernardino and other California counties in 2014. This expansion will add to the more than $180 million of solar and energy efficiency loans to-date for the program, and is expected to create another 200,000 jobs annually. We’re very excited about our participation and the prospects of further leveraging PACE to make solar more affordable and within reach of more and more homeowners. The solar financing landscape is evolving rapidly and Enphase is well positioned to support our financing partners. We stated that one of our key initiatives is to lead the industry by advancing the application of technology. Our microinverter system has resulted in a fundamental shift in the solar industry and we’re pleased to have been recently recognized for our leadership role as an industry change agent. In April, Greentech Media named Enphase to the Grid Edge 20, as one of the 20 most innovative companies leading the charge into grid edge modernization. We have long belief that our differentiated strategy, leveraging a high technology business model will help sustain our long-term growth, margin expansion and allow us to continually develop new and innovative products. Continual innovation in hardware, software and services is part of our DNA at Enphase. In fact, our new fourth generation products, which includes the M250 and the M215 with Integrated Ground, represented a significant portion of our microinverter revenue in the first quarter of 2014, along with our efforts to change the industry through the advancement of technology, as we make solar energy more affordable and broadly accessible, our efforts to promote solar energy. One of our many projects in this area is our philanthropic partnership with GRID Alternatives, a non-profit that makes solar power and solar job training available to underserved communities. Over the last four years, GRID Alternatives and Enphase have powered over 1,000 low-income homes across the U.S., generating over $25 million in long-term savings to help these families pay for basic expenses. Our recently announced expanded partnership will serve an additional 350 to 400 families over the next 12 months, providing $10 million more in savings, while providing thousands of individuals with hands-on job training in the growing solar industry. I’ll close my Q1 comments by acknowledging the consistent improvement of our financial performance. Our quarterly top line growth of 26% year-over-year, further gross margin improvement, a healthy balance sheet and positive cash flow, all point to the success of our business model and our ability to execute. We’ll continue to work hard to sustain this performance. Kris will discuss our financials in more detail in a few moments. But before I turn it over, I’d like to provide a short industry update. When we hosted our Q1 2013 earnings conference call a year ago, I stated we were extremely bullish on the future of the solar industry due to multiple factors, including decreasing system costs, new strategies for lowering the cost of customer acquisitions and new financing vehicles that are helping take solar mainstream. We believe this is creating a foundation for explosive growth around the world. Escalating energy prices along with an increasing awareness of the environmental impact of burning fossil fuels were expected to result in increasing global demand for alternative energy solutions including solar. It appears these dynamics are gaining momentum. 2013 was a very good year for the global solar industry. For 2014, it’s looking even more promising. A recent solar industry report stated that every quarter in 2014 is forecasted to reach new highs. We have long believed that the future of the solar industry holds tremendous promise and Enphase is in a position to be a clear winner when this promise manifests itself. I believe it has now more than ever and are extremely excited about our prospects for the balance of 2014 and beyond. Now, I’ll turn it over to Kris for his review of our financial results.
Kris Sennesael: Thank you, Paul. First, I will start by providing some more detail on the financial results for the first quarter of 2014, and then I will turn to the business outlook and touch on the shelf registration we filed yesterday. As a reminder, the financial measures that I am going to provide are on a non-GAAP basis unless otherwise noted. During the first quarter, we saw strong business momentum that started in the fourth quarter of 2013 and has continued into the first and second quarters of 2014. Total revenue for the first quarter of 2014 was $57.6 million, beating the high-end of our revenue outlook of $54 million to $57 million that we provided during the previous earnings call. Revenue for the first quarter of 2014 increased 26%, compared to the first quarter of 2013. On a sequential basis, revenue was down only 14% from the fourth quarter of 2013, which is much better than the 20% to 25% seasonal decline that we have historical experienced during the first quarter of each year. This year we are seeing the impact of strong overall demand for solar in our core markets, as well as growing demand for Enphase microinverter systems and increasing contribution from our global expansion. We shipped 93 megawatts AC or approximately 107 megawatts DC during the first quarter of 2014, which is an increase of 37% on a year-over-year basis. The 93 megawatts shipped represents approximately 423,000 microinverters, of which, over 70% was our fourth generation microinverter systems, which includes the M250 and the M215 with Integrated Ground functionality. As Paul mentioned, first quarter demand was strong in the U.S. residential markets and across all geographies, except for Canada and the Northeast of the United States, which were down substantially on a year-over-year and sequential basis due to the severe and extended winter weather. During the first quarter of 2014, international revenue was approximately 15% of total revenue. Our revenue in Europe and Australia was up 41% year-over-year. In Europe, we are very pleased of the progress in the U.K., which was up over 60% from the fourth quarter of 2013. The first quarter of 2014 gross margin was a company high of 32.7%, an increase of 570 basis points, compared to the first quarter of 2013, and an increase of 40 basis points compared to the fourth quarter of 2013. As a reminder, during the first quarter of 2014, we implemented fair value accounting for warranty obligations, which resulted in approximately one point of gross margin improvements. Pricing during the first quarter of 2014 remained relatively stable and we continued to drive down overall product costs. Operating expenses during the first quarter of 2014 were $22.6 million, up $1.3 million or 6% from the fourth quarter of 2013. We made additional investments to support and drive international growth, as well as target some new market expansion opportunities. As reflected by our fast growing revenue number in U.K. and Australia, these investments are paying early dividends. For the first quarter of 2014, R&D expenses were $85 million. Sales and marketing expenses were $8.3 million, and G&A expenses were $5.8 million. These non-GAAP operating expenses did not include $1.9 million in stock-based compensation expenses. Our operating loss for the first quarter was $3.8 million, which was better than expected due to the strong top line performance and improved gross margins. For the first quarter of 2014, net loss was $4.1 million or a loss of $0.10 per share, compared to a net loss of $8.7 million or $0.21 per share in the first quarter of 2013. On a GAAP basis, the net loss for the first quarter of 2014 was $6.2 million or $0.15 per share. So when looking at the income statement on a year-over-year basis, I am very pleased with increases in our top line and gross margins, as well as significant improvements to our bottom line. Turning to the balance sheet. We once again did an excellent job of managing our working capital. Cash generation from operations during the first quarter was $4.3 million, while our net cash flow was $1.7 million. This marks the second straight quarter of positive cash flow. Our receivables and inventory metrics continued to be very good as we ended the quarter with DSO of 44 days and inventory on hand of 33 days. Capital expenditures during the first quarter of 2014 were $2.2 million, and depreciation and amortization was $1.9 million. We have repaid approximately $900,000 of our existing term debt. We exited the quarter with total cash balance of $39.9 million and $7.8 million of term debt. As a reminder, our working capital facility remains undrawn and we recently extended the maturity of this facility to November 2016. We remain confident that our cash position and credit facility along with our focus on working capital management and drive towards profitability provide adequate liquidity to support the growth of our business. In closing, I am very pleased with our first quarter results, reflecting Enphase strong business momentum as well as the solar industry in general. We believe the dynamics for the industry and Enphase looks favorable for the balance of 2014 and we will continue our efforts to improve our financial performance and expand our industry leadership position. Now, let’s discuss our outlook for the second quarter of 2014. We believe the strong demand of our microinveter systems and favorable industry conditions provide the foundation for a good second quarter. We expect revenue for the second quarter to be in the range of $69 million to $73 million. At the midpoint of the revenue outlook range, revenue would be up 22% compared to the second quarter of 2013. We expect the gross margins to be within the range of 30% to 33%. As previously stated, we are committed to drive further gross margin expansion with the timing of pricing actions and further cost reductions are not necessarily lined up on a quarter-to-quarter basis. We expect operating expenses to be up approximately 2% to 5% compared to the first quarter of 2014, as we continue to invest and accelerate the growth of the company. Finally before turning it over for questions, I want to point out that yesterday, we filed a shelf registration statement on the Form S-3 with the Securities and Exchange Commission for a secondary offering of up to 5 million shares held by our current stockholders. This registration is solely for the purpose of providing liquidity for early stage investments in Enphase who may wish to sell shares at sometime in the future. Enphase will not sell any shares and will not receive any of the proceeds from any potential offering under the shelf. And the total number of Enphase common shares outstanding will not change as a result of any potential offering under this shelf. The registration statement has been filed with SEC, but has not yet become effective. At the present time, the company has no specific plans to offer any of the securities covered the registration statement. And now I will open the line for questions.
Operator: Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Our first question is from Philip Shen with ROTH Capital. Your line is open.
Philip Shen – ROTH Capital Partners: Hi guys, thanks for taking my questions.
Paul Nahi: Sure.
Philip Shen – ROTH Capital Partners: I’d like to start off with the U.K. market. It seems like it was a great market for you in the quarter, and the market overall is doing quite well. You talked about your current market share being at 7%. How do you expect that market share to trend over the year, and can you comment on the overall market dynamics in the U.K. overall and how you’re positioned?
Paul Nahi: Sure. So we have been in the U.K. market for a relatively short period of time. And obviously you can see by our market share growth that the value proposition of the Enphase microinverter system has certainly resonated there. I think its resonating there for the same reason it resonates in the U.S., which is that we provide a better return on investment for the owner and we provide a more efficient, more profitable business for the installer. We do have a very well established team there that’s functioning extremely well. We expect the U.K. market to continue to grow. The dynamics there – the regulatory dynamics as well as the overall economic conditions are very positive. So we’re expecting that to continue to trend well. We’re not going to comment obviously on our market share position going forward, but I think if you look at the dynamics in general, it bodes very well for Enphase.
Philip Shen – ROTH Capital Partners: Okay, great. And in your PowerPoint deck I think you have the overall mix of gen four systems in 70%. Can you break out what it was for the M250 specifically, and how you expect that mix to change and trend over the year?
Kris Sennesael: Well, so the M250, the higher power inverter was approximately 20% of total units shipped. This is still relatively low number, mainly driven by the fact that the availability of higher power modules is very limited. And so we do expect overtime that the availability of the higher power modules will increase and so also our share of the M250 and the overall units shipped will further increase, but that will take multiple quarters going forward.
Philip Shen – ROTH Capital Partners: Great, thanks Kris. One more if I may, and then I’ll jump back in queue. There are a number of financing options available for homeowners to install solar in the U.S. How do you see PACE developments fitting to the overall mix on installations throughout the year? And over the long run, how do you expect PACE share to trend?
Paul Nahi: So that’s a great question. What we’re seeing right now which is very interesting is the proliferation of multiple types of financing vehicles that allows us, that allows the solar industry to reach more and more homeowners. PACE is a very interesting and a very powerful vehicle that allows the homeowner to apply the cost of solar to their property tax and get them tax deduction as well, the interest tax deduction on that as well, as well as amortizing the cost over 20 years. The PACE programs in California are going extremely well. As I mentioned in the call earlier, we talked about the fact that it’s in fact expanding into yet again more counties in California. And the fact is that PACE is actually enacted in I think approximately 10 states across the U.S. right now. So I think as the solar industry matures, we’re going to see more and more financing vehicles, whether its loans, whether its PACE and even some more yet to be built, that are going to allow solar to reach more and more households across a broader economic range.
Philip Shen – ROTH Capital Partners: Great. Thanks, Paul. I’ll jump back in the queue.
Paul Nahi: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question is from Krish Sankar with Bank of America. Your line is open.
Krish Sankar – Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Yes, hi. Thanks for taking my question. I had a couple of them. Number one, Paul, you articulated your international growth and your market share there. Kind of curious what do you think your market share is here in your home-based and along the same side, the trends that you’re seeing in markets like California and Arizona that are actually revising the net metering legislation?
Paul Nahi: So our growth in the U.S., we believe to be somewhere in the neighborhood of 40% of 50% of the North American U.S. residential markets. We’ve been fairly consistent there for the past couple of quarters. We have been attracting more and more installers. We’ve been working with more and financing partners. So I feel very good about our continued growth and the path in the U.S. In reference to some challenges to net metering, I think we’re going to see those challenges not just in California and Arizona but other states as well. However, the solar industry has tremendous momentum right now. And I think despite some of the challenges that the utilities are going to face in adopting a higher and higher degree of density of solar, we are going to find ways to work with these abilities to built business models that makes sense for both classes of companies. I don’t see in the short-term any material effect with these changes. Over time, it’s going to take a lot more negotiating at discussions, but I think the solar industry has done a good job in spearheading a lot of those discussions to-date. And I think we’re going to continue to do so.
Krish Sankar – Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Got it. And that’s very helpful. And then just quickly, I know you guys don’t give a full-year outlook, but is it fair to assume that your international revenue this year should be significantly higher than 2013?
Paul Nahi: Again, we’re not giving specific guidance. I think that if you look at the progress that we’ve made in the international market, the success we’ve had of both in communicating the value proposition as well as really outstanding execution in multiple markets, I think it’s fair to assume that overtime, our total share of revenue will become greater and greater from the international markets. How soon that occurs? It’s going to depend on many different factors including the growth in the U.S. market. So I would say that our prospects internationally have never been brighter, but I am not going to comment on the specific timing.
Krish Sankar – Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Got it. Fair enough. And then a final question for Kris. The OpEx going up 2 to 5 points and just kind of curious, how do you think about the split between R&D and SG&A? Is there more of a focus on R&D, given new product inclusive or is it just more SG&A leveling up as the sales goes up?
Kris Sennesael: No. It is an even split I would say between R&D and sales and marketing. We keep G&A relatively flat, but we definitely continue to invest in R&D and sales and marketing. R&D is of course very important as we want to continue to bring out new products and continue to work on driving down the profit cost, that’s definitely a key item and we’ll continue to invest in that. And then of course sales and marketing, especially in support of our international expansion. We’ll have 2% to 5% sequential increase. I think it’s very important, if you look at top line growth, where in Q1 we did 26%, in Q2 at the midpoint of the guidance we’re at 22%. We definitely want to continue to grow our top line and accelerate to grow the top line. And in order to do that, we will have to continue to invest in our operating expenses and support that, while at the same time of course driving leverage in the model. As you can see, we have build the increases we have in operating expenses that the rate of increase is much more than the rate of the increase in the top line. And so as such, we are driving leverage in the model.
Krish Sankar – Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Got it. Thank you very much guys. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Vishal Shah with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
Jerimiah Booream-Phelps – Deutsche Bank: Hi guys, this is Jerimiah on the line for Vishal. Thanks for taking my question and congratulations on the progress you’ve made.
Paul Nahi: Thank you.
Jerimiah Booream-Phelps – Deutsche Bank: I just wanted to touch on potential profitability outlook. Obviously no full guidance, but I think you guys are in breaking distance. Do you have any kind of way of thinking about that in terms of the timeframe there? Could we see that over the next couple of quarters potentially?
Kris Sennesael: So as you’ll probably remember in Q4 of 2013, we had our first profitable quarter from a non-GAAP operating income point of view and we were definitely very excited about that. In Q1, we are getting back to a quarter in which we have a loss, but Q1 is seasonally softer quarter. And we were down 40% on the revenue line sequentially, mainly because of it’s a soft first seasonal quarter. Going forward, when you look at the guidance, Q1, we guide for very strong top line growth. And there is still a range out there, right, from $69 million from $73 million with gross margin at 30% to 33% and operating expenses up 2% to 5%. But when you do the math, at the high-end of the guidance, we have a shorter profitability in the second quarter. Again, it will depend on where the actuals come out vis-à-vis the guidance that we provided here. And as we continue to grow the top line in the second half of the year and depending on what’s happening from a margin point of view, we definitely are committed to further drive gross margins, but there is a lot of elements that go into the equation there for gross margin to this pricing and pricing pressure, and we will continue to drive down our product costs with some modest increases in operating expenses to support the current and future growth of the company. I do think we have the right mix there to continue to drive towards profitability.
Jerimiah Booream-Phelps – Deutsche Bank: Okay, great. Yes, it sounds like you can get there pretty sustainably in the future. And on that note, as the international market expands, maybe could you just touch on the dynamics there and how that might be affecting your margins, both from an overall perspective and also as you’re entering the new markets?
Paul Nahi: Sure. So the margin picture is very complex. It involves different products, product mixes, geographies, different market segments. So it’s very hard for me to provide sort of guidance by one particular geography or by one particular market segment. What I would say just in general is that the high technology business model that we have, it’s very semi-conductor focused. That allows us to apply R&D to further reduce our costs, and has given us a great deal of confidence that we’re going to be able to continuously reduce our costs and stay ahead of the price reduction. Having said that, whether or not it happens on the same quarter, that we’ve always said that’s really not something we can predict, but over the long-term we’re feeling very good about it. So in general, we have seen in the past, anywhere between 6% and 14% ASP reductions year-on-year, and we’ve been able to keep pace with that with yet again more in cost reductions. And we feel confident that over the long run, we’re going to be able to maintain that trend.
Jerimiah Booream-Phelps – Deutsche Bank: Okay, thanks. That’s helpful. And just one last quick question. Do you have any specific plans to enter some of the big markets internationally such as Japan, Germany or Italy?
Paul Nahi: The short answer to that is yes. We absolute plan to expand into the rest of Continental Europe. We are in active discussions with several potential partners for Japan. We’re investigating the Japanese regulatory environment as well. We have, as Kris has mentioned before, really embarked upon a path of profitable growth, which means we have to be careful about not letting OpEx get too far ahead of growth, but having said that, we have been very, I think aggressive in our international expansions to-date and we’re going to continue that same level of expansion into yet again new countries, again both in Europe and outside.
Jerimiah Booream-Phelps – Deutsche Bank: Thanks guys.
Paul Nahi: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Timothy Radcliff with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
Timothy Radcliff – Morgan Stanley: Hi guys. Thanks for taking the question. I just had a couple quick ones on your customer mix. So, the first one is in terms of the mix of customers and specifically installers versus third-party tech leasing players. Can you talk about how much of your capacity today is going towards the former versus later?
Paul Nahi: So we don’t break out the specifics there. What I would say just in general is that we are working with almost every significant financing partner in the U.S. right now. The value proposition is working very well with that. We’re continuing to add new partners all the time. We talked about HERO and PACE. And there are yet again new forms of financing that are going to be coming online that we should be able to talk about in the near future as well. So, well, again I can’t break out the specifics. I can’t say that our progress in the financing market is going extremely well.
Timothy Radcliff – Morgan Stanley: Great. And then as a follow-up, can you maybe talk about your share within some of your top customers and kind of the outlook for that share? I know at the time of the IPO you talked fair amount about some customers that will use so much Enphase product, that they were using it exclusively. Are all of those relationships still intact, and then maybe with regards to some of the other customers that maybe don’t use the Enphase 100% but they represented a large amount of your volume, how are those relationships going?
Paul Nahi: In general, I’d say that the relationships that we’ve had remain intact that we’re seeing some of our very large customers are expanding and continuing to use Enphase. Some are 100% Enphase, some are less so, some will make decisions for supply issues. It’s very hard to sort of talk about the customer base in general, because each of our customers has a very different business model and a different way of approaching it. But our relationships with certainly all of our major customers, and I’d say the vast majority of our customers in general is stronger than it’s ever been and remains a very powerful portion of our value proposition.
Timothy Radcliff – Morgan Stanley: Great. Thank you for the info, and congrats on the strong quarter.
Paul Nahi: Thanks very much.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question is from Pavel Molchanov with Raymond James. Your line is open.
Pavel Molchanov – Raymond James: Hi guys. You know me. I ask this question at every earnings call. Competitive landscape, Power-One, SMA, any startups popping up that are giving you guys any headaches?
Paul Nahi: So if you’re referring to the competitive microinverter landscape, the answer is no. Although Power-One, ABB and SMA and other competitors have their micros that have been actively marketing them for sometime now. They just haven’t received any significant traction. Having said that and as we said on I think just right every call as well is that given this wholesale shift to microinverters, and we’re seeing that in every country we’re going to and we’ve already talked about why that’s occurring, the value proposition that’s accelerating that, there is no question that we will eventually see it, whether it’s their second, third or fourth generation product, we certainly overtime expect to see it, which is why we continuously invest in R&D, which is why we are staying ahead of the technology curve on microinverters, on software, on services and a broad array of products. But having said that, as of today, we’re not seeing any meaningful competition. The competition that we’re seeing really is primarily coming from traditional string inverters.
Pavel Molchanov – Raymond James: Okay, understood. And pricing for either your specific product mix or I guess, how should we think about that heading into the, maybe next six to 12 months?
Paul Nahi: So we don’t forward announce any pricing as I said in the past. And in fact I said on this call, on average, if you look historically, we’ve reduced our pricing anywhere between probably call it 6% and 14% per annum. We have been able to maintain a cost reduction ahead of that. So you’ve seen a gross margin expansion, but again we don’t give any forward pricing, but we think that our ability to continuously reduce our price and reduce our cost provide a better value to the installer and provide a better value to consumer will continue unabatedly.
Pavel Molchanov – Raymond James: Okay. I appreciate it guys.
Paul Nahi: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Our next question is from Paul Strigler with Esplanade. Your line is open.
Paul Strigler – Esplanade Capital: Hi guys. Couple of quick ones. One, it looks like despite sort of your 6% to 14% guidance for ASP declines, prices are hanging in there pretty well, at least if I do the quick math. Is there anything we should know about that’s sort of supporting pricing? It looks like it was only down, what like, 1% or 2% Q-over-Q. Is it gen four mix or is it just demand in supporting the current pricing?
Paul Nahi: So just to clarify one thing, the 6% to 14% is actually not guidance. That’s all historical.
Paul Strigler – Esplanade Capital: Understood.
Paul Nahi: Yes. But in reference to your question, it’s a combination. We’ve been able to continue our path of cost reduction. The value proposition is resonating. We’ve been able to maintain a relatively stable ASP, the product mix, the geographies have been in our favor. Again – and I think we’re very proud of what we’ve done so far, and I think it’s been – the results have been outstanding. But having said that, going forward, you may see a quarter or two where there are variations in gross margins, because we can’t time the cost reduction to the price reduction, but the overall trend which you’ve seen over the past number of years, again we feel confident will continue.
Paul Strigler – Esplanade Capital: Great. And then just a question on the U.S. trade case. Are you guys seeing from any of your partners sort of an acceleration of projects in Q2 before the June, and I think [indiscernible] gotten delayed till July, but any acceleration of projects or shipments for you guys into Q2 ahead of the trade case or it’s sort of – all sort of status quo is persisting?
Paul Nahi: I’d say in general, it’s more status quo than not. We have heard of some incidences where some things have been expedited, but I think for the most part we haven’t seen any significant change in demand related to the trade case.
Paul Strigler – Esplanade Capital: Great. And then one last question. So some of the Hawaiian markets, so it looks like the Public Utilities Commission there is finally going to make HECO actually – that project proceed on a regular basis now. When do you guys sort of expect that to I guess turn into more shipments in the Hawaiian market? I know they’ve been sort of stalling a lot of folks with these interconnection studies, but it looks like that’s going to be sort of – that’s going to subside a little bit at least it sounds like?
Paul Nahi: So we’re actually very close with HECO. We’re working with them on several issues right now. And again it’d be very hard to predict when they decide to make any particular change. What we’re working with them on is our ways to help them stabilize their grid with the concentration of solar that they have. So a lot of technologies that are required to make this happen, we have several programs ongoing with them as we speak. I believe that HECO has very much the right intention. They are wrestling with sort of the dynamics of their existing grid and the advent of solar on that grid, but I’m optimistic that in the long-term we’re going to get through a lot of these technical issues and Hawaii will resume a very rapid growth.
Paul Strigler – Esplanade Capital: Great. Thanks guys. Great quarter.
Paul Nahi: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question is from Colin Rusch with Northland Capital. Your line is open.
Colin Rusch – Northland Securities: Thanks guys. As you’re looking at the diversity of markets, you’re making some good headway in the U.K. as well as in Australia. Can you give us an update on, where you’re at with Japan and how do you see the back half of the year playing out in EMEA?
Paul Nahi: Sure. So I’ll address Japan first. As I had mentioned a bit earlier, we are, and will continue to be very active in our global expansion. What we have seen over the past 12 to 18 months is that the value proposition of an Enphase microinverter system really doesn’t change depending on the geography that you’re in, being able to provide a better return on investment for the owner of the system, being able to provide a simpler and easier design and installation methodology resonates. Japan is a very challenging market for an American company to break into. We know that. A lot of us on the executive team have had experienced working in Japan. So we’re doing the right thing, which is working with right now potential partners to find out that right engagement that will help accelerate our instruments into the Japanese solar market. And we’re working with the appropriate regulatory agencies, JET and others, to make sure that we abide by any of the local rules required for microinverter systems. I am confident long-term that we’re going to be a big player in the Japanese market. Given some of the challenges there, it’s a little bit harder to predict when that’s going to happen, but there is a lot of work with Enphase to make that happen as quickly as possible. In terms of the rest of Continental Europe, we certainly recognize that Germany and Italy are very big markets. And again we don’t preannounce the launch of a particular geography before it happens, but having said that, we have been very clear that we expect to be in every significant solar country across the world over time. And we’re going to do it in a way that continues our profitable growth strategy.
Colin Rusch – Northland Securities: And can you talk about the dynamics around monetizing the grid stability and the communications functionality that you guys have? It seems to me that the lot of value that you’re providing that you’re not necessarily monetizing with some parties just...
Paul Nahi: It’s needed and wanted [ph] by multiple constituents. Putting in a format that makes sense, finding a business model that makes sense, it may take a little bit of time, but we do believe that every day, as we collect 400 gigabytes of data every day, we’re adding to a database that will absolutely be able to help utilities stabilize the grid and know what’s happening in any particular area. And hopefully that will also provide an easier way for more and more concentration of solar as well.
Colin Rusch – Northland Securities: Great. I’ll take the rest of it offline. Thanks so much, Paul.
Paul Nahi: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Just one moment while we wait for questions. All right, I’m not showing any further questions at this time. Please proceed with any closing remarks.
Paul Nahi: Thank you all for joining our call. 2014 is off to a great start. We’re encouraged by the positive industry outlook for the balance of the year and believe this outlook reflects the improving dynamics for the global solar industry as the true economics of solar power are becoming more fully appreciated. We remain bullish on the industry and are confident in Enphase’s ability as an industry leader to create shareholder value. Thank you. And we look forward to speaking with you again next quarter.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today’s conference. This does conclude the program. And you may all disconnect. Everyone have a great day.

And now, I would like to introduce Paul Nahi, Chief Executive Officer of Enphase Energy. Paul?
Paul Nahi: Thank you. And welcome to everyone joining us for our fourth quarter and full year 2013 earnings call. I'm going to start with a general overview of our fourth quarter performance, and then provide a recap of 2013. After that, Kris will take us through the financials, and we will go to Q&A. We closed 2013 on a distinctly high note for an exceptional fourth quarter having achieved several key milestones. Our fourth quarter revenue was a record $67.1 million as we shipped over 100 megawatts AC of microinverter systems for the first time in any one quarter. This top line performance was mainly driven by healthy demand and strong business momentum in our core U.S. residential market. Gross margin for the fourth quarter was also a company record coming in at 32.3%, marking the first time we've exceeded the 30% threshold and representing 430 basis points improvement over the fourth quarter of 2012. Combined with our ongoing focus on expense management, we delivered an operating profit of $400,000 and positive cash flow from operations of $7.6 million. This is the first quarterly operating profit in Enphase's history, and a major achievement for the company. Kris will go through more of the fine points regarding our fourth quarter and fiscal year financial results, but I will say that we are very pleased with our ongoing progress. This quarter's results demonstrate the power of the Enphase business model, the demand for Enphase systems around the world, and importantly our ability to execute on key initiatives. We are extremely pleased to have achieved these milestones during the fourth quarter, and I am very proud of the entire Enphase team for their great work in making this happen. In addition, we exited 2013 with strong business momentum and a very solid business and operational foundations that will enable our continued success. We are well positioned for 2014 and off to a great start for the New Year. Since the beginning of Enphase, back in 2006, we have consistently made tremendous progress and our impact on the global inverter and solar industry has been nothing short of disruptive. We have introduced a system-based high technology approach to solar energy generation, which formally did not exist and is transforming the industry. Our value proposition is being embraced by a growing number of global industry participants that has resulted in Enphase rising to become the leading inverter technology used on homes in the Americas. Since inception, we've shipped over 1 gigawatt AC or 1.2 gigawatts DC of microinverter systems. We are by far the highest volume inverter company with more than 5 million units shipped. We also passed the key milestone of 1 terawatt-hour of clean energy produced by our microinverter systems. We continue to build a strong Enphase brand in 2013, both domestically and in the global markets. In the U.S. residential market, we continue to grow our business and increase our market share to become the number one inverter company. We estimate that our market share in the U.S. residential market is over 45% by megawatts and over 50% by revenue. Internal data obtained through our Enlighten monitoring software reflects that our installations in the U.S. residential market showed very impressive growth of about 45% in 2013 year-over-year as we solidified our position as the dominant inverter technology in this market segment. Let's speak to the value of our microinverter system, which is being embraced by our growing customer base including thousands of small, medium and larger installers along with third-party financing companies. During 2013, we experienced even higher growth rates in our businesses outside of the U.S. despite some challenging market conditions as a result of uncertain and declining government incentives. We believe that markets such as the U.K. and Australia represent tremendous opportunities, and we are very excited about our progress there. Both markets have large relatively stable residential and commercial solar businesses. In the U.K., we have made great strives in developing the Enphase business by creating brand awareness, building out a distribution network, and most important of all, developing relationships with installers through education, training, and providing the world's most advanced inverter technology. As a result, we estimate our residential market share in the U.K. has grown to over 6% in the fourth quarter of 2013. In Australia, we have established our team, the corporate infrastructure and are rapidly making an impact. We are now poised for significant market share growth. As in other countries, which are being both the residential as well as the commercial markets, in fact in December the largest Enphase array in Australia, a 100 kilowatt installation was completed for the Glenlyn care facility in Melbourne. We look to build on this success and others as we continue to grow our business in Australia in 2014. So in summary, our 2013 international business showed strong growth and we believe we are well positioned for substantial contribution from our international business segments in 2014 and beyond. During 2013, we continue to look to new partners, markets and channels to accelerate our top line growth. One of these channels is new homebuilders, which is highlighted by our strategic relationship with Lennar, one of the largest homebuilders in the country. The Enphase microinverter system provides the flexibility, performance, quality and monitoring capabilities that have helped Lennar in the rapid expansion of their very successful Sun Street program. Nearly 820,000 home starts are projected in the U.S. for 2014, and this relationship offset the course for advancing solar energy adoption in new homes across the country. In addition to our initiative with new homebuilders, we recently announced that we are working with Ingersoll-Rand Nexia Intelligence to evolve smart home energy monitoring. These collaborative efforts are into integrating performance data from rooftop solar systems using Enphase microinverters with home automation systems and making it accessible via the Nexia Home Intelligence platform. This provides yet another example of how Enphase continues to expand its offerings for U.S. residential solar customers. Product development and innovation continued to be at the heart of what we do at Enphase. In 2013, we successfully introduced our fourth generation product, the M-250, to the U.S. market to augment our highly successful third generation product, the M-215. In addition to providing better performance and supporting higher output panels, the M-250 has features that reduce requirements for both labor and material decreasing the cost per watt of our microinverter system, while at the same time being accretive to gross margin. In early January of 2014, we announced the expansion of the Enphase system with new hardware and software products. Two examples of new hardware products include a Wi-Fi option for the ongoing communications gateway and the new M-215 microinverter with integrated ground. The Wi-Fi option provides greater flexibility and reduced installation time. The new M-215 now includes our Integrated Ground Technology eliminating the need for a separate copper wire to be attached to each microinverter which saves both labor and material. These features introduced with the M-250 in 2013 are now included in the complete Enphase microinverter product family in North America. Along with these products, we also introduced the two new Enlighten software products MyEnlighten and Enlighten Manager, which will further improve the solar consumers experience and the installers’ installation and management of their fleet of systems. MyEnlighten has been specifically designed for the educational and informational needs of solar homeowners, while professionals using Enlighten Manager will see new sophisticated web-based software tools to help them more efficiently and effectively install and manage their solar systems. As an example, Enlighten Managers will help installers identify, confirm, and prioritize maintenance needs across multiple installations, thereby reducing O&M costs. These recent introductions demonstrate our commitment to the development of new products, which include performance, enhance our customer experience, and reduce cost throughout the value chain. These efforts are ongoing and are in addition to our continued development of successive generations of microinverter systems. In closing, 2013 was another year of growth, global expansion, technical accomplishment, the achievement of significant financial milestones, and the continued success of our high-technology business model. It required a lot of hard work, cleverness, as well as the grid and perseverance of the Enphase team. Looking forward to 2014, the business environment for solar appears to be stronger than ever and so is Enphase. We are eagerly anticipating our new challenges and opportunities as we continue to spearhead the industry's transition to micorinverter systems. We are poised to deliver strong results and continue to execute on our balanced profitable growth strategy. And with those comments, I'll turn it over to Kris.
Kris Sennesael: Thank you, Paul. First, I'll start by providing some more detail on the financial results for the fourth quarter of 2013, touch on some of the full-year results, and then I will turn to the business outlook. As a reminder, the financial measure that I am going to provide are on a non-GAAP basis unless otherwise noted. During the fourth quarter, we experienced better than expected strong business momentum. Total revenue for the fourth quarter was $67.1 million, exceeding the high-end of the revenue outlook of $62 million to $65 million that we provided during the third quarter earnings call. $67.1 million of revenue is a new company record, up 8% compared to the third quarter of 2013, and an increase of 16% year-over-year. We shipped approximately 107 megawatts AC or 123 megawatts DC during the fourth quarter, which is an increase of 14% over the third quarter of 2013, and an increase of 30% on a year-over-year basis. The 107 megawatts shipped represents roughly 485,000 microinverters, of which approximately 20% were our fourth generation microinverter systems. Revenue from outside of the U.S. represents approximately 15% of total shipments. Fourth quarter gross margin was a record of 32.3%, an increase of 400 basis points compared to the third quarter of 2013, and an improvement of 430 basis points compared to the fourth quarter of 2012. Our ongoing gross margin improvement has been exceptional, driven by ongoing cost reductions and higher volumes. To provide some perspective, this quarter's gross margin of 32% compares to 8.3% in the first quarter of 2010. Operating expenses during the fourth quarter were $21.3 million, up slightly over the third quarter mainly as a result of semiconductor tape-out related engineering expenses. R&D expenses were $8.2 million. Sales and marketing expenses were $7.7 million, and G&A expenses were $5.4 million. These non-GAAP operating expenses did not include $1.8 million in stock-based compensation expenses. As Paul noted, in the fourth quarter, we posted the first quarterly non-GAAP operating profit in the company's history. Our top line growth and gross margin expansion combined with our efforts to keep operating costs relatively flat resulted in an operating profit of $400,000. This provides some insight into the leverage of our business model as we were able to post our first quarterly operating profit on $67 million of revenue. For the fourth quarter of 2013, net loss was $700,000 or a loss of $0.02 per share. On a GAAP basis, the net loss was $2.8 million or $0.07 per share. In addition to our strong top and bottom line performance, we did an excellent job of managing our balance sheet in the fourth quarter. Cash flow from operations during the fourth quarter was $7.6 million, while our net cash flow was $6.3 million, due primarily to improved financial performance and management of our receivables and inventory. We ended the quarter with DSOs of 44 days, and inventory on-hand of 33 days. Capital expenditures during the fourth quarter were $1.4 million, and depreciation and amortization was $1.9 million. We repaid approximately $600,000 of our existing term debt. As a result, the company exited the year with a total cash balance of $38.2 million and $8.7 million of term debt. As a reminder, our working capital facility remains undrawn and we recently expanded the maturity of this facility to November 2016. Closing on my fourth quarter summary, we have repeatedly stated we have line-of-sight to profitability and positive cash flow. This quarter's results underscores the progress we have made. We still have more work to do to improve on this quarter’s result and make them sustainable, but we believe we are well on track to achieve this goal. Now, I would like to talk about a few of the full year highlights, starting with the top line. Full year 2013 revenue is $232.8 million, up 7% compared to 2012. However, keep in mind that during 2012, we benefited from the 1603 Cash-Grant Program that expired at the end of 2011. As a result of this, we recognized approximately $28 million of incremental revenue during the first and second quarter of 2012. Some of those units were installed during the second half of 2012, but a large part of them were being installed during 2013 or later. Excluding the 1603 units, revenue which have been up approximately 23% on a year-over-year basis, which we believe is a better representation of our true growth story. This is also clearly demonstrated in the continuous high growth that we experienced in installations. Fortunately, the 1603 effect is largely behind us, and year-over-year revenue growth comparisons going forward should no longer be materially impacted by this. Turning to gross margins, our performance in 2013 expanded our track record of remarkable improvements in an industry that is seeing eroding gross margins in general. Our fourth quarter gross margin of 32.3% is a company highlight and with our full year gross margin of 29.1%. We continue to make good progress towards our target of 35% to 40%. Our ability to expand gross margins based on our balanced pricing actions and continuous focus on cost reductions through innovation in our semiconductor-based product platform is a clear differentiator for Enphase. Also, 2013 was a year where we shifted our focus from investing in operating expenses to leveraging the infrastructure that has been put in place. For the full year, our operating expenses totalled $82.5 representing only $1 million increase over 2012. We have implemented the financial discipline that will help guide our spending as we move forward. With that said, we expect 2014 to be a year where we make some incremental investments in operating expenses to continue to fuel top line growth. We expect these investments to be modest and will be aligned with supporting efforts around driving profitable growth. Finally, turning to cash flow and liquidity, we made great progress in 2013 approaching breakeven in cash flow from operations. Our top line growth, improved margins and financial performance and focus on working capital management resulted in a full year cash flow from operations of negative $900,000. In addition, our low CapEx model based on outsourced manufacturing resulted in $6.3 million of capital expenditures for the year. We closed the year with $38.2 million of cash. And we believe that our cash on-hand combined with our committed credit facility and improved cash flows gives us ample liquidity for the foreseeable future. Paul noted that 2013 was a pivotal year for us. The key element of this is our significantly improved financial profile, which positions us well to participate in what is projected to be a very strong 2014 for the solar industry. Before turning to our outlook for Q1, I'd like to take a moment to discuss an accounting change that we are making, effective this January 1, 2014. This change will affect how we will account for the warranty obligations on our microinverters going forward. To-date, we have recognized warranty obligations on a undiscounted cost basis. These undiscounted obligations are then settled over a term of up to 25 years. Effective January 2014, we have elected to account for such warranty obligations on a fair value basis. It should be noted that this election is applied on a prospective basis only and will not apply to the warranty obligations incurred prior to January 1, 2014. Under the fair value accounting, warranty obligations will be presented on a discounted net present value basis at time of sale. These obligations will then be accreted up to their undiscounted cost over the warranty term. We believe the election to present warranty obligations on a fair value basis more accurately reflects the time value of money associated with obligations that are settled over a longer period of time. Now, let's discuss our outlook for the first quarter of 2014. The first quarter of every year is typically a soft quarter due to weather and all the seasonal threats. However, we continue to experience strong business momentum. As a result, we expect the revenue for the first quarter to be in the range of $54 million to $57 million. At the midpoint of the revenue outlook range, revenue is up 22% compared to the first quarter of 2013. Regarding gross margin, we expect the gross margin to be within a range of 30% to 33%. This also includes the improvements in gross margins of approximately one percentage point as a result of the introduction of fair value accounting for warranty expenses on a going forward basis. We also expect operating expenses to be up approximately 5% to 8% compared to the fourth quarter of 2013 as we continue to invest in the growth of the company. And now I will open the line for questions.
Operator: Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Philip Shen from ROTH Capital.
Philip Shen - ROTH Capital: Hi, guys. Congrats on the performance in the quarter, and especially the margins.
Paul Nahi: Thank you.
Philip Shen - ROTH Capital: Let's talk about 2014 if we can. You’ve got into Q1 clearly -- how should we think about revenue growth in '14? And how, perhaps your international exposure changes because I think you had about 15% mix of international sales in Q4. What are your thoughts on how this evolves in '14 and perhaps what overall revenue growth might be relative to consensus of just around north of 20%?
Paul Nahi: Sure. So, clearly we only guide to the current quarter. So, I can't give you any definitive numbers beyond that. But what I can say is that if you look both historically and what we are doing in the current quarter, you will see tremendous momentum both in our core markets in the U.S. as well as what we are seeing as really fantastic growth outside of the U.S. as well. We expect the momentum both domestically and internationally to continue, and as we continue to build out our operations overseas and continue to invest in new go-to-market channels in the United States, I think we are very comfortable with the current growth path.
Philip Shen - ROTH Capital: Okay. I think given your guidance for Q1, can you just share with us perhaps what the Gen 4 mix of shipments might be that's baked into guidance?
Kris Sennesael: In the fourth quarter, roughly 20% of our shipments were fourth generation. And looking forward to Q1, we expect approximately the same, maybe slightly up -- when you look at the fourth generation, especially the M-250, shipments there are driven by the availability of the higher power modules, and unfortunately in our core markets, the U.S. residential market, there is not a lot of demand for the higher power modules right now. We expect that to continuously increase over time, but for now, there is not a lot of economics that support the use of those higher power modules. And as a result of that, most of our customers continue to use the 250-260 watt DC modules and pair them with our M-215.
Philip Shen - ROTH Capital: Okay. And what do you think what will it take to shift the U.S. market to the higher wattage panels?
Paul Nahi: That's really up to the installers and the module manufacturers. What we have seen is that economics of the lower power modules are better and are quite good right now. I think as the higher power modules will scale up in production, we should see efficiencies there, we should see cost come down there, and I think you will see a more rapid migration. But importantly for Enphase, we are a little bit ambivalent while we would love to see the continued adoption of higher modules, higher power modules. We have a very broad product offering that allows the installer to exactly tailor the installation to the module and the inverter and make sure that it is as efficient as possible for their consumer.
Philip Shen - ROTH Capital: Okay. That's helpful, Paul. How long do you think the transition might take? Originally, you guys were thinking a year. Is it the case that we could see the 215 and the 250 available for another year or even two together?
Paul Nahi: Distinctly possible. Again, since we don't really control the higher, the volume with the higher up of modules or the prices higher up with modules, all we can really do is provide the commensurate inverter for them, which we do. But it looks like certainly throughout the 2014, you are going to see the M-215 do quite well and possibly into 2015.
Kris Sennesael: All right. And I would like to add there. We will of course continue to drive down the unit cost, the product cost of the M-215 down. We announced now the availability of the M-215 with the Integrated Grounds feature, and so we definitely will continue to push hard and drive down the cost of that product as well.
Philip Shen - ROTH Capital: Great. Shifting gears, I think last quarter you guys had, maybe 15% of your sales going to the commercial market. So, I think you are talking about 15% to 20% of your shipments could become -- or could go into the commercial market. What's your view on that now? How is that mix evolving? What are your thoughts there?
Paul Nahi: As of now that the percentage mix is not changing. We feel very good about both the entrance obviously and what we are doing in the residential market as well as our penetration into the commercial market. Now, we do have multiple products under development that very specifically address both the commercial and the utility scale market. But product right now that's being used in the commercial market is much more similar to the residential product than it is to a purpose built commercial or purpose built utilities scaled product. So for right now, we are extremely pleased with the adoption and penetration into the commercial market both domestically as well as internationally.
Philip Shen - ROTH Capital: Great. One more question, and I will jump back in the queue, Paul. We noticed from Greentech Media that the DC optimizers have started to gain some share; I think 17% of overall residential share in '13. Talk just about what you are seeing out there, and how you expect market share to trend in 2014, and if you feel like you are coming more head-to-head -- competing more head-to-head with those technologies these days?
Paul Nahi: Actually our main competition right now continues to be the standard string in central inverters. We are not seeing any significant or any meaningful contribution to the competitive landscape from either the DC optimizers or our competition microinverters. At this point, it become very clear, I think to all inverter companies that if they want to stay relevant in the rooftop, the global rooftop market, they are going to have to produce a microinverter, and several of them have. But once again, they are not really providing yet any meaningful competition. We expect that to change and we expect them to be very strong competitors over time, but not necessarily with their first generation product.
Philip Shen - ROTH Capital: Okay, great. Thanks, Paul. Thank you, Kris. I'll jump back in the queue.
Paul Nahi: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Krish (inaudible) from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Unidentified Analyst: Yes, hi. Thanks for taking my question and congrats again on the good results in Q4. I had a couple, the number one, Paul or Kris, I am curious for the reason for the change in the warranty obligation from (January 1st). And along with same target noticed in Q4, the warranty obligation balances up sequentially more than shipments are up. So, was it related to any feel, performance concern? What is going on there?
Paul Nahi: Yes. So let me post it. There has been change in the accounting. We have an ongoing process in which we review our accounting policies and practices. And especially going into a new year, we pay some more attention to it. And for us it's clear that when you have an obligation that is settled over a period of up to 25 year that the fair value accounting is a much better presentation of a long-term obligation. And as a result of that, we are making that change right now starting with the new fiscal year 2014. In reference to the warranty disclosures last quarter, really what we do as a hardware company is very, very standard. We will every quarter review the data from the field. Remember, we have over 5 million units all over the world in all kinds of environmental conditions. We will review the data from that. And we will make the appropriate modification sometimes up, sometimes down to the warranty obligation based on real field data. So the process we use is very standard. And as you will notice that some products may have gone up, some products will go down. That process will continue.
Unidentified Analyst: All right. And then another case, obviously there is this solar trade coming from the talents from the ITC and Department of Commerce. In a situation where that drives up the price of the modules, does it mean that there is going to be extra pressure on inverter prices to offset, to help offset some of the BeOS cost or how do you kind of view this solar trade case impact on your pricing?
Paul Nahi: I think that there has been consistently pressures on ASPs for inverters. I don't think that's anything new. We won't necessarily opine on this specific case. What we do know is that the industry right now is extremely robust that because of their lower prices of solar in general, because of the rising prices of fossil fuel energy we are seeing a better and better environment for solar within the U.S. and across the world. Clearly, doing something that raises the price of the modules isn't helping. But at the same time we need to find a balance between fair trade and doing something that encourages the development of the solar market. Having said all of that, in reviewing the trade case, it's our view that on anticipation that whatever changes that may come out as a result of it most likely won't necessarily materially affect the demand in the U.S.
Unidentified Analyst: All right, fair enough. And then a final question from my end, if you look at the Q1 OpEx guidance somewhere around the mid 50 million revenue run rate, OpEx as a percentage of sales is much higher than one you did last Q2 or even like Q4 of 2012. So, is this a new norm on a go-forward basis or is this a one-time OpEx pick up that should probably peel off some time as the year progresses?
Kris Sennesael: So, I am definitely very pleased with the operating expense management that we did during 2013, keeping them flat for almost four quarters in a row with some slight increase towards the end in Q4. But to be honest, that was not really sustainable. If we want to grow the top line, let's say, up about 20% in revenue which is of course more like 30%, 35%, 40% in megawatts, we will have to continue to invest in the future of the company. We will have to continue to invest in R&D resources and sales and marketing resources to support the international growth that we have. So I think a good way to think about that is if you assume a 20% top line growth, OpEx will grow about half the speed of that. So let's say, more like a 10% year-over-year basis. Obviously if revenue would grow faster, let's say at 25%, then you look more like at the 12.5% growth or if revenue grow slower then that would come down as well. But that's kind of like a good way to look at it in order to support the growth of the company.
Unidentified Analyst: Got it. Thanks, Paul and Kris.
Kris Sennesael: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Colin Rusch from Northland Capital.
Colin Rusch - Northland Capital: Thanks guys. Can you just talk about what's going on at the working capital, obviously both inventory and payables were down pretty dramatically on a percentage basis. Are you starting to see a different cycling with the way customers are ordering or something changing with your supply chain?
Kris Sennesael: Well, let me first address on the receivable side. Q4 is somewhat like in preparation of a softer Q1. And so the business start getting a little softer already in the December month, and then January and February is typically softer and then we start seeing a rebound in the March timeframe. And so that seasonal trend definitely helps to reduce the overall DSOs. On the inventory side, it's a big focus item for us. We want to manage our inventory levels down and improve our inventory turns. We feel very comfortable with what we have achieved there. And going forward, it's definitely going to be a big focus item for us as well.
Colin Rusch - Northland Capital: And then on the ASP trend, I know there is some mix between the system level and just the inverter mix, but you had a pretty healthy decline quarter-over-quarter, can you just talk a little bit about what's driving that and what you're doing with pricing as we go into 2014?
Kris Sennesael: The pricing for us is -- it's obviously a very important topic that we are looking at on a quarter-to-quarter basis. We are continuously evaluating the competitive landscape, and we are looking at our growth as well and finding the right balance between the right ASP and then obviously getting to an operating profit. We have said several times in the past that we don't believe that either ASP declines or cost reductions are going to be linear; they're going to be by definition a little bit lumpy. But are we seeing anything right now that would lead us to believe that there should be a very dramatic change in 2014? No. But we do believe that 2014 will be a very competitive environment and we do believe that there will be very significant pricing pressure. And we have obviously built that into all of our models.
Colin Rusch - Northland Capital: Okay. And then just on the product development cycle, historically you have introduced a new product every 18 to 24 months, another generation I should say, where about a third of the way through that short timeframe with the Gen 4, can you talk a little bit about how you see that cycle changing as we going forward and with the relatively slow adoption on the Gen 4 given the availability of the higher power panels, how are you focusing R&D efforts as you look at the Gen 5, where it seems like going to a higher power, a higher power rating, it could have been one of the key drivers for cost reduction?
Kris Sennesael: Sure. Higher power is one element of cost reduction, but there are several others; semiconductor integration, volume, manufacturing efficiencies. So there is a lot more there than just higher power, but higher power is important. But in terms of timing for the introduction of the next generation products, you had mentioned that we had said in the past, 18 to 24 months, that cadence seems accurate, and I don't know that I would make any adjustments to that right now. And those are obviously very approximate. What is important to know, however, is that the one element of a solar system that is far and away going to need to change the most to adapt to the evolving grid is the inverter. The inverter is where all the intelligence is housed. It is the brain to the system. And as we approach increasing density of solar on a particular grid, on a particular (feeder) network, the inverter is going to have to work far more closely with utility and more interactively with utility to support that. It's one of the reasons why we are spearheading the charge with the working group in California to evolve some of the dynamics required, some of the technical specifications required of the inverter to work in these kind of environments. So there is a lot of work going on within Enphase, a tremendous amount I should say. For the next generation inverter, that will support these evolving technologies, these evolving requirement, that are not just coming from California, but California, from Hawaii, and from the rest of the world. So we see our R&D actually ramping up to support this. But at the same time, these are going to necessarily be the same path where higher power modules or -- could that potentially slowdown? Yes, it could, but the need for the next generation inverter is higher than ever right now.
Colin Rusch - Northland Capital: I will just sneak one last one in. With the change of the Board, bringing on the gentlemen from Landis+Gyr, which is obviously owned by Toshiba, can you talk about your -- this integration with utility services? Is there new revenue stream that you can see starting to emerge yet in terms of selling this buyback utilities for monetizing it through that, and then also if you could comment on the Japanese market, and your approach at developing parts for that market?
Kris Sennesael: Sure.
Colin Rusch - Northland Capital: Okay, thanks.
Kris Sennesael: Sure. So, the dynamics of the inverter business as it relates to utilities is really two dynamics for me to comment on. We do know that there are going to be some requirements to work within a grid that has higher density of solar. So those are very likely going to be table stakes. But on top of that is there an opportunity to work more closely with the utilities, to provide them information, to help them manage the grid, that is distinctly possible, but again those business models are evolving, the technologies are evolving. So I really can't be having more specific at this time. Now, in reference to your comment about Japan, we are working very, very closely with multiple Japanese companies looking at both the market as well as the technologies necessary to enter Japan. It's still a work-in-progress for Enphase. There are a lot of obvious challenges associated with the Japanese market. But we feel that the market itself is very well suited to Enphase and to our microinverter system solution. So we're bullish about our prospects there, although I can't provide any timing. And I will take this opportunity to say that we are very excited to have Richard Mora join the Board of Directors. As the COO of Landis+Gyr, with his experience both with utilities and with metering, we believe that his contributions are going to be very meaningful over the next several years.
Colin Rusch - Northland Capital: Thank you so much, Kris.
Kris Sennesael: Thank you. Do we have the next question? Operator? Hello? We may be experiencing a technical difficulty, if we could ask for everybody's patience.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Vishal Shah from Deutsche Bank; one moment.
Vishal Shah - Deutsche Bank: Hi, thanks for taking my question. Paul, I was wondering when you think you can hit your margin target of 35% to 40%, you guidance 30% to 33% of the run rate of $50 million, $55 million of revenue would suggest that at some point in 2014 you should be able to hit at least the low-end of the targets, can you just talk about that? And also, as you look into the market in the U.S., I mean where do you think the market -- the demand is coming from, which states are already active right now or do you see broadband trend across all the states or is it only one of two states that are driving the growth? Then finally, how do you think about the demand from some of the larger leasing companies, I think that pricing has been an issue with some of those leasing companies, are you trying to work with some of those companies to fix the pricing issue? Thank you.
Paul Nahi: Sure. So, for your question on when we plan to hit our models, our goal -- and we've said this many, many times and we will continue to say is we're on a path of profitable growth which means that we need to chart a way to optimize both growth and profitability. If we wanted to focus on, as an example, gross margin, we can get there relatively quickly. We wanted to focus really on growth. We could do that as well. Neither one of those independently other, we feel is the best long-term solution for Enphase. What we are doing right now is focusing on the middle ground, if you will, that nuanced path that allows us to continue to grow, but doing it in a responsible way that allows us to become more and more profitable or chart a path towards profitability with every quarter.
 : In terms of demand from the U.S., we are definitely seeing the demand come from multiple states. These are the states I think that everybody is familiar with. But we are also seeing an expansion. Our new states coming online, there are new programs coming online, not just with different states, but within a state. So I think that if you look at across the U.S., you are finding that the demand for solar is coming from a wider and wider geography. It is still very concentrated in California, but I think at over time you are going to see that concentration dissipate even as California continues to grow. In reference to the leasing companies and pricing that's associated with that, we are today -- we work with almost every large and small PPA in the country. In some cases, we are the exclusive microinverter, in some cases maybe not. So we have outstanding relationships and very, very deep ties to many of them. You had mentioned pricings being an instrumental part of those relationships, we couldn't agree more, but we feel that we have a very good handle on where their demand is and are very comfortable with our ability to meet the upcoming pricing requirements, the upcoming ASP requirements in 2014 from the leasing companies.
Vishal Shah - Deutsche Bank: Thank you so much. Well, just on that front, where do you think your market share is in the leasing space and do you expect your share to go up in 2014, would them be leasing market?
Paul Nahi: So we don't talk about this specific percentage within the leasing market. What we do say, however, is that almost every third-party leasing company uses Enphase. And as I mentioned just a moment ago in some cases exclusively. And our share of the leasing market has continued to grow. And yes, we do expect it to grow at 2014 as well.
Vishal Shah - Deutsche Bank: Thank you so much.
Paul Nahi: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Pavel Molchanov from Raymond James.
Pavel Molchanov - Raymond James: Hey guys, congrats on a nice cash flow in the quarter. Kind of building on the prior question about the drivers behind the growth domestically, have you noticed any changes in your customer concentration, and I ask because you've obviously disclosed publicly some of the relationships that are quite relevant like Vivint. Have there been any changes or not in that sense?
Paul Nahi: I would say, in general, no. We continue to support both the large and small customers that we currently have. But there hasn't been any material change. Now, what is true is that some of the larger companies are growing quite fast. So, that by default would sort of change the mix a little bit. But if you look at it in terms of the number of installers that we're supporting, I think you would see the percentage to be fairly consistent.
Pavel Molchanov - Raymond James: Okay.
Kris Sennesael: And we have approximately two or three customers within the 10% to 20% customer range, and so, that hasn't changed over the last two three years.
Pavel Molchanov - Raymond James: Okay. And yes, your largest customer, I'm not sure if you want to identify it by -- has their share of your revenue increased over the past year?
Kris Sennesael: It has increased over the past year, yes. But it's still within that 10% to 20% range.
Pavel Molchanov - Raymond James: Okay, got it. Then, second point from me is, you've mentioned OpEx is going to go up in a year when you're looking to do some investing. Is capital spending, which I know has not been at that meeting, historically, should that be picking up as well?
Kris Sennesael: No. In 2013, we spent $6.3 million on capital expenditures. For 2014, we definitely target to keep the CapEx below $10 million.
Pavel Molchanov - Raymond James: Okay, but higher than the stakes?
Kris Sennesael: It could be slightly higher than the stakes, yes.
Pavel Molchanov - Raymond James: Okay, understood. I appreciate it guys.
Kris Sennesael: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Ashok Ramji from Lamoreaux Capital.
Ashok Ramji - Lamoreaux Capital: Hi, Paul and Kris. Congratulations on this quarter's results. A follow-up on the competitive landscapes, you mentioned that the main competition is still in form of central string inverters, are we seeing some press on SMA Sunny Boy microinverter product now coming to market, granted in other parts of the world? Could you comment on this, please? And is their entry into the U.S. still some time away? Thank you.
Paul Nahi: Ashok, we can't comment on the timing for the entry into the U.S. That question would need to be addressed after May. What I will say is that it has been out there for some time. And as I've mentioned before, we're just not seeing it as a strong competitor. Our competition both internationally and domestically remains the string and central inverters. And as we've talked about, as you mentioned SMA and there are other companies out there that have micros. There is a recognition; a clear recognition from these companies that they are going to need to do one. And long-term, we absolutely expect these companies to produce very competitive products, but today we are not seeing any meaningful competition come from other microinverters.
Ashok Ramji - Lamoreaux Capital: Great. Thank you very much.
Paul Nahi: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Our next question comes from the line of Paul Strigler from Esplanade.
Paul Strigler - Esplanade: Hey, guys, just a couple of quickies. One, on the slower adoption of the Gen 4 product, are there any penalties with your OEM manufacturing partners, if you don't hit -- if it's a 20% of your volume and you budget it for 30, is there any sort of penalties you might face?
Kris Sennesael: No. So, the answer is no.
Paul Strigler - Esplanade: Great. And then, so when I think about sort of 2014 for the residential market in the U.S, obviously SolarCity is going to be a huge chunk of that growth. And you guys know the residential market probably better than anyone. Sort of, what do you forecast the non-SolarCity growth for the residential market in the U.S. for 2014?
Kris Sennesael: So I probably would not breakout SolarCity versus not. What I would say is that we would expect market growth in the U.S. to grow somewhere between 20% and 30%; U.S. residential market.
Paul Strigler - Esplanade: And so going from how many megawatts to how many megawatts, would that be?
Kris Sennesael: It's probably 750 megawatts plus or minus for 2013.
Paul Strigler - Esplanade: Great. Thanks a lot guys.
Kris Sennesael: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And that concludes our question-and-answer session today. I would like to turn the conference back over to Paul Nahi for any concluding remarks.
Paul Nahi: Thank you for joining us on our call today. We're excited with our progress, highlighted by our record fourth quarter revenue and gross margins as well as our first ever operating profit. The focused execution of our business strategy has propelled us to the number one position in the U.S. residential solar inverter market, for a wider platform for global growth, demonstrated our ability to expand our margins and enabled us to chart a path to sustainable profitability and positive cash flow. We are taking this momentum with the 2014, and look to build on what was a great 2013. In closing, I want to once again acknowledge the efforts of everyone at Enphase. To achieve these outstanding results requires a team effort, and we truly have a great team here at Enphase. We look forward to talking with you again next quarter.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program and you may now disconnect. Everyone have a good day.

===== 2013 Q3  (2013-11-05 16:30:00) =====
Executives: David Niederman - Director - The Blueshirt Group Paul Nahi - President, Chief Executive Officer Kris Sennesael - Chief Financial Officer
Analysts: Vishal Shah - Deutsche Bank Philip Shen - ROTH Capital Partners Andrew Hughes - Bank of America/Merrill Lynch Colin Rusch - Northland Capital Ryan Berney - Raymond James
Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Enphase Energy’s Third Quarter 2013 Financial Results Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this call is being recorded. I’d now like to turn the call over to David Niederman, Investor Relations. You may begin.
David Niederman: Good afternoon and thank you for joining us on today's conference call to discuss Enphase Energy's fiscal third quarter 2013 results. This call is also being broadcast live over the web and can be accessed in the Investor Relations section of Enphase Energy's website at enphaseenergy.com. With me on today's call are Paul Nahi, Enphase Energy's Chief Executive Officer and Kris Sennesael, Chief Financial Officer. After the market closed today, Enphase issued a press release announcing the results for its fiscal third quarter ended September 30, 2013. We’re providing an accompanying presentation with our earnings call that you can access on the Investor Relations portion of our website. During the course of this conference call, Enphase’s management will make forward-looking statements, including but not limited to statements related to Enphase Energy's financial performance, market demands for its microinverters, advantages of its technology, market trends and future financial performance. These forward-looking statements are based on the company's current expectations and inherently involve significant risks and uncertainties. Enphase Energy's actual results and the timing of events could differ materially from those anticipated in such forward-looking statements as a result of these risks and uncertainties. Factors that could cause results to be different from these statements include factors that company describes in its press release of today, especially under the section entitled Forward-Looking Statements as well as those detailed in the section entitled Risk Factors of the company's reports on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2012. Copies of these documents may be obtained from the SEC or by visiting the Investor Relations section of our website. Enphase Energy cautions you not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements and undertakes no duty or obligation to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future events or changes in its expectations. Also please note that certain financial measures we use on this call are expressed on a non-GAAP basis and have been adjusted to exclude certain charges. We’ve provided reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures in our earnings release posted today which can also be found in the Investor Relations section of our website. Now, I would like to introduce Paul Nahi, Chief Executive Officer of Enphase Energy. Paul?
Paul Nahi: Thanks David. And welcome to everyone joining us on the call today. The third quarter 2013 was a record breaking quarter for Enphase with highest ever revenue of $62 million and highest ever gross margin of 28.3%. Operating expenses which totaled $20.4 million were once again flat for the fourth consecutive quarter. We are continuing to drive leverage in our model by focusing on operating expense control while making the necessary investments to sustain the growth of our business. Our financial discipline combined with our top line growth and improving gross margins enabled us to narrow our loss from operations and improved cash flow. During the third quarter of 2013, Enphase shipped its 4 millionth microinverter representing approximately 885 megawatts of AC microinverter capacity. This marks yet another milestone for Enphase as the world’s leading microinverter systems provider. Another important achievement is the introduction of the latest Enphase system which featured our M250 microinverter. You will recall last quarter we announced that we have shipped the first few thousands units of this fourth generation product. During the third quarter, we offered our new M250 on a limited availability basis to our North American customers as we continue to ramp production and as our customers started the transition from our highly successful third generation product for our newest microinverter. During the third quarter, we shipped approximately 60,000 M250s which represented 15% of total unit shipped during the quarter. The transition to our latest microinverter will continue over the next several quarters and we expect our fourth generation product will represent approximately 20% to 30% of total units shipped in the fourth quarter of 2013. Our latest microinverter system is an example of the step function improvement which accompanies each new product generation. The M250 contains our most advanced custom semiconductor device which in addition to the latest power electronics technology incorporates our next generation communications technology. The M250 offers higher output power, increased conversion efficiency and a labor saving integrated ground feature. Now along with our hardware product innovation, the Enlighten software platform also continues to evolve. We are now collecting over 200 gigabytes of data everyday, managing big data of this kind requires our proprietary analytics engine to turn this data into valuable information for Enphase system owners. We just launched the second version of our Enlighten API or Application Programming Interface, which makes it even easier to integrate solar system production data from Enlighten into other custom applications. These can include fleet management tools, display kiosks, building management software, building integration and mobile apps. This is just one more example of how we continue to utilize our unique position to provide system performance data that is used and valued by a broad range of constituents in the solar energy value chain. Our new system has been very well received by our customer base, including our direct customers, distributors, OEMS, installers and system owners. And on October 21st at Solar Power International 2013, we announced the general availability of the fourth generation system in the North American market. Later in 2014, we plan to introduce the M250 in Europe and Australia as well. Enphase continues to be the clear market leader in the U.S. residential market. In addition, we are making a lot of progress in the commercial market which is a tremendous opportunity for Enphase as we look to accelerate our top line growth. We just announced the completion of 3-megawatt project for the San Diego Unified School District. This is a 125-building distributed solar project using Enphase microinverters spread across 29 schools and two facilities buildings throughout the School District. Our microinverters allow the project developer to focus their installers on a single inverter technology to support 3 megawatts of arrays and more than 125 different systems each uniquely designed with different roof angles, orientation and sizes. The challenging rooftop would have made array design logistically impractical with traditional inverters. This project was ideally suited to our microinverters which can be customized to fit both the smallest of arrays as well as megawatt scale systems. The design diversity of this distributed– 3 megawatt system exemplifies the flexibility and adaptive nature of the Enphase technology. In addition, solar system safety was critical because Enphase microinverters are low voltage, the developer was able to install the system knowing that no dangerous high voltage wiring would be running through the schools. And speaking of megawatt scale systems as a follow up to our earlier announcement, this quarter we completed a 2.3-megawatt solar installation for Vine Fresh Produce in Ontario, Canada. In contrast to the previous installation, this array was on a single unobstructed rooftop with no significant shading. This three-phase commercial system is Ontario’s largest commercial rooftop solar PV array as part of the province’s Feed-in-Tariff program and utilizes over 9,000 Enphase microinverters. We were selected for this project in part because of our higher energy harvest, no single point of failure, ease of installation and the fact that Enphase systems are easier to maintain because of our module level monitoring. Another example of our efforts around market expansion involves our participation in the Clinton Global Initiative Commitment to Action. Enphase is piloting an innovative solar energy microgrid system in Abuja, Nigeria. This microgrid system will help address some of the energy challenges in Nigeria and reduce their dependency on expensive polluting, diesel generators by providing clean affordable and reliable alternative sources of energy. Another example of an Enphase microgrid application is our participation in the U.S. Army’s SAGE pilot program, standing for Smart and Green Energy. This program seeks to reduce the quantity of liquid fuels required for electrical power generation for military base camps by employing PD systems, microgrid technologies and many energy efficiency measures. The Enphase microinverter system is ideal in these types of applications. Longer term we expect opportunities for microgrid applications to increase in developed countries as well as grid stability and reliability continues to be a concern. In summary, we are constantly evaluating new growth opportunities with several other initiatives underway and we will share updates with you as they progress. Our financial results for the third quarter of 2013 were marked by a strong performance from the domestic markets as business in the U.S. was up 13% sequentially despite a reduction in inventory and the distribution channel and some weakness in the Hawaiian market. Business in Europe during the third quarter was rather soft mainly due to the summer holidays schedules resulting a schedule decline of approximately 25%. Looking at the individual countries, the U.K. market is growing and our business there is developing nicely. However, the market in France, Belgium and Netherlands where we now have a top-three market share position are softer as a result of substantial reductions or cancellations in FIT programs. We anticipate these conditions will persist in the near term tempering demand in these regions or encouraged as we gain share in Enphase market and believe they will have robust demand for solar in the coming years. Our business in Australia is starting to ramp. In fact, we recently completed a 100-kilowatt system, our largest project to-date, now we continue to build our position and product offering in this attractive market. We are also seeing signs of renewed activity in the Canadian market resulting from a new and stable FIT program and are pleased with our progress in this market. Looking at the 2014 and beyond, we continue to be extremely bullish on the industry and see potential for significant growth of Enphase's business particularly in the U.S., the U.K. and Australia. A recent solar industry report by Deutsche Bank stated grid parity as a reality today in roughly 10 states in the U.S. and as system prices continue to decline, they expect this number to increase. The combination of lower system prices, solar financing products and the reduction in some of the soft cost such as customer acquisition and permitting is creating a catalyst fueling the demand for solar over the next several years. And with those comments, I will turn it over to Kris.
Kris Sennesael: Thank you, Paul. First, I will provide some more detail on our third quarter financial results before turning to the business outlook for the fourth quarter. As a reminder, the financial measures that I’m going to provide are in non-GAAP basis unless otherwise noted. During the third quarter, we continued our track record of execution and improving top and bottom line as well as cash flow. Revenue for the third quarter was a record $62 million up 7% sequentially and coming in at the upper end of the revenue guidance of $59 million to $63 million, During the third quarter of 2013, we shipped 426,000 microinverters representing 94 megawatts. Approximately 15% or 60,000 units were the Enphase fourth generation microinverter systems. Domestic revenue comprised 84% of third quarter total revenue, while the international revenue made up 16%. As Paul mentioned, our international revenue was down sequentially mainly driven by weak seasonal business environment due to the summer holidays and various regulatory actions impacting the solar industry incentives. In the third quarter, we set another gross margin record at 28.3% which is an increase of 140 basis points compared to 26.9% in the third quarter of 2012, an increase of 20 basis points compared to our previous gross margin record in the second quarter of 2013. The third quarter gross margin improvement is driven by relatively stable average selling prices, ongoing cost reduction efforts and the benefit of the higher margin on our fourth generation system. During the third quarter, we continue to focus on our financial discipline delivering on our operating expense management strategy and leveraging the infrastructure that has been put in place. Operating expenses for the third quarter were $20.4 million, this is the fourth consecutive quarter we have maintained our spending at this level. R&D was $7.7 million, sales and marketing was $7.6 million and G&A was $5.1 million. Sales and marketing expenses were up slightly from the prior quarter but were offset by reductions in R&D and G&A. These non-GAAP operating expenses did not include approximately $2 million in stock-based compensation expenses and $400,000 in severance cost. Our top line growth, record gross margins and flat operating expenses enabled us to further reduce our operating loss and net losses. For the third quarter of 2013, we recorded an operating loss of $2.9 million and a net loss of $3.7 million or a loss of $0.09 per share. On a GAAP basis, the net loss was $6.3 million or $0.15 per share. Now let’s talk about our continued improvement in cash flow. Third quarter negative operating cash flow was reduced to $500,000 and net cash flow was a negative $2.2 million. As our improved financial performance and focus on working capital management moves us closer to positive cash flows. We exited the quarter with a total cash balance of $31.8 million. And once again, we did not draw on our available debt facilities. During the quarter, we repaid approximately $600,000 on our existing term debt. Turning to working capital, we ended the third quarter with inventory at $24.4 million up $6.5 million from the second quarter. The higher inventory levels are associated primarily with our current product transition. We expect to reduce inventory levels in the fourth quarter in advance of our seasonally softer first quarter. We ended the quarter with accounts receivable of $34.7 million up slightly from the $32 million in the second quarter inline with the sequential revenue increase. Capital expenditures during the third quarter were $1.4 million and depreciation and amortization was $1.8 million. Now I would like to turn to our guidance for the fourth quarter of 2013. We expect revenue for the fourth quarter to be in the range of $62 million to $65 million, which is an increase of 8% to 13% on a year-over-year basis. Regarding gross margin, we expect gross margin to be within a range of 29% to 32% as we continue to drive down product cost and benefit from the product transition. We also expect non-GAAP operating expenses to be roughly flat compared to the third quarter. And now, I will open the line for questions.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Vishal Shah of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
Vishal Shah - Deutsche Bank: Hi, thanks for taking my question. Paul, I wanted just talk a little bit about how you can improve your gross margin going forward, is it going to be a function of overall product mix as you start selling more of these higher margin products or is it also going to be a function of volumes and just talk a little bit about what’s your profitability looks like sort of what kind of breakeven levels are you looking at now? Thank you.
Paul Nahi: Sure. Currently our gross margins have been affected by three specific factors. One, clearly is technology and our ability to integrate more of our device on to a single asset and thereby reducing the part count and reducing the size of the inverter. Another element certainly is volume and the scale associated with that. Another is simply just the growing size of the inverter, the fact that modules are becoming more powerful and attendant microinverters that’s also equally powerful. Going forward, we see those three main factors still at play. There is a lot of technology in front of us, a lot of technology development that’s going to help continue to reduce the cost. We have seen that in every subsequent generation of our product and we don’t see that slowing down. Our volume continues to increase and that is also having a very significant effect. Now I would only caution you that as we have seen in the past, we have reduced ASPs anywhere between 6% and 12% year-on-year and we certainly see a similar trend in the future. So there is going to be some downward pressure as a result of normal ASP trend. But the continuing upward momentum on gross margin as a result of technology volume and inverter size will continue.
Vishal Shah - Deutsche Bank: Okay. And when should we start – what kind of breakeven levels are we looking at and when do we start looking at profitability at bottom line?
Kris Sennesael: Right. We have a breakeven model with revenue at $80 million per quarter, 30% gross margin and 30% OpEx which is $24 million of OpEx. However, as you have seen in our financials we have been able to keep our operating expenses well below the $24 million level, it’s currently at $20.4 million, $20.5 million. So as a result of that our breakeven model is actually currently below the $80 million per quarter.
Vishal Shah - Deutsche Bank: Okay. Appreciate that. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Philip Shen of ROTH Capital Partners. Your line is open.
Philip Shen - ROTH Capital Partners: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions.
Paul Nahi: Sure.
Philip Shen - ROTH Capital Partners: Hey, first one is on, the revenue guidance came up a bit short versus consensus, but it seems like your better than expected gross margin guide may completely offset that. So if we use the upper end of your guidance range there appears to even be a touch of upside to Q4 EPS estimates. And you may possibly even reach breakeven on a non-GAAP basis. Can you talk to us about how confident you are in the upper end of your guidance range and what the potential may be to exceed that range in Q4?
Kris Sennesael: So Phil you are absolutely correct and just mathematically, if we hit the upper end of the guidance, we have $65 million of revenue and 32% gross margin. We have operating expenses flat at $20.5 million range; we would hit profitability from a non-GAAP operating income point of view. However, having said that we provide guidance within a range and so the range is 62 to 65 for revenue and 29% to 32%. There is no commitment or indication as of today that we will hit the high end of the guidance or even do better than that. Phil?
Operator: Our next question comes from Krish Sankar of Bank of America/Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.
Andrew Hughes - Bank of America/Merrill Lynch: Hi, guys. This is Andrew Hughes on for Krish. One question on competition, just who you are seeing in the U.S. residential market specifically not really in terms of micros because it’s not something that we have seen but any new competitive threats among some of the new string offerings and just comment on that and perhaps our market share as well?
Paul Nahi: Sure. So starting with your last question first, we are seeing our market share in the U.S. hold steady, if anything it may be slightly trending up but let’s call it holding steady for now. In terms of competition you are exactly right about micros, in fact at this point all the largest inverter manufacturers have announced that they are currently selling micros. We have not seen any appreciable effect in our market as a result of that. Clearly our competition today is coming more from traditional string and central inverters. And there all I would say is that we are not seeing any change in the fundamental landscape. The players are not really changing there, the market shares are staying relatively constant, one versus the other. So I don’t think we are seeing anything dramatic occurring in that area.
Andrew Hughes - Bank of America/Merrill Lynch: Great. And then just one more and in terms of hitting $80 million revenue target whether or not that’s breakeven or not, does your level of confidence and your ability to do that while keeping OpEx where it is now and where you are going to – where you see most of that additional revenue coming from. Is it U.S. market or is it primarily internationally focused? Thanks.
Paul Nahi: Sure. So we are actually growing in a number of new markets. As we mentioned in the prepared remarks, the U.K. and Australia are tremendous residential markets for Enphase and we are just beginning there. In fact, those markets individually while not quite as big as U.S. market or close to the same size. And our market share in both of those cases is relatively small simple because we’re new entrants in those markets. So there is a potential – there is a tremendous amount of growth potential in those new markets. There is also growth potential in the U.S. commercial market which we’re continuing to do well in. So our overall, growth trajectory, I think is going to be very healthy in 2014 and beyond, we see a lot of room both domestically and internationally for growth. When you look at Enphase in the scheme of all the solar, even all of DG, you will find that we are still in the very early innings of this game and we have a lot of headroom in front of us.
Operator: Our next question comes from Colin Rusch of Northland Capital. Your line is open.
Colin Rusch - Northland Capital: Hey, guys. Can you talk a little bit about the cost reduction performance in the Gen4 product so far, historically you have seen, if I recall correctly about 35% or 40% cost reduction on the generational shift. Are you seeing what you had hoped to see at this point in the ramp?
Paul Nahi: So you are right. Every subsequent product that we introduced does see a significant cost reduction. And as we said in the past, you don’t necessarily see all of those cost reductions on day one often times in fact almost in every case, you will some cost reduction immediately. But then, through the course of that product life time, we will continue to reduce cost through a variety of different means. We have seen what we have expected to see from the fourth generation product, primarily as a result of technology and specifically semiconductor design. But, we also expect to see continued cost reduction throughout the – its life time as well. Again, that is good news on cost reduction, good news on gross margin, should be tempered with what we have fully expect to being a normal definition ASPs as we have seen in the past.
Colin Rusch - Northland Capital: Okay. And as we look at the gross margin guide from 3Q to 4Q was that a ton of revenue increase. How of much that is being driven mixed shift and how much of that is being driven by management or the supply chain?
Kris Sennesael: Yes. So part of that is driven by an increase of the fourth generation as we mentioned during the call. In the third quarter roughly 15% was fourth generation, we expect in the fourth quarter that to increase to 20% to 30% of overall shipments. So that is definitely helping us. Now in addition to that we will continue to drive down the cost on our third generation product and made further improvements across the board. And so that all together gives us a view to 29% to 32% gross margin for the fourth quarter.
Colin Rusch - Northland Capital: Great. And then just one final one for me. Can you talk about the ramp in Australia and the potential entrance into Japan, obviously, those [indiscernible] very strong markets particularly for applications you guys said well? Love to understand how you see that playing out over the next couple of years?
Paul Nahi: So the team is being built in Australia as we speak. We really do believe it could be a very strong potential market for Enphase. The dynamics of that market are very healthy. It is effectively while not entirely, it is effectively an unsubsidized market right now in roof top PG, which we believe to be a very positive trend. The initial indication has been extremely positive, our product has been very well-received and again we are just starting, so we feel very comfortable about our current position and our ability to grow that market. Japan is a little more complicated for a variety of different reasons. We are actively engaged with several potential strategic partners. Japan has both some marketing challenges as well, some technical challenges which needs to be over come, all of which are eminently doable but its just a question of resource and time. We do view Japan as a strong market for Enphase, not exactly should sure when we are going to enter that market.
Colin Rusch - Northland Capital: Great. Thanks so much.
Paul Nahi: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Pavel Molchanov of Raymond James. Your line is open.
Ryan Berney - Raymond James: Hi, guys. This is Ryan Berney in for Pavel. I just wanted to ask last quarter you alluded to some excess [indiscernible] channel, as that subsided over the past three months and also have you been able to identify the reasons for that original issue?
Paul Nahi: So the answer to the question is, yes, we feel that we have done what we had set out to do which is reduce the inventory in the supply chain. And the reason for that as we talked about in the past, it’s in large part due to the transition from the third to the fourth generation product. And I think part of it is just normal course of business, throughout the year. Inventory levels will fluctuate and because we have very clear visibility on our -- not just ourselves in data but out data its very important for us to maintain a healthy level of inventory in the channel, which means that we need to manage it from time to time.
Ryan Berney - Raymond James: All right. Thank you very much.
Operator: Our next question comes from Edwin Mok of Needham & Company. Your line is open.
Edwin Mok - Needham & Company: Thanks for taking my question. So on the gross margin, if we think about the fourth generation product let’s say you ramped up to 400% of your shipment and you will get growth you are expecting and let’s say 10% price decline that you are thinking about on a year-over-year basis, right? What kind of gross margin, do you think you can achieve with that product fully ramped?
Kris Sennesael: So Ed, now our long-term gross margin target is 35% to 40% and so we are well on our way to achieve that. I cannot guarantee however that we will achieve that. We have 100% of four generation shipments. A lot of that will depend as you pointed out what will happen from a pricing point of view. Competitive pricing and how we react to that with our pricing. And so that will be a key driver but yes, long-term 35%, 40%, we do have line of site to achieve that over time.
Edwin Mok - Needham & Company: Okay. That’s fair. And then on the U.S. side market looks like it’s been strong this quarter. Can you quantify how much of that come from commercial versus residential. And as you look long-term maybe look at 2014, how do you think that makes [ph] mixed shift?
Paul Nahi: So sure, today approximately 15% to 20% of our shipments are commercial, most of that is in the U.S. Going forward, we expect that to increase, we have already seen a tremendous trend and there are examples of that which we shared with you on the prepared remarks on several multi-megawatt site. So we do expect the percentage of commercial to increase, while we increase the residential and we expect that trend to be not just U.S. but also international.
Edwin Mok - Needham & Company: Last question, I have regarding [indiscernible]. What is roughly the timing at least based on your current plan the timing for fifth generation inverter?
Paul Nahi: We have not announced the fifth generation inverter, the timing for the release of the fifth generation. What we said in the past is that traditionally if you look at historically what we have done and if you look at Silicon Valley tech companies in general, from generation to generation can be anywhere approximately 18 to 24 months. Having said that I will note that the fifth generation as you all know is well underway it’s actually operating, its on rooftops. We have actually just started the sixth generation as well. So we continue to invest heavily both in hardware and in software to increase our lead.
Edwin Mok - Needham & Company: Great. That’s very helpful. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Philip Shen of ROTH Capital Partners. Your line is open.
Philip Shen - ROTH Capital Partners: Hey, guys. Don’t know what happened earlier but I got cut off. Just a quick follow up here. In this quarter you guys had about 16% of your revenues exposed to international sales 20% in Q2. As you look out ahead, what kind of international revenue mix do you expect transferred all 2014?
Paul Nahi: So we can’t speak specifically to 2014. We don’t guide to that level of specificity but what we can say is that the – we are continuing to gain share in just about every international markets we are in. The adoption of the product, the reception to the microinverter technology has been fantastic. We are seeing the exact same level of response there that we did in the U.S. maybe back in 2008, 2009 which gives us a great deal of confidence that we are going to be able to achieve internationally what we have achieved in the U.S. Having said that of course, there are logistics issues, there are operational issues, having to build teams in those countries, establish sales, customer support, training and all the rest. We are well on our way to doing that in the core countries that we are focused on right now. So I would say long-term we expect the percentage of sales to come from rest of the world to increase very dramatically from where it is right now. And we are very confident we are going to able to achieve that.
Kris Sennesael: Phil just to add the U.K. residential solar market as well as the Australian residential solar market, each of them is approximately the same size as the U.S. residential solar market. So it’s a really large market and we have only started our adventures there. And so we have a tremendous opportunity to go and take share in that market grow our share and grow our business.
Philip Shen - ROTH Capital Partners: Great. Thanks Kris. Thank you, Paul as well.
Paul Nahi: Thank you.
Operator: I’m showing no further questions. At this time, I’d like to turn the call back over to Paul Nahi for any further remarks.
Paul Nahi: Thank you for joining us on today’s call. The third quarter 2013 was a record breaking quarter with strong execution on our strategic initiatives and solidifying our position as the industry leader. We look forward to speaking with you beginning of next year as we report on our fourth quarter and full year 2013 accomplishments.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today’s conference. This does conclude the program. And you may all disconnect. Everyone have a great day.

===== 2013 Q2  (2013-08-06 16:30:00) =====
Executives: Paul Nahi - President & CEO Kris Sennesael – CFO David Niederman - IR, The Blueshirt Group
Analysts: Colin Rusch – Northland Capital Edwin Mok – Needham & Company Phillip Shen – Roth Capital Partners 
Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Enphase Energy’s Second Quarter 2013 Financial Results Conference Call. At this time, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. But later, there will be a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. (Operator Instructions) And as a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. And now, I would like to turn the conference over to your host, David Niederman.
David Niederman: Good afternoon and thank you for joining us on today's conference call to discuss Enphase Energy's fiscal second quarter 2013 results.

Now, I would like to introduce Paul Nahi, Chief Executive Officer of Enphase Energy. Paul?
Paul Nahi: Thanks David, and welcome to everyone joining us for our second quarter 2013 earnings call. This call will follow our normal format, I am going to start with an overview of our Q2 performance and provide an update on our progress and some of our key initiatives. Kris will take us through the financials and next quarter guidance and then we will go to Q&A. The second quarter 2013 was another solid quarter for Enphase with great execution on our goals. Revenue, gross margin and operating expenses are all inline or better than our guidance for the quarter. We have strong sequential top line growth of 28% with a revenue of $58.2 million. We had another gross margin record at 28.1% and we kept our operating expenses flat for the third quarter in a row. We also made significant progress in reducing the negative cash flow from operations to $1 million. So, on balance our second quarter financial performance was very strong and continues to reflect ongoing progress as we grow and move forward on our path to profitability and sustainable positive cash flows. Now, let’s talk about some of our other second quarter highlights. In our last call, we told you, we’ll focus on and execute the key initiatives we believe are critical to our success. These include providing superior microinverter systems and services, reducing product and system costs to the customer while increasing gross margins through our semiconductor based business model, growing market share in our core market, seeking out new market opportunities, expanding our geographic footprint and continuing to tread our path to profitability and sustainable positive cash flows. I’m pleased to able to share tangible evidence of progress we’re making in these areas, starting with the introduction of our fourth generation microinverter system featuring the new M250 microinverter. This is yet another example of driving stakeholder value through cutting edge, hardware and software technology development. During the second quarter, we made our initial shipments of the M250 microinverter and new Enlighten software monitoring system with general availability in North America scheduled for September. Optimized for high power solar modules, the M250 microinverter produces 250 watts peak AC output power and pairs with modules up to 300 watts. The M250 is rated at 96.5% CEC weighted efficiency, the highest efficiency in the industry for microinverters. In addition, the M250 has been built to withstand the most grueling environmental conditions. It is NEMA 6 rated and has undergone over one million hours of testing in extreme temperature and humidity environments prior to launch. The M250 also supports a new integrated ground feature, again a first in the industry for microinverters. The M250 microinverter no longer needs a separate Grounding Electrode Conductor to each microinverter. This improvement creates a more streamlined and cost effective installation process by reducing installation time and decreasing materials costs. The fourth generation Enphase system also introduces enhancements to our intelligent software platform Enlighten. Enlighten is a critical tool for both installers and owners of the solar system to best serve the different needs of both the solar professionals and system owners, Enlighten is now available in two different versions. For solar professionals, Enlighten Manager offers increasingly sophisticated backend web based tools to monitor and manage multiple installations, further streamlining the operations and maintenance process. For solar energy system owners, MyEnlighten offers an engaging interface to view and easily share production and environmental benefit of solar energy with friends and colleagues through seeing with integrated social media connections. Recognizing the two software interfaces allows us to increase the functionality for each user; we see this evolution in our software platform opening yet again new avenues for value creation. In addition, well the new M250 microinverter brings increased value for our customers and end users as with each new generation of our product, we continue to reduce product costs and improve gross margins. We expect to see the gradual benefit in our financials as we phase in the new product, which typically takes around four quarters. Next, in addition to being the technology leader, we are recognized as the number one residential inverter supplier in the America for 2012 by IHS Research with 53.5% share of revenue and the number one power electronic PV monitoring provider globally by number of sites in 2012. Surpassing traditional inverters was an important milestone for us and further validates the microinverter technology for rooftop solar applications. Turning to our international business, we had substantial growth in revenue generated from outside of the U.S. in the second quarter as it surpassed 20% of total revenue. In Europe our performance was particularly strong in France, which is up over a 150% year-over-year and in the U.K. which has grown to our second largest European market behind France. These results reflect the early benefits of the realignment of our European organization which we announced last quarter. We continue to increase our market share and presence in Europe by leveraging existing partnerships and developing new ones. As an example, during the second quarter working with our distribution and installation partner we became involved in a new project in the U.K. putting solar on 600 homes. This will be our largest project to-date in the U.K. with an average size of 3 kilowatts per home. Installations for this project have begun and ongoing. It’s also important to note our growth in Europe is against the backdrop of a challenging market with reductions and feed interrupts in several countries and uncertainty related to potential import duties on Chinese modules. Today, we are making great progress and we’ve learned a lot from our expansion at the Europe. To capitalize on this experience, we’ve recently deployed a team to more fully evaluate the things that we did well, amplify our performance and identify the things we can improve as we looked at further international expansion. This is creating a systematic and repeatable process that will allow us to more seamlessly move into other target markets. Finally, closing on international, we are beginning to see signs of recovery in the Canadian market as demand is improving. We are also starting to gain some early traction in Australia and are signing up new distribution progress. In addition, we just participated in our first trade show Clean Energy Week 2013, which is Australia’s biggest event for the renewal energy industry. Our presence at the event helped us significantly build our profile in the Australian market as we met with hundreds of installers and perspective customers. In fact, at the show we received an order for a 100 kilowatt system, which will be our largest to-date in Australia. Turning to expansion of our core market, we are making progress with our work in the commercial and new housing set market segments. As an example of the tracks that we are gaining in the commercial segment, a two megawatt project using Enphase inverter has just came online. This is the largest project and this is the largest commercial project using microinverters and is a great example of our product being successfully deployed in a large commercial installation. We’ll be sharing more about this project in the coming weeks in a formal announcement. In addition to this success story, we recently announced a new commercial initiative for the European market to help feel the momentum of commercial solar; we are now providing our installers with a full solution to meet the demands for small commercial projects. Our Enphase system offers installers and owners a technology solution with a modular architecture, integrated intelligence, lower level like cost of energy and increased project profitability. It includes the M250 microinverter both three phase and single phase engaged cabling, our onboard gateway, the Enlighten monitoring platform along with training and project design support. This offering will enable us to address the fast growing market of small commercial systems up to 100 kilowatts with our microinverter system. Next, I’d like to update you on our efforts to address the new home market. We’ve recently formed a strategic relationship with one of the leading U.S. homebuilders Lenoir through its newly created subsidiary Sunstreet Energy Group. Lenoir chose Enphase in part because of our leadership in the industry and because the microinverter provides the most flexible and productive technology for the new home market. In addition, you’ll recall last November we were selected as an exclusive inverter partner of CertainTeed, one of the nation’s largest building materials manufacturers, in combination these relationships provide an ecosystem to deliver high quality interactive solar solution that benefits a builder and homeowner with Enphase as the technology of choice for modern solar living. We view this as an important step and providing us additional access to the new home market, you’ll recall the last quarter, I mentioned there are only approximately 250,000 solar homes in the U.S., but there are more than 70 million homes in total and industry analyst expecting over 1 million new homes be built in 2013. Our strategic relationships with Lenoir and CertainTeed are an important step in developing a channel to address this growing market opportunity. In summary, our efforts are very improved. In addition to being named the number one residential PV inverter supplier in the Americas and the number one global power electronic PV monitoring provider in 2012, we recently achieved an important milestone surpassing over one terawatt hour of clean energy production from systems reporting to Enlighten. We are extremely proud to have reached this milestone and to be acknowledged as the industry leader, but our work is far from complete. We aspire to be the number one rooftop PD inverter supplier worldwide, expand our share in the commercial segment and further distance ourselves from the competition in the use of data provided by our intelligence monitoring systems. Now before turning over to Kris to go over the financials, I want to close with some industry comments. We are extremely pleased with our progress in the first half of 2013. We continue to see strong POS or sell out by our channel partners and demand from installers and end users continues to increase. However, as a end phase in the broader U.S. solar industry continue to grow, it is now without challenges and we are seeing a stronger focus on working capital management within the industry. Consequently, our channel partners are starting to pair back their inventory level. In addition, as we transition from the third to the fourth generation microinverter system, certain distribution partners are reducing inventory levels of the third generation product as well. Well, our guidance for Q3 reflects the impact of this temporary channel correction, the fundamentals of Enphase and the broader industry are stronger than ever and we will continue to execute on our strategy which has proven to be a winning approach. And with those comments, I will turn it over to Kris.
Kris Sennesael: Thank you, Paul. First I will go over the financial results in more detail for the second quarter of 2013 and then I will turn to the business outlook for the third quarter. As a reminder the financial measures that I am going to provide are on a non-GAAP basis unless otherwise noted. As Paul indicated, we are pleased to have the solid performance of the company during the second quarter of 2013. Total revenue for the second quarter was $58.2 million slightly above the midpoint of the revenue guidance of $56 million to $60 million. This is a strong sequential increase of 28% and an increase of 4% on year-over-year basis. However, the second quarter of 2012 included approximately $19 million of 1603 related revenue. If we normalize for the 1603 related revenue, the second quarter of 2013 is up more than 58% on a year-over-year basis. During the second quarter of 2013, we shipped 399,000 micro microinverters or 86 megawatts. The sequential revenue growth was strong on both domestic and international fronts. We’ve approximately 80% of the revenue coming from the U.S. and 20% comprised by our international markets, mainly from Canada, France, U.K., Belgium, the Netherlands and Australia.  We are especially pleased with the progress that we are making in our international business which has shown steady growth increasing from approximately 10% of our total revenue in Q4 of 2012, to 15% in the first quarter of 2013, and now further improving to 20% of total revenue. We will continue to focus on our international expansion as a key driver of our top line growth.  In addition to the strong sequential revenue growth, we continue on our path of improving gross margins. We set another company gross margin record. In the second quarter we have the gross margin at 28.1%, an increase of 360 basis points, compared to the 24.5% in the second quarter of 2012, and an improvement of 110 basis points from the first quarter of 2013. The second quarter gross margin is particularly impressive when taken into consideration a price reduction within the quarter and almost no benefit from the launch of our fourth generation product as we only began shipments during the second quarter. Gross margins have steadily improved over the last couple of years from approximately 10% in 2010 to approximately 20% in 2011 and 25% in 2012. We have a new record now in the second quarter at 28.1% and so we are well on our way towards our long-term target gross margin of 35% to 40%. We also continue to deliver on our operating expense management strategy and the ability to leverage the infrastructure that has been put in place. We have kept our operating expenses flat for three quarters in a row and well below the level of the third quarter in 2012, which was $23.1 million. Total operating expenses for the second quarter were $20.4 million with R&D at $8 million, Sales & Marketing at $7 million and G&A at $5.4 million. Sales & Marketing expenses are slightly up from the first quarter driven by our international expansion efforts, but offset by a slight reduction in R&D and G&A expenses. These non-GAAP operating expenses did not include $1.4 million in stock based compensation expenses. We ended the first quarter with 384 employees slab compared to the last three quarters. As a result of the sequential top line growth, record gross margin and flat operating expenses, we continue to reduce our operating losses and net loss as we chart our path to profitability. For the second quarter of 2013, net loss was $4.8 million or a loss of $0.12 per share. On a GAAP basis, the net loss was $6.4 million or $0.15 per share. Finally, I want to point out a significant progress we’re making towards our goal of sustainable positive cash flows. We improved the cash flow from operations by $6 million over the first quarter of 2013, closing the second quarter with negative cash flow from operations of $1 million and a negative net cash flow of $2.5 million. As a result, the company exited the quarter with total cash balance of $34 million. We did not draw on our available debt facilities and we did repay approximately $600,000 on our existing term debt. Working capital improvements were mainly driven by an increase in the inventory turns from 6 to 9 times, we have inventory at the end of the second quarter at $17.9 million down $4.4 million from the first quarter. It is a result of stronger focus on inventory management, overall business planning and our logistic processes. Capital expenditures during the first quarter were $1.8 million and depreciation and amortization was $1.7 million. Now, I would like to turn to our guidance for the third quarter of 2013. We expect the revenue for the third quarter to be in the range of $59 million to $63 million. This takes into account an anticipated reduction of the inventory levels within our distribution partially as a result of the transition from the third to fourth generation microinverter system and the ongoing rationalization of inventory levels within the industry. Regarding gross margin, we expect the gross margin to be within a range of 27% to 29%. We expect to see the benefit of the higher gross margins on the fourth generation product to start improving our overall gross margin overtime as we start ramping the sales of our new microinverter system. We also expect non-GAAP operating expenses to be roughly flat compared to the second quarter. And now, I will open the line for questions.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) So, we will go with our first question from the Vishal Shah from Deutsche Bank. Vishal, please go ahead.
Unidentified Analyst: Hi guys, this is Jeremiah (ph) calling in for Vishal. I was just hoping you could touch on the outlook for how margins might look like once you have completed the transition to the fourth generation microinverter?
Paul Nahi: So, obviously we are not guiding to forward-looking margins beyond this quarter, but what I can say is that we expect to see similar improvement in gross margin with the gen four as we have in previous generations. What I would remind you of is that that doesn’t necessarily happen right away. We will introduce a next generation product, and then over the lifetime of that product, we will continue to reduce cost. So, it's throughout the lifetime of that product that you will see the increase in gross margin.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay, that's helpful. And maybe just, I mean, I know you are only giving official third quarter guidance. But, how should we think about fourth quarter in the next year? Are we going to see those inventory rationalizations start to turnaround or how should we think about that?
Paul Nahi: So, the inventory rationalizations that we are seeing in this quarter are unique and we believe will be contained to this quarter. At the same time, we will be introducing our fourth generation product and that transition will take a couple of quarters. So, we definitely think that the rationalization that we are talking about now is limited to Q3 and we expect to continue growth both in 2013 as well as 2014.
Unidentified Analyst: All right that’s very helpful, thanks Guys.
Operator: Okay, thank you. And our next question is from Colin Rusch from Northland Capital. Colin, please go ahead.
Colin Rusch - Northland Capital: Hey guys! You talked about basically four quarter ramp for the 1040 product. So, you can talk about why you think this channel inventory is only going to take a quarter to work its way through and why only it take, why won’t it be over multiple quarters?
Paul Nahi: The bulk of it will happen upfront for obvious reasons. As we introduce a new product, people are going to want to make way for it, but at the same time, we have to remember that the M215 will continue to be sold for many quarters from now and the transition as we move to a higher and higher concentration of the M250s will result in a lower concentration of the M215s, so the effect of dwindling M215s over time will be less pronounced. I think what you are going to see is a bulk of the effect coming upfront and maybe not all of it in Q3, but a good chunk of it and then it dwindling off rapidly after that.
Colin Rusch - Northland Capital: Okay. And, can you talk about the magnitude of the impact on 3Q, I mean, are we thinking about something as much as 20% or 30% of revenue will be impacted by this channel inventory?
Paul Nahi: So, it’s hard to quantify exactly, what I’d say is that we are, the rationalization is probably in the neighborhood of a couple of weeks of inventory and that would probably account for it.
Colin Rusch - Northland Capital: Okay. And then, the last one is just on the cost structure, you guys have done a very nice job of winding up the overhead, is there more to do on the R&D side or on the G&A side or should we expect to see those things kind of flatten out or start to roll going forward?
Paul Nahi: We feel that we’ve made multiple investments early on, this is going back to 2011 and 2012 even early in 2013, we feel punctual with where we are today, I don’t see necessarily a significant reduction in those expenses, we are still investing in R&D, we do have our fifth generation product that’s well underway in development, in fact it’s up and running in the lab, we are continuing to invest in products and technologies and services to keep us well ahead of the competition. But, even if there is a modest increase it will be commensurate with sales. So, I don’t want to expect to see any spike up or down.
Colin Rusch - Northland Capital: Perfect. Thanks a lot.
Paul Nahi: Thank you.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) We’ll take our next question from Edwin Mok from Needham & Company. Edwin, please go ahead.
Edwin Mok – Needham & Company: Hey, thanks for taking my question. Well, I guess, just come back to the channel inventory, anything specific to like any specific distributor or any regional that you might see more that inventory worked out or is it more across the board or across the state there?
Paul Nahi: In generally, it was across the board, it was, it definitely is contained to the U.S., this is definitely North American challenge, but nothing more specific in that.
Edwin Mok – Needham & Company: Okay, that’s helpful. And then, you mentioned that part of it was due to, to call it ramp down the third generation inverter, anyway you can quantify how much of the channel inventories currently third generation and how much do you think that would change by the end of this quarter?
Paul Nahi: It would be very difficult quantify or sort of breakout the effects of both the ramp down on the 215 as well as the rationalization of the channel itself. What I will say is that, I think what we are seeing this quarter is really the confluence of both of those events, the combination of the channel wanting to engage and perhaps more effective cash management, coupled with the fact that they have an opportunity to leverage the fact that we’re transitioning to the M250 and so they are going to want to be very careful on the volume of M215s that they hold. That combination I think is what you are seeing this quarter but breaking them out would be a little bit difficult.
Edwin Mok – Needham & Company: Okay. That’s fair. My question, I have on international, you mentioned UK as, you highlighted UK as one of the market that is strong, I understand that market actually has a pre – somewhere your competitor is always selling to that market, did that actually help you penetrate market faster because customers already gone, used to seeing microinverter or even the optimizer solution, do you see that part of market that already have microinverter or these optimizers as potential market that can grow faster in the near term?
Paul Nahi: So let’s talk about U.K. specifically. While there were an entrant or two, their market penetration was really so low as to not have much of an effect for us. Unfortunately, it wasn’t as if the microinverter concept had been well understood and widely used. So, our competition continues to be the central string inverters and today, that’s who we spend most of our time competing within the U.K., and as we mentioned, we are making tremendous progress in there. There are very few countries that have any real experience with the microinverter. The more countries we enter and the more experience we get. We recognize that we are not just introducing Enphase, but we are also introducing the concept of microinverters across the world. This is both good and bad, but I would say on balance, it’s definitely more good. We are able to communicate our vision, the value and the benefit of the Enphase microinverter. They are able to start off with the highest reliability microinverter in the world, which we think all in all benefits Enphase and the industry.
Edwin Mok – Needham & Company: Okay, great. One last question, can you remind us what would be your breakeven revenue level and what kind of margin are you targeting based on that?
Kris Sennesael: We have a breakeven model. We have $80 million of quarterly revenue and 30% gross margin and 30% OpEx, that makes it breakeven. Now keep in mind, that 30% OpEx on $80 million is $24 million of OpEx. Currently we are tracking well below that $24 million. As you see, last quarter was $20.4 million and we intend to keep that as flat as possible.
Edwin Mok – Needham & Company: Great, that’s all I have. Thank you.
Paul Nahi: Thank you.
Operator: Okay, thank you. And we’ll take our next question from Colin Rusch from Northland Capital. Please go ahead. So, Colin you may want to check your mute button. Okay we will go into our next question for Phillip Shen from Roth Capital Partners. Phillip please go ahead. And Colin your line is open as well. Would you check your mute button?
Phillip Shen – Roth Capital Partners : Hello.
Paul Nahi: Hello, please go ahead.
Phillip Shen – Roth Capital Partners : Hi, this is Phil, can you hear me.
Paul Nahi: Yes, we can Phil.
Phillip Shen – Roth Capital Partners : Okay great. In your prepared remarks you discussed the number of international markets, can you give us a sense for what your megawatts or market share targets might be in Australia and in U.K., and perhaps what timeframe?
Paul Nahi: So the way I would characterize that is to say you that both the UK and Australia are viewed as core markets for us and a core market by definition means that our goal is to be number one and number two in that space. So, we have a lost gold in those areas, but based on the traction that we have had and the reception that we are receiving, we feel very confident that we can achieve those goals.
Phillip Shen – Roth Capital Partners : Okay. And in terms of the timeframe, any thoughts on that at all?
Paul Nahi: Nothing that specific enough to be able to share what we have learned in the process of going, in the process of globalization is that it does take time to setup shop to get all the logistics prepared and then to educate and train the installers as we did in the U.S. The good news for us is that we have a blueprint for success. We know what it takes and we are able to duplicate that in various international markets, but is something that's really measured in quarters or years, it's not something that happens necessarily overnight.
Phillip Shen – Roth Capital Partners : Okay, great. And then, I know you talked about the phasing of the 250 taking four quarters or so, can you talk about your expectations of product mix between M215 and M250 over those next quarters, these coming four quarters?
Paul Nahi: I would look at it as sliding scale that initially you’re going to see more M215 and M250 as we ramp up on the M250 and then that balance will shift over four quarters to be more 250 than 215. Clearly, the 250 has a lot of advantages and that it's able to support higher power modules. It has higher efficiency, it has integrated ground, these are all tremendous attributes, but at the same time there are modules out there, lower power modules for which the M215 maybe more appropriate from the power perspective. So, we are going to see a continuation of the M215 for a while and the market migration away from the M215 to the M250, as we see more and more predominant of higher power modules.
Phillip Shen – Roth Capital Partners : Okay, thanks Paul. One last one and I’ll jump back in queue. Perhaps you could talk in general about how the reception of the M250 has been among customers. Have there been any challenges at all or any hiccups at all? And if not, then perhaps you can just talk about the overall reception?
Paul Nahi: Sure. The reception has been extremely strong, in fact today, demand out-served supply. We are sold out of everything we can make. As we introduce a new product, we like to ramp manufacturing in a very steady manner to maintain the quality and the processes that we feel are necessary for the reliability of the unit, and as a result we are limited in supply initially, but basically everything we can make right now, we are selling and the response has been tremendous.
Phillip Shen – Roth Capital Partners : Great, thanks again Paul.
Paul Nahi: Thank you.
Operator: Okay, so I am showing no further questions in the queue. I’d like to turn it back to your host for any concluding remarks.
Paul Nahi: Thank you, and thanks for joining us for today’s call and your interest in Enphase. Our second quarter was one of significant achievement as demonstrated by our results. We are very pleased with our ability to execute well on our strategy, progress on many of our key initiatives, and solidify our position as the industry leader in our market segment. Of course, none of this could have been accomplished without the collective efforts of the entire Enphase team, who is doing a fantastic job. We look forward to speaking with you again next quarter.
Operator: Okay ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude your conference. You may now disconnect and have a great day.

===== 2013 Q1  (2013-05-07 16:30:00) =====

Now, I would like to introduce Paul Nahi, Chief Executive Officer of Enphase Energy. Paul?
Paul Nahi: Thanks David, and welcome to everyone joining us for our first quarter 2013 earnings call. I am going to start with an overview of our Q1 performance and provide some industry commentary. Kris will take us through the financials and next quarter guidance and then we will go to Q&A. Looking at the financial results for the first quarter which is a typically seasonally soft quarter, Enphase executed well with healthy revenue growth and gross margin expansion on a year-over-year basis. We also continue to demonstrate financial discipline by keeping operating expenses flat on a sequential basis. First quarter revenue came in at the upper end of our guidance at $45.6 million. This is an increase of 7% compared to first quarter of 2012, but keep in mind, that during that quarter, we benefited from the expiring 1603 tax grant program which clouds the year-over-year comparison. In the first quarter of 2012, we recorded approximately $900 million or revenue associated with 1603 purchases. Excluding this, our year-over-year topline growth is actually 36%. Gross margin for the first quarter was 27% which is also inline with guidance and up significantly on a year-over-year basis. Over the past three years, we demonstrated consistent gross margin expansion from roughly 8% in the first quarter of 2010 to current levels which are approaching 30%. As a reminder, we’ve stated previously that there are multiple factors which impact gross margin and the expansion will not necessary be linear on a quarter-to-quarter basis, but should continue to trend upward overtime. Our operating expense for the first quarter of 2013 was $20.4 million, the same level as the fourth quarter of 2012. For the balance of the year, we will continue to maintain operating expenses as flat as possible while at the same time ensuring we make appropriate investments to fuel growth. This is key as we continue our paths of profitability and sustainable positive cash flows. So looking at the first quarter from a financial performance standpoint, it was a very good start to 2013. Now let’s spend a few minutes discussing the current industry dynamics and their impact on Enphase. The global demand for solar continues to grow. In 2012, 30 gigawatts were installed worldwide up approximately 10% from 2011. The industry continues to benefit from a decrease in module prices. The excess capacity in the industry has resulted in module prices declining from approximately $3 per watt only a couple of years ago to around $0.75 per watt today. Currently, we are seeing pricing stabilize as the module industry consolidates. From market perspective, industry analysts expect the global PV market to grow to approximately 33 gigawatts in 2013 with strong growth in the United States, Japan, Latin America, the Middle East and Africa; partially offset by declining markets in Germany and Italy. So let’s turn for a moment to our activities in Europe. Our initial investments have enabled us to establish (inaudible) heads in France, Italy and the UK to serve those markets. To more fully leverage these investments and pursue broader market opportunities, we have realigned our European organizations under a single Managing Director to pull over the execution and expansion that will better utilize existing resources and relationships, in this way we can increase our market presence in Europe in an efficient and scalable way by leveraging existing partnerships as well as establishing new local ones. As an example, in March, we announced that we began shipping in Switzerland through existing strategic partnerships with large PV suppliers; while we’re encouraged by our progress in the European region, we anticipate the solar markets there will continue to face headwinds for the balance of 2013 as their economies recover and they transition to a lower fit environment. Emerging markets such as Asia Pacific, Latin America and the Middle East are coming up as well. These unfolding opportunities will help stabilize the global solar industry. To grow organically companies must win share in new markets which in our opinion will require being nimble, selecting the appropriate timing to enter into the right markets, offering global products and having cost effective market entry strategies that serve these new customers. To close on my 2013 industry overview, we are looking forward to an exciting year with lots of opportunities and challenges in our core markets in U.S. and other countries. Enphase will be dedicated to further strengthening our industry leading position. This is an exciting time in the solar industry and as always we are ready to seize the challenge. We will continue to focus on and execute the key initiatives we believe are critical to our success which include providing superior microinverter systems and services, reducing product and to some cost to the customer while increasing gross margins through a semiconductor based business model; growing market share in our core markets, seizing out new market opportunities and expanding our geographic footprint and continuing to tread our path of profitability and sustainable positive cash flows. These are milestones you can use to engage our performance and progress and we will be talking about them regularly. Looking further ahead, we progressed in 2013 with optimism and are extremely bullish on the future of the solar industry. Inexpensive modules and new strategies that lower customer acquisition costs are creating a foundation for explosive growth as the cost of solar continues to decrease. New financing vehicles are taking solar mainstream and have made the choice to install solar are motivated by economic considerations rather than just environmental responsibility. These factors have contributed to making solar PV the fast as growing technology in the U.S. energy sector now and for the next several years. The market potential for solar in enormous; illustratively, in the U.S. alone there are approximately 250,000 solar homes, yet there are over 70 million owner occupied homes in total with projections of roughly 1 million new homes to be built in 2013. With the costs of solar coming down and new financing tools available to consumers, the proposition for installing solar is increasingly compelling and this is not just the US phenomena but a global one. Escalating energy prices along with an increasing awareness of the environmental impact of burning fossil fuels will result in increasing global demand for alternative energy solutions including solar. What is also exciting to me is the fact that advanced features in addition to price are becoming more important considerations in the decision making process of the purchase of the solar system. Reliability, increased power generation, system performance, modular level monitoring for operations and maintenance, and the ability to provide data and analytics are beginning to influence purchase decisions. These features are core strength of Enphase. From inception our vision has been to build intelligent data rich microinverter systems while applying a high-tech semiconductor business model. Now with over 3.3 million units in the field, we are seeing validation of the value proposition offered by Enphase's microinverter system. In summary, the future of the solar industry holds great promise for Enphase and we believe we are in a position to be a clear winner when this promise manifests itself. Now with those comments, I will turn it over to Kris to go over the financial results for the first quarter.
Kris Sennesael: Thank you, Paul. First, I will start by providing some more detail on the financial results for the first quarter of 2013 and then I will turn to the business outlook for the second quarter. As a reminder the financial measures that I'm going to provide are on a non-GAAP basis unless otherwise noted. As Paul mentioned, total revenue for the first quarter was $45.6 million which is at the high end of our revenue guidance of $43 million to $46 million. This is an increase of 7% year-over-year, but if we normalize for the 1603 related revenue at the beginning of 2012, it is up 36% year-over-year. On a sequential basis, revenue was down 21% from the fourth quarter, which is in line with our normal seasonal pattern. During the first quarter of 2013, we shipped 315,000 microinverters or 68 megawatts. Approximately 85% of the revenue was in the United States and 15% outside of United States mainly in Canada, France, Benelux, UK and Italy. This is an increase over the fourth quarter of 2012 where revenue outside of US was roughly 10% of total revenue. Recently we have seen some improvements in those markets and the growth is starting to resume as those markets are stabilizing after the phased reductions in 2012 and as we continue to gain market share in those countries. Gross margin in the first quarter was 27%, an improvement of 510 basis points compared to the 21.9% in the first quarter of 2012. The gross margin is down 100 basis points from our record gross margin in the fourth quarter of 2012, mainly as a result of a reduction in volume during our seasonally slowest quarter of the year. However, we continue to make good progress with our ongoing cost reduction efforts and experienced a relative stable pricing environment for the Enphase microinverter systems during the first quarter of 2013. Operating expenses in the first quarter of 2013 were flat compared to the operating expenses in the fourth quarter of 2012 at $20.4 million as we continue to maintain tight control on our operating expenses. R&D came in at $8.5 million, sales and marketing at $6.3 million and G&A at $5.6 million. These non-GAAP operating expenses did not include $1.3 million in stock-based compensation expenses and $150,000 in severance costs. We ended the first quarter with $382 employees, which is the same level as at the end of 2012. Again, going forward, we will continue to focus on keeping our operating expenses as flat as possible and driving leverage in our business model. For the first quarter of 2013, net loss was $8.7 million or a loss of $0.21 per share. On a GAAP basis, the net loss was $10.4 million or $0.25 per share. Cash flow from operations during the first quarter of 2013 was as expected a negative $7 million, and net cash flow was negative $8.9 million which is in line with normal seasonal trends. As a result, the company exited the quarter with a total cash balance of $36.4 million. We did not drop on our $66 million debt facilities, but we did repay approximately $600,000 on our existing term debt. Accounts receivable at the end of the first quarter of 2013 were $24.9 million or 49 day sales outstanding, slightly up from the 44 days last quarter. The revenue for the first quarter was backend loaded with a seasonally weak January and February resulting in an increased DSO. Inventory turns are at six times, with inventory at the end of the first quarter at $22.3 million, slightly up from the $19.8 million at the end of the fourth quarter as we prepared for the ramp of the business into the second quarter. Capital expenditures during the first quarter were $1.7 million and depreciation and amortization was also $1.7 million. Now I would like to turn to our guidance for the second quarter of 2013. After seasonally slower first quarter, we expect strong sequential increase in our top line, with revenue for the second quarter to be in the range of $56 million to $60 million. At the midpoint of the guidance, this is up 27% sequentially. Also, at the midpoint of the guidance, this is up 4% year-over-year, but if we exclude approximately $19 million of 1603 related revenue during the second quarter of 2012, the midpoint of the guidance is up more than 50% on a year-over-year basis. To be fair if there was no 1603 grant expiration, some of the $19 million revenue would have been recognized during the second quarter of 2012, but it's really hard to estimate the exact amount. Regarding gross margin, we expect the gross margin to be within a range of 26% to 28%. We also expect the non-GAAP operating expenses to be roughly flat compared to the first quarter. And now, I will open the line for questions.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) And our first question comes from Sanjay Shrestha from Lazard. Your line is open.
Sanjay Shrestha - Lazard Capital Markets: Good, great gross margin here. First on, if I come to the gross margin, one big picture question in terms of what’s happening in the industry I guess. So, Paul, how do you sort of think about this recent acquisition that happened which seem like a pretty high EBITDA multiple on '13, so again suggesting the growth type acquisition rather than really anything else. How do you see that changing the overall industry dynamics and maybe even for -- with the one that actually is in the process of being required, does that even potentially end up slowing their focus on microinverter and so even making it better for you guys, can you talk about a bit, what’s your expectation, what does it mean for the industry and for you guys?
Paul Nahi: Sure. So I think it’s probably best to start off by indicating that the ABB’s interest, the company of the size and scale of ABB, their interest in solar I think is a validation that the solar industry is set to grow in a big way both domestically and internationally, and it takes companies like ABB to sort of to recognize this and validate it for the rest of the industry. In reference to the multiples and evaluations that are being seen today as a result of that, I think I’d leave that to investors to draw their own conclusions there. And I think it does validate and does recognize the potential for the solar market and for the companies that have the right business models that can generate positive sustainable cash flows and generate profitability through the growth of this industry.
Sanjay Shrestha - Lazard Capital Markets: Okay. So do you -- any comments on what do you think it probably means because these guys are going after the big ticket item and does this sort of potentially end up giving you even a better opportunity on the microinverter side as they sort of have to focus now on acquisition integration and things like that, any sense there.
Paul Nahi: It could, it’s very hard to predict the outcome of an acquisition. I think we've all seen them go well and some go not so well. I think importantly for Enphase, we are very focused on the execution of our current business model and our current plan. We've got new products in the pipeline that we are very excited about introducing both on the hardware and the software side. We are continuing to expand both domestically and internationally, and I think our success is really very dependent on our ability to continue the quality of execution that we've demonstrated to date.
Sanjay Shrestha - Lazard Capital Markets: Two quick questions for me guys; one in terms of the gross margin here in Q1 which is obviously pretty impressive, huge improvement year-over-year and the sequential decline from Q4 to Q1 was that all related to pricing or how should we think about that, right so 100 basis points decline sequentially was there anymore cost improvement versus what the pricing decline was or did the cost per lot go down on a sequential basis and can you comment on that a bit.
Kris Sennesael: Sure, and I will take that question here, we were definitely very pleased to have the gross margin coming in at 27% being down 100 basis points from our record gross margin. It was 28% at the fourth quarter and the main driver for that 100 basis points drop was the much lower volume that we experienced in the first quarter being the seasonally softer quarter. So from a pricing point of view we really experienced a relative stable pricing during the first quarter compared to other price level at the fourth quarter.
Sanjay Shrestha - Lazard Capital Markets: Final question for me guys, so in terms of Q2 you guys have given the guidance right but for the second half 2013 how should we think about that as to sort of the revenue ramp and if any qualitative comment you can provide on that would be very helpful market mix and how should we sort of think about the second half of ’13.
Paul Nahi: Sure well as you know we only guide to the current quarter. What I would do is perhaps direct your attention towards our historical numbers which definitely show an up tick in the Q3 and Q4 timeframe and that is not unique to Enphase. That is symptomatic I think of the entire industry and represents the seasonality associated with weather and the ease of installation.
Sanjay Shrestha - Lazard Capital Markets: Okay, so we should expect that (inaudible).
Operator: Our next question comes from Vishal Shah from distribute.
Vishal Shah - Deutsche Bank : The second quarter gross margin guidance midpoint is flat yet you know you are seeing nice volume growth. So is it all because of some pricing change in the second quarter or is there anything else going on.
Kris Sennesael: That's basically correct. As you know in 2012 we've experienced roughly 8% to 10% price reduction as we pass on some of our cost reductions to our customer and looking forward in 2013 there will be some price actions including some of the actions that we already took in the second quarter. But again given the price actions that we already took we do expect the gross margin to come in that 26% to 28% gross margin level for the second quarter which we are very pleased with that as well.
Vishal Shah - Deutsche Bank: Okay, so similar 8% to 10% price deduction for this year.
Kris Sennesael: We don't provide any specific guidance on the full year basis but historically it has been around 8% to 10%.
Vishal Shah - Deutsche Bank: Okay, that’s helpful and the mix of megawatts or revenues international versus U.S. you think it's going to be same sort of 8515 or are you going to slowly start seeing the international mix improve you know, to more like 20%-25%.
Paul Nahi: Well, clearly we've seen it already improve from 10% last quarter to 15% this quarter and I would say that we're very early in to our international expansion. As you know, we have offices in France, UK, Italy, Australia and we continue to expand in to new countries. So I think that as far as long term trend is concerned, we would fully expect the percentage of rest of world sales to continue to increase.
Vishal Shah - Deutsche Bank: Okay, great. One of the question just on the OpEx front. You mentioned you are going to keep your OpEx flat, talking about expansion internationally. So how are going to manage that? Are you trying to take some cost out in the U.S. or what are some of the other things you are doing and what percentage of your OpEx is related to some of these international markets. Thank you.
Paul Nahi: So, I will take the first part of that question. One of the things we have just mentioned is that we're changing our European infrastructure to more of a pan-European infrastructure to better leverage the existing resources we have. So in the past where we were more country focused, we are more now regionally focused. This allows us to leverage the existing resources we have without materially increasing or affecting the OpEx but allowing us to enter, yet again, more countries. We will continue to exercise this strategy going forward in Europe and in other parts of the world as well.
Kris Sennesael: And from an OpEx point of view, our OpEx U.S. versus international, reflects more or less the revenue split so that’s pretty inline of each other. 
Paul Nahi: I will just finish this out by saying that we have said several times in the past that we had used 2011, 2012 to build out a significant infrastructure not just in the U.S. but globally, we are right now in the process of leveraging that infrastructure.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Andrew Hughes from Bank of America. Your line is open.
Andrew Hughes - Bank of America: One additional quick one on pricing you mentioned and we have all seen the stabilization module prices, I know you are passing some of the cost improvement along your customers, but are you seeing developers and distributors lean on you any more on the pricing front, now that module prices have cease the rate of decline or customer seeing in 2012?
Paul Nahi:  We are not seeing anything different now that we have seen before. I think just in general, all of the constituents of a solar system, whether it's the module provider, the BOS, the inverter, even the installer have seen a trend towards lower pricing, in terms of the health of the industry I think that’s a very good thing. We continue to see what we have seen, nothing exceptional or current and we fully expect to be able to meet the demand for a slow and new ones reduction in ASPs overtime.
Andrew Hughes - Bank of America: Got you, and just one more on, in the press release you mentioned the extension of the Vivint partnership for another year, which is great. I was just wondering if you could talk generally about how those, if that’s a typical supply relationship how that works on a year-to-year contract and just generally how those relationships are progressing in the U.S. and may be abroad as well? 
Paul Nahi: So without getting into the specifics of the Vivint deal sort of in general there are a broad away of agreements that we have with multiple different installers and PPA and lease providers. Vivint is a fantastic customer and we enjoy a solid relationship with them. It’s actually one where not only are they purchasing the microinverter them selves, but they are actually leveraging the light and software and OEM and for billing purposes also. We have more and more customers that are leveraging in [lighten] and our software to further integrate into their business models whether it is on the front end for installation, whether it is to help close a sale or whether it is on the back end to support operations and maintenance and of course we have as I mentioned the variety of different types of engagements, some more involving software than others, but I think the general value proposition of creating a simpler business model for the installer, well providing more energy and reliability for the owner continues to resonate.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) our next question comes from Pavel Molchanov from Raymond James. Your line is open.
Pavel Molchanov - Raymond James: First one on the competitive landscape but I think one of the earlier questions alluded to the recent M&A, but above and beyond that legacy players that you are seeing starting or accelerating shipment of microinverters and any start up that perhaps might be getting into the market place in the more meaningful way.
Paul Nahi: We haven't seen any significant change in the start-up environment, while there are some companies out there; none are providing any significant competition. There are some legacy players who have been actually selling and marketing very aggressively new products for them, microinverter for them, but there has been no real impact in the marketplace for us.
Pavel Molchanov - Raymond James: Okay. And I guess as we look at into the second half of the year given the diversification of your revenue mix as you mentioned into other geographies outside the US, are pricing strategies that you guys are following essentially on par with what you have traditionally done in the US or do you have to sell at a discount or offer rebates to encourage adoption overseas?
Paul Nahi: No, our pricing strategy overseas is very similar to what we do and how we do it in the US. We are not -- there's no fundamental change. Really what motivates adoption and what we have seen in the US, what we've seen in France, in Benelux and in multiple other regions is really more about training, training and getting people accustomed to doing business with a microinverter, teaching them how the software can help them to close a sale, showing them how the Enlighten software can help on the backend O&M and then showing them what it means, what a microinverter means to their current operations and how it can save the installer money and build a more profitable or more efficient business. That's really where we spent most of our time as we enter new countries. We have been doing that for quite some time now and continue to do that.
Pavel Molchanov - Raymond James: Last question for me. In 2013, will there be a new generation rolling out?
Paul Nahi: We have indicated that we are going to be introducing our fourth generation product in 2014. We are actually very excited about the launch. It’s a brilliant new product. In addition to that, we will be introducing new software in 2013 and of course our fifth generation is up and running in the lab, it’s en route and it will be introduced some time after that. I think what you are seeing is a very steady and consistent investment in research and development to ensure that we are always, that [employees] always has the latest, the greatest microinverter technology on the hardware front and software front as we are going to see more and more entrants try to compete in this phase.
Operator: Our next question comes from Colin Rusch from Northland Capital.
Colin Rusch - Northland Capital: Can you talk a little bit about the impact of that new product on demand in the second quarter? Have you seen any fluctuating for new products into the third or fourth quarter to an expert’s decision?
Paul Nahi: Sure. This is -- actually obviously as the fourth generation product, this is something we've done in the past which is to manage the introduction of a new product while we are currently selling an existing generation product. I think we understand what it takes. We know how to manage the process of introducing a new product. We do not believe that the introduction of our fourth generation product will adversely affect the sales of our third generation product. Clearly, the two will coexist for some time and we are managing that and developing plans for that as we speak, but we don't -- so we don't expect the transition to be sudden or dramatic, but we will be rolling out the new product in conjunction with the old then managing that transition over several quarters.
Colin Rusch - Northland Capital: And then just on the competitive front, obviously Power One warranty is different than what you've seen, are you having to work with any sort of rebates or manage expectations on warranty and/or right now and so making purchase decisions for choosing between the two products?
Paul Nahi: If I understand your question correctly [Colin] I think the answer is no. We're not doing anything different as a result of anybody else’s competitive product. Our warranty is a reflection of the quality we've built into the product, a quality that’s taken five years of building and selling microinverters to develop, but we believe that a very important part of our value proposition and will continue to emphasize it. At the same time, we think that as we move forward, it's not the warranty while an important element of the overall value proposition will be just a small portion of the total system value, which includes the quality of microinverter itself and all the system level software.
Colin Rusch - Northland Capital: (Inaudible) implemented, you know, is there any sort of (inaudible) hanging out there?
Paul Nahi: Colin, I am sorry you broke up during the first part of the question. Could you repeat it please?
Colin Rusch - Northland Capital: Sure. Are you seeing any overhead from the 1603 buying from last year? Is there any remaining inventory out in the market that still needs to be work through?
Kris Sennesael: There is still some 1603 related inventory out there; probably more than half has been sold through. Our customers continue to use those 1603 units they blend them in, we have new purchases that they make and we expect our process to continue for the next couple of quarters maybe even like the next whatever four, six quarters out there.
Operator: Thank you. I show no further questions and would like to turn the conference back to Mr. Paul Nahi for closing remarks.
Paul Nahi : Thank you. So we are also a great start for 2013, with the close of the first quarter, we now have five quarters in the book as a public company. During this time, we have established a track record of executing our strategy and delivering results as we strive to grow the company, provide industry leading products and services, and create shareholder value. Thanks everyone for joining us today. And we look forward to speaking with you again next quarter.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen thank you for your participation in today’s conference. This does conclude the program. And you may all disconnect at this time.

Now, I'd like to introduce Paul Nahi, Chief Executive Officer of Enphase Energy. Paul?
Paul Nahi: Thanks David, and welcome to everyone joining us for our fourth quarter and full-year 2012 earnings call. I'll give a general overview of our Q4 performance, Kris will take us through the financials, and then we'll go to the Q&A. But first, I'm going to start by reflecting on 2012, our first year as a public company. In 2012, Enphase made substantial progress as we executed on our strategy, achieving strong topline growth along with increasing gross margins. We closed 2012 with $217 million in revenue, a 45% increase year-over-year in what has been a challenging environment for our sector. During the year, we completed the successful transition to our third-generation products, continued to gain market share in the U.S. residential and commercial markets, and established a European presence selling into France, Italy, the Benelux region, and the U.K. We're pleased with the market share gains in those geographies during the last 12 months and the growing acceptance of our microinverter technology globally. Based on our analysis of market research data, we believe we ended the year with the number one market share position in our core U.S. residential market. We estimate to have had in excess of 35% market share in 2012 and just over 45% exiting Q4. This underscores our major success in both the traditional cash market as well as the fast-growing third-party financed market, where we established strong partnerships with several key players in this space. As a result, we sold over 1.5 million microinverters in 2012 compared to 1 million in 2011 and passed the 3 million units sold milestone during the fourth quarter. We continue to execute very well on our gross margin expansion strategy, improving gross margins from approximately 10% in 2010, to 20% in 2011, to over 25% in 2012, while most of the other players in the solar market are facing declining margins. This speaks to the value of our business model of providing highly valued and differentiated microinverter systems while managing our costs through semiconductor development as well as our outsourced manufacturing model. Our increased volume, the transition to our higher-margin, third-generation product, and only a modest erosion of our average selling prices, all contributed to the gross margin expansion. During 2012, we also took significant steps to further improve the quality and reliability of our products and streamline the manufacturing process. We strengthened our quality management systems and improved our manufacturing capabilities through automation. The result has been a continual increase in quality and decrease in costs of each subsequent generation of our products. Turning to our operating model, 2012 was the year of investing and building out our core infrastructure in engineering, manufacturing, quality, marketing, sales, and corporate functions. By the end of the third quarter of 2012, we had substantially completed these investments enabling us to realize operating leverage as we execute our balanced profitable growth strategy. Our Q4 results, which included sequential decline in operating expenses and positive cash flow provide a clear indication of the leverage we anticipate. At this time last year, we were in the midst of our IPO activities which resulted in our initial public offering on March 30, 2012. Later in the year, we put in place additional debt capacity through financing arrangements with Wells Fargo Capital and Hercules Technology Finance. In combination, these activities were significant steps that strengthened our balance sheet and provided the financial flexibility enabling us to pursue our strategic objectives. Also in 2012, we increased the breadth and depth of our management throughout the organization, both domestically and internationally, to support our growth initiatives. This included rounding out our senior management team, filling leadership roles in quality and reliability, customer service, human resources, and bringing on Kris Sennesael, our CFO. 2012 was a year of significant technology development for Enphase. Our investment in research and development has resulted in advances in both our hardware and software technologies. We now have approximately 100 patents issued or pending and are focused on developing the most advanced solar inverter system technologies in the world. And more recently, our technology leadership was further validated as we were presented with the Technology Pioneer Award by the World Economic Forum. We were honoured to be invited to participate in the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, engaging in policy discussions with global energy leaders advocating for renewable and advanced forms of energy and introducing Enphase to policy leaders and global energy suppliers. In summary, 2012 was a year of truly remarkable achievement for Enphase. We continued to grow the topline significantly, increased market share domestically and internationally, expanded our gross margin, and built the infrastructure which positions Enphase for ongoing success and profitable growth. Of course, none of this would have been possible without the contribution and commitment of all our Enphase team members. In my opinion, we have the best people in the industry. Now let's turn to our fourth quarter results. We had a solid fourth quarter as we posted revenues of $57.6 million compared to $57.1 million in the prior year. This is an increase of 14% compared to the fourth quarter of 2011 when excluding approximately $6.5 million of revenue in Q4 of 2011 facilitated through the expiring 1603 tax grant program. You will recall that at the end of 2011, the whole industry benefited from the expiration of certain tax benefits, commonly referred to as 1603, which resulted in several customers accelerating product purchases prior to the year end of 2011. Our stronger than expected 2012 fourth quarter topline performance was mainly driven by the strength in the U.S. markets, which was partially offset by a reduction of inventory levels in the distribution channel during the fourth quarter. Fourth quarter revenue outside of the U.S. was somewhat disappointing. They accounted for approximately 10% of total revenue. Reduced feed-in-tariffs resulted in softer [conditions] (ph) in the Canadian and European renewable energy markets leading to lower sales for the quarter in those regions. However, it's important to note that we are relatively new entrants in the European market, and our product continues to gain acceptance and market share. We believe these markets are a tremendous growth opportunity for Enphase. In addition, we're beginning to see increased activity in Canada as the feed-in-tariff, which had been suspended, was recently reinstituted. Our gross margin of 28% in the fourth quarter was another record for Enphase and demonstrates our ability to balance with the multiple factors that impact gross margin as we seek continued expansion of this key metric. I'm also particularly pleased with our efforts in the fourth quarter to leverage our investments in infrastructure. For the first time in the Company's history, we saw operating expenses decline sequentially from the prior quarter. Kris will go into more detail on this in his review of the financials. Finally, I want to point out some recent examples which illustrate the progress we are making in two of our key initiatives, geographic expansion and commercial market application of our microinverters. On January 24, we announced our entry into the Australian market, starting our expansion into the Asia-Pacific region. Leading analysts project Australia to become a gigawatt plus solar market, and Enphase enters at a time when this growing clean economy is gaining promising momentum. And in February, we announced two commercial projects which featured Enphase microinverters; the first was a 302 kilowatt system installed by Cambio Energy of Tempe, Arizona on the Tempe Plaza carport parking structure. Cambio selected Enphase for safety, simplicity, lower cost of installation, and advanced monitoring system. The second was a 902 kilowatt commercial project, one of our largest to date, at Strain Ranches in [Orchards] (ph) rice processing facility in California. In fact, we just hosted the commissioning ceremony for this project last week. These installations validate the value we bring to large commercial projects and is indicative of the type of opportunities we'll target going forward. And with those comments, I'll turn it over to Kris
Kris Sennesael: Thank you, Paul. First, I will start with providing some more detail on the financial results for the fourth quarter of 2012, and then I will turn to the business outlook. As a reminder, the financial measures that I'm going to provide are on a non-GAAP basis unless otherwise noted. As Paul mentioned, total revenue for the fourth quarter was $57.6 million, slightly above the high end of our revenue guidance. This is an increase of 1% year-over-year, but if we normalize for the 1603 related revenue at the end of 2011, it is up 14% year-over-year. On a sequential basis, revenue was down 5% compared to our record revenue level of $60.8 million in the third quarter of 2012, mainly driven by a reduction in revenue in Canada and Europe as a result of the (indiscernible) rate changes in those areas, and a reduction of inventory levels in the channel in the U.S. as distributors were reducing inventory levels in front of a seasonally softer first quarter. During the fourth quarter, we shipped approximately 384,000 microinverters or approximately 83 megawatts. Also in the fourth quarter, Enphase set a new gross margin record of 28%, an improvement of 510 basis points compared to the 22.9% in the fourth quarter of 2011 and an increase of 110 basis points compared to the 26.9% in the third quarter of 2012. This improvement was driven by our ongoing cost reduction efforts, combined with a relatively stable pricing environment for Enphase microinverter systems. Operating expenses in the fourth quarter were $20.3 million, with R&D at $7.8 million, sales and marketing at $7 million, and G&A at $5.5 million. These non-GAAP operating expenses did not include $1.5 million in stock-based compensation expenses and $400,000 in severance costs. During the fourth quarter, we made some changes to our organization realigning departments, improving the critical skill set mix, and making adjustments to our international entities to better serve our customers. We ended the fourth quarter and full year with 384 employees, the same level as at the end of the third quarter, and up approximately 85 employees from the beginning of the year. The operating expenses were down approximately 12% compared to the third quarter of 2012. It is actually the first time in the history of the Company that we were able to reduce operating expenses sequentially, mainly as a result of discretionary spend reduction in all areas of the Company. As announced during the previous earnings call, we feel good about the current level of our operating expenses and the size and depth of our engineering, marketing, and sales team as well as the corporate friendships. Going forward, we will continue to focus on keeping our operating expenses as flat as possible and drive the leverage in the model. For the fourth quarter of 2012, net loss was $5 million or a loss of $0.12 per share. On a GAAP basis, the net loss was $7.7 million or $0.19 per share. In addition to the better than expected revenue performance during the fourth quarter, the record gross margin and the reduction in operating expenses, I'm also very pleased with the positive cash flow from operations during the fourth quarter of $7.6 million and a positive net cash flow of $3.6 million. As a result, the Company exited the year with a total cash balance of $45.3 million, up from the third quarter ending cash balance of $41.7 million. Accounts receivable at the end of the fourth quarter were $27.7 million or 44 days sales outstanding. Inventory turns are at 8 times, with inventory at the end of the fourth quarter at $19.8 million, slightly up from the $16.7 million at the end of the third quarter. Capital expenditures during the fourth quarter were $1.9 million, and depreciation and amortization was $1.6 million. Now, I would like to turn to our guidance for the first quarter of 2013. The first quarter of every year is typically a very soft quarter due to weather and other seasonal trends. We expect revenue for the first quarter to be in the range of $43 million to $46 million. At the midpoint of the guidance, this is down 23% sequentially, which is in line with normal or typical seasonality. Also, at the midpoint of the guidance, this is up 5% year-over-year, but if we exclude approximately $9 million of 1603 related revenue during the first quarter of 2012, the midpoint of the guidance is up 33% on a year-over-year basis. Regarding gross margin, we expect the gross margin to be within a range of 26% to 28%. At the midpoint, this is slightly below our record Q4 gross margin, mainly as a result of the lower volumes in a seasonally softer quarter. We also expect non-GAAP operating expenses to be approximately flat compared to the fourth quarter. And with that, I will open the line for questions.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Vishal Shah from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
Unidentified Analyst: This is [Susie Min] (ph) calling on behalf of Vishal Shah. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to get a better sense of the cadence of revenues. I know you said Q1 will be seasonally weak, but would we see kind of a pickup in Q2 going through Q4 or would it be very back ended for the year, and then I have a follow-up question?
Kris Sennesael: The normal seasonal trend is Q1 is a soft quarter due to weather and other seasonal trends, and then if we just talk about normal seasonality, we see a strong sequential growth in second quarter followed by further growth into the third quarter, and then typically there is also growth in the fourth quarter, although it slows down a little bit as the channel is preparing themselves for a softer first quarter.
Unidentified Analyst: Great, thank you. And how should we think about your target for profitability, as you said you're improving margins and that's been great as well as the revenue pickup in the next couple of quarters? Is that something we can expect in the second half of 2013 or is 2014 more of a target?
Kris Sennesael:   We do not provide full-year guidance, but we just provide guidance one quarter at a time, but as you can see from the numbers, we definitely are making strong progress towards profitability and sustainable positive cash flow. So, we are very pleased with the progress that we make, and we do have line of sight to profitability and positive cash flows without giving a specific timing on that.
Unidentified Analyst: Sorry, may I ask one more question? Just on the OpEx, I mean, you guys did a great job of reducing costs. Is that something that we can expect to stay at those levels or should we just mimic kind of growing but slower than expected revenue growth?
Kris Sennesael: Yes, so for the first quarter, we are very clear in terms of our guidance. We expect Q1 to be approximately flat compared to the fourth quarter, but then also looking forward for the rest of the year, it's definitely our target to keep operating expenses as flat as possible.
Operator: Our next question comes from Pavel Molchanov from Raymond James. Your line is open.
Pavel Molchanov - Raymond James: Hey guys, thanks for taking the question. I noticed that the blended ASP was almost $0.70 this quarter, up about $0.04, a pretty big increase from Q3. Anything in particular that accounts for that?
Paul Nahi: The blended ASP for Enphase is a little bit challenging to calculate, in part because we include cabling, the communications unit which we call Envoy, as well as different product mixes. So, I wouldn't read much into that number. What I would say is that we have been very successful in reducing prices in 2012, and we expect to have built-in further reduction in prices in 2013 for the full year.
Pavel Molchanov - Raymond James: So, I guess since you're not giving guidance for the full year in this current quarter, what sequential ASP decline should we expect?
Paul Nahi: We're not guiding specifically to ASP. What I would say is that, when we do an ASP reduction, we will certainly let you know, but for the time being, we have not announced anything in terms of price reduction.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Our next question comes from Scott Reynolds from Jefferies. Your line is open.
Scott Reynolds – Jefferies: Thanks for taking my questions and congratulations on a good quarter. I don't get to say that very often in solar land. So, I was wondering overall in 2013, does the Company have some type of expectations that they are looking at for growth in the key markets that they address, and potentially how we should think about overall market shares trending for Enphase in 2013?
Paul Nahi: Sure. So, as we mentioned, we exited the year with tremendous market share in the U.S. In fact, I don't really know of any other solar company that has had this kind of market share. However, I think what we're seeing is a very clear and undisputable trend towards microinverters on the global rooftop market, and as a result, I think what we're going to see is an increased utilization of microinverters across the globe. We clearly lead this space, and I fully expect us to maintain and increase our lead in the markets that we're in and the markets that we're going to be in.
Kris Sennesael: And maybe I would like to add there that looking into 2013, we -- and industry analysts, they expect U.S. residential market to grow 20% to 30% on a year-over-year basis. Obviously, there is going to be some price erosion that will partially offset that growth, but we will definitely continue to push hard to grow our market share as we have been able to do that in the past. In addition to that, we are continuing with our geographical expansion and continue to grow our share outside of the U.S. in Canada and Europe. Those markets nowadays are somewhat challenged, so it's a little bit unpredictable what the growth rates are going to be in those markets, but we definitely continue to expand our geographical reach in those markets.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Sanjay Shrestha. Your line is open.
Unidentified Analyst:  This is [Jacqueline] (ph) on behalf of Sanjay. I was wondering, given the traction you've had with your microinverter product, could you talk about the overall competitive dynamics on the product front, and what are you seeing from your competitors?
Paul Nahi: Sure. Well, we've had competition for a while right now, although it hasn't had a material effect on our sales. This has been primarily from smaller companies. For the first time, we are seeing competition from some of the larger companies. In fact, one of our larger competitors is investing very heavily in sales, in marketing, in outreach, both domestically and internationally for their new microinverter product, and it hasn't had any material effect on our sales. What I think we're seeing quite frankly is the challenge associated with the development of a microinverter. It's a very sophisticated technology. I think while many of our competitors are trying to develop one, I think the challenges associated with the development of a reliable product that can be introduced on a global scale has proved to be, I think, a more significant problem than they anticipated.
Unidentified Analyst: Great. Thank you. And with the improving outlook for various financing structures, especially within the residential market, are you beginning to see any meaningful uptick in demand from this segment?
Paul Nahi: Would that be demand from the finance segment?
Unidentified Analyst: From the residential market.
Paul Nahi: We are. And I think you're correct in assuming that some of that growth, if not much of that growth is being driven by financing. As Kris had mentioned, we are seeing or we are anticipating a 20% to 30% increase in the U.S. market this year. I think a large part of that will be driven by financing, and financing itself I think is also changing in its very nature as well. So we're going to see multiple types of financing in addition to the traditional cash sales.
Unidentified Analyst: Great. Thank you for the color.
Operator: Our next question is a follow-up from Scott Reynolds from Jefferies. Your line is open.
Scott Reynolds – Jefferies: Thanks. Just a follow-up to Susie's question. What do you guys see for overall breakeven levels for revenue? I know it's lumpy quarter-to-quarter on your gross margin side, but how should we think about that?
Kris Sennesael: Our breakeven model calls for revenue at approximately $80 million. We have a gross margin of 30% and obviously OpEx stand at 30%, you get to a breakeven from a non-GAAP operating income point of view.
Scott Reynolds – Jefferies: Alright, thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Edwin Mok from Needham & Company. Your line is open.
Edwin Mok - Needham & Company: Thanks for taking my question. I remember last quarter you guys talked about channel inventory. Sorry I called in late, you might have mentioned that, where is channel inventory right now, and how do you guys see that progress throughout the year?
Paul Nahi: So, it's very typical for us to see channel inventories drop at the end of Q4, as the channel prepares for a slower quarter in Q1. What we really like to see is a slow build-up in that channel from Q1 through the rest of the year, Q1, Q2, and Q3. We are on track to do that in a very modest way. So, I don't think – there is nothing unusual happening right now. It feels like a normal trend.
Edwin Mok - Needham & Company: Okay, that's helpful. And then, just going back to gross margin, I think previously you guys talked about transition to the third-generation product which will help gross margin rate because of improved design. I was wondering can you give us some yardstick in terms of when do you think you can say get to 50% of your product being third-generation, you know some kind of metric that you think about how that could help gross margin?
Paul Nahi: So, the third-generation product is a product that we are currently shipping and we're almost exclusively third-generation product right now. We have announced that we will be shipping a fourth-generation product later on this year. Our fifth-generation product is up and running in the lab as well, but the fourth-generation product, when it's introduced, will actually be introduced in parallel with our existing third-generation product, and we really can't yet speak to when the transition fully to the fourth-generation product will occur.
Edwin Mok - Needham & Company: Does that transition require a lot of requalification on the customer side or is it not that hard to make a transition from one generation to the next?
Paul Nahi: Well, our experience so far, having done this three times, has been that with each generation of products, we've been able to increase quality, increase the feature set, decrease the price, and decrease the cost. So it's been very, very readily received by all of our customers. So, I don't anticipate this transition to be any different.
Edwin Mok - Needham & Company: Great. That’s all I have, thank you.
Operator: Thank you. I show no further questions at this time, and would like to turn the conference back to Mr. Paul Nahi for closing remarks.
Paul Nahi: Thank you. So, 2012 was a great year for Enphase. Looking forward to 2013, I'm excited about the opportunity to continue driving topline growth and market share gains in our existing markets while continuing our geographical and market segment expansion. In addition, we'll continue our relentless development of next-generation technologies to further increase performance and drive down costs. This, in combination with a focus on balanced growth, will drive the leverage in the model towards healthy profit levels and positive cash flow. Thank you everyone for joining us today, and we look forward to speaking with you again next quarter.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program, and you may all disconnect at this time.
