===== 2025 Q3  (2025-03-26 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Cintas Corporation announces fiscal 2025 third quarter results conference call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Jared Mattingley, Vice President, Treasurer and Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
Jared Mattingley: Thank you, Ross. Thank you for joining us. With me are Todd Schneider, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Mike Canton, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We will discuss our fiscal 2025 third quarter results. After our commentary, we will open the call to questions from analysts. The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a safe harbor from civil litigation for forward-looking statements. This conference call contains forward-looking statements that reflect the company's current views as to future events and financial performance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ materially from those we may discuss. I refer you to the discussion on these points contained in our most recent filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. I'll now turn the call over to Todd.
Todd Schneider: Thank you, Jared. We are pleased with our strong third quarter results. Third quarter total revenue grew 8.4% to $2.61 billion. Our organic growth rate, which adjusts for the impacts of acquisitions and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, was 7.9%. Our results reflect great execution by our employee partners across each of our business segments. Uniform rental and facility services continue to perform well with organic growth of 7%. Our first aid and safety services and fire protection services businesses grew double digits, underscoring the comprehensive value proposition we offer to customers of all types and sizes. Gross margin for the third quarter grew 11.1% over the prior year to 50.6%, an all-time high. Operating income increased 17.1%, excuse me, 17.1% to 23.4%, which was also an all-time high. Our third quarter profitability includes a $15 million gain on the sale of property. Excluding that benefit, operating income as a percent of revenue was 22.8%, the second highest in Cintas history. Diluted EPS grew a robust 17.7% to $1.13. Our strong earnings growth and profitability reflect our continued operational excellence via sourcing and supply chain initiatives, route and energy optimization, and technology-enabled efficiency in our facilities. For example, we continue to leverage our SAP system to standardize our processes across our operations. These initiatives are improving the way our employee partners work and getting the right products to our customers faster, improving both the customer experience and our margin profile. Cash flow this year continues to be very strong. Our free cash flow for the first nine months of the year increased 14.5% over the prior year. Our strong cash flow generation enabled us to deploy capital across each of our capital allocation priorities, starting with investing back in the business, including products and technologies, to support our employee partners as they look to sustain attractive growth levels and create value over the long term. Additionally, we made strategic acquisitions across each of our three route-based segments in the quarter. Returning capital to Cintas shareholders also remains a key priority. Cintas paid a quarterly cash dividend of $0.39 per share on March 14th, and we continue our opportunistic approach to share buybacks. Before turning the call over to Mike to provide details of our third quarter results, I'll provide our updated financial expectations for the remainder of our fiscal year, which reflect our continued momentum and confidence in our outlook. We are updating our annual revenue expectations from a range of $10.255 billion to $10.32 billion to a range of $10.28 billion to $10.305 billion. As we enter our last quarter of fiscal 2025, we have narrowed our revenue guidance to increase total revenue growth and organic revenue growth at the midpoints of the guide. The $15 million reduction at the top end of the range reflects the negative impact of the foreign currency exchange rate experienced in the third quarter and the expected impact for the fourth quarter. Please keep in mind that the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations does not impact organic growth. Our organic revenue growth guidance is now to be in the range of 7.4% to 7.7%. We are also raising our annual diluted EPS expectations from $4.34 to a range of $4.36 to $4.40, implying a growth rate of 15% to 16.1%. I want to thank all of Cintas' employee partners for their outstanding work and dedication to our customers. With our culture of continuous improvement, superior products and services, and the strong value proposition we offer to our customers, we remain poised to deliver sustained growth and value creation for the rest of fiscal year 2025 and beyond. With that, I'll turn the call over to Mike to discuss details of our third quarter results.
Mike Canton: Thank you, Todd. Third quarter revenue was $2.61 billion compared to $2.41 billion last year. The organic revenue growth rate adjusted for acquisitions and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations was 7.9%. As Todd alluded to, foreign exchange rates negatively impacted third quarter revenue growth by 40 basis points. Organic growth by business was 7% for Uniform Rental, 15% for first aid and safety services, 10.6% for fire protection services, and uniform direct sale was down 2.3%. Gross margin for the third quarter of fiscal 2025 was $1.32 billion compared to $1.19 billion last year, an increase of 11.1%. Gross margin as a percent of revenue was an all-time high at 50.6% for the third quarter compared to 49.4%, an increase of 120 basis points. Robust volume growth, operating leverage, and continued operational efficiencies helped generate this strong gross margin. Gross margin percentage by business was 50% for uniform rental and facility services, 57% for first aid and safety services, 49.9% for fire protection services, and 41.2% for uniform direct sale. Gross margin for the Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment increased 120 basis points from last year. Our progress year over year reflects our focus on operational excellence initiatives, combined with leverage from strong revenue growth. We continue to realize benefits from our technology investments and extracting inefficiencies from the business. Gross margin for the First Aid and Safety Services segment increased 70 basis points from last year, with strong revenue growth continuing to create leverage. Our sales mix remains favorable with more profitable first aid products and increases in our recurring revenue products like AED rentals, eyewash stations, and water break. Our technology investment in SmartTruck provides route optimization and improved efficiencies. And we continue to see sourcing benefits from our first aid dedicated distribution center that have allowed us to lower product costs. All of these contribute to improved margins. Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue was 27.2%. As Todd shared, there was a $15 million gain on the sale of property during the third quarter of fiscal 2025. Without that gain, selling administrative expenses would have been 27.8%. Last year, there was a $15 million agreement in principle to settle a purported class action contract dispute. Without that $15 million settlement, selling and administrative expenses last year would have been 27.1% instead of the reported 27.7%. Third quarter operating income was $609.9 million compared to $520.8 million last year. Operating income as a percentage of revenue was 23.4% in the third quarter of fiscal 2025 compared to 21.6% in last year's third quarter, an increase of 180 basis points. Adjusted for the gain on the property sale, operating margin in the third quarter of fiscal 2025 was 22.8%, the second highest in Cintas history. Our effective tax rate for the third quarter was 21% compared to 19.9% last year. The tax rate in both quarters was impacted by certain discrete items, primarily the tax accounting impact for stock-based compensation. Net income for the third quarter was $463.5 million compared to $397.6 million last year. This year's third quarter diluted EPS of $1.13 compared to $0.96 last year, an increase of 17.7%. When adjusted for the $15 million property sale, EPS was $1.10. As Todd mentioned earlier, we continue to generate strong cash flow. Over the first nine months of the year, our free cash flow increased 14.5% over the prior year. This has allowed us to invest back in the business, which has resulted in the third quarter capital expenditures of $99.9 million. We expect capital expenditures for the year to finish close to our target of 4% of revenue. Todd provided our annual financial guidance. Related to the guidance, please note the following. Fiscal 2025 revenue guidance accounts for the impact of negative foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. While the first half of the year was negatively impacted by only 10 basis points or $5 million, the second half of the year is expected to be negatively impacted by approximately 40 basis points or $16 million. Our fiscal 2025 effective tax rate is expected to be 20.2%. Please note that this implies a fourth quarter effective tax rate of 23% compared to an effective tax rate in last year's fourth quarter of 21.4%. As a reminder, there are two fewer workdays in fiscal 2025 compared to fiscal 2024, which has a negative impact of about 80 basis points for the year. Also, as a reminder, the upcoming fourth quarter will have one less workday than last year's fourth quarter. This will negatively impact the fourth quarter total revenue growth by about 160 basis points. Guidance does not include any future share buybacks or significant downturns. I'll now turn the call back over to Todd for some closing remarks.
Todd Schneider: Thank you, Mike. Before we open the line to Q&A, I want to address the announcement we made on Monday afternoon that Cintas has terminated discussions with UniFirst regarding Cintas's proposal to acquire UniFirst for $275 per share in cash. After we publicly announced our proposal in early January, we engaged with UniFirst and its advisers in an effort to reach a mutual agreement regarding a transaction that we believe offers tremendous value for customers and shareholders. Despite Cintas's considerable efforts, we were unable to have substantive engagement with UniFirst regarding key transaction terms. While we continue to believe in the merits of a transaction, we do not believe further discussions are warranted at this time. As you all can appreciate, we will not have more to say on this matter. As our third quarter performance demonstrates, we remain focused on executing our strategy and taking great care of our customers, and we look forward to the great market opportunity ahead. With that, I'll turn it back over to Jared.
Jared Mattingley: Thanks, Todd. That concludes our prepared remarks. Now we are happy to answer questions from the analysts. And a single follow-up if needed. Thank you.
Operator: If you would like to ask a question, please be prepared to ask your question when prompted. You will also be allowed to ask one follow-up question. Once again, if you would like to ask a question, our first question comes from George Tong from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead, George.
George Tong: Hi, thanks. Good morning. Can you talk a little bit about how customer purchasing behaviors in sales cycles are changing given the currently evolving macro environment?
Todd Schneider: Good morning, George. So the customer behavior, I would say, remains stable. Our new business and our retention rates continue to be attractive. Our ad stops metrics really there has been no significant change. We certainly recognize there is more uncertainty in the marketplace right now, and we are reading the similar things to what you are reading. And we continue to monitor things. But our value proposition continues to resonate, especially in periods of uncertainty like this. Outsourcing can improve on steady cash flow and saves time that can be spent on people's business, on our customer's business. So no real change, I would say, to customer behavior at this point, sales cycles, etcetera. But we are certainly monitoring it, paying close attention as, again, we are reading the same things you are reading.
George Tong: Got it. That's helpful. And just as a quick follow-up, you mentioned last quarter that you are experiencing some pricing normalization as inflation normalizes. Can you talk a little bit about how pricing trends are performing this quarter compared to the past quarters?
Todd Schneider: Great question. You know, the pricing environment, as always, it's always challenging. Has been my entire career. I'm sure it will be in the future. Our pricing is right at historic levels. So, again, there is more uncertainty in the market. But we really haven't seen any change from that standpoint. And I'd like to just say that I'm really proud of the organization. Being able to grow at attractive levels the way they are and expand margins by extracting out inefficiencies in our business. It's been impressive to watch. In an environment that has been certainly a little bit more uncertain with the news that has been coming out of the administration and other areas of our economy.
George Tong: Very helpful. Thank you.
Operator: And our next question comes from Jasper Bibb from Truist Securities. Please go ahead, Jasper.
Jasper Bibb: Hey, good morning, guys. I was hoping you could update us on what you're seeing on the COGS side related to tariffs on Mexico and China, and I guess, is there any way to frame the exposure to purchasing from those countries and what you might be able to do to offset any potential increased costs with your sourcing efforts.
Todd Schneider: Good morning, Jasper. Yeah. First off, it's too early to tell any tariff impact that might have. Certainly, we were well aware of April 2nd that the administration is going to be announcing potentially additional tariffs, but it's too early to tell at this point. I'll say this, our supply chain organization is a strategic advantage for us. So, you know, we have less than 10% of our products are sole sourced. We're in a really good position to negotiate from that standpoint. Certainly, it is something that we're watching. But we think we've got a real competitive advantage there. The geographic diversity that we have, as I mentioned, the dual sourcing. And our corporate culture traits of positive discontent and competitive urgency, they fuel process improvements that drive us to be more efficient. So we think we're in a good position there. We're certainly paying very close attention to it. And we will pivot as appropriate, and we believe we're well positioned to pivot. All that being said, as you're aware, it takes a while for products to get through the system for us. Whether it is manufacturing it, has to get into our inventory, then it has to be purchased by our locations, and then we amortize it. So we have really good visibility on what our costs will look like, which gives us time to pivot. And time to address these subjects with customers as appropriate.
Jasper Bibb: Thanks for that. And then maybe stepping back on the M&A question, are you thinking about the opportunity to consolidate, I guess, more midsized private platforms to be available in rental uniform or your other industry verticals? And I guess separately, how would you characterize the pipeline of those smaller tuck-in size deals for that?
Todd Schneider: Great question. First off, M&A has been an important part of our strategy for the last, I'd say, thirty, forty years. So that's important to us. And we love M&A. We love tuck-ins. Tuck-ins are very attractive for us. Allow us to bring efficiencies on route, bring customers on where we can offer additional a wider breadth of products and services to those customers. And in certain cases, we're able to bring on M&A that allows us to have additional capacity. So that's all important to us, and we are always in search of that. You really can't pace it. That pacing is really around, in certain cases, family dynamics, whether or not an operator is getting to a retirement age or an operator doesn't have children that are interested in participating or whatever. So it's tough to pace those and predict them. But we're active in the market. And we are pursuing M&A in all of our route-based segments, and we think it's a great use of cash for us.
Jasper Bibb: Thanks for taking the question, guys.
Operator: And our next question comes from Manav Patnaik from Barclays. Please go ahead, Manav.
Ronan Kennedy: Good morning. This is Ronan Kennedy on for Manav. Thank you for taking my questions. Could I please reconfirm the primary drivers of these impressive margins, especially at the GM level, and then also the sustainability of those drivers and how that will evolve going forward in consideration as to whether the 25% to 35% incremental range is still the right way to think about it?
Todd Schneider: Good morning, Ronan. I'll start, Mike, if you want to chime in. We believe that 25% to 35% incrementals are the area where we want to point towards. And we believe we can continue to do that. It's really driven by solid execution in our key initiatives. As I speak about often, our core corporate culture is our greatest competitive advantage. And it drives the behaviors around trying to execute at high levels, but also find ways to extract out inefficiencies. That being said, strong revenue growth is a very powerful leverage for us, and we've executed nicely upon that. In addition to that, the material cost improvements we've seen through improved sourcing, the technology that we deployed into our facilities that allows us to get better reuse of garments has been important to us. And then I would say the other infrastructure improvements that we made through our engineering department and our Six Sigma black belt teams have been encouraging for us. And we still see that target of 25% to 35% incrementals as being where we're focused on and where we plan to drive towards.
Ronan Kennedy: Thank you. Appreciate it. And then going, I guess, to a more granular level with that question, how should we think about the current operating and incremental for the respective segments, uniforms and first aid, drivers and sustainability there? And I guess also for fire protection, I understand there is going to be some potential impacts of SAP conversion next year, but just anything to be mindful of margin-wise by segment specifically.
Todd Schneider: Yeah. I spoke a little bit to the rental, you know, the garment sharing, the technology we're deploying in our facilities, our smart truck technology that we're leveraging across all of our route-based systems, our route-based businesses, have been important for us. Just speaking of first aid, really again, really good organic revenue growth, which is giving us real leverage. The value proposition in that business is resonating big time. You know, we talk, the leadership of our organization in First Aid speaks about what's more important to a customer than the health and safety of a business's employees and their customers. So that value proposition is resonating. The mix of revenue in the first aid business is attractive. It's in recurring type areas of our business. Our sourcing organization has done a really nice job with our dedicated first aid distribution center. As I mentioned, SmartTruck. And in the fire business, the leverage that we're getting is, again, on attractive revenue growth, deploying technology to make our people more successful and more efficient. And you're correct. We are investing in deploying SAP into that business, and we're encouraged about, as we get through the deployment, reaping some benefits in that business as well.
Ronan Kennedy: Thank you. I appreciate it.
Operator: And our next question comes from Tim Mulrooney from William Blair. Please go ahead, Tim.
Luke McFadden: Good morning. This is Luke McFadden for Tim Mulrooney. Thanks for taking our questions today. Maybe starting off one here just on the macro picture. Fully recognize you're not providing guidance for 2026 at this time. But just curious, kind of at a high level, how should we think about the setup heading into next year, given organic growth in the business remains pretty healthy, but obviously, there's a decent amount of uncertainty out there right now.
Todd Schneider: Yes. Good morning. Yeah. So we're certainly monitoring it very closely, but we're positioning our people to be successful in the short, mid, and long term. So we're investing in our business so that we have great products, great services, and provide a real value proposition to our customers. You know, we've shown the ability to grow our business in just about every economic environment that we've seen over my career. And we've shown the ability to grow in multiples of GDP. You know, we certainly love it when people are hiring more workers, but we've been able to grow in spite of that. So whatever the economic environment that is thrown at us, we plan to be successful, and we're organized around that. We're investing for that. And we see that opportunity moving forward. So we'll continue to monitor it very closely and watch the impact on the economy and our customer base, and we will pivot appropriately. But nevertheless, we think our value proposition resonates with folks and helps them run a better business.
Luke McFadden: Understood. Thanks. That's really helpful. And then maybe switching gears a bit here. You've spoken recently about government as being a focus vertical. Just curious how you're thinking about that opportunity in light of the administration's intention to reduce spending broadly across the federal government agencies? Thanks.
Todd Schneider: Great. Good question. You know, keep in mind, we have a very broad customer base. But the efforts that are going on there, it's too early to tell what exactly is going to happen. As you have seen, the efforts are really around the federal government, and our focus has been on state and local governments. So there's certainly a possibility that the work still needs to be done at the state and local government level. So as the federal government shrinks, it's very possible that the state and local government just take on more work. So we're watching that. We've recently, from a state and local standpoint, had a local public school system, a very large public school system, come to us and talk about, hey, is there ways that you can take cost out? And in that case, we consolidated suppliers, meaning that provided us more business but lowered the overall total cost of their program. And so this allowed us to streamline invoicing for the customer, which lowered the administrative burden for the school system. So, net-net, we took cost out of the total dollars that were in their budget, but we were able to enjoy a larger portion of that wallet. So we expect that certainly that may very well be a more common subject in the future, but we're having those types of conversations with all customers, and certainly school systems are not immune to that. So we think we're in a good spot.
Luke McFadden: Great. Thanks so much.
Operator: And our next question comes from Andrew Steinerman from JPMorgan Securities. Please go ahead, Andrew.
Andrew Steinerman: Hey, Mike. Two questions. One small one, one math one. So what was energy and fuel cost as a percentage of revenues in the just reported third quarter? And my second question is, could you tell us what's implied, what's embedded in your full-year organic revenue growth guidance when you look on a sequential basis at the fourth quarter that we're in now versus the third quarter, and you can imagine I'm talking about organic constant currency sequential same-day basis.
Mike Canton: Let me start, Andrew, with energy. And the energy for the quarter was for the total company was 1.7% of revenue. That's the same as last year's third quarter. Rental was 2%, same as last year, 2%. From an organic guide, Andrew, we just talked about a 40 basis point on total revenue in the third quarter because of FX. We expect that to be fairly similar in the fourth quarter. In addition to that, in the quarter, we had, you know, call it 70 basis points of M&A impact. Actually, it was 90 basis points of M&A impact with a 40 basis point headwind to get to that 50 basis point differential. Something not too different than that in the fourth quarter is where I would be guiding you.
Andrew Steinerman: Right. So maybe let me just ask it one other way. When you look at the sequential revenue for the fourth quarter that we're in versus the third quarter we just reported, are you assuming a normal seasonal pattern?
Mike Canton: Well, we would assume a normal seasonal pattern in the performance of the business and the underlying performance of the business, yes. The FX is a little different in that we have seen a change in the FX in this back half of the year, both in terms of the size of the move and the quickness of the move that is not usual for us. That's why we've called out the Canadian FX impact.
Andrew Steinerman: Good.
Mike Canton: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: And our next question comes from Justin Hock from RW Baird. Please go ahead, Justin.
Justin Hock: Yeah. Great. Thank you. I guess I just wanted to follow-up on that question that was just asked because it would look like the fourth quarter organic, you know, constant currency and workday adjusted implied number with having that same FX headwind and the M&A contribution would be closer to, like, you know, 6% versus the high sevens that you've done in the last two quarters. So I guess I was just curious why there would be kind of a deceleration there. And then the second one, and this is also just purely a number question, but the $15 million gain on sale, which segment was that in on the SG&A line? Thank you.
Mike Canton: I'll answer the second question first. That was spread across for both this year and last year, spread across each of our segments. From a fourth quarter revenue standpoint, Justin, let's keep in mind that there's one less workday. Right? So that is 180 basis points of growth impact. So if you take that, if you take the guide range and solve it for the fourth quarter, yes, you are going to see deceleration in total growth, mainly because we have the headwind of one less workday. So when you add back that 180 basis points to our growth, you get something very similar to what we've been doing for the full year, both in growth excluding the workday impact, as well as the organic growth. We expect to have a pretty good quarter in the fourth quarter. That's what the guide is leading us to.
Justin Hock: Okay. Alright. Thank you for clarifying that. I guess we'll check the math on the workdays, but it sounds like it should be similar to what you did. Thank you.
Operator: And our next question comes from Ashish Sabadra from RBC. Please go ahead, Ashish.
David Paige: Hi, good morning. This is David on for Ashish. Thanks for taking our question. Can you just dive a little bit deeper into uniform direct sales? Looks like sequentially, it performed better, but still a little down. And so any color there? And then as a follow-up, just circling back to capital allocation, can you just give us an overview, I guess, like, the valuations and the multiples we're seeing out in the market and, absent of any large M&A, would you shift towards a buyback stake?
Todd Schneider: Yes. Thanks for the question. First off, our Uniform Direct Sale business is historically, there is some lumpiness to that business. It was improved sequentially. But that's a very important business to us. It's a strategic business. We sell a lot into those customers, not just uniform direct sale, but they are outstanding prospects for, you know, from rental, also for facility services, first aid, and fire services. So that's a strategic business for us. That sets the table for us to sell additional services. And, yeah, there can be some lumpiness, but we think we're well positioned in that business. Regarding capital allocation, just to remind you, our number one use of cash is investing back in the business. So we want to invest back in the business because we want to make sure that we're positioning our people to be highly successful, yeah, with the appropriate capacity, the appropriate technology, tools, products, services, training, all that is very important. Second item for us would be M&A. And I think we've shown to be very good stewards of capital as it relates to that. We're making strategic acquisitions, really attractive businesses that we can bring our products and services to and also bring our efficiencies to. But it starts with when you have those strategic M&A, it starts with the most important resources there. Certainly, our products and trucks and systems, what have you, but it's really the people. And there were no buybacks in Q3, but we think our balance sheet puts us in an incredibly good position to deploy as needed.
David Paige: Great. Thank you.
Operator: And our next question comes from Scott Schneeberger from Oppenheimer. Please go ahead, Scott.
Scott Schneeberger: Hey, thanks very much. I just wanted to touch base on, I think it's pronounced Hitch, the acquisition you made a quarter or two ago. Any learnings or just a progress report there and any evolution or opportunity to offer new Cintas products, not only stemming from perhaps that, but from other acquisitions or ideas or initiatives you've come with recently? Thanks.
Todd Schneider: Thanks for the question, Scott. Hitch is how you pronounce it. And it's a company that we've admired for decades. And that was in a particular case where it was in the family for generations. And the owner, Jim Vaudre, passed away, and the family then saw it as the most appropriate decision to merge their business in with Cintas. So great example of an outstanding company, great customer relationships. We received capacity in those markets as well. The most important thing that we got there were certainly the people and the customers. We love the capacity. But it's about the now Cintas partners and their customers. And every time we acquire a company, we learn and we get better as a result of that. We learn from them. Hopefully, they learn a little from us, but the most important thing is we get, usually, really good people. In that case, we absolutely did. And great customers that we're going to try to make sure we nurture and hang on to and grow.
Scott Schneeberger: Okay. Thanks. Appreciate that. And for the follow-up, just free cash flow has been very strong this year. Looks like in working capital, you've been making a lot of improvement. Just curious, what has occurred structurally perhaps thinking ahead to the out years? Are you going to be able to achieve a new level, and how should we think about free cash flow as a percent of revenue perhaps? And are you moving in a very positive direction? And then maybe some discussion of how that's occurred.
Mike Canton: Sure, Scott. Free cash flow has been strong for us, and last year was quite a strong year, and we've grown about 15% over last year. We have generally, from a net income conversion to free cash flow, we've generally been in a 90% to 100% type of range, and that's where we are this year. And that's where our expectation would be as we go into the next several years. There are times, for example, where we may spend a little bit more on inventory, as we did in the third quarter. You saw inventory go up just a little bit to maybe get out ahead of the tariffs. Todd talked about how we're dealing with tariffs. And maybe make a little bit more of an investment in the near term to make sure that we've got the inventory we want, at the cost that we want. And so there can be various quarters ups and downs, but generally speaking, we like our ops cash flow to be in that 110% to 120% range. And we like our free cash flow to be in that 90% to 100% range. I would expect that going forward too.
Scott Schneeberger: Great. Thanks.
Operator: And our next question comes from Shlomo Rosenbaum from Stifel Nicola. Please go ahead, Shlomo.
Shlomo Rosenbaum: Hi. Thank you. I just have a few questions out there. Todd, are you seeing any change at all competitively? One of your major competitors is just seeing a lot of change on the top of their organization. I was just wondering, is that something that you kind of notice on the ground, or is that not really noticed on the ground over the last kind of year, year and a half?
Todd Schneider: Yeah. So good morning, Shlomo. Thanks for the question. We operate in a very competitive industry. It always has been. So nothing noteworthy as far as change there. Certainly, we're aware of the changes in the organization at the top level of the organization you're speaking of. But I don't know if that's changed any dynamic of how people are taking care of their customers and what have you. And just keep in mind that our new business wins tend to come from the vast majority are from what we call no programmers, those who are not renting when we walk in and when we walk out they are. So, yeah, we love winning business and always, but for the past several decades, we've grown our business primarily by growing the pie of customers, those who were sourcing products somehow. They might be buying it on the Internet or they might be buying it at Costco or Walmart or what have you. And then we've shown a better, faster, smarter way. Even with garments, especially with garments, I would say, everybody's wearing garments and that, Jeff, matter of obtaining those garments. So, in fact, I've got a couple examples I'll give you. You know, we recently converted over a large equipment manufacturer that was purchasing flame-resistant clothing from a competitor. They were really excited about our Carhartt branded flame-resistant clothing line. And they were looking for a higher quality garment to improve employee comfort and overall satisfaction. And as we dug into it, we were actually able to save them some dollars in the rental program because of the turnovers that they had. And also our first aid and safety team at the same time was able to provide some essential training for that customer around their electrical program in conjunction with some recent OSHA guidance change on that subject. So that's an example where they were certainly wearing garments. They were, but they were not taking it from a rental competitor there. But it resulted for the customer in a safer, more compliant customer with happier wearers and lower overall cost. So I've got other examples like that that we've seen. You know, we just recently converted over a Fortune 500 global field service company with thousands of remote service technicians that were in a direct purchase program. Again, they were dealing with long lead times, how do they repair the garments, how they replace them, size changes, new hires. And the challenge is the workforce doesn't report back to a central location. So in that case, we placed them in a managed program where their employees were able to clean their own product, clean the garments, but we manage the inventory, size changes, repairs, placements. So I give those examples because, yeah, certainly, we're always interested in the competitive landscape. It's always been competitive. Always will be, but we see the greatest opportunity is to expand that pie and sell programs, manage programs into companies that are buying product or haven't seen the value yet in having a uniform program. And we grow that pie. So it's really important to us. It's been a key strategic lever for us for decades. And we'll continue into the future.
Shlomo Rosenbaum: Great. Thank you. Just one follow-up for Mike. Can you just give us a heads up on what the days look like for the quarters in fiscal year 2026 for modeling? Like, is the year the same? Are there any nuances between the quarters?
Mike Canton: Shlomo, they are all the same as current as fiscal 2025 for the quarters. The days per quarter in fiscal 2026 are the same as in fiscal 2025. Sixty-five in every quarter.
Shlomo Rosenbaum: Thank you.
Operator: And the next question comes from Stephanie Moore from Jefferies.
Harold Antor: Hello. This is Harold on for Stephanie Moore. So I guess just real quick on the tech investment side. You know, you talk about SAP, SmartTracking, MyCintas portal. I know you're still rolling out. So if you could just provide us, you know, a sense of where you are at least, like, which end you're in, along that journey. And I guess, if you're doing any other incremental tech investments in the business that you're waiting to materialize, that'd be helpful. Thank you.
Todd Schneider: Yeah, Harold, we are thanks for the question. We're always making tech investments because it's important to make our employee partners more successful and provide more value to our customers. So specific to the MyCintas portal, yeah, it is rolled out. Once we roll out the fire business on SAP, all of our route-based businesses will be on that same portal. And we see advantages absolutely today, and we see advantages coming in the future as we expand it out, but also offer more benefits to the customers. So when you think about it, they can pay, they can make service requests, they can manage their program in totality, and they can buy. So all that is an additional conduit for the customer to be able to work with us and make it easier to work with us. So and that's a fundamental concept that we have is that we want to make it easier for the customer to do business with us and make it easier for our employee partners to do their jobs. So, yeah, you'll see continued investment in that, and that'll be going on for many, many years.
Harold Antor: Thank you for the color. My guess is on your verticals, you know, health care, hospitality, food services. Anything in the call out there, are you seeing any new business wins in any particular vertical this quarter or any in the pipeline that you would like to call out? And then, I guess, also on the new business side, sounds like you've seen some new business wins on the larger side. So are you when you look at your new business wins, are they more so coming from national accounts now versus small businesses? Anything around there? That would be helpful. Thank you.
Todd Schneider: Thanks for the question, Harold. Just to address the back half of your question, the examples I gave you were a couple large. We have wins of all shapes and sizes, all industries, really small companies or larger ones. You name it, we have it. But as far as the verticals are concerned, they're all performing well. We're happy with our investments there. We think we've chosen really good verticals. And we've organized around them as well. Servicing them, selling them, managing them, all that is very important. In health care, I'll give you a couple of examples of wins. We rolled out our health care privacy curtain business product line about a year or so ago. And we just recently sold a large multistate health care network into this privacy curtain service. Prior to us, the customer was trying to manage the tracking, the exchange, the cleaning of the curtains themselves, which is what most of that market is. And we came in with our patented curtain system and proprietary technology. And it's had a really positive impact on their business. We received a letter from the customer, and they told us the following. Told us, first off, that our services allowed them to now achieve 100% compliance with regulators. The program has generated over 20% cost savings for them from them managing themselves. It has also helped them reduce hospital-acquired infections, which is obviously very, very important. And then lastly, the program has enhanced the patient and employee satisfaction level at the hospital network. So a lot of wins there, and that came from the customer. And I'll give you one other one. We had from a health care scrub dispensing program, we converted over recently a 14-hospital network that was renting scrubs from a traditional supplier, but one that had inadequate inventory control. And as a result, lost scrubs were a real problem for the customer and showing up in lost charges and a lack of supply for the wearers, which was a real pain point for the administrators, the hospital administrators, because, yeah, the cost was a real problem. But when they didn't have product for the employees, then that's a really big problem. So we deployed our patented dispensing technology, which eliminated the loss charges and the frustration around the lack of supply. But it also allowed us to invest in a more comfortable high-quality scrub at a net savings for the customer. So a real win-win for the healthcare worker and the administrators and another example of, in both those cases, we're deploying better products, technology, positioning our people to take better care of the customer, and in almost all those cases, we're helping to save that money.
Harold Antor: Thank you for all the color. Really appreciate it.
Operator: And our next question comes from Toni Kaplan from Morgan Stanley.
Toni Kaplan: Thanks so much. I was hoping you could give us an update on cross-selling, how many products on average each customer is purchasing, how that's trended. Just maybe where are you seeing the most cross-selling or add-ons? Like, is there a specific type of product or within a certain vertical? Just anything on cross-selling would be helpful.
Todd Schneider: Toni, great question. Our cross-selling efforts are going quite well. But we're still very much in the early innings. As I think we've described in the past, our most penetrated item is walk-off mats, but we have opportunities to sell a vast majority of our products into even our rental customers, separate from that to sell to cross-sell within the business unit. So really having great success with each of them. Our fire business is the only business that we're in where you legally have to have it in order to operate your business. So every business in the country is a prospect for us in that case. So that's certainly a simpler one because every customer that we service is a great candidate for our fire service, whether it be sprinkler alarm, fire extinguishers, emergency lights, etcetera. But we're having great success and continue to have great success with cross-selling our first aid products, AEDs, eyewash, water break, first aid cabinets, that's going quite well. But the opportunity we have is immense to cross-sell and upsell within our current customer base, all while we're focused on bringing in additional customers into the fray.
Toni Kaplan: Great. And then just as a follow-up on outsourcing, we talked about it a couple of times how there could be an opportunity if customers want to reduce their budgets that you can provide some help to them there. Just wanted to get a sense of historically when you've seen sort of periods of budget tightening or uncertainty, like, do you tend to see that outsourcing accelerate? Like, just obviously, that could be offset by other things. But, you know, have you seen that historically and just maybe an update on outsourcing and how that's been trending over the last, call it, few months.
Todd Schneider: Toni, it's a good question. You know, if a customer cuts back on the number of employees that they may have, there's still work to be done. And in many cases, they look to an alternative source to help them get that work done. And because we're there, we have eyes, ears, and minds in our customers on a very, very frequent basis, it allows us to see opportunities and help them with those. In many cases, we hear from them, oh my gosh, you can take care of this for me. Thank you. I don't have to put the cash flow up front, and I can just outsource it to you. So that happens. That absolutely happens. When customers are trying to cut back on cost, in many cases, they might be spending money with another vendor that is not a traditional direct competitor that you would think of, but they might be buying it from a website or a retail network. So and as a result, in many cases, because we're there and we can manage it for them, we can help them reduce the cost of running the program and allow them to be freed up to take care of their employees and their customers. So we see that as an opportunity, and we'll pivot as appropriate based upon what we see with our customer base.
Toni Kaplan: Terrific. Thanks.
Operator: And our next question comes from Jason Haas from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead, Jason.
Jason Haas: Good morning, and thanks for taking my questions. Wanted to follow-up on the response to an earlier question on pricing to see if you could put a finer point on it. I think you had said that we're right in the historical range, which my understanding of the historical range was that's 0% to 2%. I thought, at least as of last quarter, the pricing was running more like 2%. So I wasn't sure if that implied that there's been further moderation in pricing from last quarter, and now we're just thinking about closer to the midpoint of that range. So if you could just help clarify that, that'd be helpful.
Todd Schneider: Well, Jason, the way I describe it is pricing hasn't changed. It's exactly where it was last quarter, which is about historical levels. And so really no change to the environment from what we described last quarter.
Jason Haas: Alright. Okay. That's helpful. Thanks for clarifying. And then just on the incremental margins, on the thought that 25% to 35% is the right range. I think we're going to be, you know, definitely will be above that this year. It seems. So can you help me just understand what would drive the incremental margins back down to that 25% to 35% range? I'm not sure exactly what the gain on sale, the $15 million gain on sale. So, like, I assume that's not a recurring, I don't know if there's vehicle sales or what, but I assume that's not a recurring benefit. And then I know that there's the SAP implementation for FHIR, but is there anything else to think about that sort of brings those incremental margins back down lower going forward? Thank you.
Todd Schneider: Well, Jason, first off, that land sale is not recurring. So that was a one-timer. And as far as incrementals moving forward, you know, running a business is not linear. And we suspect that we'll have over time incrementals between 25% and 35%, which we're really proud of and think are really attractive. And right where we want to be, we want to make sure we're investing appropriately in the business. And so we're doing exactly that, whether it comes from, to your point, investing in technology, investing in infrastructure, more products and services, training, you know, all those items are very important for us so that we can continue to provide a great working environment for employee partners and a great value proposition for our customers.
Mike Canton: Jason, I might add, you know, when there are times also when you're computing that incremental margin, where last year's margin has an impact. So for example, especially if you remove the $15 million settlement from a year ago, our second half of fiscal 2024 was, we made a nice jump in operating margin. And so when you do that, that also has an impact on that incremental calculation. So it's dependent on where we were last year, what our levels and cadence of investments are this year, as well. But the really good news is, as Todd's been saying, our initiatives, these initiatives that we talk about all the time, they are not one-time, but they are just changing the way we do business, and that gives us confidence that we can still work in that range for years to come.
Jason Haas: That's great. Thank you.
Operator: And our next question comes from Leo Carrington from Citigroup. Please go ahead, Leo.
Leo Carrington: Good morning. Thank you. On the topic of M&A away from UniFirst itself, are there any other large M&A targets in North America? And if not in uniform rentals, where does this leave you? Other route-based service targets of interest? Outside of North America, or are you just solely focused on the tuck-in fertilizer-wise? Thank you.
Todd Schneider: Yeah. Leo, thanks for the question. We really don't get into any particular M&A, you know, particular deals. But I'll say that our focus is on North America. We still see a great runway there. We service a million customers. There are 17 million businesses in what is still a very fragmented business for M&A opportunities, but also just selling more customers and bringing on more customers. So we don't see a need to expand outside of North America at this point. We're always watching, and we have relationships with the appropriate people in various geographies, which we stay in touch with because we want to make sure we're in touch with the market, but we don't see a need. We have an incredible opportunity here in North America, what we think is the greatest economy in the world. And that's where our focus is. As far as any particular M&A, we're interested in buying great companies that have great customers and great employees that we can bring into the Cintas family. Thank you.
Operator: And at this time, there are no further questions. I'd like to turn the call back over to Jared for some closing remarks.
Jared Mattingley: Thank you for joining us this morning. We will issue our fourth quarter of fiscal 2025 financial results in July. We look forward to speaking with you again at that time. Thank you.
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2025 Q2  (2024-12-19 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Cintas Corporation Announces Fiscal 2025 Second Quarter Results Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Mr. Jared Mattingley, Vice President and Treasurer, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
Jared Mattingley: Thank you for joining us. With me are Todd Schneider, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Mike Hansen, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We'll discuss our fiscal '25 second quarter results. After our commentary, we will open the call to questions from analysts. The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a safe harbor from civil litigation for forward-looking statements. This conference call contains forward-looking statements that reflect the Company's current views as to future events and financial performance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those we may discuss. I refer you to the discussion on these points contained in our most recent filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. I will now turn the call over to Todd.
Todd Schneider: Thank you, Jared. We are pleased with our strong second quarter results, which reflect great execution by our employee partners and the comprehensive value proposition we provide to our customers in supporting their image, safety, cleanliness and compliance needs. Second quarter total revenue grew 7.8% to $2.56 billion an all-time high for revenue in a quarter. The organic growth rate, which adjusts for the impacts of acquisitions and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, was 7.1%. In the second quarter, we continued to experience strong demand for our services, reflecting the complementary nature of our platform and our unmatched product and service offerings for businesses of all types and sizes. Virtually, every business has a need Cintas is ready to meet, whether it's a front door that needs a mat, a bathroom to service, exit lighting, fire extinguishers and sprinkler systems, first aid and safety needs or an apparel solution. Cintas is continually deepening our value propositions, particularly within our four focused verticals of healthcare, hospitality, education, and state and local government, which continued to perform well. Gross margin for the second quarter grew 11.8% over the prior year to 49.8%, just below our all-time high we set in the first quarter. Operating income of 23.1% as a percent of revenue was an all-time record, an increase of 18.4% over the prior year. Diluted EPS grew robust 21.1% to $1.09. Our strong earnings growth reflects our operational excellence via sourcing and supply chain initiatives, route and energy optimization, and technology enabled efficiency in our facilities. Cash flow this year continues to be very strong with free cash flow for the first six months increasing 34.9% over the prior year. We continue to deploy capital across each of our capital allocation priorities, starting with investing back into our businesses. This strong cash flow generation allows us to focus on making strategic investments in our customers and our employee partners, which positions us to deliver long-term value for our shareholders. Our technology investments remain a significant area of reinvestment. We continue to leverage our SAP system to standardize our processes across our operations. Combined with our focus on operational excellence, we are improving the way our employees work and getting the right products to our customers faster, all of which improves the customer experience and positively impacts our margin profile. At the same time of investing in our customers and employee partners and making strategic acquisitions, returning capital to Cintas' shareholders remains a key priority. Cintas paid a quarterly cash dividend of $0.39 per share last week. And looking ahead, we will continue our opportunistic approach with share buybacks. Before turning the call over to Mike to provide details of our second quarter results, I'll provide our updated financial expectations for our fiscal year, which reflect our strong momentum and confidence in our outlook. We are updating our annual revenue expectations from a range of $10.22 billion to $10.32 billion to a range of $10.255 billion to $10.32 billion, a total growth rate of 6.9% to 7.5%. We expect our organic growth rate to be in the range of 7.0% to 7.7%. We are also updating our annual diluted EPS expectations from a range of $4.17 to $4.25 to a range of $4.28 to $4.34, a growth rate of 12.9% to 14.5%. Cintas' differentiated culture, superior products and services, and industry best talent position us to deliver meaningful value creation in fiscal 2025 and beyond. We remain focused on delivering outstanding customer experiences and making appropriate investments in the business to sustain our growth. I thank all of Cintas' employee partners whose outstanding work and dedication to our customers remains the key to our success. With that, I'll turn it over to Mike to discuss the details of our second quarter results.
Mike Hansen: Thanks, Todd, and good morning. Our fiscal 2025 second quarter revenue was $2.56 billion compared to $2.38 billion last year. The organic revenue growth rate adjusted for acquisitions and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations was 7.1%. Organic growth by business was 6.9% for Uniform Rental and Facility Services, 12.3% for First Aid and Safety Services, 10% for Fire Protection Services, and Uniform Direct Sale was down 9.2%. Gross margin for the second quarter of fiscal '25 was $1.28 billion compared to $1.14 billion last year, an increase of 11.8%. As Todd mentioned, gross margin as a percent of revenue was 49.8% for the second quarter compared to 48% last year, an increase of 180 basis points. Robust volume growth, operating leverage and continued operational efficiencies helped to generate this strong gross margin. Gross margin percentage by business was 49.1% for Uniform Rental and Facility Services, 57.3% for First Aid and Safety Services, 49.9% for Fire Protection Services, and 41. 2% for Uniform Direct Sale. Gross margin for the Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment increased 170 basis points from last year. Our progress year-over-year reflects our focus on operational excellence initiatives combined with leverage from strong revenue growth. We continue to realize benefits from our technology investments and extracting inefficiencies from the business through our Six Sigma and engineering teams. Gross margin for the First Aid and Safety Services segment increased 280 basis points from last year with strong revenue growth continuing to create leverage. Our sales mix remains favorable with more profitable first aid products and increases in our recurring revenue products like AED rentals, eyewash stations and WaterBreak. Our technology investment in SmartTruck provides route optimization and improved efficiencies. And we continue to see sourcing benefits from our first aid dedicated distribution center that have allowed us to lower product costs. All of these contribute to improved margins. Selling and administrative expenses as a percent of revenue was 26.8%, which was relatively consistent with last year. Second quarter operating income was $591.4 million compared to $499.7 million last year. Operating income as a percent of revenue was 23.1% in the second quarter of fiscal '25 compared to 21% in last year's second quarter, an increase of 210 basis points. Our effective tax rate for the second quarter was 20.7% compared to 20.9% last year. The tax rates in both quarters were impacted by certain discrete items, primarily the tax accounting impact for stock-based compensation. Net income for the second quarter was $448.5 million compared to $374.6 million last year. This year's second quarter diluted EPS of $1.09 compared to $0.90 last year, an increase of 21.1%. As Todd mentioned, earlier, we continue to generate strong cash flow. Through the first six months, our free cash flow increased 34.9% over the prior year. This great cash flow over the first six months has allowed us to deploy a total of $1.3 billion of capital across each of our capital allocation priorities of capital expenditures, M&A, dividends and share buybacks. Todd will provide our annual financial guidance related to the guidance. Please note the following. Fiscal 2025 net interest expense is expected to be approximately $101 million compared to $95 million in fiscal '24. predominantly as a result of higher variable rate debt. Our fiscal '25 effective tax rate is expected to be 20.2% and guidance does not include any future share buybacks or significant economic disruptions or downturns. I'll now turn it back over to Jared.
Jared Mattingley: Thanks, Mike. That concludes our prepared remarks. Now we are happy to answer questions from the analysts. Please ask just one question and a single follow-up, if needed. Thank you.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Tim Mulrooney from William Blair. Please go ahead, Tim.
Tim Mulrooney: Yes. Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to ask about your guide on organic growth. It looks like it came down slightly at the high-end from 8.1% to 7.7%. Just curious what the reason for that was, if second quarter sales came in below your expectations or if the outlook for the second half of the fiscal year, it's shifted slightly? I know it's a small number, but just curious if you had any comment there.
Todd Schneider: Good morning, Tim. Thanks for the question. First, we're pleased with our organic growth rate of 7.1%. It's very good and it's right where we'd like to be. And our second half guide implies a continuation of that good growth, mid to high single-digits. The rental division is right in line where we like it to be. And the First Aid and Fire divisions both grew double-digits. So, they continue to perform well, and the value proposition continues to resonate. So, we like where we are, and we think that our guide reflects attractive growth for the year and the back half of the year as well.
Mike Hansen: And Tim, I might offer a couple of things on the guide as well. The workday adjusted revenue for the year is now 7.7% to 8.4%. So, a really nice range for us. And as you said, the organic revenue growth of 7% to 7.7% is a really good year for us and not much of a change, but maybe I'll give you a little a bit of thoughts on the implied growth as well. So, if you think about that guide that we just gave, it implies an organic growth rate range of 6.6% to 7.9% for the back half of the year, and that's the same implied growth rate that we had in the guide last quarter for the final three quarters. So, in other words, that implied guide hasn't really changed. And so, we -- again, as Todd said, we had a nice quarter and the outlook for the second half of the year really hasn't changed all that much, still a really good year both in total growth and in organic growth.
Tim Mulrooney: Okay. That's good color. It sounds like just some fine-tuning around the edges and continuation of what you've been doing. So that's very helpful context. Thank you. For my second question is, I just wanted to touch on the incremental EBITDA margins, 60%, I think, in the quarter, obviously, very impressive, well above Street expectations. Just putting my analyst head on and trying to pick this apart a little bit, curious, if there's any one offs or discrete factors that we should be considering that we're either favorable to this year or unfavorable to last year that might help explain some of the strong outperformance because 60% is obviously just really, really high? Thank you.
Todd Schneider: Well, Tim, no one-offs to speak of. We're getting good leverage from our revenue growth. So, the revenue growth is really helping us to get leverage. We've spoken in the past about, we've got programs initiatives to extract out inefficiencies in our business, and that continues to go well. Our Six Sigma Black Belt team, our global supply chain, our engineering teams are all functioning at high levels and allowing us to extract out improvements throughout our organization. So, no one-offs to speak of, and we're trying to get great leverage on the revenue and then extract out inefficiencies and that plan is working.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Andrew Steinerman from JPMorgan Securities. Please go ahead, Andrew.
Andrew Steinerman: When talking about the organic revenue growth of 7.1% in the quarter, could you just give us a sense if price realization has kind of now returned to the long-term average increase? And then also, did ad stop change much when looking at the November quarter year-over-year versus the August quarter year-over-year?
Todd Schneider: Good morning, Andrew. Obtaining price increases is more challenging than it was in the past, compared to earlier portion of the calendar year and the first quarter, but we're still able to obtain price increases. They are right at about our historical levels now, which makes sense, since we continue to see price increases coming down as inflation has come down. And in spite of this, I'm really proud of the organization being able to increase margins, while extracting out those inefficiencies I spoke about earlier. And as was mentioned with Tim previously, our incremental margins are really strong. As far as -- why don't I just speak a little bit about customer behavior in general? I mentioned price increases. New business is quite strong. Our retention rates are still at very attractive levels. Ad stops, I would say no significant changes there. Catalog spending was down a little bit. But overall, the business is functioning at a high level, and the macro data seems to be pretty stable. And the second half guide, I think, reflects that, we're going to have a -- we plan to have a very good year, and not only the first half, but the second half reflects that.
Operator: And our next question comes from Jasper Bibb from Truist Securities. Please go ahead, Jasper.
Jasper Bibb: Good morning, guys. I want to ask about the proposed tariffs from the new administration and potential impact on your material costs, if those proposals come through. I think you previously talked about a bit of inflation on hangar costs from tariffs on China during the last Trump administration. Is there more sourcing coming through Mexico, Canada, or China that could potentially be impacted?
Todd Schneider: Good morning, Jasper. Certainly, we're watching all those items very closely with tariffs. It's still way too early to tell exactly what's going to occur there, but I know this. We have a world-class global supply chain, and they're positioned to pivot as necessary. We're already in a position, where we dual source over 90% of our products. So, those multiple sources include also geographic diversity. So, I think we're in a good spot to -- because when those types of challenges that we may face in the future or the world will face, our global supply chain will have a chance to shine. And I'm confident that, that's exactly what they'll do and we'll pivot as appropriate, but we're in a good spot.
Mike Hansen: Jasper, I might, just as a reminder speak to our rental material cost. So, in the rental business you might keep in mind that, we amortize the costs of our garments, our mats and other products over some period of time. And that allows us time to have our global supply chain adapt to the current situation, maybe make some changes, but also it allows us to recognize those costs over a longer period of time. In other words, we don't recognize that cost in our P&L right away, and that allows us to do other things like not just sourcing changes, but also how to think about our initiatives that we've got going on in the business, and how to think of future price increases and so on. So, just as a reminder, our ability to amortize a good chunk of our materials can really be a benefit in a time when uncertainty like this related to these tariffs.
Jasper Bibb: Thanks for that. And then maybe to follow up on Tim's earlier question, is there anything you think might make incremental operating margins moderate in the second half versus the first half? I mean, on my math, adjusting for working days, incremental operating margin was well north of 40% in the first half, and it seems like guidance imply a pretty material step down in increment for the second half. Is there anything specific driving that first half, second half split?
Todd Schneider: Nothing specific, Jasper. Certainly, running a business isn't linear. But when you look at our guide for the year, we think we're in a really good spot to grow our operating margin, our EPS, so attractive margins for the year, and we think we're in a good spot to deliver that.
Mike Hansen: You might remember Jasper that our -- we want to be in an incremental of 25% to 35%. And while we are above that in the first half of the year, our expectation is longer-term, we're going to be sort of in that range and that's what we have guided for the back half of the year. We will likely be closer to that range. It's hard to think that we would be in a 40% to 50% incremental longer-term. But as Todd said, we've got a lot of initiatives that are really working for us.
Operator: And our next question comes from Manav Patnaik from Barclays. Please go ahead, Manav.
Manav Patnaik: Yes. Thank you. If I can just follow-up on that, the top line guide that you lowered by 40 basis points. It sounds like all you said all your expectations have kind of remained the same, but you still lowered it. So just curious is that -- can you just help us with why you lowered it by 40 bps? Maybe the catalog sales that were down, is that what it was? Just any color there would be helpful.
Mike Hansen: Manav, it's a little bit of math, right? The implied guide is about the same today as it was -- for the second half of the year as it was after the first quarter. But we've got another quarter in the books. Our Q2 at 7.1% comes right in the middle of that range. And so, that's really -- it's that's the math of seeing it go from 8.1% to 7.7%, but the implication of that guide for the rest of the year is still the same as what we called out after our first quarter. Does that make sense?
Manav Patnaik: I mean, I guess, are you saying that, maybe this quarter perhaps then come in better than maybe what you would have thought?
Mike Hansen: Well, it’s -- this quarter is sort of in the middle of that organic revenue guide that we've given.
Manav Patnaik: Okay, fine. And then if I can just follow-up, sorry, go ahead if you were saying something.
Mike Hansen: No, go ahead.
Manav Patnaik: I was just going to say the M&A in the quarter, just it seems -- like you were pretty active. So just curious in which areas and anything to call out there?
Todd Schneider: Manav, I'll speak to that. Good morning. M&A is hard to predict. We've been pursuing businesses in all of our route-based businesses, as long as I can remember, and we did have a good quarter with M&A. We bought some businesses in each of our areas. And those, we get some -- we're after really good quality businesses that can position us to obtain synergies in certain cases and then help us with an offering, a broader offering to that customer base. So, yes, we like the businesses we're buying. They're very complementary, and they're quality businesses, and we think that's going to be a good long-term investment for our organization.
Operator: And our next question comes from Josh Chan from UBS. Please go ahead, Josh.
Josh Chan: Hi, good morning, Tom, Mike, Jared. I guess, on the guidance question, maybe I can ask it this way. I guess, as compared to the scenario where you would have held your top-line guidance, the top end of your top-line guidance, like what did not happen, I guess? What did you not see to allow you to kind of hold that? I guess maybe that helps to ask that question a little bit.
Todd Schneider: Well, Josh, as I described earlier, the pricing environment is -- obtaining price increases is more challenging than it was. And as that we're still able to obtain price increases, but it's more challenging. It's back to historical levels. So, we're having to grow off of over and above that. So, just tightening that up a little bit. But, when you look at -- as Mike spoke of, when you look at the back half of the year, organic of -- implied organic of 6.6% to 7.9% and workday adjusted growth of 7.3% to 8.6%. It's right where we want to be, and we like that, and we think we're well positioned to achieve those results.
Josh Chan: Certainly, that's still very good growth. And then maybe my follow-up on fire, obviously it grew 10% this quarter that's really strong. But I guess in prior quarters it had been above that. So, was there any abnormality in fire this quarter or do you think it's just normal fluctuation?
Todd Schneider: Yes. Josh, no abnormality, to speak of. They were coming off a pretty attractive growth rate last year. But no, we think we're really well-positioned there to continue to grow that business, at the levels, at double-digits levels. And the team has organized around that and positioned it, and that's what we certainly expect in the future.
Josh Chan: Great. Thanks for your time and good luck in the second half.
Operator: And our next question comes from George Tong from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead, George.
George Tong: Hi, thanks. Good morning. You mentioned new business and retention rates were strong in the quarter. Can you talk more about what you're seeing with customer sentiment and customer purchasing behaviors and how they've evolved over the course of the quarter?
Todd Schneider: Good morning, George. Besides what I mentioned with customer behavior, not much has changed there. The sales cycle, it's not elongated. It's pretty similar to what it has been in the past. We're still selling about two-thirds of all of our new accounts are no programmers, and that's exciting to us, because the pie is massive out there, because as we've talked about, we serviced a little over a million business customers, and there are 16 million businesses in North America. So, that makes it really attractive. Now, that being said, those businesses that we're selling, it's not always new money. They're wearing clothes, garments. They've got items to help keep their facilities clean and maintained. We can do it better, faster, smarter, cheaper in certain ways, certain times that allows for those customers to accomplish their objectives more in a better fashion. So, no changes there. We're still selling a significant amount of no programmers, and the future looks bright there because there's just such a massive quantity out there of no programmers.
Operator: George, do you have a follow-up question?
George Tong: Yes. Sorry, I was on mute. So, on the margin side, you're seeing good benefits from sourcing and supply chain and routing. Can you talk a little bit more about where you are in your journey in terms of unlocking additional efficiencies from what you've already achieved? In other words, are you -- would you say you're still in the very early innings of what you hope to achieve with efficiencies or are you towards the middle or towards the later stages of what you hope to accomplish?
Todd Schneider: Thank you, George. Part of our culture here is a culture of positive discontent. We are constantly looking for ways to improve. And so, you're going to continue to see improvements in those areas. There's a long list of initiatives that we are constantly focused on and we're excited about, because and the team has done one heck of a job in that area, whether I mentioned sourcing, engineering, Six Sigma. It's been an impressive performance, and they still have a big to-do list.
Operator: And our next question comes from Shlomo Rosenbaum from Stifel. Please go ahead, Shlomo.
Shlomo Rosenbaum: Hi. Thank you for taking my questions. Just to talk a little bit about the guidance a little more on the top end. But I'd like to ask a little bit about the M&A, it looks like you did about $145 million in acquisitions in the quarter. Could you talk about how much those acquisitions are expected to add to revenue in this fiscal year? And if there -- where exactly would they be falling out mostly? Would it be mostly in the laundry and in the uniforms, or was there something else that you made that was sizable excuse me, that didn't hit the news? And then, I'll have a follow-up.
Mike Hansen: Shlomo, we did make some nice acquisitions in the rental space. We've also made some in the Fire and First Aid and Safety space. But the rental space, we did have some nice acquisitions. We don't typically get into exactly the amount of those. They are sort of local market to maybe a little bit of regional, but really nice players in the market and we're excited about it.
Shlomo Rosenbaum: Okay. The reason I was asking is because there's a huge focus on kind of that tweaking of the guidance on the top end. The commentary about the pricing being a little bit tougher, just to dimensionalize it would be helpful to know how much we should be expecting in terms of incremental M&A. So that's where that question is coming from. But the second question, the follow-up I have, could you give a little bit more color on the growth of the targeted verticals? Specifically in the quarter, did some do better than others? Maybe just give us a little bit more detail in terms of how much of the growth is being driven by those verticals, some of them accelerating versus decelerating, just so we get a sense, as to how the efforts are progressing there?
Todd Schneider: Shlomo, our four focused verticals are performing well. They have been and continue to perform well. They perform at above our normal operating levels of growth and we expect them too, because they're focused verticals. And I think it's important to understand, it's not just a sales focus in those areas. We organize around those. We have teams of leaders and partners that are focused on understanding those businesses, understanding products and services that are important to them. And so, they're in that world, and they're delivering great results and helping customers accomplish their objectives better and we expect that to continue. But that's been baked into our business for the past few years, and we suspect that that will continue to occur.
Operator: And our next question comes from Ashish Sabadra from RBC. Please go ahead, Ashish.
David Paige: Hi, good morning. This is David Paige on for Ashish. I was just curious, if we could -- if you could just give us some sense on how the Uniform Direct sales performed in the quarter? Was it in line with your expectations? And then not to go back to it, but how is that playing Uniform Direct specifically playing into your organic revenue growth guide for 2025? Thank you.
Todd Schneider: Good morning, David. Our Uniform Direct Sale business, as we mentioned, was down in the quarter. It's a strategic business for us that sells into Fortune 1000-type customers, airlines, hotels, casinos, those types. So, that business can be quite lumpy, and it was negative in the quarter. But keep in mind, we sell many things into that customer base. It's not just direct sale. So, it's been a strategic area for us to sell, whether it's rental garments or facility services. Our Fire and our First Aid businesses all sell into those. So, it's a real strategic market for us. And again, that business can be a little lumpy, and it certainly went backwards in Q2. But we like that market, and we like the solutions that we're providing those customers.
David Paige: Okay, great. That's helpful. And then, I know you mentioned that, your focus verticals are continuing to perform really strong, but was there any specific vertical either within the focus or outside of the focus verticals that performed I guess that stood out of the quarter or performed really well? Thank you.
Todd Schneider: David, nothing specific to call out regarding the four verticals. They're all performing well, and we've been investing to make sure that, we're positioning them for the future to get the right products, the right services for those customers. And it's showing in their results, and we expect that, that will continue.
Operator: And our next question comes from Andrew Wittmann from R.W. Baird. Please go ahead, Andrew.
Andrew Wittmann: Yes, thanks. Good morning, guys. I just thought maybe, Mike, I'd give you an opportunity to talk a little bit more about the margin profile here today. Obviously, results were good. But could you just talk about any categories in particular? Obviously, you called out the energy, always call it the energy, but maybe other key categories, merchandise costs, maybe route costs in general beyond just the energy there. Other things in the plant or things in SG&A. Just help to understand some of the puts and takes on that line item with gross margins now having been consistently above people's expectations now for several quarters in a row, I thought maybe opportunity to drill into that a little bit more would be helpful.
Mike Hansen: Sure. And as you know within our and I'll speak to rentals. As you know in our cost of rentals there are -- you can think of three buckets right the material cost, the production cost which is the cost associated with our operating our laundry facilities and the service costs. So, that's the routing. And the really good news, Andy, is we've got initiatives that are working really well in each of those. And so, over the last year, couple of years, we've seen improvements in all of those areas. So, material cost, Todd talks about our global supply chain. It has operated so well for us and continues to do so, and is constantly looking for better ways to source. In addition to that, you've heard us speak to a garment sharing. So, this goes to the stockroom and when we share garments, that means, we have better utilization out of those garments and we order fewer garments, new garments from our distribution centers. In other words, that is allowing us to put fewer garments into service, meaning our amortization tends to come down. That's been a really good area for us over the course of the last year or two years. If we move to production, we've talked a lot about operational excellence and things like making sure we are perfectly loading the washers and dryers has been really important for us. We are automating our sortation. As you know, once those garments come out of the dryer, we have to sort them to get them back to the customer, and we've got initiatives going on, that are automating that sorting and that allows for efficiencies in the production department. So, the wash alley has become more efficient, the sorting has become more efficient and that helps overall production costs. And then, you continue to hear us speak to a SmartTruck. It's just a new way of life for us, but it continues to allow us to leverage the service costs and the that bucket. And so, when we are able to be better at routing, that means fewer trucks need to be purchased, fewer routes being opened and we are just more efficient. Todd always talks about we don't make money when the truck is moving and effectively the truck is not moving as much as it has been in the past. So, really nice performance there. The other thing that SmartTruck allows us to do is save on energy because we can do things like monitor idling, and our idling is down and that means we are more efficient with our energy spend. So, Andy, those are a few of the components of those different buckets that are operating really well. And as you hopefully can pick up, those aren't sort of one-timers that go away. Those are all sort of new ways or more efficient ways of doing business.
Andrew Wittmann: Got it. Thank you for that context. Maybe just for my follow-up, I'd say over the last 18 months, it kind of feels like there's been more national account business that's kind of hit the market and its traded hands. Obviously, there's always some of that and it's not new, but because there was a bit more of a flurry around that, I would just thought -- I would kind of talk to you about getting your thoughts about a national account business today. How much is trading compared to historical levels and what you're seeing in the pricing dynamics specifically related to that segment of the marketplace?
Todd Schneider: Andy, nothing specific there. It's always been a highly competitive market. Our business in general is highly competitive, and our team has done a great job with pursuing those, retaining those. And certainly, those wins are nice, but we're trying to build our business around selling, growing the pie of customers. We think that's really attractive, and there's a massive opportunity there. So, that's where we're focusing our business is, selling those node programmers, providing great value for them. And so often, when we get in there and we talk to the customers, they don't even realize Andy, nothing specific there. It's always been a highly competitive market. Our business, in general, is highly competitive. And our team has done a great job with pursuing those, retaining those. And certainly, those wins are nice, but we're trying to build our business around selling, growing the pie of customers. We think that's really attractive and there's a massive opportunity there. So, that's where we're focusing our businesses, selling those no programmers, providing great value for them. And so often, when we get in there and we talk to the customers, they don't even realize that what we provide and the fact that our average customer is relatively small. Many of our customers think that they're not big enough to have a service like what we provide. And so, it's -- our role is to get out there and talk to them about it and make them aware. And that's helping to grow our business, and we like where that's heading.
Operator: And our next question comes from Toni Kaplan from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead, Toni.
Toni Kaplan: I was hoping to go back to the direct sales business, and I'm less focused on the quarter because I think the comp was fairly tough. But just when you think about how fast that line of business should grow over time. How should we be thinking about that? And could you also give us an update on what percent of your customers are buying products or services across more than one segment?
Todd Schneider: So, Toni, as far as the direct sale business, we tend to grow our other businesses faster than that business. Now when you think of that group of customers, they're growing at, I'll call it, normalized levels. But the direct sale business specifically is not growing. It wouldn't -- we wouldn't expect it to grow at the levels of our business in total. So, as we look at it, we're -- we see many of those customers are very interested in those products, which gets us in the door, and then we can sell many other products and services to them. As far as any particular percentages, we see -- I don't think we've given out specific percentages of how many customers use what products and services. But we have -- we are still in the very early innings of cross-selling across our business. So, we're focused on doing that, but we're also focused on adding new customers whether they be up and down the street customers or more regional in nature. We think there's an amazing opportunity to sell more into our current customer base and even more amazing opportunity to bring additional customers on because we service a little over one million businesses, and there's 60 million businesses in North America. So great opportunity.
Toni Kaplan: Yes. Great. And then on first aid margins, they've really ramped up over the past few years. You mentioned the favorable mix and sourcing benefits in this quarter. I guess, should we expect those to be sustainable? How big were those benefits? And maybe just in general, like the margins were very good. And so, like how are you thinking about the right level of investment, how much -- should you be investing more, for example?
Todd Schneider: Great, Toni. Thank you. We love the first aid business. It's growing really attractively. As you mentioned, the margins are very good. And it's not linear. So, there's puts and takes in every quarter. But we suspect that these margins will be sustainable. And nothing specific to call out besides the fact that we're continuing to get very good efficiencies from our dedicated distribution center in first aid. The mix of business is very attractive in what we're selling. It's repeat revenue. And we are investing heavily. And I think you're seeing that in the growth rates that we've experienced and expect to continue experiencing in that business. So really good business, and we're investing to grow it at very attractive levels.
Operator: And our next question comes from Faiza Alwy from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead, Faiza.
Faiza Alwy: So, I wanted to ask a little bit more about the pricing comments that you made. And I'm curious if you're seeing more difficulty in taking pricing across the board, or is it more specific products, categories, verticals, maybe to Andy's question earlier is that around some of the national accounts. Just more color on -- is this -- and perhaps if you can help us dimensionalize the deceleration in pricing that you've seen and what you expect from here?
Todd Schneider: Faiza, as I mentioned, it's always been a very competitive environment that we've operated in. My entire career has been. And as far as price adjustments, it's pretty well. It's more of a general position that price increases are more challenging than they were several -- in the first quarter. And -- but nothing -- no real changes besides the fact that inflation has come down significantly. And with that, it's very reasonable to think that price increases will come down as well. So, we are facing that. But nevertheless, the team is doing one heck of a job and in growing the business in spite of that and finding efficiencies to grow margins in spite of that as well. So very bullish on the future and proud of what the team is accomplishing.
Faiza Alwy: Great. And then I wanted to ask about M&A. We've seen some increasing activity in M&A. And I'm curious what you're seeing in terms of valuation expectations and just the opportunities out there? What's the environment like?
Todd Schneider: Faiza, trying to predict M&A, it's challenging because it really depends upon if it's a local business, it takes, in many cases, some type of an event to occur where a family member decides to move on from the business that would trigger something like that. So, it's tough to predict it. I can say this, we're very active -- and we are most active in the best businesses because we want to buy really good businesses that can -- they have great customer bases, they are happy, have great employee partners that can come into our organization. And then the ability to extract out inefficiencies, whether it gave us some additional capacity that we can leverage or routing capacities. All those items are opportunities for us. So, trying to predict it's tough. But we do -- we're very active. We think it's a very strategic investment for us long term.
Operator: And our next question comes from Stephanie Moore from Jefferies. Please go ahead, Stephanie.
Harold Antor: This is Harold Antor on for Stephanie Moore. So, I just want to piggyback on one of the questions about the Company's freight cost. I know, in Costco's, you talked about some of the innovations you've done in the health care sector in terms of providing curtains and stuff. So, I just wanted to ask, what other innovations have you done in some of your other vertical across hospitality, state and local governments? And then I guess the follow-up on that would be, help us understand the incremental margins, how they've trended in these new innovative products and I guess, the increase in revenue that you have seen in those business from these innovations?
Todd Schneider: Harold, thanks for the question. I'll answer the first half. As I mentioned, we do organize around those verticals. The health care is the one that I think I'll speak to that whether it is microfiber mops that we -- our customers are using to keep patient rooms and common areas clean to help prevent the health care-acquired infections. So, that’s very important to them. Certainly, we have provided technology around dispensing of garments that has really helped our customers not just in the health care vertical, but all verticals where they can control the dispensing of inventory, which allows them to ensure that people have the garments when they need them, but also control any loss that occurs. So that's been important to our customers. in general, health care specific just because of when you think of health care, they tend to wear scrubs, which normally was a kind of a commodity item because they would put them on a shelf and then they would disappear through some type of -- wherever they would end up. So, that's been really valuable to our customers. And then lastly, you cited the privacy curtains. We learned of this issue with our customers, spending time with the customers and asking them where they need help. And this item continued to come up where they said it's a significant compliance problem for them. It certainly affects health care acquired infections. And those are two really strong buying motives for our customers. So, we came up with technology that allows for us to help them with that. They came up with a patented product that allows us to help them with that. And the customers are embracing it. They very much like it. They struggle to find labor to handle it, and we're able to help them with that solution. So, I think that's attractive and we'll continue to invest in the future for those customers.
Operator: And our next question comes from Scott Schneeberger from Oppenheimer. Please go ahead, Scott.
Scott Schneeberger: I want to follow up a few M&A questions in here. And guys, I understand there's limited color you'll share there. But this was, I think, the biggest quarter of M&A since all the way back to G&K fiscal '16. And you said it was across a few of the business lines you serve. But was it -- was there any one particularly large acquisition in one area? And I'm just curious kind of is it -- as a follow-up on this topic, what are you looking for in M&A right now? What type of I think the multiples? But -- just if you could talk about prevailing multiple, that would be great, what you're seeing out there? And what are you looking for? Are you looking to add technology? Are you building out vended laundry, on-premises laundry? Just curious, are there some areas you might be moving into?
Todd Schneider: Scott, thanks for the question. We're active across all of our route-based businesses and acquiring business. What are we interested in? We're interested in quality businesses, buying really good businesses with great customer base and great employee partners. Those are usually the businesses that have invested in making sure that they are positioned to take great care of customers and their employees. So those are the ones we're interested in. We don't get into multiples. But as far as the focus its quality businesses that are in the businesses that we're in is what we bought. And so, nothing out of the ordinary there, and it's across each of the route-based businesses. We think we're in a really good spot to do that. And then once we do it, we certainly are interested in extracting out synergies. We get, in certain cases, really good capacity. And then -- and what we always get is a customer base that we can sell more into and provide more value to those customers. So, our focus is on buying great businesses with great people and great customers. And when we do that, really good things happen.
Scott Schneeberger: Great. And just as a follow-up, I don't think we've discussed myCintas portal on in earnings call in a while. A progress report on that, and just curious, is that contributing at all? It could be -- it's been around for a few years now. Is that contributing at all yet to the impressive margins that we're seeing?
Todd Schneider: Yes. Thank you, Scott. myCintas has been important to our business, important to customers. It allows us to provide our customers an opportunity to manage their account, manage it on the time that they want to do it. We've always had the ability to -- we're going to see our customers for the most part, every single week. Certainly, they can call if they need anything. But that interaction in person on a weekly basis is really, really valuable. But it doesn't mean that the customer wants to do business or all their business right then. They may not even be available at that point. So having an electronic portal that allows for them to manage their business, pay their bill. It's just another conduit that makes us easier to do business with for the customer and that's important to us. So, it allows for that. It allows for us to the customer pays their bill, there is no cash application. So, it's meaning that it goes right to the account. So, we don't have to apply it. So, there's efficiencies there if they're managing their account and they're not calling in, there's efficiencies there, right? So -- but it just allows the customer another conduit, and many of them really, really like that conduit and which allows for them to be happier and us to get efficiencies and a better relationship with the customer.
Operator: And our question comes from Jason Haas from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead, Jason.
Jason Bibb: I'm curious if you could help quantify where we are in terms of the price increases relative to history? Are we still like close to 3%, and we're sort of on a path back to 2%? Or how would you describe it? And then, are there certain verticals or industries where you find it a little bit easier to maintain those prices?
Todd Schneider: Jason, thanks for the question. Yes, as I mentioned, historically, we're in the 0% to 2% price increase range. We've been above that, with inflation being well above that, certainly, well below those peaks of inflation. And as a result, our price increases are now back into that historical range. And it's tough to predict what inflation looks like moving forward. We watch what the Fed is trying to figure out. And -- but we're watching that very closely, and we will manage it appropriately moving forward.
Jason Bibb: Got it. That's very helpful. And I guess I'll talk to this. So, are there any verticals that it's easier to maintain those prices? Or is it all sort of -- is it all reverted back to that historical 0% to 2% range? And then I also wanted to just follow up on the incremental margins because those were really strong in the first half. And I know you said that we're -- the expectation is we'll get back to more sort of normal targeted levels for the second half, I was just curious like what the drivers of that would be? So, what changes from the first half to the second half that causes those incremental margins to come down?
Todd Schneider: Jason, so as far as any verticals, is it able to -- are we able to obtain better price increases in any one particular? I wouldn't say so. It's probably pretty darn reflective of the market in general. So as far as incrementals in the back half of the year, yes, we had -- as I mentioned, it's not linear. So -- and we had some really good incrementals in the first half. But we like that 25% to 35% range, and that's what we're guiding towards, and that's what we're organizing around as well. So, with that, I think you should be thinking about.
Mike Hansen: Yes. Sometimes it's tough comps relative to last year. We had a really good second half of the year margin. And as Todd said, sometimes it's just timing of investments. It is not going to be a straight line for sure.
Operator: And at this time, there are no further questions. I'd like to turn the call back over to Jared for closing remarks.
Jared Mattingley: Thank you for joining us this morning. We will issue our third quarter of fiscal '25 financial results in March. We look forward to speaking with you again at that time. Thank you.
Operator: This now concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2025 Q1  (2024-09-25 10:00:00) =====
Jared Mattingley: Thank you, Ross. Thank you for joining us. With me today are Todd Schneider, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Mike Hansen, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We'll discuss our fiscal '25 first quarter results. After our commentary, we will open the call to questions from analysts. The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a safe harbor from civil litigation for forward-looking statements. This conference call contains forward-looking statements that reflect the company's current views as to future events and financial performance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those we may discuss. I refer you to the discussion on these points contained in our most recent filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. I will now turn the call over to Todd.
Todd Schneider: Thank you, Jared. We are pleased with our start to fiscal year 2025. Our first quarter results reflect the strength and breadth of Cintas’s value proposition for businesses of all types and stellar execution by our employee partners. First quarter total revenue grew 6.8% to $2.5 billion, an all-time high for revenue in a quarter. First quarter revenue growth was negatively impacted by one last workday in the first quarter of fiscal 2025, compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2024. On a same-day work basis, first quarter revenue growth was 8.4%. The organic growth rate, which adjust for the impacts of acquisitions, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, and the fact that there was one less workday in the quarter was 8.0%. Each of Cintas’s business divisions contributed to our success in the quarter. As Mike will detail, our rental division was right where we like them to be, and our first aid and safety and fire protection businesses each generated double-digit year-over-year growth, demonstrating the complementary nature of our platform and our long runway for future growth. The value of the products and services Cintas delivers continues to resonate with customers of all sizes and across industries. We remain focused on the tremendous opportunity we have to serve 16 million businesses across North America. In the first quarter, we continue to experience strong demand for our services not only from existing customers, but across our new business pipeline. Businesses across our four focused verticals of healthcare, hospitality, education, and state and local government continue to perform well. Our top line results flow through to our bottom line. Gross margin for the first quarter increased 9.7% over the prior year to a record 50.1%. Operating income of 22.4% as a percent of revenue was also an all-time record, an increase of 12.1% over the prior year. Diluted EPS, which reflects the recent 4-for-1 stock split, grew a robust 18.3% to $1.10. Our earnings growth continues to reflect our relentless focus on operational excellence in every aspect of our business, including strategic sourcing, the supply chain initiatives that drive down our material cost, route and energy optimization with SmartTruck, and leveraging our SAP system to maximize the efficiency of our facilities. Cash flow was very strong in the first quarter with free cash flow increasing 62.4% over the prior year. Our cash generation enabled us to deploy capital across each of our capital allocation priorities. We continue to focus our strategic investments in our customers and our employee partners. This strategy is reflected in our capital allocation priorities that continue to position us to deliver long-term value for our shareholders. In the first quarter, we continued to invest in our businesses through capital expenditure of $92.9 million and made acquisitions in each of our three route-based segments. Our technology investments are a significant area of re-investment. We are making great strides to implement better technology driven solutions to standardize our processes across our operations. These investments have enabled us to provide more flexibility to our customers, including increased garment sharing and achieving more nimble and efficient product sourcing. Coupled with our ongoing partnerships with Verizon, Google, and SAP, we're able to make our employee partners jobs easier and get the right products to our customers faster. We are seeing these efforts continue to improve customer experience and possibly impact our margin profile. In addition to making the investments in our business to fuel future growth, returning capital to Cintas shareholders through our dividend and share repurchase remains a key priority. Cintas increases quarterly dividend by 15.6% per share, which resulted in an aggregate quarterly cash dividend payment of $157.9 million on September 3. This marked the 41st consecutive year that we increased our dividend, meaning we have maintained this practice every year since going public. We also purchased $473.6 million worth of common stock during the quarter. Before turning the call over to Mike to provide details of our first quarter results, I'll provide our updated financial expectations for fiscal year, which reflect the momentum we carried through the first quarter and the exceptional dedication of our employee partners in helping our customers meet image, safety, cleanliness, and compliance needs. We are increasing our financial guidance range for fiscal 2025. We are raising our annual revenue expectations from a range of $10.16 billion to $10.31 billion to a range of $10.22 billion to $10.32 billion, a total growth rate of 6.5% to 7.5%. We expect our organic growth rate to be in the range of 7.0% to 8.1%. We are also raising our annual diluted EPS expectations from a range of $4.06 to $4.19 to a range of $4.17 to $4.25, a growth rate of 10.0% to 12.1%. The future of Cintas remains bright, and I look forward to the year ahead. With that, I'll turn the call over to Mike to discuss the details of our first quarter results.
Mike Hansen: Thanks, Todd, and good morning. Our fiscal 2025 first quarter revenue was $2.5 billion, compared to $2.34 billion last year. The organic revenue growth rate adjusted for acquisitions, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, and a difference in the number of workdays was 8%. Total growth was negatively impacted by 160 basis points due to one fewer workday in the first quarter, compared to the prior year period. As a reminder, we have two fewer workdays in fiscal 2025, compared to fiscal 2024. One impacted our first quarter and the second will impact our fourth quarter. Each of our fiscal 2025 quarters has 65-days. Organic growth by business was 7% for uniform rental and facility services, 14% for first aid and safety services, 13.8% for fire protection services, and uniform direct sale was down 1.8%. Gross margin for the first quarter of fiscal ‘25 was $1.25 billion, compared to $1.14 billion last year, an increase of 9.7%. As Todd mentioned, gross margin as a percent of revenue reached a milestone 50.1% for the first quarter of fiscal ’25, compared to 48.7% last year, an increase of 140 basis points. Robust volume growth continues to generate strong operating leverage. Our gross margins also increased as a result of our world-class supply chain, investments we have made in technology, and continued operational efficiencies. Gross margin percentage by business was 49.3% for uniform rental and facility services, 57.7% for first aid and safety services, 50.2% for fire protection services, and 40.6% for uniform direct sale. Gross margin for the uniform rental and facility services segment increased 120 basis points from last year. We continue to generate leverage as a result of our strong revenue growth. Great performance from our supply chain is lowering our product costs. We continue to realize benefits from our technology investments and we are extracting inefficiencies from the business through our Six Sigma and engineering teams. Gross margin for the first aid and safety services segment increased 180 basis points from last year. As with our rental business, strong revenue growth continues to create leverage. Our sales mix continues to be favorable with more profitable first aid products and increases in our recurring revenue products like AEDs, eyewash stations, and water brick. Our technology investment in SmartTruck continues to provide route optimization and improved efficiencies, and we continue to see sourcing benefits from our first aid dedicated distribution center that we opened several years ago that has allowed us to lower product costs. All of these contribute to improved margins. Selling administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue was 27.6%, which was a 20 basis point increase from last year. We continue to make strategic investments in technology and in our partners. First quarter operating income was $561 million, compared to $500.6 million last year. Operating income as a percentage of revenue was 22.4% in the first quarter of fiscal ’25, compared to 21.4% in last year's first quarter, an increase of 100 basis points. Our effective tax rate for the first quarter was 15.8%, compared to 19.2% last year. The tax rate in both quarters were impacted by certain discrete items, primarily the tax accounting impact for stock-based compensation. Net income for the first quarter was $452 million, compared to $385.1 million last year. This year's first quarter diluted EPS of $1.10, compared to $0.93 last year, an increase of 18.3%. As Todd mentioned earlier, we generated strong cash flow. Our first quarter free cash flow increased 62.4%, this has allowed us to invest back in the business, which has resulted in first quarter capital expenditures of $92.9 million. Our investments include technology to grow the top line and expand margins, automation to improve efficiencies in our plants, and additional processing capacity where needed. We expect capital expenditures to finish between 3.5% and 4% of revenue for the year. Todd provided our annual financial guidance. Related to the guidance, please note the following: fiscal ‘25 net interest expense is expected to be approximately $101 million, compared to $95 million in fiscal ‘24, predominantly as a result of higher variable rate debt used to complete a portion of the previously mentioned share buybacks. Our fiscal ‘25 effective tax rate is expected to be 20.4%, the same compared to our fiscal ‘24. And guidance does not include any future share buybacks or significant economic disruptions or downturns. With that, I'll turn it back to Todd for some closing remarks.
Todd Schneider: Thank you, Mike. Before we conclude, I'd like to take a moment to thank our employee partners for their continued efforts on behalf of Cintas and our customers in the first quarter. As I've said before, our culture is our greatest competitive advantage. Our partners fuel our success, and we believe deeply in the importance of each employee partner having ownership in the company to share collectively in that success. As Cintas shares reach record highs in the spring, our board of directors approved a 4-for-1 split of our common stock, which went into effect before the market opened on September 12. We're proud to enhance the accessibility of Cintas’s shares for all of our investors especially for our employee partners, so they can continue to share in the future growth of Cintas. As we look ahead to the rest of fiscal ‘25, our outlook reflects our continued confidence in our strategy and value proposition of helping our customers achieve their image, safety, cleanliness, and compliance needs. We remain focused on delivering outstanding customer experiences and making the necessary investments in the business to sustain our growth for the remainder of fiscal ‘25 and beyond. I'll now turn the call back over to Jared.
Jared Mattingley: That concludes our prepared remarks. We are now happy to answer questions from the analysts. Please ask just one question and a single follow-up if needed. Thank you.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from George Tong from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead, George.
George Tong: Hi, thanks. Good morning. Can you talk a little bit about the overall selling environment and whether you're seeing any changes in customer purchasing behaviors in response to the overall macro environment and evolving macro uncertainty?
Todd Schneider: Good morning, George. Thanks for the question. We have not seen much change in the customer behavior. It's just 60-days ago that we reported our full fiscal year ‘24 earnings. But we haven't seen much change. We still see nice demand from our customers. We're helping them with their image, their safety, their cleanliness, and their compliance needs. And that frees them up to focus on what's most important for them, taking care of their guests, their people, their patients, whatever their constituents are. So not much change, I would say, in the sales cycle or in the demand of the customer.
George Tong: Got it. That's helpful. And you continue to highlight healthcare, hospitality, education, and government as key focus verticals for the company. Can you talk a little bit more about traction you're seeing in those verticals and how growth and performance there compare versus the broader company?
Todd Schneider: Yes, certainly. So those, we believe we've chosen those verticals very well. We've invested in them. We run them not like just a sales vertical, but we look at them as how do we take care of those customers holistically. And I thought I would just give an example of that, but all this starts with our culture. We have a spirit of positive discontent is what we call it at Cintas, which is meaning, we're constantly focused on improving and innovating. And we also believe that the answers are not at our desk, meaning we believe the answer is out with our customers and our employee partners. So we travel and we get out and we talk to our customers about where we can help them. And I have two examples where we're helping customers in the healthcare area that came exactly from those conversations. The first was, and we've spoken a little bit about this with garment dispensing. We're continuing to have a very good success with this technology. And our healthcare customers, what they told us was they had a problem managing their inventory, in this case of scrubs, as they didn't have accountability with the scrubs. So when you don't have accountability, there's hoarding of garments that occurs, which leads to a lack of availability, meaning the first person who gets there takes garments and then those who show up later don't get the garments. And as a result, our -- the healthcare customers, for the most part, invested in what I'll call substandard product, because they wanted, well, when they didn't have control over the inventory, they went as cheap as possible. So, and this technology addresses those issues. And today, it's being used in many clinical areas, you know, labor and delivery, emergency room, operating rooms, radiology, cath labs, ICU are some examples of where we're doing that. We found the exact same opportunity, meaning when we spoke to our customers, we asked them, what else can we help you with? And they said, we are having a heck of a problem with privacy curtains. And what they told us is it was one of their top compliance issues. And those privacy curtains, when you think about those, they're in patient rooms, recovery areas, emergency rooms, and acute care, but they're also in non-acute throughout in surgery centers and medical centers. And they have to be cleaned. They have to be cleaned on a frequent basis. And so it's a real compliance challenge for our customers. So we listened to them and we didn't just take over the problem, we studied it and came up with some great products and technology. Those products have some patents on them as well and the technology allows us to track compliance. So it makes for, in total, it makes for a safer environment, a more compliant environment, and it frees up the environmental services at those organizations, who are cleaning patient rooms and other areas where clinicians provide care. So a safer, cleaner, more compliant, and more efficient environment. So I thought that might help just to give a little bit of color around what we're doing in that particular vertical, but it really starts with our culture and we listen to our customers, where can we help, and then we dive in and we provide those solutions.
George Tong: Very helpful, thank you.
Todd Schneider: Thank you.
Operator: And our next question comes from Tim Mulrooney from William Blair. Please go ahead, Tim.
Luke McFadden: Hi, this is Luke McFadden on for Tim Mulrooney. Thanks for taking our questions today. I might have missed it in your prepared remarks, but could you provide the breakdown in new sales between market share wins and conversion of no programmers for the quarter?
Todd Schneider: Yes, good morning. We did not cite it specifically, but no change to that trend. On average, we're historically about two out of three of our new customers come from what we call the no program market. The no program market would meaning that they're not with a traditional competitor. Now that doesn't mean that they're not using products and services, meaning we might go in and they need help with, they might own a mat, they might have soaps, they might buy uniforms, but they're not with a traditional competitor. So they may be spending money on these products, but we redirect them to ourselves to help them do it better, faster, smarter, cheaper in many cases.
Luke McFadden: Understood, really helpful. And then kind of just sticking on that topic with my follow-up, it sounds like that no programmer penetration continues to be an area of strength in the business. I was hoping you could offer maybe some insights into the typical profile of these recent no programmer conversions? Are the majority of these recent wins of a particular business size or concentrated in any specific in market? Or is it relatively broad-based?
Todd Schneider: Well that's the beauty of our business. We service a little over a 1 million customers and there's 16 million businesses in North America, U.S. and Canada. And so the wins come from all industries, all shape sizes of businesses. And that's why we're so bullish on the future, because we see that opportunity, that white space out there, as a significant opportunity to help customers, and we're still in, obviously, the very much early innings there.
Luke McFadden: Understood. Thanks so much.
Todd Schneider: Thank you.
Operator: And our next question comes from Andrew Steinerman from JPMorgan. Please go ahead, Andrew.
Andrew Steinerman: Hi, this is Andrew. Could you talk about merchandise amortization in the quarter? Year-over-year, how much is merchandise amortization a headwind or tailwind? And what have you assumed for the fiscal year in terms of trends in merchandise amortization?
Mike Hansen: Good morning Andrew. The material cost has been an area of strength for us in and I'll say the rental business, but also the others, but I'll stick to the rental business for a second. Material cost has been trending nicely and, you know, we work hard at that material cost. So within there, you can think about our global supply chain and finding better ways to source better cost of product. And so they've done a really great job there, despite the really good business volume growth that we've had. And the other thing that we really worked hard at, as you know, Andrew, is in our stock rooms and the sharing of garments. And so we -- the more we share in terms of our garments, the more pull percentage we get out of the stock rooms. And that means we are injecting fewer garments into service. And so the combination of those things have created some nice tailwind and you see that showing up in our gross margin. We would expect that will continue through the fiscal year.
Andrew Steinerman: Thanks, Mike.
Operator: And our next question comes from Jasper Bibb, Truist Securities. Please go ahead, Jasper.
Jasper Bibb: Hey, good morning guys. I wanted to ask about SmartTruck and the Google partnership. I think you announced that a little over a year ago now. There's a cloud migration a few quarters ago. I'm just kind of hoping you can update us on how that's progressed and where you might be seeing some associated margin or efficiency benefits at this stage?
Todd Schneider: Yes, Jasper, thank you for the question. SmartTruck is -- as a reminder, is proprietary technology that we work to develop. It's been very helpful for our business, but more specifically, it's helpful for our customers, because we're able to, instead of spending time driving, we're able to spend more time with our customers. So, and when we're there with our customers, it gives us the opportunity with eyes and ears and minds in those business to solve problems for them. Whether it's something else in their business like I mentioned with -- in healthcare with garment dispensing and scrubs and privacy curtains. So more time with the customer is really valuable for us. Separate from the fact that we like to say around here, we don't make any money when the wheels are moving. We only make money, I mean, generate revenue when the wheels stop on our trucks. So that's been valuable. Our relationship with Google has been very advantageous. And as important as our relationship with Google is Google's relationship with SAP. So having that all combined gives us insight into our business, helps us to leverage our infrastructure and leverage our employee partners to put them in the right spot, the right place, the right time. So we believe that, that is going to be beneficial into the future and we really value those relationships.
Jasper Bibb: Thanks, and then maybe following up on that last point, sounds like pretty good growth in fire in the quarter. Any color on or underlying operating margin for that business was in the first quarter? And it would also be great to hear how some of the initiatives you're doing there like the SAP implementation and some of the G&A investments you've called out in the past are where those stands today?
Todd Schneider: Yes, good question. So we love the fire business. It is growing really nicely. The organic opportunity is amazing. The M&A opportunity is really attractive for us. And yes we're investing in that business, we’re investing in our SAP system, and we're excited about that. Excited about having all of our route-based systems on one system. We think that'll really give us some insights into our customers that we don't have today. But the opportunity out there for fire is incredible just, because it's every business, the only business we're in, that every business legally has to have it, the services around it, whether it's sprinklers, alarms, in certain cases fire extinguishers, emergency lights. So we think the runway is really attractive in that business. We like the margin profile, we know how to run the business, we know the mix of business that's attractive. And as a result, not every M&A opportunity that comes down the pike is really attractive for us, but we know how to do it, and we will be aggressive as appropriate.
Mike Hansen: Maybe I'll offer two things with that as well. You heard me say in the prepared remarks, this was the second quarter in a row that gross margin in the fire business was 50%. And so that is a reflection of a lot of the things that Todd talked about in terms of really going well and running the business well. We are in the midst of that SAP implementation that we've talked about and I think back in July I mentioned that there would be a little bit of pressure on fire margins in fiscal ’25, because of that implementation. And so you see a little bit of that coming through fire SG&A and if you look at the all other operating margin, we're down a bit from Q4 to Q1 and it's a bit of that reflection of the SAP implementation. As you've seen in our first aid and safety and rental businesses, that SAP implementation, it certainly takes some time, but there are some really nice benefits subsequent to getting that system in and running it and learning how to run it. But as we talked about, fiscal ‘25 may show a little bit of pressure in SG&A and the fire business. Certainly that is all incorporated into the guide, the overall guide that we've given.
Jasper Bibb: Great. Thanks for the detail there.
Operator: And our next question comes from Manav Patnaik from Barclays. Please go ahead, Manav.
Ronan Kennedy: Hi, good morning. This is Ronan Kennedy on for Manav. Thank you for taking my question. The strong growth in [Technical Difficulty] margin expansion, you said it was sourcing, supply chain, tech, operating efficiencies, an element of favorable mix, I think 20 bps from energy. Can I please confirm whether there's any one-time factors in there or is it the more sustainable drivers? And do you see upside to the margin expansion opportunities?
Todd Schneider: Ronan, thanks for the question. No one-timers to call out. As far as where we can go with this, you know, we're focused on extracting out inefficiencies in our business and there's more to come. So we don't like to put a ceiling on our aspirations there, but, you know, we see opportunity in our business to extract that in efficiencies and so we will continue to do that. I think from an operating margin standpoint we've talked about 25% to 35% incrementals and I think our guide reflects in that range.
Ronan Kennedy: Got it, thank you. And then may I please, could I ask for your current competitive dynamics within the industry and whether recent activity within the industry changes the way we think about capital allocation?
Todd Schneider: Ronan, you're speaking of M&A, is that correct? Or if you'd like to clarify.
Ronan Kennedy: Yes, please. And broader [Technical Difficulty] dynamic and potential implications of potential M&A and your thought process for the allocation.
Todd Schneider: Great. Great. Well, M&A is an important component of our business, has been and will be. We are -- it's worked very well for our business, for our customers, our shareholders throughout. And we certainly stay aware of what's going on in the marketplace. And we like our competitive position. We think we're in a good spot. We will continue to invest to make sure that we're appropriately positioned to compete in the marketplace moving forward. So that's where our focus is, and that's what we'll continue to do.
Ronan Kennedy: Thank you, appreciate it.
Operator: And our next question comes from Josh Chan from UBS. Please go ahead, Josh.
Josh Chan: Hi, good morning, Todd, Mike and Jared. Thanks for taking my questions. On the rental business, could you confirm that you haven't seen much change in wearer levels? And kind of relatedly, if you were to see wearer levels start to moderate the economy. Could you talk about the Cintas playbook and that scenario and what you can do to sustain the attractive growth that you're used to seeing? Thank you.
Todd Schneider: Josh, thanks for the question. I'll start, Mike, feel free to chime in. You know, we certainly love when jobs are being added. We haven't seen real change in our wearer levels. But that being said, you know, our business, we've demonstrated that we can grow our business in multiples of GDP and multiples of employment growth. So we are certainly not reliant on that. That being said, I love when jobs are being added. I think it's good for our economy, and it's good for our customers, and it's good for our business. So -- but we're not reliant on that. We've also demonstrated that we can grow our business in virtually every type of economic cycle that we've seen. So we're focused on doing just exactly that, investing for the future to position our employee partners to take incredibly good care of our customers. And we'll continue to invest in that, so that we can be positioned to be really successful for the future.
Josh Chan: Great, thank you for that color. And on your guidance, was the growth in Q1 better than your internal expectation? I guess I'm asking in the context of you raising the full-year guidance expectancy at the low end. I just wanted the color on your thoughts around that? Thanks so much for your time.
Mike Hansen: Sure. Well, I'll say this. The growth, we saw some nice growth in the first quarter. And generally, it lines up with where we like to be. It was at the high-end of our guide, but as we now have a quarter in the books, it’s a little -- we can feel a little bit more confident to bring up the low-end of the guide. If you think about that guide range, it's a same-workday growth range of 7.3% to 8.4% for the year. And when you think about the implied guide range for the rest of the year, Q2 through Q4, we're not too far different from that. 6.9% to 8.3% on a same-workday basis. So look, this 8% growth that we saw in the first quarter, organic growth is right where we want to be and the guide I think for the rest of the year is a reflection that look we have some confidence in the way we're operating we haven't seen a lot of change in the operating environment and the growth still looks good.
Josh Chan: Great, and I congratulate you on that strong quarter.
Todd Schneider: Thank you.
Operator: And our next question comes from Andy Wittmann from R.W. Baird. Please go ahead, Andy.
Andy Wittmann: Yes, great, thanks, And good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. You guys in the script, you talked about Six Sigma. You talked about your engineering teams, degree of automation. So I was just wondering if you could talk about the rollout of things like RFID inside your plants. I know that you've been kind of testing this for a while. And I think maybe that you're ramping this a little bit more. I thought maybe Todd, you could comment on that specifically, and kind of where you are? And if this is the direction we're heading? And how long does it take you to get to that promised land where this is the way that your business runs on a day-to-day basis? I guess maybe there would be a similar question related to the auto-sortation. I think in the past you guys have talked that you like auto sort of like half of your business roughly. I was just wondering if there's any new developments on that like cheaper technologies that make it so that you can deploy it more widely or I know that sometimes like space considerations in your plant have been a limiting factor. Any technologies that have been developed that allow you to broaden the rollout of your auto-sortation. So, just hoping you could talk about those two things in particular?
Todd Schneider: Certainly. Thank you, Andy. I think, let's go back to our culture. We have this, we call it a spirit of positive discontent. So, and part of that is we are constantly innovating. It's just -- it's in our DNA. It always has been since I've joined the company, and I'm sure it always will be. So we're always trying to find ways to make it easier for our partners to, our employee partners to provide services, products and services to our customers and easier for our customers to do business with us. So RFID, you mentioned, we've been using RFID for many years in our business in certain areas of that. And we're continuing to test and innovate. And hopefully there's a future where we can have that more broadly in our business. Whether it's controlling inventory is important to us, important to our customers, so we're always innovating in that area and that will continue. Similar with auto-sortation in our facilities, in our rental facilities. So we're innovating and we see opportunities there. We have invested in some proprietary technology there that allows us to more broadly leverage that -- those technologies to extract out inefficiencies in our business. So you're right, footprint can be an issue with certain technologies with auto-sortation. And we look at that and say, well, there's got to be a better way. And we've invested and we're bullish on that moving forward. Those things all take time. We're constantly tweaking to make sure we nail it. But we'll continue in that path.
Andy Wittmann: Appreciate those perspectives. I thought maybe I'd ask you about some innovation maybe that's relevant to the top-line financials of your business. You've talked so much about healthcare government education. It's been a well-trodden thing for a while now. But I know you guys are always trying to open up new end markets. And I thought maybe you could talk about some of the developing end markets that maybe you're getting more excited about. Things around residential home services, is that an opportunity for you and can you just talk about if you can play there and the size of that market in comparison to some of these other growth markets that you've talked about in the past?
Todd Schneider: Thanks for the question, Andy. So that's the spirit of positive discontent flows through every area of our business and we're always looking for the next best vertical. Not prepared to speak about anything where we see an investment in a particular vertical. Home residential services is not high on our list. It's not been an area of focus. It's a very different business. Certainly, they have needs for our products and services, but that has not been an area of significant investment for us.
Andy Wittmann: Thank you.
Todd Schneider: Thank you.
Operator: And our next question comes from Shlomo Rosenbaum from Stifel Nicolaus. Please go ahead, Shlomo.
Shlomo Rosenbaum: Hi, thank you. I want to get back to a question I think that George was touching on. I know there's broad-based growth, but were there particular types of clients or verticals that you might want to call out over here in terms of, you know, really standout growth during the quarter?
Todd Schneider: Shlomo, I would say that, you know, our business in totality is functioning at a very good level. So no particular vertical to call out besides, you know, the investments we've made in healthcare hospitality, education, and state and local governments. We've been investing there and will continue to. You know, if you look at how, you know, particularly the jobs reports there, they've been good in those areas. Not shocking that healthcare with the demographics of North America that there's continued investment there. But we still see really good runway in all those businesses and we expect them to grow better than we do on average. If they weren't then why would we have a focused vertical? So yes, so nothing specific to call out besides that what I just mentioned there.
Shlomo Rosenbaum: Okay thanks. And this is just a housekeeping item for Mike. Just the press release says you repurchased about 474 million in stock and I go to the cash flow statement, it looks like 615 million. Can you just talk about what the differences between what's on the cash flow statement and what's in the commentary?
Mike Hansen: Yes, the commentary reflects the board approved buyback authorization. The cash flow reflects that plus the impact of stock option exercises and restricted shares. So in other words, when we have employee partners that exercise a stock option. There are some shares that are effectively withheld or purchased for taxes for the exercise, the netting of shares, et cetera. For restricted shares that vest, same thing, we are withholding shares for taxes. That's the difference.
Shlomo Rosenbaum: Got it, thank you.
Operator: And our next question comes from Ashish Sabadra from RBC. Please go ahead Ashish.
Ashish Sabadra: Thanks for digging my question. I just wanted to follow-up on the margin front, really solid margin expansion in the quarter. The 38% incremental margins were above your, like, a midterm guidance of 25% to 35%, and that's despite one fewer working day headwind. So as we go through the year, obviously you've made out multiple different margin expansion drivers, but how should we think about the incremental margins for the rest of the year? Thanks.
Mike Hansen: Hi, Ashish. You know, we gave the 25% to 35% range, and that's where our target is. You know, the business isn't wholly linear, and so there are some periods where we invest a little bit more there are so we'll be a little bit lower in that range and there are some quarters where we'll be higher in the range. Generally speaking as we think about this year though we've got 65 work days in each of our quarters remaining and so there's a little bit of the variability, because of workdays that's not going to be there. But I expect that we'll run within that range, some quarters at the higher end, some at the lower end. That's the way we'll go through the -- as we move into the future. Todd talked about so many initiatives and Six Sigma projects and investments and these just sort of can move us through that range, sometimes even in and out of that range. Generally speaking though, our expectation is we will be in that range and that will be the really good news is that means margin improvement for the year.
Ashish Sabadra: That's great color. And maybe just a quick follow-up on M&A. Just wanted to follow-up on our earlier question on M&A. If you can talk about your M&A pipeline, and appetite for potentially a large M&A deal as well? Thanks.
Todd Schneider: Well, Ashish, thanks for the question. First off, again, M&A has been an important part of our strategy. And we've shown it can work really well for our business, for our customers, shareholders, all involved. And we're open to deals of various shapes and sizes across the entire platform. If you're speaking of what has been public with Vestas being courted by an international company, that acquisition in particular would pose particular challenges, because it's been historically under-invested asset. So it would make it hard for us to generate the level of value we expect from M&A in that particular one. In M&A in general, it's again, it's important to us and we think it's really attractive. It's hard to predict when sellers are ready to transact. And it takes two to dance in those categories. So -- but we're very much in that area of the business. We're very interested in M&A on a more general basis.
Ashish Sabadra: That's very helpful, color, and solid result. Thanks.
Operator: And our next question comes from Faiza Alwy from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead, Faiza.
Faiza Alwy: Yes, hi. Good morning, I wanted to talk about this first aid business, because we're seeing organic revenue growth acceleration in that business? And I'm curious if you can talk about your drivers there? And really what your expectation is for the long-term opportunity here? I don't know if you can talk about a potential scam or how we should think about the sustainability of, you know, teams type of [Technical Difficulty] business?
Todd Schneider: Faiza, thank you for your question. The first aid and safety business has been great. The buying motives resonate with our customer base. There's 16 million businesses in North America. Maybe not every single one of them is a great candidate, but a large portion are great candidates for our products and services that we provide. So, you know, to a certain degree the pandemic changed some things with regards to that business, meaning people, how they look at their health and wellness of their people and of their facilities. And we think that's been positive for our business. So providing, whether it's a first aid cabinet, AEDs for in the case of sudden cardiac arrest, our eyewash stations that are for health and wellness, and certainly our water break where it provides potable water for people that in various dimensions, that makes it accessible for them. So all those have been really attractive. So the mix of business is really good, but meaning back during the pandemic it was more probably PPE focused. So that mix of that business has changed, but the demand has been very attractive. So we've invested there, we've invested in technology, we've invested in salespeople, service partners to take great care of our customers. And I neglected to mention we have a really nice training in compliance business, which helps our customers stay in compliance with the various needs they have, whether it's forklift training, first aid, general first aid training, certainly CPR training, are all things that we think we can invest in more significantly and provide more value to the customers.
Faiza Alwy: And are you finding that there's revenue synergies with the uniform business? I know that you're running the businesses separately in terms of, you know, certainly there's different trucks and things like that? But I'm curious, like, what percentage of sort of new customers that you have in this first safety business or existing, you know, uniform customers? Or is it a whole new type of customer that you're attracting?
Todd Schneider: Faiza, a good question. I don't have that number specific for you, but I'll say this. We do run separate trucks to those customers. And we found that having that focus organized around that business specific has been really beneficial for us. But we share data. We share data within our customers and opportunities. And as I mentioned, we have this infrastructure of employee partners that are in those customers. And when they're visiting with those customers, they have eyes, they have ears, they have minds, and they can help provide solutions to those customers. So it's easy enough to say, hey, I noticed you might have a need for this, or they may ask us. So there's a mix. Some of it were -- the very first time we do business with a customer is through first aid. Sometimes it's through fire, sometimes it's through rental. Just the sheer scale of rental certainly makes it for a nice cross-selling opportunity, because, well we've been in that business the longest. It's our heritage business and it's our largest business. But so we really don't care where we get started with the customer, we just want to do business with them, and then we'll leverage that infrastructure, that data, to try to cross-sell as best as possible to provide additional solutions for those customers.
Faiza Alwy: Great, thank you so much.
Todd Schneider: Thank you.
Operator: And our next question comes from Stephanie Moore from Jefferies. Please go ahead, Stephanie.
Stephanie Moore: Hi, good morning, Thank you. I wanted to touch on maybe the competitive environment within your vendor market. If you're seeing anything in terms of stepped up competitive activity in the form of maybe aggressively going after existing customers, maybe a little bit challenging from a pricing standpoint? Any color there on the competitive activity would be great. Thanks.
Todd Schneider: Good morning, Stephanie. We operate in a really competitive environment, and it's been competitive since I started with a company in 1989. And I'm sure it will be competitive for the future. So one of the differences that is how we approach the business. We look at the no program market as an incredible opportunity. We service a little over 1 million customers or 16 million businesses. The white space out there is amazing. And we see that opportunity where they can buy today and we can help them today. So growing that pie is significant. That being said, yes, it's really competitive, always has been. I wouldn't say there's a real change in competitive behavior. We're focused on trying to invest in our business to make sure we provide the best solutions for our customers and position our people best to compete in the marketplace. And it's certainly very important to us.
Stephanie Moore: Great. And then just as a follow-up, you touched on this actually a couple questions ago, but clearly there's some kind of potential industry consolidation activity going on. You know, as you think about that, if you were to see your industry continue to consolidate, how do you think that would impact you? Thoughts on competitive activity in a more consolidated environment and the likes of that? Thanks.
Todd Schneider: Yes, good question. So we certainly pay attention to that. We never underestimate our competition, and we deal with competitors that are very good at what they do. So industry consolidation, would that have a dynamic impact? We don't think so. But we always have our head on a swivel and we're making sure that we are focused on investing in our business to best position our people to take care of our customers and to provide the best solutions for our customers. So that's where we're spending our time investing and focusing, but we pay very close attention to the competitive landscape.
Mike Hansen: Keeping in mind that we compete every day against what we might call non-traditional competitors. So those who are providing direct sale uniforms, Amazon, Walmart, we're competing against all different kinds of competition. So industry consolidation is not necessarily a bad thing for us. It will continue to be competitive.
Todd Schneider: Yes, I completely agree, Mike. As I mentioned, we walk into a business. They may not be with a competitor, but in many cases, they've got the products and services or something very similar as what we can provide. They're getting it from those non-traditional sources. We think we can do it better, faster, smarter, cheaper in many cases for the prospect or the customer. And that's where we've been successful in growing our business.
Stephanie Moore: And I guess just to take that one quick point, I mean, you basically said it's always been competitive. If you had a greater consolidation, do you think it would be even more, you know, with maybe another player that's new to North America, do you think they would end up being actually a more or less competitive environment?
Todd Schneider: Yes, it's hard to imagine it being even more competitive. It's really competitive today. But if any international competitor were to enter, we don't see the competitive dynamic changing. And again, our focus would remain on delivering great value our customers on a daily basis.
Stephanie Moore: All right. I asked too many questions thanks guys.
Todd Schneider: Thank you.
Operator: And our next question comes from Scott Schneeberger from Oppenheimer. Please go ahead Scott.
Scott Schneeberger: Thanks very much. I have two, I'll ask them both up front since we're getting late here. First one, uniform direct sales, the organic declines, they persisted for I think five quarters now. And I know this is a lumpy business and the years prior was very strong. But could you guys please elaborate on trend over the balance of the year? What we might see there to the extent you have visibility? And then the second question is free cash flow really strong in the first quarter. CapEx appears on pace. So it looks like the strength was something working capital driven. Could you discuss it? Was this a timing issue or should we anticipate a particularly strong cashier and fiscal ‘25? Thanks.
Todd Schneider: Scott, thanks for the question. I'll talk a little bit about the direct sale business and Mike if you'd like to respond regarding the cash flow. Scott, you nailed it. It's a lumpy business. Rollouts of national accounts, those types of national customers are highly impactful. And you also nailed it that they had incredible growth going back a couple years. So just really more timing, lumpiness, no real change in that business. We like where we're positioned and feel like we're in a good spot for the future.
Mike Hansen: Yes, regarding cash flow, you're right, Scott. Free cash flow was really strong. For us, some of that is timing. So for example, you see some real working capital change in accrued compensation related liabilities. That's a little bit more timing. From accounts payable, we got a nice benefit from accounts payable. We've been working hard in accounts payable to extend some terms, and that's paying off with a nice benefit in the cash flow. For the year, generally speaking though, we look at it to be in the typical range. So free cash flow conversion of net income in the 90% to 100% range, which is sort of typically where we have been. That's where we expect to be for the rest of the year or for the full-year in total.
Scott Schneeberger: Thanks, guys.
Todd Schneider: Thank you.
Operator: And our next question comes from Jason Haas from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead, Jason.
Jason Haas: Hey, good morning and thanks for taking my questions. I'm curious if you could remind us what level of price increases you're putting in this year? And then I'm curious what the reception has been like from your customers?
Todd Schneider: Jason, our price adjustments are a component of our growth, certainly not where we're focused in on how we grow our business, but it is a component. And our price adjustments are way lower than they were at the peak of inflation, and they're back much closer to historical today. And how they're received, you know, those are always challenging conversations. And we try to position our people on a daily basis to provide the best service so that they can go better, but it's always challenging. And it's been challenging my entire career on price adjustments. So we try to focus our time on how to best position our people, how to train them, and how to give them the best products and services so that they can provide the most value.
Jason Haas: Got it. That makes sense. Thank you. And it's a good segue to the next question. I was curious about the hiring market for your own business, and I'm curious if it's gotten any easier or harder to hire people?
Todd Schneider: Yes, Jason, good question. I call it similar, right? Similar meaning it's always been a challenge to find great people. And that's what we're focused on. The hiring market, it has eased, there's no doubt, from pandemic craziness. But it is certainly easier, but never easy. So That's what we're seeing in our business. We're still investing for the future. The reason we're investing is because we see the opportunities that lie ahead.
Jason Haas: Got it. That makes sense. Thank you.
Todd Schneider: Thank you.
Operator: And at this time, there are no further questions. I'll turn the call back over to Jared for closing remarks.
Jared Mattingley: Thank you, everyone, for joining us this morning. We will issue our second quarter of fiscal ‘25 financial results in December. We look forward to speaking with you again at that time.
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2024 Q4  (2024-07-18 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Cintas Corporation Announces Fiscal 2024 Fourth Quarter and Full Year Results. Today's call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the meeting over to Mr. Jared Mattingley, Vice President and Treasurer, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
Jared Mattingley: Thank you, Ross. Thank you for joining us. With me is Todd Schneider, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Mike Hansen, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We'll discuss our fiscal '24 fourth quarter and full year results. After our commentary, we will open the call to questions from analysts. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a safe harbor from civil litigation for forward-looking statements. This conference call contains forward-looking statements that reflect the Company's current views as to future events and financial performance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those we may discuss. I refer you to the discussion on these points contained in our most recent filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. I will now turn the call over to Todd.
Todd Schneider: Thank you, Jared. Our fourth quarter performance marked a strong finish to another successful year for Cintas. Fourth quarter total revenue grew 8.2% to $2.47 billion, an all-time high for revenue in a quarter. The organic growth rate, which adjusts for the impacts of acquisitions and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations was 7.5%. And importantly, each of our businesses continue to perform well and execute at a high level. Fourth quarter gross margin was $1.22 billion, an increase of 11.6% over the prior year. Gross margin increased 150 basis points from 47.7% to 49.2%. Operating income for the fourth quarter of $547.6 million increased 16.3% over the prior year. Operating margin increased 160 basis points to 22.2% from 20.6% in the prior year. Fourth quarter net income was $414.3 million, an increase of 19.7%. Earnings per diluted share for the fourth quarter were $3.99, an increase of 19.8% over the prior year fourth quarter. These results conclude a strong fiscal year marked by significant accomplishments, including robust revenue growth and margin expansion and excellent cash generation, which continue to fuel our balanced capital allocation strategy. The following are specific highlights of fiscal '24. I'd like to begin with revenue. Fiscal year revenue was a record $9.6 billion, an increase of 8.9%. Organic growth was 8% for the year. Our First Aid and Safety Services operating segment exceeded $1 billion in annual revenue for the first time. Our top line growth is a function of the total value proposition we offer customers of all sizes and across industries and unique Cintas culture that drives our partners to deliver an outstanding customer experience. Business across our focused verticals of health care, hospitality, education, and state and local government continue to perform well. We experienced strong demand for our services not only from existing customers but across our new business pipeline. About two-third of our new customers continue to come from no-programmers, underscoring our ability to capitalize on the vast growth opportunity that remains ahead. In addition, our retention rates remain strong. Our strong revenue performance also translated into continued growth in profits and earnings, including the following highlights. Fiscal '24 operating income grew 14.8% for the year, and our operating margin of 21.6% was an all-time high. EPS grew 16.6% for the year. Our enhanced profitability and earnings growth is a reflection of our relentless focus on operational excellence in every aspect of our business, spanning strategic sourcing and supply chain initiatives, route and energy optimization opportunities with SmartTruck, and leveraging the SAP system to support greater stockroom visibility and efficient garment sharing. Our cash flow from operating activities exceeded $2 billion for the first time. Strong cash generation provides us even greater flexibility to deploy capital across each of our capital allocation priorities throughout the year. Our number one capital allocation priority is investing back in the business. We prioritize investments in technology, infrastructure, and people to support our sustained growth and value creation over the long term. As we continue to grow and create value, capital is required to add capacity in a number of ways, including new facilities, new equipment, new vehicles as well as technologies to make our partners more successful. We spent $186.8 million in fiscal '24 on acquisitions. This is the most we've spent on acquisitions since fiscal '17. We love acquisitions as they provide us with new customers where we can offer a broader range of products and services. Sometimes they can bring needed capacity that can also bring attractive synergies that involve leveraging our existing route structures, providing more time with customers and less time driving. Another of our priorities is returning capital to our shareholders through dividends and share buybacks. In fiscal '24, we increased our quarterly per share dividend by 17.4%, marking the 40th consecutive year that we've increased our dividend, including every year since going public. We also bought back $1 billion of shares during fiscal '24 and up through yesterday. Lastly, we were named to the prestigious Fortune 500 for the eighth consecutive year. It is an honor to be recognized among the most successful and respected companies. We're proud of these results and the value we continue to deliver for the Cintas shareholders. That performance reflects the focus and great execution by our employees whom we call partners. I'll now turn the call over to Mike to provide details of our fourth quarter results.
Mike Hansen: Thanks, Todd, and good morning. Our fiscal '24 fourth quarter revenue was $2.47 billion compared to $2.28 billion last year. The organic revenue growth rate adjusted for acquisitions and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations was 7.5%. Gross margin for the fourth quarter of fiscal '24 was $1.22 billion compared to $1.09 billion last year, an increase of 11.6%. Gross margin as a percent of revenue was 49.2% for the fourth quarter of fiscal '24 compared to 47.7% last year, an increase of 150 basis points. Strong growth from new customers and the penetration of existing customers with more products and services helped generate great operating leverage, aided by the performance of our global supply chain and focused efforts to extract inefficiencies from the business via our Six Sigma engineering teams as well as technologies like SmartTruck. The Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segment revenue for the fourth quarter of fiscal '24 was $1.91 billion compared to $1.77 billion last year. The organic revenue growth rate was 7.1%. As we have done in the past, I will share revenue mix of the Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segment for the fourth quarter. Keep in mind, there can be small fluctuations in mix between quarters. Uniform rental was 48%; dust was 19%; hygiene was 16%; shop towels were 4%; linen, which includes microfiber, wipes, towels and aprons, was 10%; and catalog revenue was 3%. These percentages are consistent with last year and demonstrate we are experiencing strong demand across all our products and services. Gross margin for the Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segment was 48.6% compared to 47.7% last year. This 90 basis point improvement was the result of good top line growth that continue to generate great operating leverage and excellent sourcing and process improvements, which continue to create additional efficiencies such as garment sharing and SmartTruck. Our First Aid and Safety Services operating segment revenue for the fourth quarter was $277.6 million compared to $249.8 million last year. The organic revenue growth rate was 11.1%, capping off another year of double-digit organic growth. Gross margin for the First Aid and Safety Services operating segment was 55.4% compared to 51% last year. This 440 basis point improvement was a result of our double-digit revenue growth that created solid operating leverage, an improved sales mix, a dedicated first aid distribution center that has lowered costs as well as efficiencies from our SmartTruck technology. Our Fire Protection Services and Uniform Direct Sale businesses are reported in the All Other segment. All Other revenue was $282.1 million compared to $261.5 million last year. The Fire Protection revenue was $197.9 million, and the organic revenue growth rate was 12.9%, resulting in another year of double-digit organic growth. The Uniform Direct Sale revenue was $84.2 million, and organic revenue decreased 4.4%. The organic growth rate in Uniform Direct Sales can vary from quarter-to-quarter. Gross margin for Fire Protection Services was an all-time high of 50% compared to 47.9% last year. This 210 basis point improvement was primarily the result of robust revenue growth that generated strong operating leverage along with route productivity improvements. Gross margin for Uniform Direct Sales was 40.9% compared to 36% last year. This 490 basis point improvement was the result of higher margin accounts from a disciplined approach to the market. Fourth quarter selling and administrative expenses as a percent of revenue was 27%, which was a 10 basis point improvement from last year. We were able to create leverage with these costs while continuing to invest in technology and selling resources. Fourth quarter operating income was $547.6 million compared to $470.8 million last year. Operating income as a percentage of revenue was 22.2% in the fourth quarter of fiscal '24 compared to 20.6% in last year's fourth quarter. The fourth quarter marks the first time that all three operating segments, Uniform Rental and Facility Services, First Aid and Safety Services, and Fire Protection Services exceeded 22% in operating income in the same quarter. Our effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 21.4% compared to 22.4% last year. Net income for the fourth quarter was $414.3 million compared to $346.2 million last year. This year's fourth quarter diluted EPS was $3.99 compared to $3.33 last year, an increase of 19.8%. I'll now turn the call back over to Todd to provide his thoughts on next year and our financial expectations for fiscal '25.
Todd Schneider: Thank you, Mike. As we move into fiscal '25, we expect to exceed $10 billion in annual revenue for the first time. This outlook, coupled with our strong fiscal '24 results, demonstrate that our value proposition continues to resonate. Every business in North America, goods-producing or services-providing, has a need for image, safety, cleanliness, and compliance. We help our customers meet those needs so they can focus on running their businesses. As we deliver on our customers' needs, our culture remains our greatest competitive advantage, and it drives our focus on continuous improvement and evolving for the future. We will continue to prioritize investments in technology, infrastructure, and people. Our technology investments include our continued investment in SAP with our Fire division currently going through the implementation process. In addition to SAP, we have partnered with Verizon and Google to deploy technology solutions that make it easier for our partners to run their business and easier for our customers to do business with us. In addition, technology initiatives such as SmartTruck and garment sharing are helping to drive customer satisfaction as well as efficiencies throughout the organization. Our working partners really are the key to our success. We know that when we take care of our partners, they will, in turn, take great care of our customers. We are investing in training our partners and giving them the best and latest tools to make their jobs easier while also investing in talent acquisition in order to ensure we are properly staffed to support our growth initiatives. The future of Cintas remains bright, and our fiscal '25 guidance reflects that outlook. For fiscal '25, we expect our revenue to be in the range of $10.16 billion to $10.31 billion, a total growth rate of 5.9% to 7.4%. Please note the following: fiscal '25 will have two fewer workdays compared to fiscal '24. Each quarter of fiscal '25 will have 65 workdays. The two fewer workdays will impact the first and fourth quarters by one day each. The revenue growth rate in each of those two quarters will be negatively affected by about 160 basis points. Please keep that in mind when modeling. Adjusting for the impact of two fewer workdays, acquisitions already completed and at constant currency, our total organic growth rate for next year is expected to be 6.4% to 8%. We expect diluted EPS to be in the range of $16.25 to $16.75, a growth rate of 7.3% to 10.6%. Fiscal '25 net interest expense is expected to be approximately $106 million compared to $95 million in fiscal '24, predominantly as a result of higher variable rate debt used to complete a portion of the previously mentioned share buybacks. Our fiscal '25 effective tax rate is expected to be 20.4%, the same compared to our fiscal '24. Guidance does not include any future share buybacks or significant economic disruptions or downturns. I want to end by thanking our partners for their tremendous efforts to achieve a successful fiscal '24. As we look ahead to fiscal '25, our outlook reflects our continued confidence in our strategy. We remain focused on delivering outstanding customer experiences, reinforcing the unique Cintas culture that drives our success while making the necessary investments in the business to sustain our growth through fiscal '25 and long beyond. I'll now turn the call back over to Jared.
Jared Mattingley: That concludes our prepared remarks. Now we are happy to answer questions from the analysts. Please ask just one question and a single follow-up if needed. Thank you.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Joshua Chan from UBS. Please go ahead, Joshua.
Joshua Chan: Congrats on a strong quarter. I was wondering if you guys could comment on your retention rates. I know that you've said it's generally stable. Have you seen any slight uptick in industry churn or downtick in retention, I guess? How are you seeing your customers behave in this environment?
Todd Schneider: Thanks for your comments. We really haven't seen a change in our customer behavior. As I mentioned, our retention rates are still at very attractive levels. And when you have as broad of a customer base as we do, there are certainly some aspects that are doing -- that are thriving and some that are struggling. It varies based upon industry. It varies based upon geography. But when you speak as a whole, I would say our customer base is -- we haven't seen much change in it so far.
Joshua Chan: That's great to hear. And then for my follow-up, could you just kind of talk about your reasoning behind choosing the 6.4% to 8.0% organic growth for next year? I guess in the context of just doing 7.5% in Q4, what are the scenarios that would lead you to the bottom and the top end of the growth range?
Todd Schneider: Well, Josh, we really like where we -- our guide is. We like where our business is. And that's where we -- that's kind of where we target our business to grow at those types of levels. Certainly, we read the overall macro data that we -- that you all read about what's going on in the economy. So, we watch that. But we don't expect much change at this point. And as a result, I'd say we expect to be right in that guide. We'd love for the economy to go even faster. But nevertheless, we find ways to be successful. Our value proposition is resonating. We have -- we service a little over 1 million customers or 16 million businesses in our market, and we have all kinds of ways to grow. And I think we've shown that we have the ability to exceed GDP growth and exceed employment growth. So, we would certainly love for our customers to be thriving and adding people all over the place. But nevertheless, we're going to find a way to be successful and we're confident in our guide.
Operator: And our next question comes from Heather Balsky from Bank of America. Please go ahead, Heather.
Heather Balsky: Can you just kind of update us on how you're thinking about incremental margins and how you're thinking about the margin story for 2025? What are the bigger tailwinds? What are you most excited about? And anything going on in the cost environment as well?
Todd Schneider: Well, I'll start, Heather. As we think about margin expansion, and our guide reflects margin expansion with the first item we think about as it comes to that is leverage, leverage on revenue growth. And we've demonstrated that we have the ability to do that, and we'll continue to do that. And that's easy to say, hard to do, but the team has done an incredible job in so many areas, starting with our global supply chain, which is a competitive advantage in the marketplace. How they go about their jobs, the fact that they have dual source or many sources for 90% or more of the products that we source, so how they go about that. The great work that's been done on material costs, again, starting with sourcing. But also, we leverage our SAP system to help us to improve our garment sharing. And we've been working on this for years and it's bearing fruit not only in our cost structure but also in turnaround time for our customers. So, it helps us to get product to our customers faster when it's in our stockrooms versus having to order new out of our distribution centers. Better for our customers, better for our financials, and that's paying off for us.
Operator: And our next question comes from Andy Wittmann from R.W. Baird. Please go ahead, Andy.
Andy Wittmann: I just thought I would start with the competitive environment. Both of your largest competitors have noted increased competition out there. And I know that your product and service offering is a little bit broader. But I thought just given those competitor comments, I would take your temperature and have you comment, if you could, please, on what you're seeing out there in the competitive environment.
Todd Schneider: Andy, here's what I'll tell you is that we operate in a highly competitive market. Always have, always will. I'm sure. I've been with the Company for 35 years. It's been competitive every day since I've been here. Now that being said, our revenue retention rates, as I mentioned, are attractive. And part of it is because our new business wins tend to come from the no-program market and less from the competition. So, as I mentioned earlier, there's 16 million businesses out there. We service about 1 million. So, the white space out there is incredible. And we're focused on converting those folks from, I'll call it, a do-it-yourself type to a customer of ours. And that value proposition is resonating because we help them focus on taking care of their customers or their patients or their guests or whatever, however you want to describe it, and we take that for them. And we're able to do it better, faster, smarter and, in many cases, cheaper than what they were doing it. So yes, is it competitive? Heck yes. It's always been competitive and we're focused on growing the market and that's been a good model for us.
Andy Wittmann: I appreciate that. And then I guess, maybe Mike, I guess I wanted to kind of ask some of the margin questions in a little bit different way. First, as I was just kind of doing the math between the EPS and the revenue, I was getting somewhere around 20 or 30 basis points of implied operating margin expansion for the year. So maybe you could just clarify that. But that's a pretty decent deceleration from the amount of margin expansion certainly you saw in the quarter or even over the course of the past fiscal year. So, I was just wondering if you could comment on if there's anything, any categories inside the P&L that we should be aware of that are inflating more materially, or if there's other areas, maybe energy costs, I don't know, that we should be aware of that could be weighing on continued margin expansion like we've seen here in recent quarters.
Mike Hansen: Andy, the short answer to are there any new headwinds, the short answer is no, with the exception of maybe the two fewer workdays where as you've heard us talk about, for example, in the first quarter, we talked a little bit about the top line impact being 160 basis points of growth headwind. But also, you've also heard us talk about margins. When we lose a workday, we've generally talked about a 50 basis point impact. We lose two workdays next year. We've done such a good job of leveraging our infrastructure that the loss of a workday in a quarter is probably more like 30 to 40 basis points now. But we lose two workdays, and so there'll be a little bit of headwind from that. That is just sort of a product of the calendar and not necessarily the business. Having said that, the business is still operating really well. And if you think about the -- we think about the guidance range is generally in the, you can call it, the 25% to 35% incremental margin range. And so, it is a pretty good margin range of the 30 basis points that you referred to, Andy. We would kind of say, look at the very bottom. There still is margin expansion at the very bottom of our range. At the top of the range, there's more than 30 basis points, probably more like 70 basis points. So, the year, we think this is a typical guide range for us. As you saw in our fourth quarter, the initiatives and the operational excellence that we have worked so hard on have continued in the fourth quarter. And given this guide, we expect those to continue into fiscal '25.
Operator: And our next question comes from George Tong from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead, George.
George Tong: Can you talk a bit about the progress you're making with penetrating your high-growth focused verticals, including health care, hospitality, education, and government? Where are you seeing particularly good traction?
Todd Schneider: Yes, we really like the verticals that we've chosen. And as a reminder, it's not just a sales strategy. It is also how we organize around those customers, those industries, those verticals to make sure that we're meeting, exceeding their needs because they're a little different. And as we do that, the products, the services that we provide, the support that we provide all comes along with that. And so yes, they're all operating at attractive levels. And I wouldn't call anyone out specifically where I'd say, oh my gosh, that one's exceeding. They're all doing quite well. I thought it might be helpful to talk a little bit about a recent health care win that we had. We recently sold a large hospital network with scrub dispensing technology for the scrubs in the various departments throughout an acute care hospital. But we're also having really good success with surgery centers and those types that are attached to the large acute care hospital networks. And you're probably seeing some of that acute care hospital networks having investments in other areas. So, in fact, I'd say three large health care systems came to us for help with their non-acute facilities. When I say non-acute facilities, I'm talking about really surgery centers, clinics, physician offices, those types. And they came to us and said, "You're doing a great job for acute care. Can you help us with the non-acute?" And what does that do for them? It allows them to have a consistent supply but also allows them to consolidate vendors. So, we're seeing good success certainly in health care. But the other verticals are all performing well. And we like the decisions, the investments that we've made in those areas, and we think they're going to continue to pay dividends for us.
Operator: And our next question comes from Tim Mulrooney from William Blair. Please go ahead, Tim.
Tim Mulrooney: Just one from me, and I hopped on late so apologies if this has been addressed, but a few of your competitors have recently cited more pricing pushback and an increasing number of customers putting their contracts out to bid. I'm wondering on this pricing idea if you're seeing a similar dynamic where customers are becoming more price sensitive in this environment. Or do you think that this is less of an issue for the industry overall and could perhaps be more specific to these individual companies or markets?
Todd Schneider: So, I'd say nothing to call out specifically there. It's still really a normal operating environment. As I mentioned earlier, we operate in a highly competitive market. So, we've got to make sure that we're -- our value proposition is resonating with our customers and we're providing outstanding customer service. We've said that our plan is to lower pricing back towards historical levels and that's what we're seeing. And I would just point out that as we've moderated pricing, even in fiscal '24, we were able to expand operating margins 120 basis points. And so, we're finding ways to provide great value for our customers while moderating pricing but still extracting inefficiencies out of our business so that we can improve operating margins.
Tim Mulrooney: Okay, so not really seeing pushback on pricing. And Todd, would you say it certainly is not lost on us that you had strong incrementals this quarter as pricing moderated. Would you say now pricing has fully normalized? That there is no more headwinds as we head into 2025 from moderating pricing? Or is that -- are you still in that process?
Todd Schneider: Tim, we've -- as I mentioned, it's a highly competitive market. We have continued to moderate pricing. And pricing is a local subject. It really depends upon the customers, what their operating environment's like, what their customer base is doing, those types. So, we continue to monitor that and manage it appropriately based upon our local businesses and making sure that we're meeting our customers' needs and thinking about the long-term value of a customer because we don't look at it and say, we're focused on the near term or in the short term. We're focused on the long term for our customers, and we'll continue to manage pricing in that manner.
Mike Hansen: And I might just add, Tim, to your question, probably not a lot of fiscal '25 to fiscal '24 year-over-year pricing change.
Operator: And our next question comes from Andrew Steinerman from JPMorgan. Please go ahead, Andrew.
Andrew Steinerman: If you could believe it, I'm just going to ask you to clarify something you just said. So, you talked about moderating pricing. When I hear the words moderating pricing, I hear price decreases. I assume what you mean is you're moderating to a more normal type of modest price increase. And then when talking about fiscal '25, are you talking about modest price increases or really flat pricing year-over-year for existing customers?
Todd Schneider: Just to clarify, moderating pricing is the way you characterized it, which is we are passing through modest price increases based upon our agreement and relationship with that customer. And that varies based upon customers, geographies, industries, et cetera. But yes, the way you described it is appropriate. It's a modest price increase with customers in general.
Andrew Steinerman: That's true for the fiscal '25, too, right?
Todd Schneider: That would be correct.
Andrew Steinerman: Good clarification.
Operator: And our next question comes from Jasper Bibb from Truist Securities. Please go ahead, Bibb.
Jasper Bibb: Was hoping you could give a bit more color on what you're seeing as far as net headcount at customers or their hiring posture and any expectations there embedded in your fiscal '25 organic growth guidance.
Todd Schneider: Yes, it really varies. As I mentioned, we have such a broad customer base in geographies but really not much change in customer behavior when it comes to hiring. We're seeing a pretty -- the environment is, I'll call it, stable and hasn't really changed much in the past few quarters.
Jasper Bibb: Got it. Last one for me. Maybe asking an earlier question a little bit differently. With this whole dynamic of peers talking about increased churn, including at some of the larger national accounts, if you're not seeing a pricing or retention hit, are you potentially taking away some of this competitor business at a higher rate, given these market dynamics?
Todd Schneider: Well, here's the way I'd describe it is we operate in a really competitive environment. And so, we're out there trying to do the best to take care of our customers fighting for business every day. And I wouldn't characterize it as really much of a change in the environment. It's always really competitive. And we're continuing to try to position our organization with the best products, the best services, the best technology so that they can be successful in the marketplace.
Operator: And our next question comes from Manav Patnaik from Barclays. Please go ahead, Manav.
Manav Patnaik: I just had one question. Earlier, you talked about how you've been the most active in M&A for many years now. So just curious if you could just talk a little bit more about why now and perhaps what the pipeline in each of your segments looks like for future M&A?
Todd Schneider: As you know, M&A, it's tough to predict. We think about it long term and make sure that we have relationships so that when someone does decide that they want to transact, that we're well positioned. So, it's really tough to predict deal flow. But again, we think about long term, and we want to be -- we find M&A really attractive and in large part because of, as I mentioned earlier, it gives us a new set of customers that we can offer a wider breadth of products and services that we offer. There can be highly attractive synergies. In many cases, we get some infrastructure that is important to us. And we always get great people and we learn from those. So yes, we're highly interested in M&A of all shapes and sizes and we're active in those markets. Tough to pace it. It takes two to dance. And we just want to make sure we're at the dance and ready.
Operator: And our next question comes from Scott Schneeberger from Oppenheimer. Please go ahead, Scott.
Scott Schneeberger: The first one is just you've been speaking over the course of the year about investing in your selling capabilities, technology, management training. Just an update there. And also, you've been alluding a lot to myCintas portal. Any quantification you can put on that about penetration or anything else about how that's progressing?
Todd Schneider: It's tough to put a number on that. It's kind of like, how do you put a value on the culture of Cintas? We're constantly reinvesting in those technologies, in those trainings to position our people to be more successful. We talk about making it easier for them to do their jobs and make it easier for our customers to do business with us. So those are all investments that are long-term thinking, long-term investments that positions our people to be successful in the marketplace. Some of those investments pay off faster but it's a continual investment. And when we think about those investments, it is -- we have an amazing team of partners that are out every day taking great care of the customers. We want to make it easier for them. And we want to make it -- give them data that allows them to provide more value to the customers, make it less laborious for them to do their jobs and allow customers the ability to self-serve and have many conduits to do business with Cintas and also communicate with Cintas. So, all those investments are ongoing and will be, frankly, probably ongoing in perpetuity because that's the nature of business now that technology plays a key role. And we're blessed to have a balance sheet where we can invest appropriately and position our team to be really successful.
Scott Schneeberger: And the follow-up is, I just figured fiscal year-end and all-time high in the fourth quarter on the operating margin. So, kind of a conceptual longer-term question. You guys have done great since implementing the ERP and reaping benefits from it. What can you get to for peak margins? I mean, you've talked about incremental margins, 25%, 35% range. Can you get to 25% promptly? Can you get to 30% longer term? Just some consideration on what aspirational targets would be reasonable.
Mike Hansen: Scott, I would say this, we don't like to put a ceiling on our aspirations, but we certainly think that we can continue to improve margins. And so maybe a couple of points. First of all, 25% to 35% incremental operating margins, we've got locations that are operating at the 30-plus level today. And so, we -- and that's in all of our businesses. And so, there is a pathway there and we are continuing to work on it. Sometimes it's better scale and density. Sometimes it's a little bit of product mix. Sometimes it's the newness of the location. But we have those examples, and we're continuing to get all of our locations closer and closer to those highest operating locations. And that incremental operating margin range of 25% to 35%, in our minds, tells us, certainly, we can work -- continue to work to get there. As you go back to the -- you've talked a little bit about technology. I would say that we're still in the early innings of technology. We've become much, much better at operating on the SAP system. And it's only been about four years since we've been -- since our rental business has been fully on and Fire is not on yet. And so, we have been getting better and better at using that system. But as you know, as we've talked about over the course of the last year or so, there are still a lot of things that can come with our Google and Verizon and SAP partnerships that we are just touching the surface on. And we think that can be a big driver of continued margin expansion into the future. Not ready to put a date on when we can hit 25% or 30%, but we certainly have that in our sights and we'll continue to work hard to get there.
Operator: And our next question comes from Shlomo Rosenbaum from Stifel Nicolaus. Please go ahead, Shlomo.
Adam Parrington: This is Adam on for Shlomo. Could you just maybe provide a little bit of outlook for Uniform Direct Sales and Fire Protection businesses for '25? And how much of a margin impact should there be in the Fire business from the SAP implementation you alluded to last quarter?
Mike Hansen: From a Fire Protection business perspective, we're still in the implementation phase of that. And there's going to be a little bit of pressure on there. I'm not going to give a specific guidance in terms of their margin. But there'll be some pressure as we go through, keeping in mind when we go through an implementation, there is the work of the implementation, the work of training all of our people to use it, the inefficiencies that come along with that, and we will then get better and better. And fiscal '25 is going to be a little bit of a year of that training and implementation period. And so, I would say that's going to be a little bit of pressure on the margins there. Certainly, that's incorporated within our overall guide of margin improvement. From a Uniform Direct Sale perspective, our margins have been really good. We've been working on selling the right types of programs, and our Uniform Direct Sale partners are doing a great job in that area. But having said all of that, a little bit hard to tell based on that SAP implementation in Fire, but keeping in mind that's included with our overall guide.
Operator: And our next question comes from Ashish Sabadra from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead, Ashish.
Ashish Sabadra: Maybe just a question on the guidance philosophy because when we think about the organic growth in the quarter, still continues to be pretty robust compared to the industry growth profile at 7.5%, but it has moderated over the last eight quarters. The higher end of the guidance implies -- the 8% organic growth implies an inflection in growth. And historically, you've always set your guide where you have beaten and raised to guidance throughout the year. So, as we think about where do we really see the inflection? And in terms of guidance philosophy, when you say, is it equally conservative as we have seen in the prior years?
Mike Hansen: Well, I'll say maybe this, Ashish. We had an 8% organic growth rate year this year, and that was a really good year in a year where, again, last year, we were at about 12.2% and 10% the previous year. And these were years where there was just heavy inflation. And as you know, our pricing was a little bit higher than norm. And we got the 8% this year in sort of that bringing the price increases back to something closer to historical levels. As we think about our guide, maybe I'll throw out a couple of numbers to you. And as Todd has been mentioning, we've had a -- we've not seen a lot of change in customer behavior. And we've had some really good performance in our full fiscal '24 year but I'll point out a couple. In our third quarter, if you adjust for the workdays, our total growth was 8.2%. In the fourth quarter, our total growth was 8.2%. In our guide, when you think about just simply the workday, our guide range is 6.7% to 8.3%. So, our guide range is effectively telling you we're seeing the business operate in much of the same manner as we saw in the second half of the year. If you look at the organic numbers in those -- in the third quarter, fourth quarter and next year, same story. And so, the philosophy is a little bit of, look, we have to build a bit of a range because we have to consider certain alternatives. But effectively, the guide range for fiscal '25 on the top line is right in line with what you've seen particularly in the second half of fiscal '24. And that is really nice growth in all of our businesses, certainly in Uniform Rental, First Aid and Safety, and Fire Protection. So hopefully, that helps a little bit, Ashish.
Ashish Sabadra: Yes. No, that's very helpful color.
Operator: And our next question comes from Faiza Alwy from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead, Faiza.
Faiza Alwy: So, you mentioned earlier in the call about the white space opportunity and just the traction you're getting with no-programmers. I think relative to historical levels, the contribution from no-programmers to growth has been higher. So, I'm curious if you can talk about what you're doing differently. Are you maybe using technology? Has the pit changed a little bit? Is there something about the underlying environment? So just curious on what's driving sort of incremental contribution from no-programmers.
Todd Schneider: I'll start, and Mike, if you'd like to contribute. Faiza, good morning, and for several decades now, we have had a focus on trying to grow the pie of the business, and that white space is significant. So, we teach our organization about how to attract no-programmers. And it's a little different process. And it takes -- it's more of a conceptual sell versus something, I'll call it, more about -- well, you've got to coach them and teach them about how to do something different instead of simply doing it yourself. And again, that's a conceptual sell and we teach our folks on how to do that. And we happen to be blessed with being in a spot where there is a massive white space out there. And I'll say it's a harder concept to get across to people. But we've been doing it for so long that it's just part of how our organization operates. And we think that's exciting for us. No real obvious change I would point to. It's just part of our culture. It's part of how we teach and train our partners on how to approach that. And it resonates with people because they get the concept of outsourcing. They get the concept of, yes, maybe I am struggling to keep up with all this. And you can do it, you can do it better, faster, smarter, cheaper than I can. And that's been a key fundamental of how we've grown our business over the years and how we'll continue to grow our business into the future.
Mike Hansen: Faiza, maybe I'll offer this a bit. If you think about the health care vertical that we've been in for maybe a decade or so now. When we got into that, we needed to create a sales team because it's just a different kind of sale, different kind of relationships. And so, we had to create a different kind of sales team. When we did that, we started with sort of maintenance uniforms, uniform rental and maintenance because we didn't have a broad product offering. As we continued in that business, we started to learn through dialogue with the customers how else we can help them, and we started things like microfiber and we started rental programs in microfiber. And that started to take off and has become a nice product for us. As we continued to have dialogue with them, that sort of evolved into then scrub rental programs. These came out of, again, dialogue with how can we help our customers. And so, this health care has grown from almost nothing to, call it, 8% of our revenue now. And it's largely because of the adaptation of our people to this new type of vertical, along with our dialogue with our customers and creating a real nice partnership, that then creates some innovation, that gets innovation flowing for us in new products and services. And then if we couple that with technology of having more information at our fingertips, of being able to find better prospecting. As we can better able to tell what customers have, which products and where might the warmest leads and so on be, over time, we have been able to grow the business and through that, grow the productivity. And so, all of these things that we do that Todd talks about, they don't happen overnight. They are the evolution and continued dialogue and collaboration with our customers to become more and more ingrained in what we do with them. And so, the -- you asked about the white space. This is just a continued evolution of that collaboration, innovation, technology wins, productivity improvement.
Faiza Alwy: That's very helpful. And then just a quick follow-up on CapEx. You mentioned at the outset as a priority. I know we saw an increase in CapEx in 2024. And apologies if I missed it. I don't know if you gave a specific number, but just talk a bit more about some of the CapEx investments and how we should think about that going forward.
Mike Hansen: We were about 4.3% in fiscal '24 as a percent of revenue. You might remember, we had a little bit of a catch-up in truck purchasing through the year. We had some of the SAP investment for Fire Protection. We largely believe that CapEx in the future is the 3.5% to 4% of revenue range. I think that's where we'll likely end up in fiscal '25.
Operator: And our next question comes from Stephanie Moore from Jefferies. Please go ahead, Stephanie.
Stephanie Moore: I wanted to follow up actually on just the last question there and just one quick question. Are you finding potentially some increased activity from new customers that are viewing maybe a value proposition differently? So maybe taken another way, with higher inflationary environment, maybe not looking to kind of do it in-house and kind of have that initial capital outlay and your value proposition is coming in. Has that been a contributing driver to the growth?
Todd Schneider: Yes, there's many inputs to it. Certainly, if you are with a rental uniform program, if you want to buy garments, there's a large capital outlay versus us doing that for the customer, and other areas where you might have to go buy dispensers for chemicals or soaps, towels, what have you, in restrooms. And we do that for the customer. We make that investment on their behalf. And then again, we free them up to take care of their business, focus on their people, their customers, their guests, their patients. So, I'm sure that contributes to it. Certainly, when it's -- I think we've benefited from the environment where people are busy, and whether they're trying to hire people, take care of customers and they say, again, wow, I didn't realize you could do that for me, you can do it at those competitive rates, and that frees me up. And over the years, we've spoken to many, many customers who were surprised that our average-sized customer, how small it is. And they didn't realize that they were big enough to have a service like ours, where our average-sized customer is really small. And that's part of our responsibilities to get the message out, that we can help customers and our sales team out there actively pursuing those. But I've seen that over and over again throughout the years.
Stephanie Moore: Great. Got it. No, that's excellent color. Just last question for me. You talked about M&A being a bit more aggressive in this past year. I'm curious what your appetite would be to maybe more aggressively expand in the Fire and Safety or Fire and Security space. It's been a good vertical for you. I think it is an area or a market with a pretty considerable white space. So just curious your appetite within that vertical specifically.
Todd Schneider: Yes. Stephanie, the way I would describe it is, again, we were able to invest more in M&A this year than going back all the way to fiscal '17. That being said, that is a byproduct of just timing, deal flow, when people make decisions. I wouldn't call it a change in strategy on our part. It was more about timing and flow. And that's tough to predict. As far as the First Aid and Safety Services and the Fire business, we're acquisitive in every single route-based business that we have. And so, we like to evaluate every single deal and make a good decision. In the Fire business specifically, we want to make sure that we're competitive and aggressive after good, attractive deals. The mix of business matters to us, meaning we like a business that meets the mix of test and inspect that we have and repair along with that as well. And there are some deals that have come across our desks that we have chosen not to participate in because there's a significant amount of installation in those businesses. And the installation business tends to be kind of tied to new construction. And that is really a very business and not one that's as attractive to us. It's tougher to staff, tougher -- it's kind of like bid and chase business. So, we've chosen to avoid those. But we really like both the -- all the route-based businesses. Again, we're highly acquisitive and would like to continue on that path.
Operator: And at this time, there are no further questions. I'd like to turn the call back over to Jared for closing remarks.
Jared Mattingley: Thank you for joining us this morning. We will issue our first quarter of fiscal '25 financial results in September. We look forward to speaking with you again at that time.
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2024 Q3  (2024-03-27 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Cintas Corporation Announces Fiscal 2024 Third Quarter Earnings Release Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Jared Mattingley, Vice President and Treasurer, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
Jared Mattingley: Thank you for joining us. With me is Todd Schneider, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Mike Hansen, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We will discuss our fiscal 2024 third quarter results. After our commentary, we will open the call to questions from analysts. The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a safe harbor from civil litigation for forward-looking statements. This conference call contains forward-looking statements that reflect the company's current views as to future events and financial performance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those we may discuss. I refer you to the discussion on these points contained in our most recent filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. I'll now turn the call over to Todd.
Todd Schneider: Thank you, Jared. Due to the outstanding dedication and execution of our employees, whom we call partners, we delivered very strong results for our third quarter. Total revenue for the third quarter grew 9.9% to $2.41 billion. The revenue dollars represent record quarterly revenue. We are pleased with the performance of each of our businesses. Our revenue growth remains robust and we have good momentum in the business. New business remains strong. Our sales team continues to operate at a high level. We are seeing broad success across the many verticals, particularly within our focus verticals, as well as our cross-selling efforts and penetration of new products and services within our existing customers. Retention levels are strong and remain at very attractive levels. Our strong revenue growth flowed through to our bottom line. Gross margin for the third quarter increased 220 basis points to a record 49.4%, an increase of 14.9%. Operating income was a record 21.6%, an increase of 16.6%. Diluted EPS grew a robust 22.3% to $3.84. Cash flow remains strong. Net cash provided by operating activities in the third quarter grew 32.8% over the prior year. In the third quarter, we continued to invest in our businesses through capital expenditures of $107 million. During the third quarter, we made acquisition purchases of $111 million. On March 15th, we paid shareholders $137.6 million in quarterly dividends, an increase of 17.1% from the amount paid the previous March. Our strong cash flow gives us flexibility to choose how we deploy our capital and through three quarters, we have deployed over $1.4 billion of capital across our priorities of capital expenditures, acquisitions, dividends, and buybacks. I would like to thank our employees, whom we call partners, for their continued focus on our customers, our shareholders, and each other. Before turning the call over to Mike to provide details of our third-quarter results, I'll provide our updated financial expectations for our fiscal year. We are increasing our financial guidance. We are raising our annual revenue expectations from a range of $9.48 billion to $9.56 billion to a range of $9.57 billion to $9.6 billion, a total growth rate of 8.6% to 8.9%. Also, we are raising our annual diluted EPS expectations from a range of $14.35 to $14.65, to a range of $14.80 to $15, a growth rate of 13.9% to 15.5%. Mike?
Mike Hansen: Thanks, Todd, and good morning. Our fiscal 2024 third-quarter revenue was $2.41 billion, compared to $2.19 billion last year. The organic revenue growth rate adjusted for acquisitions, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, and a difference in the number of workdays was 7.7%. Total growth was positively impacted by 170 basis points due to the extra workday. We remind you, as you update your models for next fiscal year that there will be two less workdays compared to this current fiscal year. Each quarter next year will have 65 workdays, which means, the first and the fourth quarters will each have one less workday than this fiscal year. Organic growth by business was 7.1% for Uniform Rental and Facility Services, 11.5% for First Aid and Safety Services, 13.9% for Fire Protection Services and Uniform Direct Sale was down 3.9%. Gross margin for the third quarter of fiscal '24 was $1.19 billion, compared to $1.03 billion last year, an increase of 14.9%. Gross margin as a percent of revenue was 49.4% for the third quarter of fiscal '24 compared to 47.2% last year, an increase of 220 basis points. Strong volume growth, technology improvements, and continued operational efficiencies helped generate this strong gross margin. Gross margin percentage by business was 48.8% for Uniform Rental and Facility Services, 56.3% for First Aid and Safety Services, 48.8% for Fire Protection Services, and 41.1% for Uniform Direct Sale. Gross margin for the Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment increased 170 basis points from last year. Energy was a tailwind of 40 basis points. In addition, we continue to leverage our strong revenue growth, our technology investments and extract inefficiencies out of the business through our Six Sigma and engineering teams. Our technology investments have allowed us to improve garment sharing among our plants, which improves material cost. Our SmartTruck technology allows us to improve our route efficiencies and provide route densities to our existing routes, which positively impacts truck purchasing, labor, and energy. Our Six Sigma and engineering teams have helped us create efficiencies in the plant that allow us to maximize the utilization of our plant equipment, labor, and energy. Gross margin for the First Aid and Safety Services segment increased 470 basis points from last year. Strong revenue growth continues to help expand our margins in this segment. Strong revenue performance in some of our high-margin recurring revenue products like AED Rentals, eyewash stations, and WaterBreak continues to provide a healthy revenue mix. Our technology investment in SmartTruck continues to provide route optimization and improved efficiencies. And our First Aid dedicated distribution center allows us to lower product costs. All of these contributed to improved gross margins. Selling and administrative expenses increased 90 basis points from last year. The increase was driven by investments in selling resources, technology and our management trainee program, as well as costs associated with an agreement in principle to settle the purported class action contract dispute brought by plaintiffs City of Laurel. We determined that settling the claim is in the best interest of Cintas. The total monetary payment agreed to in the proposed settlement, including the 60 basis points recognized in this quarter is $45 million. We expect that the settlement costs will not impact our financials in future periods. As Todd mentioned earlier, we generated strong cash flow. For the year, our free cash flow increased 31.6%. This has allowed us to invest back into the business, which has resulted in capital expenditures of 4.3% for the year. Our investments include technology to grow the top line and expand margins, automation to improve efficiencies in our plants and additional processing capacity where needed. We expect capital expenditures to finish around 4.25% of revenue for the year. Operating income of $520.8 million compared to $446.8 million last year. Operating income as a percentage of revenue was 21.6% in the third quarter of fiscal '24 compared to 20.4% in last year's third quarter, an increase of 120 basis points. Our effective tax rate for the third quarter was 19.9% compared to 22.1% last year. The tax rates in both quarters were impacted by certain discrete items, primarily the tax accounting impact for stock-based compensation. Net income for the third quarter was $397.6 million compared to $325.8 million last year. This year's third-quarter diluted EPS of $3.84 compared to $3.14 last year, an increase of 22.3%. Todd provided our annual financial guidance. Related to the guidance, please note the following. Fiscal '24 interest expense is expected to be $99 million compared to $109.5 million in fiscal '23, predominantly as a result of less variable rate debt. Our fiscal '24 effective tax rate is expected to be 20.6%. This compares to a rate of 20.4% in fiscal '23. Our guidance does not include the impact of any future share buybacks. As I mentioned earlier, we expect that the proposed settlement will not impact our financials in future periods and accordingly, there is no impact on our guidance. Guidance includes $17.4 million of acquired revenue for the fourth quarter. This revenue includes the impact of the recently announced acquisitions during the third quarter. That concludes our prepared remarks. Now, we are happy to answer questions from the analysts. Please ask just one question and a single follow-up if needed. Thank you.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We will now take our first question from Manav Patnaik from Barclays Capital. Please go ahead, Manav.
Ronan Kennedy: Hi, good morning. This is Ronan Kennedy on for Manav. Thank you for taking my questions. Can I just ask, with regards to the strong margin performance, can you kind of assess or characterize the contributions from, whether it's the SmartTruck, the Six Sigma, the engineering extracting of inefficiencies? But also how we should think about those as drivers in the context of the sustainability of the margins, if you could elaborate on that, please?
Todd Schneider: Thank you for your question, Ronan. It's -- when you think about the gross margin, it really starts with our culture, how we run our business, the expectations we have, the intensity of which we run it, and the focus. That being said, there's many, many inputs to those numbers. Certainly, our investments that we are making are paying off. The investments in SmartTruck, the investments in our Six Sigma team, the investment in our engineering team, the investment in our supply chain organization are all helping us to improve those results. So I can't give you an exact number with, hey, SmartTruck gave us X basis points, what have you. It's -- there's many inputs, and we're pleased with the investments that we've made, and we're pleased with the leadership and the culture of the organization, where they're focused on driving those results, providing a better experience for our customers and providing a better experience for our employee-partners.
Ronan Kennedy: That's helpful. Thank you. And then with regards to obviously, strong performance on the top line as well, can you just talk about the contributions from new business and penetration versus expectations, how pricing is trending, and also retention, please?
Todd Schneider: Yeah, good question. So when we think about our growth, again, there's many contributing factors. We really like where we are from a growth standpoint, the internal growth, certainly we like the acquisitions that we've made. They're really good businesses. But when we think about the components of it, certainly pricing is a component, but it is not the majority. The majority of our growth is from volume growth. And that's really pleasing to us because we want to be able to grow our business in that manner. Pricing is -- has moderated and it's much closer to historical, and that's exactly what we had planned throughout the year. Where we're really benefiting is from our new business. Our team is performing at a high level. Our service organization is -- the retention levels are very attractive. And then we are cross-selling appropriately. We have a great breadth of products and services that we want to make sure that our customers and our prospects are aware of. And so we're benefiting kind of across all, not kind of, we are benefiting across all of those areas, and they're all big contributing factors, but we like where we are and we like how we're growing the business.
Operator: And our next question comes from Joshua Chan from UBS. Please go ahead, Joshua.
Joshua Chan: Hi. Good morning, Todd and Mike. Thanks for taking my questions. Could you talk about the -- I guess, piggybacking on the prior question, could you talk about the sustainability of growth that you're seeing now that the pricing has moderated to a historical level? Do you see the current run rate staining based on what you're seeing out there, talking to customers and retention rate dynamics, and all that?
Todd Schneider: Yeah, Josh, good morning. Again, we like where we are from a growth standpoint. The exciting thing is there's -- we service a little over a million customers. There's 16 million businesses in North America, so we're -- we think there's an incredible runway for us. So we're selling to -- about 60% of our new accounts come from no programmers, and that is continuing. So we're seeing great results from talking to prospects and showing them a better way to do it than they are today. Now, that doesn't necessarily mean that, that is new spend. They might be spending that money somehow. It's just we're redirecting it to do it better, smarter, faster, in some cases, even less expensive than the way they're doing it. So we think the runway is very attractive because of the number of prospects that are out there and our business -- or, excuse me, our buying proposition resonating with prospects and customers. So, we expect that we like where we are from a growth standpoint. As I mentioned, we like how we're growing and we want to continue in that manner.
Joshua Chan: That's great color. Thank you. And for my follow-up, you talked about incremental margins being in the 20% to 30% range historically, and now you're sort of at the higher end of that in recent years. Is this the right level of incremental margins going forward on revenue growth that comes ahead?
Todd Schneider: Yeah. So we're -- we recognize the math of 20% to 30% incremental margins. We need to be the higher end of that in order to continue to improve our margins and we're focused on doing that. We're doing so by extracting out those inefficiencies, getting really good leverage on our revenue growth, so many ways. But running a business is not linear. And so, we know there's going to be some puts and takes and some quarters will be higher and some won't be as high. But generally speaking, we like that range. And I prefer the higher end than the lower end, that's for sure.
Operator: And our next question comes from Heather Balsky from Bank of America. Please go ahead, Heather.
Heather Balsky: Hi. Thank you. I was hoping you could just talk about the M&A you did this quarter and what attracted you to the assets. And then an update on how to think about M&A going forward.
Todd Schneider: I'm certainly happy to start, Mike. Regarding -- Heather, good morning. And regarding M&A, so it's an important component for us. You certainly cannot pace M&A. So they kind of come as they do, and it takes two to dance. And -- but I can tell you the two that we announced this past quarter are great businesses first off, really good operators, really attractive businesses. In the case of the one in Kentucky, it provided us with some needed capacity in that region of the country. In addition to the added capacity, we were able to absorb that volume into seven of our facilities. So some really nice synergies allows us to, as we're closer to the customers, to spend more time with the customer and less time driving. So that's important to us. In the case of the acquisition in the M&A in Pennsylvania, we did not acquire any additional capacity. But in that case, we were able to absorb it into 16 of our facilities. So again, attractive synergies, more time with the customer, less time driving. And in those cases, we also then get to talk to our new customers about the broader breadth of products and services that we have. So we think it's -- overall it's very attractive. As I mentioned, it takes two to dance. You can't pace it. But in this case, these were two really attractive businesses, great operators that really made sense for us.
Mike Hansen: Maybe a couple added points. As Todd said, these are great acquisitions, and we've had a handful of them this fiscal year. Each of the two that Todd talked about is less than $20 million in annual revenue. The $17.4 million that we gave you in our prepared remarks includes the impact of those. But keeping in mind, we've made acquisitions all year long, and so that fourth quarter impact would include all of the acquisitions we've made throughout the last 12 months. Just something to keep in mind as you're thinking about our fourth quarter.
Heather Balsky: Thank you. Appreciate it.
Operator: And our next question comes from Andy Wittmann from RW Baird. Please go ahead, Andy. Hello, Andy. Is your line muted?
Andy Wittmann: I'm sorry about that. Mike, I just want to build on that last question where you were commenting on the M&A contribution. Is there any -- in your fourth quarter guidance, is there a change in your fundamental outlook for the company, recognizing that it is up now somewhat on these two -- somewhat larger acquisitions that you did? And then as an addendum to that, was this 60 basis points or $45 million legal settlement that you just talked about, was that included and considered in your initial guidance? Or are you absorbing that and still able to raise your guidance here?
Mike Hansen: Yeah. So, Andy, I already forgot your first part of the question. What was your first part?
Andy Wittmann: First question is, does your fundamental outlook for the business unchanged?
Mike Hansen: Yeah, yeah.
Andy Wittmann: Is your fundamental outlook unchanged for 4Q or is there a change…
Mike Hansen: Yeah. I apologize. No, as Todd talked about, our market remains very large, the momentum in the business remains good, the adoption remains good, and the guide for the fourth quarter is right where we want to be in terms of sort of the stated profile of growth that we want to have. And so, all of that put together with not really any change in customer behavior would mean, no, continued performance like we've seen, and we continue to like the momentum of the business. As it relates to your second question, the 60 basis points, that was not contemplated in the initial guide from the beginning of the year and that was simply absorbed through -- well, in this third quarter, the 60 basis points simply absorbed.
Andy Wittmann: Okay, thank you. That's all my questions for today.
Operator: And our next question comes from George Tong from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead, George.
George Tong: Hi, thanks. Good morning. Can you provide an update on the external selling environment, including how client budgets and sales cycles are performing?
Todd Schneider: Yeah, I'm certainly happy to start. George, good morning. We haven't really seen much of a change in sales cycle as far as our -- the interest in our products and services remains good. We're always continuing -- we're continuing to invest in new products and services. Tweaks, I guess, certainly to them to make it as attractive to the prospects and the customers as possible. But we're not seeing a change. Momentum continues to be good. Outsourcing still resonates and we're seeing, as I mentioned earlier, the no program market is still really, really large. And we've become pretty darn proficient at presenting to those prospects to help them run a better business. And we help them with all the products and services we provide. And as I mentioned, it's not always new money. Usually they're spending something. It's just redirecting it to us to do it better, faster, smarter, cheaper type thing.
George Tong: Got it. That's helpful. And then separately, can you talk a little bit about your focus verticals, including healthcare, how much additional runway is there for these focus verticals to serve as a tailwind to organic revenue growth?
Todd Schneider: Yeah. So, George, so it's in our internal growth. So it is helping us -- that focus is helping us to organize around the customer and provide the products and services that they want. And that has been a good strategy for us over the past number of years. So we like all the verticals we're in. We find them very attractive. Whether it's healthcare, hospitality, education, state, local government, business, it's all attractive and we're organized around it and our value proposition is resonating with them.
Operator: And our next question comes from Tim Mulrooney from William Blair. Please go ahead, Tim.
Luke McFadden: Hi, good morning. This is Luke McFadden on for Tim Mulrooney. Thanks for taking our questions today. So I wanted to ask, too, just on first date, I'll start with the first one and then move on to the second one after. But First Aid and Safety has been growing at a double digit rate for quite a few quarters in a row now. I know there's a penetration story here with your established base of uniform customers, but I'm also curious if new product introductions are an important driver of this growth. How much of your growth in that segment is from new product introductions?
Todd Schneider: Good morning, Luke. We really like the First Aid business. Part of our culture is continued innovation. So we're always looking at improving our -- improving our processes, improving our products, improving our services, so it's always a component. I cannot give you a number of, hey, it was X basis points of growth due to a product rollout or what have you, but I can tell you this. The value proposition in the First Aid business and all of our businesses, but in First Aid, as you asked about, it's really resonating. And the mix of business that we have there is really good. And we're able to be better sourcers, better providers of products with our investment and our distribution center. So when you have a robust supply chain that allows us to get products to the customers in a really timely fashion, it puts us in a great spot to be successful. And so yeah, cross-sell, we're absolutely, we want all of our customers, whether they're uniform or fire or direct sale customer, we want them all to know about our First Aid business. And we try to make sure that that occurs in many different conduits, but it's, yeah, we're benefiting from that cross-sell.
Luke McFadden: Understood, really helpful, and maybe just sticking on first aid and safety here. As you think about that segment of your business, does it feel like you've essentially built out the full suite of products and services there, or at some point should we expect that potentially you're more about other product introductions as you continue to build out the portfolio? Because the room here for more is essentially what I'm curious to know.
Todd Schneider: Yeah, Luke, yeah, again, I'll go back to our culture. Our culture is such that we are constantly innovating and pushing ourselves to be the -- to provide the best products and services. And so you'll see more of that to come. We're constantly innovating to put our partners in the best position, our employee partners in the best position to provide the most value for our customers.
Mike Hansen: And maybe one added comment Luke, when we think about this business, you may have heard us speak to umbrellas of image, safety, cleanliness and compliance and when we think about this business, safety is a fairly large umbrella and when our first aid and safety people are speaking with customers and thinking about that innovation that Todd talked about, we're thinking quite broadly about how do we keep our customers, how do we help our customers keep their employees safe. And that can mean opportunities into the future. And that's the way we look at it from a broad perspective.
Operator: And our next question comes from Andrew Steinerman from JP Morgan Securities. Please go ahead, Andrew.
Andrew Steinerman: Hi. In the quarter, when you look at your rentals and facility services segment, how much of the growth is actually coming from uniforms versus ancillary services directionally? Like, is there good growth in both? And also if you can make a comment about ad stops within uniforms.
Todd Schneider: Good morning, Andrew. As you know, we don't give out those specific numbers, but directionally to your question, yeah, we're seeing growth across them at all. It's -- there's good demand for our uniform business and our facility services business, frankly for all of our business products and services. So, nothing to point out to one particular area there. As far as ad stops, we haven't really seen a change to our customer behavior there. So, it’s -- I'll call it kind of business as usual. There's many inputs to that number, but nevertheless, I'd say it's kind of business as usual.
Andrew Steinerman: Thank you.
Todd Schneider: Yes, sir.
Operator: And our next question comes from Jasper Bibb from Truist Securities. Please go ahead, Jasper.
Jasper Bibb: Hey, good morning, guys. I wanted to follow up on the earlier discussion on first aid. The gross margin there was really impressive at 56% this quarter, but you also had SG&A at 25% from the prior year. So, could you provide just maybe a bit of color on the investments you're making in that business? And when do you think the first aid segment should start to deliver a bit more margin leverage over that G&A base?
Todd Schneider: Yeah, Jasper, good morning. As I mentioned, we really like the business and it's performing really well and we're investing appropriately. The amount of prospects out there are massive. And to Mike's point earlier, the value proposition is resonating. We talk about the mantra in that business is what's more important to a business than the health and safety of their employees and their customers. So that is resonating. We're in a great position to invest to provide those products and services. So we're doing just that. And so we're investing in selling resources, we're investing in marketing resources, because we really like where we are and it makes sense to invest. And I think you're seeing it show up in the operating margin and the gross margin.
Mike Hansen: Yeah, we've -- each quarter this year has been 22% or higher, which is quite a big improvement from a year ago. And so, as Todd said, these -- and we want to continue to invest in the long-term growth of all of our businesses. And you can really see those investments playing out, particularly in the gross margin line of first aid and safety. But we love the margins. They're up quite a bit over the last few years. And we'll continue to invest as we see appropriate.
Jasper Bibb: Thanks, that makes sense. And then just was hoping to get an update on what you're seeing for expense growth on labor and fleet related costs in the quarter?
Todd Schneider: Jasper, good question. Certainly, labor is an important component. We want to make sure that we're providing attractive wages, competitive wages. And we've spoken on previous calls that we were not flat-footed when it came to the wage inflation that I'd say North America has seen over the past few years. So we've been in a good position and we like where we are from that perspective. And here's what's really exciting, is we have, I mentioned earlier, our Six Sigma teams, our engineering teams, they're helping us to automate certain items to bring transformation technology to portions of our business, whether it's SmartTruck or plant efficiencies, that allows us to mitigate that subject as best as possible. And so we're investing and have invested for years in those organizations and it's paying off in -- and what we're seeing with our total labor costs as we manage through and make sure we're still in a really good spot to be a competitive and attract the very best people.
Operator: And our next question comes from Ashish Sabadra from RBC. Please go ahead, Ashish.
Ashish Sabadra: Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to focus on the Google partnership. I was wondering if you can provide an update on that front. I believe you've already migrated your SAP onto the GCP. And how should we think about those benefits that you may have seen in the quarter, but also benefits as we go forward? Thanks.
Todd Schneider: Good question, Ashish. I would characterize -- well, first off, we have a great relationship with Google. You're correct, we did migrate to the Google Cloud platform and I would characterize it as we're in the early innings there. And so we certainly hope to maximize our relationship and put our employee partners in a position to provide more value and to be as successful as possible. Because we believe there's tools that will be available to us to provide more value to the customers and to put our people in a better position to provide that value which makes them more successful. So early innings, but we're optimistic about where that can go.
Ashish Sabadra: That's a very helpful color. And if I can ask a quick accounting clarifying question. So in the balance sheet, the uniform and other rental items and service that's moderated sequentially quarter to quarter, I was just wondering if you can provide any color on what's driving that, is that better efficiency or any color on that front? Thanks.
Mike Hansen: Yes. Todd talked a little bit about how we are working on all pieces of the business, but certainly one of those is inventory, and he touched on a little bit of garment sharing. So you can think about when we improve garment sharing, for example, we don't need to inject as many new garments into that in-service inventory. So the more sharing means better utilization of our existing in-service inventory, and it means we don't have to add as much into the in-service inventory from new purchases. That's one of the areas. Certainly, though, there are others like improved sourcing as well. Volume growth, as Todd said, remains really strong, and so what we're seeing is some nice offsetting of the volume growth with some of these initiatives.
Operator: And our next question comes from Stephanie Moore from Jefferies. Please go ahead, Stephanie.
Stephanie Moore: Hi, good morning. Thank you. I wanted to continue the discussion on the pretty impressive margin front for the quarter. I appreciate the color in terms of kind of discussing the route optimization, the merchandise management, Six Sigma, the likes. But maybe if you could provide a little bit of color of your major initiatives, which ones you think are kind of still in the early innings, or we could kind of continue to see some more improvement or accelerated improvement? And then maybe taking it a step further, what is next for you guys, in terms of other areas of opportunity that haven't been as major focused yet? Thank you.
Todd Schneider: Good morning, Stephanie. From our strategic initiatives that we're focused on how can we impact our business in total, certainly our material costs, our energy, our labor. And Mike referred to earlier, our energy spend is down 40 basis points. That's not all just price. That is, those initiatives that we referred to earlier, the material cost is -- our two largest costs are material costs and labor. So we're very focused on driving efficiencies in all those areas, because to Mike's earlier point, we love the volume growth, but we don't want to sacrifice margin because the volume growth is so robust that we've got these strategic initiatives to extract these inefficiencies out of our business. And I wouldn't speak to any one in particular that it's in the earlier innings or the others. We've got a nice runway forward for doing that. A little bit of that is our culture, is that we're constantly trying to innovate and push ourselves to be better. So I think you'll see that continued. As far as acceleration, it's built in. We're constantly doing it. So I think we're focused on those incremental margins and this is an important component of making sure that we can hit those numbers.
Mike Hansen: Yeah, the only thing I might add is we're certainly in the very early innings of technology and we believe there's a nice runway there. Todd talked about just the recent migration to the Google Cloud and that creates a foundation for us to do some interesting things moving forward.
Stephanie Moore: Great. Well, thank you so much.
Operator: And our next question comes from Scott Schneeberger from Oppenheimer. Please go ahead, Scott.
Unidentified Analyst: Hey, good morning, it's [Daniel] (ph) on for Scott. Thanks for taking our question. Could you please speak to the outlook for uniform direct sales and fire protection as well as some perspective on the margins for all others going forward please? Thank you.
Todd Schneider: I'll start on the outlook and, Mike, if you want to speak to the margins. The uniform direct sale business is strategic business for us. We have some really large strategic accounts, whether it's national accounts or in the hospitality, gaming area of our business. And so strategic meaning that those customers spend a lot more money with us not just with garment direct sale but also outside of that. So that's important. That being said, that business certainly can be a little lumpy due to the nature of it with rollouts and purchases. But we like where we're positioned there. We like the value proposition that we're -- where we are there. So we think the outlook's very positive there. As far as the fire business, it's been a great business for us. The results over the last several years, we've seen great revenue growth, we've seen great margin improvement, and it's the only business we're in where you legally have to have those products and services. So we think it’s -- the outlook is really positive because of the prospects that are out there and the runway we see for opportunity. So, Mike, if you want to comment on margin.
Mike Hansen: Sure. So as Todd said, the fire business in particular, the margins have increased quite a bit in the last handful of years, and we've seen a lot of the same initiatives and other initiatives specific to that business really take off like we've seen in our other businesses. The one thing I might point out there, we did see some increase in SG&A and the fire business year-over-year, and we're starting to get into that SAP implementation for the fire business. So we might see a little bit of pressure as we move into fiscal ‘25 on the fire margins, the overall margins because of that investment and that move. But as you've seen with our rental and first aid and safety businesses, once we understand how to use that and get proficient at it, it can create some really nice opportunities. So maybe a little bit of -- we've seen some great improvement, maybe a little bit of next year and the following year pressure on SG&A because of that implementation, but we certainly expect those margins to continue to improve in the longer term. From a uniform direct sale margin perspective, as Todd said, that business is going to go up and down. It's going to be a little bit bumpy from quarter to quarter. And because of that, the margins will be as well. So I don't think there's anything specific to call out other than it isn't quite as consistent of a business as the other three that we have.
Unidentified Analyst: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Shlomo Rosenbaum from Stifel Nicolaus. Please go ahead Shlomo.
Shlomo Rosenbaum: Hi, thank you for taking my questions. Hey, Todd, can you talk a little bit about the macro environment with regard to employment? And specifically if you could touch up on some of the areas where they're looking for more automation to reduce the employment due to raises in minimum wage in areas like California, are you -- how exposed are you to those kind of verticals? And then after that, I have a follow up.
Todd Schneider: Good morning, Shlomo. Yeah, from a macro environment, as I mentioned, we haven't seen much change in our customer behavior. Certainly there is always some puts and takes. And as you mentioned, our employer is under pressure to figure out ways to automate things because wage inflation, that has occurred and will continue to occur, it's occurred for many, many years. Now there's also some -- the infrastructure bills that are out there, the on-shoring. I can't speak to specifics of, oh, boy, we're benefiting from this or this is a headwind here. But generally, we like the spot we're in. And we think it's, the macro environment where it's been reasonably stable and that's -- we find that attractive and we can be really successful in that environment.
Shlomo Rosenbaum: Okay, thank you. Just for a follow-up, you have a competitor there that was spun out, say, six months ago. And I was just wondering, has there been any change in the environment with them competitively in terms, either positively or negatively? I mean, have you seen any changes in the way that they bid? Are you taking more business from them? Maybe you could just comment in general.
Todd Schneider: Yeah, Shlomo, I would characterize it as, it's pretty well business as usual. They're a very good competitor, always have been, I'm sure they always will be, and we have a great deal of respect for them. And it's a very competitive environment, always has been as far as -- as long as I've been with the company, it has been, and I'm sure it will be in the future and -- but we're focused on putting our employee partners in the best position to be successful in providing our customers the best value proposition. So really none of that has changed.
Operator: And our next question comes from Kartik Mehta from Northcoast Research. Please go ahead, Kartik.
Kartik Mehta: Yeah, thank you. Hey, good morning. Todd, you have been able to execute extremely well this year, beat guidance. And as you look at the business, is that the result of maybe metrics like non-programmers being a little bit better than you thought? Is it sales being better than you thought? Maybe you're just more cautious about the economy than actually happened. If you look at why you have been able to do better, what would you point to?
Todd Schneider: Yeah, Kartik, it starts with our culture and our expectations of our employee partners and the pace and the intensity of which they run. But that being said, we’ve -- our value proposition is really resonating in each of the businesses we're in. The first aid business we spoke about, it's very good. Outsourcing is resonating nicely. Maybe it has to do with, it's not as easy to hire people as it has been in the past, so if you want someone to outsource it, it's that much more attractive. Yeah, we like the spot we're in, and it’s -- and we have exceeded our internal expectations, and we're pleased with that. But there's so many inputs to it, because we're trying to focus on providing better products, better services, better technologies to make our people more successful and to make our customers that much happier. So a lot of inputs but we like where we're positioned and we're continuing to invest for the future.
Kartik Mehta: And just one follow-up, you obviously discussed M&A a lot. I'm wondering, and I know some of these acquisitions can take years to come to fruition. But as you look at the market today, are you seeing any change in the pricing environment, maybe what expectations are from sellers, or has it remained about the same?
Todd Schneider: Yeah, Kartik, good question. I wouldn't speak to any change there. It's more about -- certain events might cause them, whether it's an owner's age or succession or -- there's many different life events that would cause them to make a move. And it's more about that to your point. It's in certain cases, these are decades in the making. And you can't really pace them, but when they are ready, we're ready. And we're highly acquisitive, very interested in M&A from all shapes and sizes, big, little, medium, everything in between, we think it’s -- we're very interested.
Operator: And our next question comes from Toni Kaplan from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead, Toni.
Toni Kaplan: Thanks so much. I wanted to ask a question on the focus verticals. Are you able to share sort of the growth between focus verticals versus non-focus ones? And how do you assess whether to add a new vertical into that sort of focus designation? Is there a different go-to-market strategy for focus verticals as well? Thanks.
Todd Schneider: Yeah, good morning, Toni. Well, I'll say this about our focus verticals. I certainly expect them to grow faster than the business in general. And when you have an organized approach and you're organized around a customer base, you certainly expect that. And we've chosen what we think are really good verticals that are very attractive. So yeah, I can't give you a specific of -- boy, it's adding X amount of basis points to our total growth, but we think we've chosen well. And we're always analyzing what's -- should we have another one or should we not? And what's the best way? And it really gets down to what puts our employee partners in the best position to be successful and what creates the most value for the customer base. So we're looking, we're evaluating, always doing that, but we like where our investment is at this point.
Toni Kaplan: Terrific. I wanted to also ask about your marketing budget and whether you've increased that year-over-year. I recently heard some Cintas commercials on Bloomberg Radio for example, just wondering if that's coincidence or if there's been a greater push towards more marketing? Thanks.
Todd Schneider: Yeah, Toni, first off, thank you. I'm glad to hear that. The algorithm is working and it's hitting our target audience. So I wouldn't say there's been a step change there. It's just trying to be -- make sure our investment is well-placed. And we're trying to leverage analytics and technology to make sure that the investment is deriving the very best ROI as possible. So it's just a matter of tweaks versus a step change in investment.
Toni Kaplan: Terrific. Thanks a lot.
Todd Schneider: Thank you.
Operator: And at this time, there are no further questions. I'd like to turn the call back over to Jared for closing remarks.
Jared Mattingley: Thank you for joining us this morning. We will issue our fourth quarter of fiscal ‘24 financial results in July. We look forward to speaking with you again at that time. Thank you.
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2024 Q2  (2023-12-21 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Cintas Corporation Announces Fiscal 2024 Second Quarter Earnings Release Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the meeting over to Mr. Jared Mattingley, Vice President, Treasurer and Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
Jared Mattingley: Thank you for joining us. With me is Todd Schneider, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Mike Hansen, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We will discuss our fiscal 2024 second quarter results. After our commentary, we will open the call to questions from analysts. The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a safe harbor from civil litigation for forward-looking statements. This conference call contains forward-looking statements that reflect the company's current views as to future events and financial performance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ materially from those we may discuss. I refer you to the discussions on these points contained in our most recent filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. I will now turn the call over to Todd.
Todd Schneider: Thank you, Jared. We are pleased with our second quarter results and are excited about the future. Second quarter total revenue grew 9.3% to $2.38 billion. Each of our businesses continue to execute at a high level. Our momentum in the business is good and volume remains robust. We can grow in a number of different ways. Contribution to our growth from new business remained strong and comes from companies that either outsource their program today or they are managing it themselves. We continue to have great success cross-selling to existing customers. Retention levels are strong and remain at very attractive levels, and our value proposition of image, safety, cleanliness, and compliance continues to resonate across businesses of all sizes and in all verticals. We continue to be pleased with the results from our focus on prospects within the verticals of healthcare, hospitality, education, and state and local government. We recently announced the opening of two cleanroom facilities, one in North Carolina and the other in Wisconsin. These facilities will provide additional capacity in these regions in order to expand our efforts in this area of attractive growth from pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. The benefits of our strong volume growth and revenue flowed through to our bottom line. Gross margin for the second quarter grew 11.6% and operating income grew 12.3%. Diluted EPS grew 15.7% to $3.61. Cash flow remained strong. Net cash provided by operating activities in the second quarter grew 17.8% over the prior year. Our strong cash flow gives us flexibility to choose how we deploy our capital. In the second quarter, we continued to invest in our businesses. We also acquired several smaller businesses. On December 15th, we paid shareholders $137.5 million in quarterly dividends, an increase of 17.1% from the amount paid the previous December. During the second quarter, we also purchased $320.3 million of Cintas common stock under our buyback program. I would like to thank our employees, whom we call partners, for their continued focus on our customers, our shareholders, and each other. Now, before turning the call over to Mike to provide details of our second quarter results, I'll provide our updated financial expectations for our fiscal year. We are increasing our financial guidance. We are raising our annual revenue expectations from a range of $9.40 billion to $9.52 billion to a range of $9.48 billion to $9.56 billion, a total growth rate of 7.5% to 8.4%. Also, we are raising our annual diluted EPS expectations from a range of $14.00 to $14.45 to a range of $14.35 to $14.65, a growth rate of 10.5% to 12.8%. Mike?
Mike Hansen: Thanks, Todd, and good morning. Our fiscal 2024 second quarter revenue was $2.38 billion compared to $2.1 billion last year. The organic revenue growth rate, adjusted for acquisitions and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, was 9%. Organic growth by business was 7.9% for Uniform Rental and Facility Services, 12.7% for First Aid and Safety Services, 17.8% for Fire Protection Services, and 4.7% for Uniform Direct Sale. Gross margin for the second quarter of fiscal 2024 was $1.14 billion compared to $1.02 billion last year, an increase of 11.6%. Gross margin as a percent of revenue was 48% for the second quarter of fiscal ‘24 compared to 47% last year, an increase of 100 basis points. Strong volume growth and continued operational efficiencies helped generate this strong gross margin. Gross margin percentage by business was 47.4% for Uniform Rental and Facility Services, 54.5% for First Aid and Safety Services, 48.6% for Fire Protection Services, and 40.9% for Uniform Direct Sale. Gross margin for the Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment increased 40 basis points from last year. We continue to leverage our strong revenue growth and extract inefficiencies out of the business in order to expand margins. Our year-over-year improvements are no accident. Our Six Sigma and Engineering teams have helped us create efficiencies in the plant that allow us to maximize the utilization of our equipment, labor, and energy. Our SmartTruck technology allows us to improve our route efficiencies and provide density to our existing routes. While energy expenses comprised of gasoline, natural gas, and electricity were a tailwind of 40 basis points from last year, please keep in mind that some of the energy benefit is the result of efficiencies just mentioned. As an example, our rental revenue grew organically at 7.9%, but we only added 1% to our route structure since last year. Gross margin for the First Aid and Safety Services segment increased 400 basis points from last year. Our revenue growth is strong and value -- our value proposition continues to resonate in this segment. Health and safety of employees remains top of mind. Our mix of revenues continues to be healthy, including growing high margin recurring revenue products like AED rentals, eyewash stations, and WaterBreak. We continue to use technology like SmartTruck to optimize our routes and improve efficiencies. And our first aid dedicated distribution center allows us to lower product costs. All of these contributes to our improved margins. Selling and administrative expenses grew $64.4 million or 11.1% over last year. Strong revenue growth creates leverage, which allows us to invest in the business. We continue to invest in our people, adding selling resources, investing in our management trainee program to develop future leaders, and expanding our talent acquisition efforts. Operating income of $499.7 million compared to $444.9 million last year. Operating income as a percent of revenue was 21% in the second quarter of fiscal 2024 compared to 20.5% in last year's second quarter, an increase of 50 basis points. Our effective tax rate for the second quarter was 20.9% compared to 22.1% last year. The tax rates in both quarters were impacted by certain discrete items, primarily the tax accounting impact for stock-based compensation. Net income for the second quarter was $374.6 million compared to $324.3 million last year. This year's second quarter diluted EPS of $3.61 compared to $3.12 last year, an increase of 15.7%. Todd provided our annual financial guidance. Related to the guidance, please note the following. Fiscal ‘24 interest expense is expected to be $100 million compared to $109.5 million in fiscal ‘23, predominantly as a result of less variable rate debt. Our fiscal ‘24 effective tax rate is expected to be 21.3%. This compares to a rate of 20.4% in fiscal ‘23. The higher effective tax rate negatively impacts fiscal ‘24 EPS guidance by about $0.16 and diluted EPS growth by about 120 basis points. Our financial guidance does not include the impact of any future share buybacks and guidance includes the impact of having one more workday in fiscal ‘23 compared to fiscal -- I'm sorry, fiscal ‘24 compared to fiscal ‘23. This extra workday comes in our fiscal third quarter. I'll turn it back to Jared.
Jared Mattingley: Thanks, Mike. That concludes our prepared remarks. Now, we are happy to answer questions from the analysts. Please ask just one question and a single follow-up, if needed. Thank you.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Ashish Sabadra from RBC. Please go ahead, Ashish.
Ashish Sabadra: Thanks for taking my question. Just on the four verticals that you highlighted as areas of strength in particular. I was wondering if you can quantify how big the combined revenues are from those verticals and how does the growth profile there compare to the company average? Any color? Thanks.
Todd Schneider: Good morning, Ashish. This is Todd. Thanks for the question. We don't -- I don't have any specific number for you as far as that exact number, but I can tell you that our verticals are performing quite well. We're having really good success. Our focus around not just selling but organizing around those is really paying off for us. And I've just got a couple of wins I can share with you regarding the verticals. In healthcare, in the acute space, we're having good success and non-acute as well. We’ve got a scrub rental program to a big hospital network in South Carolina that is benefiting from a new consistent image but also identification. The customer told us that they were interested in being able to -- pardon me, identify their people, understanding who was supposed to be in what area and this new scrub program did that. We had a really similar experience with a nursing home in Virginia. Same thing. They were buying their own and they -- but the leadership wanted to be able to identify and have a consistent image with their people. We had a -- on the acute side, again a hospital in Florida that we rolled out a new microfiber program because they were struggling with inventory control and product quality, which led to cleanliness concerns. And our program offered some great products, technology to control the inventory, which allow them to focus more on their patients, instead of having a full run with trying to manage the microfiber. Excuse me. And then I've got a couple of other examples I thought might be helpful for the group. In our government sector, we have -- we just recently rolled out a first aid and AED rental program to a public library system in California, which is -- you wouldn't think of a public library system as being a great prospect for us, but it is. They realized that the value would bring to their employees and being prepared with the AEDs in case it was needed because the publics in their locations. And then lastly, I'll just share with you a little bit on education. A variety of wins there. We had a chemistry department at a nice-sized university in Virginia. They put all their educators and students in a lab tour program. The maintenance department at a University in California put all of their people in Carhartt uniforms, a rental program from us, they love the Carhartt. And then the last item would be there was a dining facility at a university in Arizona where they put all their culinary people in Chef Works, which is a big win for those folks. The branded programs with Carhartt and Chef Works were big wins. So, I don't want to belabor it, but I thought I would just share a few wins because I know verticals are of interest to yourself, Ashish, but also plenty of other folks on the call.
Mike Hansen: Yeah. The only other thing I might add is, as Todd just talked about, we have so many ways to win, and clearly, those verticals are growing faster than the average. So we still are seeing really good momentum in each of those.
Ashish Sabadra: That's great color and thanks for sharing those events. It does provide a lot more clarity on those verticals. And if I can ask a quick follow-up. I was just wondering if there is -- if you could share any update on your technology, the SmartTruck program, and particularly the partnership with Google, Verizon, and SAP, any updates on that front? Thanks.
Todd Schneider: Certainly. I think how -- one of the things we have around here is we don't make money when the wheels are moving. We make money when the wheels stop. And -- so we're -- or the way Mike described it, in total for our company, we grew revenues over 9%, but we only added 1% to our route structure in total. So that means we're spending more time with the customer, less time driving, which is better for our customers, better for our partners, and better for Cintas. So we're pleased with that. Our technology and we still have plenty of room to go there. We're focused on bringing those efficiencies, extracting out the inefficiencies in our business. We sent out a note -- a press release regarding our migration this quarter to the Google Cloud, that has been very successful for us. There's a number of benefits that we get from moving from a server farm to the Google Cloud. The first one is it's more secure, so very important to us. Second item is, over time, we believe we will -- that'll be more cost-effective for us. And the third is it gives us access to Google's AI platform. So certainly in the very early innings, we just migrated, but we think that that will be able to help us longer term in making it more attractive, making it easier to do business with Cintas, making sure that we are positioning our people to be successful, to point them in the right direction and leverage that type of -- those types of tools.
Operator: And our next question comes from Manav Patnaik from Barclays Capital. Please go ahead, Manav.
Manav Patnaik: Thank you. Todd, just to follow up on all the wins and contracts you talked about, maybe, I guess the question is more around the competitive environment versus is this just first time outsourcers? Any trends, any changes you're seeing from that front, the new business percentage you've called out before, but whether that's more market share or just first time outsourcing?
Todd Schneider: Good morning, Manav. Great question. As Mike said, we win in many ways. We have been selling no programmers since the inception of my career, I can tell you that, and we continue to. And I'll just remind you, there is -- we service a little over a million businesses, but there's 16 million businesses in the US and Canada, so there's plenty of opportunity there. And we like both. We certainly win some from the competitors. We like growing the pie. And then the examples I was giving, it's a mix. But in large part, it is -- they were either doing it in house, meaning they were processing microfibers in house, or they were telling their employees to go buy product. So there's different variations of no programmers, meaning some are just -- were buying products and providing to their people and telling them to wear them. Some of them, they were just telling them to show up to work and look good. But nevertheless, we bring so much better consistent program identification, cleanliness, all these and compliance are big drivers for our customers.
Manav Patnaik: Got it. And then just on the capital allocation front, I mean, the buyback number one of the bigger quarters for a while now. I mean, is that any indication of the M&A market slowing down or just how we should think about that balance there?
Mike Hansen: Manav, we -- no change in what we're seeing in M&A. Still we're working the pipeline as best we can. We've made some nice acquisitions this year. From a buyback perspective, you've heard us speak to it being an opportunistic execution. And that's what you saw this quarter. As we think back about our first quarter results, and we thought they were pretty good, the stock reacted a little bit negatively, and we saw that as a nice opportunity and we took advantage of it. So that is a -- it was a good example during the quarter of an opportunistic execution of that buyback program. And the beauty, Manav, as we speak about our capital allocation, we don't always have to choose right in the quarter or maybe let's call it for the year. We've invested in the business as we've talked about. Our CapEx is up, which is important to us as a part of that investment. M&A is up from last year. Dividends are up 17% from last year, and we've been able to execute on the buyback program. So when you hear us talk about the sort of the four levers of capital allocation, we've done them all, I think, nicely this year. And again, the beauty of our cash flow and our balance sheet is we don't really have to choose.
Todd Schneider: Mike, I would just add that we think we're being really good fiduciaries of our shareholders' investments. Mike mentioned all the levers. And the net-net of that is we still have great dry powder, which allows us to take on M&A of all shapes and sizes and we're interested in that.
Operator: And our next question comes from Joshua Chan from UBS. Please go ahead, Joshua.
Joshua Chan: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. So, Todd, you mentioned the opening of the cleanrooms. I was just wondering if you can kind of frame for us what you see as the attractive parts of this business. How is it attractive? And what kind of opportunity does it mean for Cintas going forward in the cleanrooms?
Todd Schneider: Thanks for the question, Josh. Yeah, the cleanroom business is, it's an attractive sector for us. I mentioned pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, and there's -- it seems like there's more and more every year that need that level of cleaning, that level of cleanliness. So, that is -- we think that bodes well for that business in the future. And there has been -- you've seen some momentum onshoring in that area. And we want to make sure that we have the appropriate capacity to serve our current customers and that we're prepared for the future as well. So, we like the trends in that business, and we like the business.
Joshua Chan: Great. Thank you for the color there, Todd. And, in fact, if I can follow up with the margin question, I guess, if in the future, the energy favorability were to lessen, could you talk to the opportunities that you still have to drive margin expansion and the targeted incremental margins going forward without as much energy tailwind?
Todd Schneider: Yeah. Great question. Yeah. So, we recognize that energy prices go up, they go down. But one thing that's going to be consistent is, we're going to be focused on extracting out inefficiencies in our route structure and in our production facilities. So, that will be really important to us. And we think there is certainly ample opportunity there still to go. We've talked about the SmartTruck technology, that's been impactful to us in many ways. But what's also impactful is, as Mike mentioned, our Six Sigma team of professionals, our Engineering professionals, and then layering in with that technology allows us to have a centralized visibility into our operations at a level that we've never had before in the history of the company this technology allows us. So -- and it allows us to maximize our labor, our equipment, ultimately our energy spend. So -- and we're focused on extracting out those inefficiencies, so that we can manage it moving forward. We love when energy goes -- costs go down, but we recognize those markets will move, but we're going to be focused on extracting out those inefficiencies.
Operator: And our next question comes from Heather Balsky from Bank of America. Please go ahead, Heather.
Heather Balsky: Hi. Sorry about that. Thank you for taking my question. And first question with regards to the programmers and non-programmers, as we're further and further out from the COVID period, are you still seeing the shift in demand in terms of more non-programmers looking to outsource, or do you think it's starting to normalize back to pre-COVID trends?
Todd Schneider: Well, Heather, it's a great question. I'll start. Mike, feel free to chime in. We're -- there's various reasons why a prospect would turn into a customer. Going from a no programmer to a customer. One of them is, hey, where we'd like to outsource it, because we're not very good at it or we're not -- we don't have -- we're struggling to staff and we're struggling to find people to manage this. So, that still continues. But there's other reasons. It might be, we don't like the image that we're portraying. We don't like the lack of identification. We don't like the lack of compliance. You can provide them, and we know that they're hygienically clean. So, there's many different motives. One of it might be, hey, we can't staff, and we need help. And we still see that, frankly. And it allows our customers to focus on what's most important to them, taking care of their customers, their patients, their guests, whatever it is, instead of having to manage through these various programs.
Mike Hansen: Heather, the no programmers is still -- we get -- more than 60% of our new business comes from no programmers. Your reference to the pandemic might be, we did certainly, in the early days of the pandemic, see an increase in personal protective equipment and things like hand sanitizer. Those have normalized back to what we would call normal and ongoing levels, so that might be the only change that we had, and back to normal.
Heather Balsky: Thank you. And then, on the margin front, we're just kind of curious, when you think about -- you talked earlier about opportunities for efficiencies and further route productivities, when you think about the source of those savings, how much are just organic Six Sigma efforts, how much is coming from your SAP, and are there still G&K synergy or opportunities that you're kind of benefiting from? Thanks.
Todd Schneider: Heather, it's a good question. We don't really discern the difference between our Six Sigma team, our Engineering team and our Technologies. They all have to work, be orchestrated appropriately to get the efficiencies, so -- and that's exactly what we're doing. So, everybody has to be involved. And that's what produces the great results. As for G&K, yeah, we're -- we now -- we’re I think about six and a half years since we acquired, if my math is correct. So, yeah, I wouldn't say that there's anything left on the bone there.
Operator: And your next question comes from Andy Wittmann from RW Baird. Please go ahead, Andy.
Andy Wittmann: Yeah, great. Thanks. Good morning, and thank you for taking my questions. I guess, I just wanted to ask on the outlook a little bit here, Mike. The second half total revenue guidance is in the 7% range at the midpoint against an organic 9% quarter here. So, a degree of deceleration. I guess that was implicit in your previous guidance as well. But just thought maybe give you a chance to elaborate a little bit more on that, talk about what you're seeing in the macro, if that's just you guys being kind of your normal prudent approach, or if there's something that we should be considering?
Mike Hansen: Andy, I'd lead with it's our normal prudent approach. And when you think about where we are, we've talked a little bit already about growth is still good, momentum is good, and so we like where the business is going. The range for the back half of the year does -- certainly does imply a little bit over 7% at the midpoint, a little over 8% at the high point. We like that range. The cadence is good for us, as you know. But, look, as we look into calendar ‘24, there certainly is a little bit of uncertainty as to what the new economy may bring, what the Fed movements may bring, and so we think it is wise to be prudent as we look out.
Andy Wittmann: Great. That's my only question for today. Have a Merry Christmas, guys.
Todd Schneider: Thank you, Andy.
Operator: And our next question comes from George Tong from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead, George.
George Tong: Hi. Thanks. Good morning. Earlier you mentioned that business momentum was good. Volumes were robust in the quarter. Can you provide more color on overall customer budget trends and customer sentiment, and any changes that you might be seeing in the sales cycle?
Todd Schneider: George, we -- good morning, George. We -- forward-looking, as Mike said, there's always -- we're not trying to prognosticate exactly how our customers will react to the turning of the calendar year, but we're not seeing any change in sales cycles, and we haven't seen a change in our customer base and they're -- how they're reacting to what's going on in the marketplace. So, it's kind of business has been consistent, and it's more what Mike referred to the turn of the calendar year. And we'll see how businesses react coming out of the holidays.
George Tong: Got it. That's helpful. And also you mentioned cross selling was good in the quarter. Can you elaborate more on cross selling trends that you're seeing, in which areas you're seeing most amount of bundling or upsell, cross sell from?
Todd Schneider: Yeah, George. Cross sell is -- it's an important component of our growth, and the nature of it is we're having good success across all of our areas of our business. We're blessed to be in a position where our customers, fortunately, they really like us. They like our relationships. We have people in their businesses on a really frequent basis, mostly on a weekly basis. So they -- and we have -- so that means we have eyes, ears, and minds in their business and we can help. And it doesn't matter to us what a customer might lead with, whatever they're interested in, but then we will quickly pivot and we can help them in many ways. So -- but just the nature of the size of the rental division is such that because there is -- are so many customers there, there's plenty of opportunity for our First Aid and Fire business to cross onto that just because of the numbers there. But nevertheless, it's working quite well across all of our organization. We share leads, we share thoughts, and we make sure that the customer is well taken care of.
Operator: And our next question comes from Tim Mulrooney from William Blair. Please go ahead, Tim.
Tim Mulrooney: Yeah, good morning. I just wanted to ask one question. Pricing now normalized back to the 2% range. That means your organic growth was comprised of approximately seven points of volume. I was just hoping you could dig into that a little bit more as it was a little stronger than I think most of us were expecting. Did you see an uptick in retention? Did you have a strong quarter with that cross sell? Or maybe new account growth and any details would be helpful.
Todd Schneider: Yeah, good morning Tim. So our new business is robust. As I mentioned, retention levels are very good and our cross-sell is very good. And the pricing is still, it's lower than last year. It is higher than historical, but it's certainly getting much closer to historical. So -- but when you -- so when you think about that, it is -- our various inputs to growth are all performing well, and we expect that to continue.
Mike Hansen: And as we talk, we win in a lot of ways. And the momentum in the rental business is still really good. But we also saw in the quarter some really nice acceleration in First Aid and Safety from 11% in the first quarter to 12.7% organically in the second quarter. And we saw some nice improvement in Fire where we went from a little over 14% in the first quarter to 17.8% in the second quarter. So we just see some really good momentum in all of our businesses. And particularly those two had some really nice performance in the second quarter.
Tim Mulrooney: Yeah, I did notice that re-acceleration across both those businesses. That's helpful color. Thanks, guys. Happy holidays.
Todd Schneider: Thank you, Tim. You as well.
Operator: And our next question comes from Andrew Steinerman from JPMorgan Securities. Please go ahead, Andrew.
Andrew Steinerman: Hi. Could you just mention if your ad stops directionally and the uniform rental business was up, down, or flat recently?
Todd Schneider: Good morning, Andrew. Our ad stop metrics are -- have been pretty consistent. We haven't seen much of a change in our customer base. And so I'd say that's how I would describe it. We see still positive trends in our ad stop metrics, but that's pretty consistent as it has been for the last six to twelve months.
Andrew Steinerman: Okay, thank you very much.
Todd Schneider: Yes sir, thank you.
Operator: And our next question comes from Jasper Bibb from Truist Securities. Please go ahead, Jasper.
Jasper Bibb: Hey, good morning guys. You mentioned year-on-year tailwind from energy. But was just hoping to get some additional color on other cost inputs, I guess specifically, labor and materials.
Todd Schneider: Yeah, I'll start, Jasper. Good morning. Our -- we're seeing -- just like you're seeing with inflation in total, we're seeing that come down. It's never coming down as fast as we like, but we are seeing it. Cotton is stabilized. We're seeing freight come down and that's important to us. And the labor market is easier. It's still not easy, but it is easier. So I think that probably the right way to think about it would be as the labor market eases, and that will lessen pressure on wage growth as well.
Jasper Bibb: Thanks. And then I wanted to follow up on first aid. Operating margins there were really strong in the first half. Should we think about these like low 20% levels as sustainable going forward? And would you say there's anything that's changed there that's unlocked another leg of operating margin expansion here today?
Mike Hansen: Sure. Jasper, we have seen some nice performance in that business and I spoke to a few of them where from a margin perspective, first of all, the value that we sell with, nothing is more important than the health and safety of your employees is really still resonating well. And so our growth has been really good in that business. We talked a little bit in the opening comments about sort of the recurring revenue streams of AED rentals, our eyewash stations and our WaterBreak. And these have been great businesses for us. The growth has been really good and the margins are great for us. Many times these are add-on products to existing customers. But in all three of them, we install, and then we have a recurring service program that goes on after that. And again, it leads to really nice stickiness and also nice margins. The other thing that I'll point out is we opened a first aid and safety distribution center a couple years ago and that allows us to source more. It allows us to centralize some of our sourcing, and those kind of things lead to a better product cost, and that again drives down the material cost in our first aid and safety business. So the combination of really good sales mix, really good growth in the business, good sourcing, the one I didn't mention was SmartTruck technology that is also having a benefit there. All of those things are contributing. And so this is not a case of six months of sort of unusual items. This is a little bit of a lot of hard work and execution by our first aid and safety partners to really get this margin going.
Jasper Bibb: Very helpful. Thanks for taking the questions.
Operator: And our next question comes from Faiza Alwy from Deutsche Bank Securities. Please go ahead, Faiza.
Faiza Alwy: Yes, hi, thank you, Todd. So I wanted to follow up on both the first aid business and the fire business. You touched on the first aid a little bit, but curious on what's driving the acceleration, if you could expand on that, both on first aid and fire. And then as we think about your outlook, do you expect this level of growth to sustain looking ahead? And, I know in fire, you talked about an SAP implementation that was happening in this fiscal year. So maybe is that helping the top line? Has that happened? How should we think about margins going forward in that business?
Todd Schneider: Good morning, Faiza. Thanks for the question. We really like the fire business. It's the only business we're in where you legally have to have it. So there is, I'll call it double negative, no program market. Everyone is a programmer. But we are able to cross-sell very well into that market. We're using various technologies that Mike referenced to make sure that we're positioning our partners to be more successful, meaning we use SmartTruck technology in all of our businesses, and that helps us. But we're getting leverage from our growth. And the growth is attractive. And we think it's – there’s certainly -- running a business isn't linear. So there will be ebbs and flows, but we like the long-term outlook for the fire business. That being said, as you mentioned, we are going through an SAP implementation. We certainly -- we haven't even implemented at this point, so we haven't seen any benefits just yet, but we're optimistic about how that can help our business over the coming years.
Mike Hansen: Maybe I'll add two things to the fire, and a little bit of first aid too. The market opportunity in those businesses is really large and our expectation as we've talked about is that those businesses will continue into the future near that double digit type of a place. Again, the market opportunity is really large. One last comment on the SAP, we've not started it. And so as we get into that, which is likely going to be more about next fiscal year, we may see a little bit of pressure in the fire segment because as you can imagine, when you turn -- when you start to go into an SAP conversion, you don't get benefits overnight. It takes a little bit of time. So we'll have some additional costs in ‘25 and certainly then setting up really nice benefits into the future for that business.
Faiza Alwy: Great, thank you. And then if I could just follow up on the macro environment, you made some comments in response to a previous question around just you’re being prudent and there is some uncertainty. Just given sort of how well you are doing [with no programmers] (ph) and the momentum you are seeing in sort of these other businesses, I'm curious if you can give us a framework in terms of how we should think about the impact of macro on your business.
Todd Schneider: Well, I'll start, Faiza, with, our history has been we grow certainly in multiples of GDP and employment growth and you hit it. We are able to sell into no programmers. Even when they're not, let's say, adding people, we can take pressure off of them by managing programs for them. So our new business effort is always really good. But certainly, if we see turns in the economy, we've got to adjust potentially. If we see our customers start to reduce their number of people, we've got to adjust. And so it is prudent for us to sort of think about that as we look into our guidance and into the future of the business.
Faiza Alwy: Understood, thank you so much.
Operator: And our next question comes from Seth Weber from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead, Seth.
Seth Weber: Hey, good morning and happy holidays, guys. I wanted to just go back to the clean room discussion for a minute. If there's any way to frame how we should be thinking about that, new facility openings, and are those facilities higher CapEx relative to a traditional facility? Is there any way to combine facilities or I'm just trying to get a better understanding of this opportunity and what the investment might be for Cintas going forward? Thanks.
Todd Schneider: Yeah, Seth, thank you for the question. As you know, that's a segment of the uniform market. As I mentioned earlier, it does seem more companies over the last decade or so have higher cleaning quality requirements, so we think there's a tailwind there. As far as the CapEx required for a facility like that, you can think of it as very similar to a uniform facility. The only difference I think that you may want to think about is, it serves usually a larger geographic area than we would with a traditional facility. And the reason being is we only have so many of them and they have to cover the customer base. So as a result of that, we do cover a larger geographic area for -- out of each of those facilities.
Seth Weber: Okay, that's helpful. Is there any way for us to think about how many of these facilities you might be opening over the next couple of years relative -- I mean I saw the press release for the Wisconsin facility, but is this order of magnitude ones and twos or could this be much bigger going forward?
Todd Schneider: Yeah, Seth, I wouldn't -- you're not going to see ones and twos coming out every quarter or every year based upon the size of the market. So it certainly won't be anywhere near that pace. But it will be paced based upon the demand from the marketplace. If there's more and more customers that are interested in it, then we'll be prepared to meet that demand.
Seth Weber: Okay, that's helpful, thanks. And then maybe just a quick follow up on the direct, it's nice to see the direct sales business turn positive again in the quarter. Is there any color on whether that's coming more from the service side of your customer base, more of the manufacturing side, and any just detail there or is it just kind of across the board?
Todd Schneider: Good question, Seth. The design collective business, the direct sale portion of it, we've spoken in the past, it's certainly lumpier. And so as far as where that growth is coming from, it's really more national accounts, where we would get it, hospitality, lodging. And when they have rollouts or new allotment programs, you tend to get spikes. And then -- so we love the spikes and then the, what comes after the spike isn't as good, but I wouldn't think about it as a big growth engine for us.
Mike Hansen: Yeah, we typically would say in the low to mid-single-digit growth. So this quarter is sort of in line with that expectation.
Operator: And our next question comes from Stephanie Moore from Jefferies. Please go ahead, Stephanie.
Stephanie Moore: Hi, good morning. Thank you. I wanted to touch a bit on maybe the cross-sell opportunity over time. I think you've provided -- you continue to execute very well on your investments, particularly on the technology front and called out this enhanced visibility that you have. So maybe you can talk about, given some of these investments, what this might mean for cross-selling, meaning the opportunity to add those additional products and kind of continue to further penetrate each existing customer. So kind of how are you balancing the incremental products that you can offer over time? Thanks.
Todd Schneider: Good morning, Stephanie. Well, you can think about it -- we call it cross-sell. There's -- cross-sell is really division to division. There's also upsell which would be, we have products that our customers don't use all of our products, even within the rental division, or the first aid division, and what have you. So, those are all components of growth for us, and we see a significant, massive, frankly, runway in all those areas. So we're trying to position our employee partners to make sure that they're in the right spot and have the right information to help the customer. And then we're also continually, it's part of our corporate culture, is to invest in new products and new services. We're always working on that. And we get those ideas from those customers and then we test them and then we launch them and we're always working on that. It's always been a component of our growth and always will be.
Stephanie Moore: Thank you. Appreciate it.
Todd Schneider: Thank you.
Operator: And our next question comes from Scott Schneeberger from Oppenheimer. Please go ahead, Scott.
Scott Schneeberger: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Happy holidays. I -- my first one, I'm going to delve into the SG&A running low double digits growth, something you did last year as well. And you cited investment in selling resources, management training program, tech, and also some talent acquisition efforts. Just curious, and you guys have said on this call, labor is getting better but still a little tough. Could you elaborate on the labor aspect and kind of what you guys are doing pushing the selling? And then also curious about the tech aspect. Maybe you've already covered it in the call if that's what you meant, but just wondering if there's anything extra there? Thanks.
Todd Schneider: Yeah. Good morning, Scott. We’re -- the items that you mentioned, they're all really important to us. We are -- there's not one that I would call out, but I would think about it this way. We think the future's really bright and we want to invest for the future. We know we need the talent acquisition team to be attracting the very best talent. The management trainee programs are leaders of the future, and we think they are a critical pipeline, and we're going to need those leaders. And then the selling resources are, we see the -- it looks, we think the future's bright with our, how many customers we have, what the size of the market is. I mentioned 1 million customers, about 16 million businesses. So that's all great. And then you kind of wrap it all with technology, because technology will, we want to make it easier to do business with us, and we want to leverage technology to make our partners more successful. Point them in the right direction, give them the right tools in their toolbox to spend their time in the right spots, but also to make it easier for the customer to buy, easier to do business with in totality.
Scott Schneeberger: Great, thanks, appreciate that. And then, not a lot of acquisition activity in the quarter, but there was some, and there was a good amount in the first quarter. I remember you saying it was across all businesses, but we didn't hit it up too much last quarter. Could you talk about what it is that you're acquiring and clearly across segments, but what the strategies have been there? Thanks.
Mike Hansen: Sure, not a lot of change in the strategy, Scott, and that is we love rental tuck-in opportunities and we've made a number of those this year. And as you can imagine, when we do that in a marketplace, we add immediate capacity utilization improvement, route density, and so those things really help us in the rental business. So we've made some of those. We certainly have made some first aid acquisitions, and we've made fire acquisitions. Again, the dynamic is similar in all three of these. These are really nice tuck-in opportunities that just strengthen our business in the local markets in which we acquire them, and we'll continue to look for those opportunities as best we can.
Todd Schneider: One thing I might add is, to Mike's point, we get synergies. It helps us with density, helps us with capacity utilization, allows us to spend more time with the customers. So all that's valuable, but in each of the businesses, depending upon the business we acquire. But normally when we make an acquisition in rental, first aid, or fire, we're able to provide an offering to that customer base that's broader than what they had in the past. So the rental waiver broader offering than most companies out there, certainly in the first aid we do as well. And depending upon the [fire] (ph) acquisition, that's very consistent. Separate from, then we can cross sell. So it adds nice value.
Operator: And our next question comes from Shlomo Rosenbaum from Stifel. Please go ahead, Shlomo. Shlomo, is you line muted?
Shlomo Rosenbaum: Sorry, my line was muted. This is a question basically for Mike, just a little bit going through some of the technical items in the quarter. Receivables days were up two days sequentially. I was wondering if there was a lot of business that came in at the end of the quarter. Are you seeing any changing patterns in what clients are paying or any other factors in that because the last time we saw 48 days was during COVID.
Mike Hansen: Shlomo, when our quarters end on a holiday and it seems like too many of them do, it does create a little bit of disruption in terms of the ability to collect the mail, the application. We have seen maybe just a touch of slowing in the AR, but we've not seen any, I'll say deterioration from the standpoint of additional write-offs. But we did see a little bit of slowing, and the Thanksgiving holiday can usually contribute to that.
Shlomo Rosenbaum: Okay. Then in the OPM, the operating margin, the other unit was up very nicely sequentially, even though there's one less day sequentially in the quarter. Could you just give us some of the mechanics or tell us just what's going on on the ground over there? It's increasing the margin very nicely and is that something that we should expect to continue at kind of that 16% level?
Mike Hansen: Well we -- certainly the revenue growth is powerful in all of our businesses and when we see some really nice revenue growth, that's important. The other thing that I would say is you know the uniform direct sale business went from a negative 2.7% in terms of revenue growth to 4.7%. And that is important for operating margins too. So we did see some nice improvement there in the direct sale. Nothing I would say that is noteworthy other than, again, some nice acceleration in the revenue.
Operator: And our next question comes from Leo Carrington from Citigroup. Please go ahead, Leo.
Leo Carrington: Thank you, and good morning. If I could ask a follow up on that point around the one-off or the cost that you called out in Q2 around current acquisition, training, technology. Were you calling them out to any of these one-off increases in nature or more to highlight where the spend is? And then in terms of the underlying margins and drop through in Q2 on your organic growth, do you see that as sustainable when you factor in the additional investment this quarter?
Mike Hansen: Well, Leo, I’ll start with, we call them out because we think it's important to make sure that our investors understand that we are looking at the long term and we want to continue to invest in the business. And those investments are really important and they set up, let's say, more penetration opportunities, more cross-sell opportunities, but also productivity improvements, capacity utilization opportunities. In these cases, we wanted to call them out to show that, look, we're focused on the long-term and we're going to continue in the business. As Todd said a couple times, the future is bright for us and we want to make sure that we take advantage of that bright future by investing in the business and the call outs were really more about that. The future is bright. In the quarter, we had incremental margins of 27%. Look, our expectation is that we're going to be in the 20% to 30% range going forward. We recognize that when we're sitting at 21%, they need to be in the higher level of that range. And we think that’s -- that we can continue to do that. And when we talk about things like SAP and technology and other investments, and by the way, we're able to get 27% even when we're investing in the business. But we give those to say we're setting up those future margin and revenue opportunities. It's important for us to, I think, communicate that.
Leo Carrington: Very clear. Thank you.
Operator: And our next question comes from Toni Kaplan from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead, Toni.
Toni Kaplan: Thanks very much. You mentioned the success that you've had with the branded products earlier, particularly with Carhartt and Chef Works. Could you just remind us if these are exclusive relationships and how long the relationships are for and then are there any other areas that could benefit from branded products or equipment that you could offer as well?
Todd Schneider: Good morning, Toni, thank you for the question. So we've had a long standing relationship with Carhartt and Chef Works, and we are the exclusive licensees for those folks, for those companies on the rental programs. And so we work with them to design products that the end users want, want to wear, and -- but also that goes very well through our processing systems. So that's all very important to us. As far as, we don't get into contractual arrangements with them, but I can tell you this. We love products that our end users are, that get excited about wearing them. And Carhartt and Chef Works are two great examples of that, in great companies, great brands, great products. And as far as are there other opportunities, we're constantly looking for that. And we spend a lot of time with our customers and with our working partners to talk about that and to see where those opportunities do come from. But those are two great relationships, long-standing relationships that are really important to us.
Toni Kaplan: Yep, terrific. And maybe if you could just give us your latest thoughts on potential international expansion, that'd be great. Thanks.
Todd Schneider: I'd say, similar to products, we're always looking at those types of opportunities. We certainly know, stay in contact with the people that are running those businesses. But the great news is we don't have to do that to -- in order to be really, really successful in the future. We look at it and say there's, again, we're servicing about 1 million businesses. There's 16 million businesses in US and Canada. Here's what's really exciting is by the time we get to 2 million customers, there will be more than 16 million businesses in the US and Canada. So that's kind of a bummer if you're running a race but it's really exciting if you're running a business because once we get to the 2 mile mark, the race is going to be extended. So that's separate from -- we're going to have more products and services over the coming year. So all that being said is, we continue to watch it, we evaluate it, we look for the right opportunity, and if that opportunity presents itself, then we will seize it, but it's certainly not -- it's not required in order for us to be successful in the future.
Operator: And at this time, there are no further questions. I'd like to turn the call back over to Jared Mattingley to close out the call.
Jared Mattingley: Thank you for joining us this morning. We will issue our third quarter of fiscal ‘24 financial results in March. We look forward to speaking with you again at that time.
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2024 Q1  (2023-09-26 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Cintas Corporation Announces Fiscal 2024 First Quarter Earnings Release Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Jared Mattingley, Vice President, Treasurer and Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
Jared Mattingley: Thank you for joining us. With me is Todd Schneider, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Mike Hansen, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, who will discuss our fiscal 2024 first quarter results. After our commentary, we will open the call to questions from analysts.  The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a safe harbor from civil litigation for forward-looking statements. This conference call contains forward-looking statements that reflect the company's current views as to future events and financial performance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those we may discuss. I refer you to the discussion on these points contained in our most recent filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. I'll now turn the call over to Todd.
Todd Schneider: Thank you, Jared. We are pleased with our start to fiscal year 2024. First quarter total revenue grew 8.1% to $2.34 billion. Each of our businesses continue to execute at a high level. The benefits of our strong volume growth and revenue flow through to our bottom line. Operating income margin increased 110 basis points to an all-time high of 21.4%, and diluted EPS grew 9.1% to $3.70.  I thank our employees, whom we call partners, for their continued focus on our customers, our shareholders and each other. Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segment revenue for the first quarter of fiscal '24 was $1.83 billion compared to $1.7 billion last year. Their organic revenue growth rate was 7.6%. While price increases moved near historical levels, revenue growth continues to be driven mostly from increased volume. Our sales force continues to add new customers and penetrate and cross-sell our existing customer base. Businesses prioritize all we provide, including image, safety, cleanliness and compliance. Our First Aid and Safety Services operating segment revenue for the first quarter was $260.7 million compared to $234.2 million last year. The organic revenue growth rate was 11%. Our value proposition continues to resonate in our First Aid and Safety Services operating segment. Health and safety of employees remains top of mind.  We provide businesses with access to quick and effective products and services that promote health and well-being in the workplace. Our Fire Protection Services and Uniform Direct Sale businesses are reported in the All Other segment. All Other revenue was $254.8 million compared to $234.5 million last year.  The Fire business revenue was $174.3 million, and their organic revenue growth rate was 14.2%. The Uniform Direct Sale business revenue was $80.5 million which was down 2.7% organically compared to last year. Now before I turn the call over to Mike to provide details of our first quarter results, I'll provide our updated financial expectations for our fiscal year. We are increasing our financial guidance. We are raising our annual revenue expectations from a range of $9.35 billion to $9.5 billion to a range of $9.4 billion to $9.52 billion, a total growth rate of 6.6% to 8%. Also, we are raising our annual diluted EPS expectations from a range of $13.85 to $14.35 to a range of $14 to $14.45, a growth rate of 7.8% to 11.2%. Mike?
Michael Hansen: Thanks, Todd, and good morning. Our fiscal 2024 first quarter revenue was $2.34 billion compared to $2.17 billion last year. The organic revenue growth rate, adjusted for acquisitions and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations was 8.1%. Gross margin for the first quarter of fiscal '24 was $1.14 billion compared to $1.03 billion last year, an increase of 11%.  Gross margin as a percent of revenue was an all-time high of 48.7% for the first quarter of fiscal '24, compared to 47.5% last year, an increase of 120 basis points. Strong volume growth and continued operational efficiencies helped generate this record gross margin. Energy expenses comprised of gasoline, natural gas and electricity were a tailwind, decreasing 50 basis points from last year.  Please keep in mind that some of the energy benefit is the result of efficiencies we've created with our proprietary SmartTruck technology. Certainly, we've also seen a benefit from a drop in prices at the pump compared to a year ago. Gross margin percentage by business was 48.1% for Uniform Rental and Facility Services, 55.9% for First Aid and Safety Services, 49% for Fire Protection Services and 38.7% for Uniform Direct Sale. Operating income of $500.6 million compared to $440.1 million last year. Operating income as a percentage of revenue was 21.4% in the first quarter of fiscal '24 compared to 20.3% in last year's first quarter, an increase of 110 basis points. Our effective tax rate for the first quarter was 19.2% compared to 14.8% last year.  The tax rates in both quarters were impacted by certain discrete items, primarily the tax accounting impact for stock-based compensation. Net income for the first quarter was $385.1 million compared to $351.7 million last year. This year's first quarter diluted EPS of $3.70 compared to $3.39 last year, an increase of 9.1%.  Cash flow remains strong. Net cash provided by operating activities in the first quarter grew 13% over the prior year. On September 15, we paid shareholders $138.3 million in quarterly dividends, an increase of 17.8% from the amount paid the previous September. Todd provided our annual financial guidance. Related to the guidance, please note the following: fiscal '24 interest expense is expected to be $98 million compared to $109.5 million in fiscal '23, predominantly as a result of lower variable rate debt; our fiscal '24 effective tax rate is expected to be 21.3%. This compares to a rate of 20.4% in fiscal '23.  The higher effective tax rate negatively impacts fiscal '24 EPS guidance by about $0.16 and diluted EPS growth by about 120 basis points. Our financial guidance does not include the impact of any future share buybacks. Guidance includes the impact of having one more workday in fiscal '24 compared to fiscal '23. This extra workday comes in our fiscal third quarter. Jared?
Jared Mattingley: That concludes our prepared remarks. Now we are happy to answer questions from the analysts. Please ask just one question and a single follow up if needed. Thank you.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. And our first question comes from Faiza Alwy from Deutsche Bank.
Faiza Alwy: I wanted to see if you could provide a bit more color on the new business environment. And if you've noticed any change in terms of the macro environment. Certainly, you guys are talking to your customers every day. So just a bit more perspective around what you're seeing out there in the marketplace.
Todd Schneider: Great. Yes, our new business pipeline is quite good. We love the state of our sales organization, the focus that they have, the scope. And so new business is quite good, and that's a big driver of our growth that you're seeing and we see that continuing. As far as macro environment, it is -- we haven't seen any real change in our customers' behavior, I would say, since we reported last.  So it's pretty consistent with what we have seen over the past few quarters. And we are watching it very, very closely and monitoring it as we move forward.
Operator: Our next question comes from Manav Patnaik from Barclays.
Manav Patnaik: I just wanted to see if you could give us a little more color, I think, in terms of the pricing strategy and then also the strong volume growth. So I think you said pricing is back to historical levels. So I'm guessing that's down in that low single-digit camp versus almost every other company talking about still, I guess, pricing higher than above and average. So it just maybe the first question is just how do we think about your pricing strategy here?
Todd Schneider: Yes, it is certainly closer to historical levels, and we like that. That's, we think, appropriate based upon our cost inputs. But we're very proud of the fact that we're growing our business attractively, and we think we can continue this based upon new business being robust and our customer retention levels, being very good as well.  And we're seeing that in our customer satisfaction scores as well. And then the status of our customers is -- they're continuing on in the operating environment as they have in the past. So we like where we're positioned. We like the momentum in our business, and we like how we're growing it as well, and we think it's -- it bodes well for the future.
Michael Hansen: Manav, I might just add -- Manav, I might just add to that, you asked about our pricing strategy. And as we've talked in the past, our goal is operating margin improvement, right? And pricing can be a lever within that, but we have other levers. It's not the only way for us to improve margins.  And so as we think about the operating margin strategy of increasing, we've got a lot of good things going on. And this is a great quarter that shows where pricing is sort of returning back to that historical level. We still increased margins quite nicely even to record levels. And again, it's just that pricing is a part of that strategy.
Manav Patnaik: Yes, that make sense. That's quite impressive. And then maybe just on the strong volume growth. Could you just help provide some color on how much of that is new business, cross-selling, maybe share gains? Any color around that?
Todd Schneider: Yes. Good question, Manav. I mean, it's everything. As I mentioned, our new is quite good. Our retention levels, we're very happy with, and we're cross-selling. And we've -- we're continuing to make good progress there. We're never satisfied. But our value proposition is resonating with our customers, and we're trying to make it easier to do business with us through various technologies. And I think it's showing up in our results, and we're again bullish.
Operator: And our next question comes from Josh Chan from UBS.
Joshua Chan: I guess could I ask about inflation and what you're seeing across your different cost buckets, labor, energy, material? And how you expect that to kind of transpire over the coming quarters as well?
Todd Schneider: Yes, I'll start, and Mike wants to chime in as well. Yes, so what we're seeing from an input cost standpoint, labor is still higher than historical. But to Mike's point earlier, we're finding ways to improve operating margin in that environment still. And part of it is because productivity is quite attractive.  And we're trying to position our employee partners so that they can be more successful in the marketplace, which is good for them and it's good for ourselves. And obviously, with that retention levels of our employee partners being much back -- very close to historical levels. That's good for our customers as well.  Other input costs, you saw where energy was down year over prior. That is really a Q1 subject because if you recall last year, the price at the pump was very high. And so we got a little bit of a tailwind there. But we think that will be pretty muted through the balance of the fiscal year.  And then last, material costs. Our global supply chain team is doing one heck of a job in trying to make sure that we're well positioned to have very competitive prices and access to all that product. And we've spoken in the past about how a very small percentage of our products are single sourced. So that positions us well as far as having access to product, but also being giving them at very competitive rates.
Joshua Chan: And I guess for my follow-up, could you talk about what your CapEx expectations are this year and kind of the types of projects that you're investing in?
Michael Hansen: Sure. We did see a little bit of an increase in CapEx in Q1. We are -- as we've talked, we are in the midst of implementing SAP for our Fire Protection business and that adds a little bit of CapEx. In the first quarter, we also saw -- over the last couple of years, supply chains, our vendors have had some disruption in their ability to deliver trucks being the best example.  And in the first quarter, we saw a little bit of a catch-up in terms of us receiving more of those trucks. And so we saw a bit of an increase there too in the first quarter. I expect for the year that we're going to likely be right around 4%. Longer term, we still believe 3.5% to 4%. But because of SAP and sort of that catch-up might be a little closer to 4% this year.
Operator: And our next question comes from Heather Balsky from Bank of America.
Heather Balsky: I was hoping, first, you could talk about your exposure to the auto sector and any exposure you may have to, I guess, some of the current disruption? And then two, if you could talk about through the end markets, are there any areas where just in this macro, you're seeing softness and areas where you're seeing strength would be great?
Todd Schneider: Heather. Yes, we're certainly watching what's going on with the auto worker strike, but it is not affecting us in any material way whatsoever. We have a very broad-based customer base. And as a result of that, it's not affecting us to any material degree whatsoever.  And keeping in mind that we have no one customer that's greater than 1% of our revenue and no even sector that's greater than 10% for 3-digit NAICS codes. So that helps us and insulates us a bit from all that. As far as the macro environment, it really -- it varies based upon the sector, geography, whether they're goods producing or services providing. But the labor market is a little easier, but still not easy.  And you see that through the -- what we've -- what we're reading with the job openings, still 9.5 million job openings. And that affects our customer base from a standpoint of them trying to attract and retain people. We would love to see those jobs filled because we think that would be really good for our customers and for the economy in general.
Operator: And our next question comes from Justin Hauke from RW Baird.
Justin Hauke: I wanted to ask about the First Aid margins because it kind of sustainably been higher than they have been historically and really more comparable to the Uniform Rental and the Facility Services segment. And I guess the question is, I mean, for years, that was kind of a scale business where you were building it out and it had lower margins. Are you at the point now where like that business has reached a point where it has very comparable margin sustainably to the Uniform Rental business?
Todd Schneider: Yes, we really like the First Aid business. I mean it's -- that it resonates with our customer base. They -- a strong value proposition is helping our revenue growth. The mix has returned closer to historical with First Aid and Safety. And Justin, just like our other businesses, we're using various technologies to extract inefficiencies out of our business.  And there's certainly no exception to that. I mentioned that our global supply chain team has done -- doing a great job in sourcing product, and we're benefiting from sourcing there. But yes, we see -- certainly, there is -- running a business is not linear. But that being said, we certainly think that gross margins in excess of 50 are sustainable in that business.
Justin Hauke: Okay. Great. And then I guess the last one is kind of more procedural, I guess. But you did -- it looks like on the cash flow about $56 million spending on acquisitions in the quarter, which is a little bit higher than what you guys typically do. Do you have any comments on kind of where that was, where we should see the revenue flow from it?
Todd Schneider: Well, I'll start, and Mike can chime in. The -- Justin, as you know, we love leveraging our balance sheet for M&A. And we think it's a great use of cash, and we're very happy with the fact that we were able to deploy some of the cash to leverage that opportunity. And we are acquisitive in all 3 of our operating segments that are route-based. And we made acquisitions in all 3, so -- in Q1. So we're pleased with that, and we think that will -- is a great opportunity for us to bring those customers into the fold, those partners, those employee partners into the fold and provide more value and cross-sell to those customers that are now part of Cintas.
Operator: And our next question comes from George Tong from Goldman Sachs.
George Tong: In the past, you've talked about strong demand from the health care, education and government verticals in driving Uniform Rental's growth. Can you discuss the latest trends you're seeing in these end markets and what's fueling the growth?
Todd Schneider: Yes, those are 3 great verticals for us. I mean, they're 3 great segments of the North American economy. And so, yes, we're still seeing outsized growth in those markets. And as we've chatted about in the past, it's more than just a sales effort. We've organized around them. We've got products for them. We've got technologies for them.  And that is resonating with that customer base. So we think we've chosen them quite well, and there's plenty of runway in all of them. So we're, again, quite bullish on the future of those segments.
George Tong: Got it. And then with respect to margins, your gross margins expanded 60 bps year-over-year in your Uniform segment. Most of that appears to be driven by lower energy costs. Can you discuss puts and takes around Uniform gross margins in the quarter and opportunities for additional margin expansion over the remainder of this year that comes above and beyond tailwinds you're seeing from lower energy costs?
Todd Schneider: Yes. George, we're -- the nature of the math around our businesses, the Rental business is obviously a large percentage of it. And we're guiding towards margin expansion for the year. And we do not see energy being a tailwind for the balance of the year.  So we expect margin expansion based upon certainly leverage on revenue growth, that's going to be helpful. But we're extracting those inefficiencies out of our business. And as Mike mentioned earlier, we're proud of the fact that pricing is returning back to historical levels, but we're still able to grow operating margin -- gross margin and operating margin at very attractive levels and to levels that are all-time highs. So that's part of our plan. And our team is actually treating at a very high level, and we expect that, that will continue.
Michael Hansen: George, I might just reiterate what I mentioned in the prepared remarks that keeping in mind that the energy benefit that we are getting is partly because we are working really hard at things like our SmartTruck initiative. So in other words, as we continue to grow really nicely with volumes, we don't need to add as many routes and trucks as we have in the past, and that creates then better fuel efficiency, if you will, throughout our network. And so that's a -- it is a proactive initiative to get energy down. And one of those proactive ways is through that SmartTruck technology.
Todd Schneider: And Mike, I might add that when we extract those inefficiencies out, that's better for our customers because we're able to spend more time in front of them instead of on the road. It's certainly better for our partners, our employee partners because it makes them that much more productive, and that's good for them and our organization.  And it's really good for the environment. So we think -- let's say there's a lot of boxes checked there, and we've worked hard on that technology over the years, and it's showing up. And it's benefiting not just the P&L in a more simplistic fashion, but in many ways.
Operator: Our next question comes from Tim Mulrooney from William Blair.
Samuel Kusswurm: This is Sam Kusswurm on for Tim. I guess I want to start with another health care question here. But as it relates to your health care clients, you've talked a lot about the opportunity here, especially as more no programmers convert. But I guess I'd like to know for those health care operators who already use a service partner, what do you think your penetration rate is? And how might that compare to some of your other customer verticals?
Todd Schneider: Sam, that's a good question. I don't have that in front of me. But we know this. We're in the early innings with health care. And we're coming up with more products and services that they find attractive. And that's part of our culture. We will enter into a business. But then we get out from behind our desk and we go spend time with our customers.  And when we find that we find the answers to what they are most interested in by speaking to them, and our customers and our employee partners. And we're hearing from them on various areas where we can help them, and we're taking action there. So again, a very long runway in that vertical, and that's again part of our culture and will be part of how we go to market moving forward.
Samuel Kusswurm: Got you. Appreciate it. Maybe just another quick one on the margins. I see SG&A as a percentage of sales picked up again in the quarter compared to last year. I guess I'm wondering if there was any variable costs like your insurance expenses? Or if it was mainly some of the selling and branding investments you've talked about previously? Maybe you could just help break that out for us a little more.
Michael Hansen: Nothing unusual in the quarter. We did see the -- we talked in the fourth quarter about some claims getting higher, but not structural. We saw those come back down to something more normal. But as it relates to the quarter, just some puts and takes, nothing of any significance. Our goal is to continue to leverage particularly the G&A piece of that, and we're going to continue to work at that.
Operator: And our next question comes from Andrew Steinerman from JPMorgan Securities.
Andrew Steinerman: I wanted to talk to you about incremental margins, which were super strong in the quarter and last quarter on a year-over-year basis. I surely know, Cintas historically has targeted 20% to 30% as a range for incremental margins. But kind of given where we are right now, it definitely feels like that kind of low end of the range, the 20%, might not be as appropriate. And so my question is, has your medium-term range for incremental margins been creeping up?
Todd Schneider: Yes. 20% to 30% is our target. We -- Q1 was a very attractive incremental margins. And there's always puts and takes in every quarter as I mentioned. Running a business is not linear. But we will expect that we will be in that 20% to 30% range. I certainly like higher in the range than lower. And we are -- and I think our guide speaks to where attractive margin improvement for the year as well.
Operator: And our next question comes from Seth Weber from Wells Fargo.
Seth Weber: I wanted to ask just about the small tick down in Uniform Direct Sales organic growth here in the quarter. It's the first, I think, decline that we've seen there in a while. I know the comp was hard. Is there anything else that you'd call out there for that business?
Todd Schneider: Certainly, what we have seen outstanding performance from that business over the past really 2 years. And -- but it is -- as we've spoken about in the past, the Uniform Direct Sale business tends to be a little bit lumpier based upon rollouts of large programs, whether it's hospitality or a Fortune 1000-type customer. So nothing more than that. We still are bullish on the future of that business and for the year and moving forward.
Seth Weber: Do you think, Todd, do you think that business could be up for the year? Or do you think that's kind of flattish or down?
Todd Schneider: I would suspect -- well, we expect all of our businesses to grow. So I would suspect that we would see that up. But just the comps are set with the level of what we dealt with hospitality in that vertical, in Fortune 1000, the level of where employees came back so strongly. I wouldn't suspect that you'll see anywhere near the level of growth that we've seen in the last couple of years, but we expect it to grow.
Michael Hansen: Seth, I might point out that the last 2 years have -- they have been a significant recapture of what we sort of lost in that pandemic period of time. In our fiscal '22, that business grew organically over 50%; in fiscal '23, it was almost 30%. So there was a lot of recapture going on, but keep in mind that our longer-term goal for that business, Todd expects it to grow, but it's probably more of a low single-digit to mid-single-digit grower in our portfolio.
Seth Weber: Right. Okay. Understood. And then maybe just on the First Aid and Safety business, given the margin strength that you're seeing there, can you talk about are you seeing any incremental competition in that space? Are you seeing any bigger players trying to get into that space or just smaller regional players getting more active?
Todd Schneider: Yes. Good question, Seth. Certainly, it's a very competitive marketplace and First Aid products, Safety products, there is hundreds of competitors out there. There's many, many ways to procure those products, whether it be van delivered or e-commerce, you name it, we see it there.  But as a result of that, it's a very competitive market. And we've talked about the health and safety of employees being the #1 item that businesses are focused on. And when that occurs, there's certainly -- it attracts plenty of people into the marketplace because the value proposition of taking great care of employees is resonating with folks. And so yes, it's a very competitive environment, and I'm sure it will continue to be.
Operator: And our next question comes from Stephanie Moore from Jefferies.
Stephanie Moore: Actually, maybe continuing on that last question there. Could you talk a little bit about what you're seeing in terms of the competitive landscape and your more core Uniform ancillary product segment? As you continue to win new business, where are you seeing the majority of that new business coming from? Is it nonprogrammers, some of the regional players, larger players? Any color there would be helpful.
Todd Schneider: So I've been in the Uniform Rental and Facility Services business my entire career, 34 years. It's been highly competitive my entire career, and I'm sure it will continue to be that way. But we haven't seen a change in the landscape. It's always really competitive. So that being said, we -- our sales organization is highly skilled. And what we know is, there is a massive opportunity with the no program market.  And for years, our organization has been focused on expanding the pie, and they are continuing to do exactly that. And when we talk about expanding the pie, they are -- those employees at a no programmer mean -- they're wearing garments, right? It's -- but they are -- they may be buying it themselves. They may be buying it through a catalog, it might be a centralized program for the company, but they're purchasing them.  And then we provide more value to them with the products and services that we offer, whether they're unique products like Carhartt or Chef Works or Landau, great branded programs. But the no-program market is really attractive for us, and we find that market sees really good value in what we're offering. So we're focused on expanding that high, and that will continue.
Stephanie Moore: Got it. And just a follow-up, if I may. You noted that retention level continue to be really high. I'm just curious, in this current environment, what do you think is resonating the most with your customers that your sales force kind of goes in? Is it kind of the willingness to work with them on price? Is it the product offering, your scale? I'd love to just get your thoughts on what do you think is resonating the most to drive such a nice retention level.
Todd Schneider: Yes. Great question, Stephanie. That's a very complicated answer because there's so many inputs to it. But it starts with being highly focused on taking incredibly good care of our customers and attracting and retaining the very best people. But then giving them product, services, tools so that they can not only have the intent to take great care of our customers, but do just exactly that.  So -- and that gets into great products that I mentioned earlier, the service -- focus that we -- or the tools that we're making that make it easier to do business with us. But it gets down to our people and positioning them to take a really, really good care of our customers and then executing on that. And they're executing at a really high level.  And we talk often about when markets -- when things are challenging, when it's hard to attract people, when it's hard to procure products, when it's hard to operate in the marketplace, it gives us a chance to shine. And our culture is shining through. And our people are doing one heck of a job in taking care of our customers.
Operator: And our next question comes from Scott Schneeberger from Oppenheimer.
Scott Schneeberger: Guys, you've certainly -- it sounds like you really want to speak to a SmartTruck because that's been going very well. I was hoping you could add also on automation to facilities. And where I'm going here, just kind of an update on where I'm going here is it sounds like you've been getting nice efficiencies and you still see more room to run.  Is there any quantification you can put on that? I know you're looking for margins up this year overall business. But maybe just help us get an idea of what's at play there and how much you can do.
Todd Schneider: Scott, I'll start. Mike, if you would like to chime in there. We're deploying technology, and you can call it automation, you can call it technology, you can call it digital. We're deploying that across all of our businesses and across all areas of our business as well, and we've been focused on that for years.  But there certainly is -- we're seeing some real benefits there with our investment with SAP, with our investments -- our partnerships with Google and with Verizon. And it's -- those are -- we see that there's plenty of opportunities still to come there to improve in the efficiencies of our business and to automate certain functions.  And we call it -- make it easier for our customers to do business and make it easier for our employee partners to take great care of our customers. The more we can invest there, we think it's an incredibly good use of our balance sheet because it positions us well for not just the short term, but the long term as well.
Michael Hansen: Yes. There are so many details that go into all of the things that Todd just talked about, that it's really hard to put a number on it. Our goal is, as you've heard us say, is continue to improve margins. We have a number of different levers to do so. Our goal is incrementals in that 20% to 30% range, recognizing we're at the bottom of that range today.  But it's hard to put a specific number on what's left because we're always working on what's -- what more can we do. And there are so many details and so many different projects we're working on. So our guide certainly does imply for continued margin improvement over last year, and that's the way we think about it.
Scott Schneeberger: Great. Appreciate that. The -- you just referenced SAP, and you mentioned CapEx may be high end of the range this year, working on some implementation in the Fire segment. Could you just speak to -- would that have a tail to next year? How much more -- I mean, are we going to see SAP projects for years to come? Just a sense of what you have on the spend side going forward.
Michael Hansen: From a Fire perspective, the -- we are in the midst of the early innings of the implementation. And so we'll see some pressure in the Fire margins a little bit this year and a little bit next year. The synergies and the benefits don't come overnight. It's not a flip of the switch.  And so we -- just like we did with the Rental business and the First Aid business before that, we need to get onto the platform. It takes a little bit of time to get really good at using the platform, and then we really start to see the benefits accelerate just like we have in First Aid and Rental. Now that's a -- Fire is a smaller part of our business, but we certainly expect that those benefits will come.  As it relates to SAP, SAP is not -- it's a journey, right? And we are -- even though we are on SAP and will be for most of our business after the Fire Protection business gets on, there are constant things to learn from SAP. There are new initiatives in working with SAP and Google and Verizon that create new and different things. And so we look at this -- I think Todd's talked about it as one of his largest initiatives in terms of technology.  And it's a journey. It's not a flip of the switch. We turn on new systems here and there. So we're in the midst of that. We'll continue to invest in all of that. And our expectation is, it's going to continue to bring benefits into the future.
Todd Schneider: Scott, to expand upon what Mike said, it is a journey. But when you're on that journey, there is benefits -- a long, long tail of benefits as well. And so we will continue to invest appropriately. We have relationships at a very high level in each of those organizations, and it's going to bear fruit for us. And that's part of our plan.  It's not easy. It's very challenging to go through these processes. But our team has shown the wherewithal to not only digest the change, but then leverage the opportunities that are in front of them.
Operator: And our next question comes from Shlomo Rosenbaum.
Shlomo Rosenbaum: Todd, maybe you can just peel the onion back a little bit more on that margin on the First Aid side? I know you pointed to some sourcing and stuff like that. But it seems like the business has gone from mid-teens to low 20s in the course of the year. And I was wondering if there -- is there something to do with the route optimization?  Is it mix related, pricing? Anything else that operationally made such a significant difference? And after that, I have just a question on the labor environment for you guys yourselves? Are you -- is it easier for you guys to source people for what you need?
Todd Schneider: Good question, Shlomo. Yes. Again, we love the First Aid business. But we're -- there's so many inputs to margin expansion, and we're leveraging them all. It starts with really good revenue growth, and we're seeing that. And that's in a big way because the value proposition is resonating, the products, the services that we offer in the marketplace, trying to attract and retain people is still challenging.  And people are trying to -- customers are trying to take really good care of their people. And we're benefiting from that and we're helping them accomplish exactly that. We're helping them run their business better. So that's helpful. The mix, as you know, has -- back during the pandemic, it was certainly so much more focused on safety products, a lot of clubs and a lot of sanitizer and those types of items.  And that has abated a bit, and the mix is back focused on First Aid and those types of products, more recurring revenue type. And yes, we are absolutely leveraging technology to make it easier to do business, but also to position our partners, our employee partners to provide more value to our customers.  And SmartTruck is a component of that. We did have a little bit of energy tailwind, 40 basis points. But as Mike cited earlier, not all that's because of the price at the pump. That is also because we are extracting the inefficiencies out. And we always talk around here about how we don't make money when the wheels are moving. We make money when the wheels stop.  That's better for our customers, that's better for our employee partners. And all that is contributing. And then lastly, as I mentioned, our supply chain team has done a great job. They are leveraging the opportunities there. The larger we get in that business, the more leverage they have, and they're executing at a high level.  And -- so many inputs that are contributing to it, and -- but the -- what's really encouraging is, we see those having an opportunity to continue in the future. So certainly, no event is more of a process.
Shlomo Rosenbaum: And then just the labor environment on your own, like for the people that you're sourcing?
Todd Schneider: Yes. Pardon me. So from a labor standpoint, yes. As I mentioned earlier, it is easier, but not easy. And we are looking for great people. We want to hire not only people that are employed somewhere else, but happily employed, which is very challenging. And -- but we think we have a great employee value proposition as well.  And so we're highly focused on that. So -- but yes, easier than it was a year ago. But Shlomo, throughout my career, it's always been challenging. It's a little bit more challenging than it has been historically, but not what it once was a year ago or so.
Operator: And our next question comes from Kartik Mehta from Northcoast Research.
Kartik Mehta: I know there's a lot of questions and maybe thoughts on what happens to new sales. And I'm wondering, if you go back to kind of 2008, 2009 and hopefully never have that recession again. But if you look at new sales back then, how did Cintas perform for new sales? And any lessons from that you would take as we move forward?
Todd Schneider: Yes, Kartik. First of all, we're a really different company today than we were in 2008, 2009. We have a much more diversified customer base. We're now -- today 70% of our customers are service is providing, 30% are goods producing. We have significant verticals that we didn't have as well, health care, education, government.  So we think we're really well positioned for whenever the next recession is. And I remember '08, '09 because I was running the sales organization back then. And our value propositions still resonated with people, and we still sold new business. And we did so at attractive rates. As I mentioned, it's not always are we asking for new money. Sometimes it's just a redirection of those from somewhere else to us, not only in a -- maybe a direct competitor standpoint, but also they're purchasing clothing, they're purchasing items to take care of the facilities. So we think we're well positioned. I might also mention, you didn't ask specifically about it, but we love having a pristine balance sheet. And we think whenever the next recession is that might open up opportunities for us. And just the fact that we've -- our organization is focused on fighting through whatever the economic environment is, taking great care of our customers, taking great care of our employee partners.  And we've grown sales in 52 of the last 54 years. And we suspect that whatever the economic environment is, we believe we're going to be successful in it.
Michael Hansen: Kartik, I might add, Todd might be a little modest. He was running that organization. It was a difficult environment, and he and the sales team exceeded their internal goals and really continued to show that value even in tough times, as Todd mentioned. And as he also talked about, our customer base is quite a bit broader than it was back then, and our sales team is a little bit different.  But the really good news is even back then, in the deepest, longest, broadest recession we'd seen in 100 years, we still sold a lot of new business. And it's a nice reflection of the value proposition that we have.
Kartik Mehta: Yes. And just as a follow-up, if you look at the First Aid and Safety business, you're doing really well in it. Is there a way you would look at to say a certain percentage is recurring? Do you consider a certain percentage recurring? I know you don't have long-term contracts in that business. But just from a demand standpoint and what you've seen from a historical standpoint?
Todd Schneider: Yes, Kartik, it's a good question. I don't have that in front of me, but I know it's -- it has returned much closer to historical or even higher as far as what we see from a repeat -- recurring type of revenue. And we want to provide value to the customers, whatever product services they want. It's just the nature of it, what we provide, whether it be First Aid supplies, access to AEDs, access to eyewash stations, access to clean water through our WaterBreak offering.  Those are all items that are really important to our customers more so today than they were pre-pandemic, and we think that, that trend will continue.
Operator: And our next question comes from Toni Kaplan from Morgan Stanley.
Toni Kaplan: So one of your competitors has been talking about using a strategy where they're incentivizing their drivers to cross-sell products. Can you talk about why you don't use that strategy? What the disadvantages are that you have found when doing that?
Todd Schneider: Yes. Great question, Toni. I'm glad you asked because my first job 34 years ago was on the trucks. And we have been cross-selling our products via our -- we call them our service sales representatives. We've been cross-selling them since I started, and I'm sure it was in place well before I started as well. So we see -- the fact that we have 12,000 or so trucks that roll out of our parking lots every single day that are focused on taking great care of our customers, when they roll out of those parking lots, they're spending time in those businesses.  And they have eyes. They have ears, they have minds, and they see what's going on in those businesses, and they see opportunities. And it always has been and always will be a key component of our growth trajectory because we see that infrastructure as a real advantage. And we leverage it and make sure that those service providers, either they provide more products and services or they provide a lead to provide more products and services based upon the nature of the product that the customer might be interested in.
Michael Hansen: And Toni, we've talked a lot about this over the last -- more than 10 years, we've got customers of all different sizes, verticals, et cetera. And so while we do certainly expect those service sales reps to continue to penetrate and sell, we recognize that some businesses are just more complex than others, are larger than others.  And so sometimes, there's a strategy to enhance that opportunity. And it might be through, for example, in health care. We have dedicated people that really do reach out to the decision makers. So it's not just the service sales rep, but it's also other people that have relationship responsibilities that are looking for those new and different penetration opportunities.  It's not as simple just to simply say we're going to go in and have a service sales rep or an SSR go into each customer and sell it, all customers are so different. And so we need a strategy that can attack all types of customers, and we do.
Todd Schneider: Toni, we know that our customer satisfaction scores are really good. And in large part because they really like our people. They like our service providers, our frontline service providers. And we leverage that. And whether it be, as Mike mentioned, a more -- a smaller type customer, we can cross-sell via the service provider. A larger one that's a little bit more complicated.  There might be a need for some air cover, for some help there. But nevertheless, that's always been an important component of our strategy and always will be.
Toni Kaplan: That is super helpful. I wanted to also ask, I think the last few calls, you've been talking more about technology and investments and things of this sort. Are there any, I guess, technology capabilities that you think you still need? Will -- that you either are getting through hiring technology people or maybe even doing M&A? Like -- and maybe you've done it, maybe you still have yet to do, but are there any technology capabilities that you need that basically would be helped through M&A or hiring internally new technology people?
Todd Schneider: Yes, Toni, great question. So we are always on the lookout for those opportunities. We think we have a really strong technology platform that we can build off of. But we know that the answer for what our customers are interested in is with spending time with our customers, and our employee partners are the ones who discern those opportunities.  So we're always asking now, how do we make it easier to do business, what -- is there any void? And frankly, that's where most of our investments have come from, that information, been trying to make it easier to do business with us. So we're always in search of trying to be a world-class service provider, but having an incredibly strong technology platform that makes it easier for our customers to do business with us, that makes it easier for our employee partners, our service providers to create a world-class experience for those customers. So yes, we're in search of whether it's -- we buy it or we bolt it on to our current platform or we created ourselves, all of those are of interest to us, and we'll be moving forward.
Operator: At this time, there are no further questions. I'd like to turn the call back over to Jared Mattingley for closing remarks.
Jared Mattingley: Thank you for joining us this morning. We will issue our second quarter of fiscal '24 financial results in December. We look forward to speaking with you again at that time. Thank you.

Todd Schneider: Thank you, Jared. Fourth quarter total revenue grew 10.1% to $2.28 billion. The organic growth rate, which adjusts for the impacts of acquisitions and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, was 10.3%. We are pleased with these fourth quarter results, where each of our businesses continue to grow and execute at a high level, especially coming off our highest growth quarter in fiscal '22.  Fourth quarter gross margin was $1.09 billion. Gross margin increased 210 basis points from 45.6% to 47.7%, an increase of 15.1% over the prior year. Operating income for the fourth quarter of fiscal '23 of $470.8 million, increased 16.4% over the prior year. Operating margin increased 110 basis points to 20.6% from 19.5% in the prior year. Fourth quarter net income was $346.2 million, an increase of 17.6%.  Earnings per diluted share for the fourth quarter were $3.33, an increase of 18.5% over the prior year fourth quarter. These results conclude a fiscal year of significant accomplishments, including the following: Fiscal year '23 revenue was a record $8.82 billion, an increase of 12.2%. Organic growth was also 12.2% for the year. We saw double-digit organic growth for every quarter during fiscal '23.  We were once again named to the prestigious Fortune 500 for the sixth consecutive year. It is an honor to be recognized among the most successful and respected companies. Operating income grew 13.6% for the year. When you exclude both fiscal '22, $12.1 million gain on the sale of operating assets and a $30.2 million gain on an equity method investment transaction, operating income grew 16.7%. EPS grew 11.5% for the year, excluding the previously mentioned prior year gains, EPS grew 15.2%. We increased our quarterly per share dividend by 21.1%. We've increased our dividend every year since going public, which is 39 consecutive years. As part of our steadfast commitment to corporate responsibility, we issued our third environmental, social and governance, or ESG report. Each year, we continue to make the report more robust. Cintas was founded on a sustainable business model. Our corporate culture is based on doing what is right and challenging ourselves to improve. We're proud of these results and the efforts of our employees whom we call partners.  I'll now turn the call over to Mike, to provide details of our fourth quarter results.
J. Michael Hansen: Thank you, Todd, and good morning. Our fiscal '23 fourth quarter revenue was $2.28 billion compared to $2.07 billion last year. The organic revenue growth rate, adjusted for acquisitions and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations was 10.3%. Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segment revenue for the fourth quarter of fiscal '23 was $1.77 billion compared to $1.6 billion last year. The organic revenue growth rate was 9.1%. As we've done in the past, I will share revenue mix of the Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segment for the fourth quarter. Keep in mind, there can be small fluctuations in mix between quarters. Uniform Rental was 48%, dust [ph] was 18%, hygiene was 16%, shop towels were 4%, linen, which includes microfiber wipes, towels and aprons was 10%, and catalog revenue was 4%. These percentages are consistent with last year, which speaks to the robust demand across all of our products and services. Our First Aid and Safety Services operating segment revenue for the fourth quarter was $249.8 million compared to $218.2 million last year. The organic revenue growth rate was 14.1%. Our Fire Protection Services and Uniform Direct Sale businesses are reported in the All Other segment. All Other revenue was $261.5 million compared to $226.2 million last year. The fire business revenue was $173.5 million, and the organic revenue growth rate was 17.3% resulting in a strong finish to the year. The Uniform Direct Sale business revenue was $88 million, and the organic growth rate was 11.5%. This strong performance exceeded our expectations as robust demand continued for these products and services. Gross margin for the fourth quarter of fiscal '23 was $1.09 billion, compared to $946.2 million last year, an increase of 15.1%. Gross margin as a percent of revenue was 47.7% for the fourth quarter of fiscal '23 compared to 45.6% last year, an increase of 210 basis points. Energy expenses comprised of gasoline, natural gas and electricity were a tailwind, decreasing 65 basis points from last year. Strong volume growth from new customers and the penetration of existing customers with more products and services help generate great operating leverage. Gross margin percentage by business was 47.7% for Uniform Rental and Facility Services, 51% for First Aid and Safety Services, 47.9% for Fire Protection Services and 36% for Uniform Direct sale.  Fourth quarter SG&A was 27.1%, which was up 100 basis points from last year. We've continued to invest in selling resources and branding initiatives, and our insurance costs were higher. We are self-insured, which means our insurance costs can fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter. Fourth quarter operating income was $470.8 million compared to $404.4 million last year. Operating income as a percent of revenue was 20.6% in the fourth quarter of fiscal '23 compared to 19.5% in last year's fourth quarter. Our effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 22.4% compared to 22.8% last year. Net income for the fourth quarter was $346.2 million compared to $294.5 million last year. This year's fourth quarter diluted EPS was $3.33 compared to $2.81 last year. I'll now turn the call back over to Todd to provide his thoughts and our financial expectations for fiscal '24.
Todd Schneider: Thank you, Mike. As we move into fiscal '24, we will celebrate our 40th anniversary of being a publicly traded company. Back then, we were excited about what laid ahead. Today, we are equally excited about the significant opportunities that the future holds. Our value proposition remains strong, and our prospects for continued profitable growth are great. Every business goods producing or services providing has a need for image, safety, cleanliness and compliance. We work with businesses to help them build a better workday. We provide the products and perform the services better, faster and more economically freeing businesses to concentrate on their core competency.  A year ago, I introduced three priorities: branding, ESG and technology to help drive our focus, continue to differentiate us in the marketplace and provide increased competitive advantages. I'm pleased with our progress in each of these key areas. Our branding efforts continue as more and more businesses have learned how we can help them get ready for the workday. We continue to make progress on our ESG goals and our sustainable solutions focus on reducing, reusing, recycling and repurposing our textiles. These solutions continue to resonate with our customers and prospects as we help them achieve their sustainability initiatives. I want to spend a minute speaking about technology, in particular, our digital transformation journey. We've been very successful thus far in using technology to drive efficiencies in our production facilities, efficiencies out on the routes with our trucks via our proprietary Smart Truck technology, and we are in the early innings of our My Cintas customer portal, which makes it easier for our customers to do business with us.  As we look to the future, we're very excited to have great technology partners in SAP and Verizon, which are helping us to provide a better customer experience and improve efficiencies within our business. We are excited to announce today that we have an additional strategic technology partner with Google, leveraging their Google Cloud platform. As a result of these relationships, it positions us at the forefront of technology innovation.  We are still in the very early stages of our digital transformation journey, and we are excited about the impact it will have on our customers and our company in total. We are confident technology will be a competitive advantage for us now and well into the future. I will now provide our guidance for fiscal '24. Our fiscal year '24 -- for our fiscal year '24, we expect our revenue to be in the range of $9.35 billion to $9.5 billion, a total growth rate of 6.1% to 7.8%. We expect diluted EPS to be in the range of $13.85 to $14.35, a growth rate of 6.6% to 10.5%. Please note the following: fiscal year '24 interest expense is expected to be approximately $98 million compared to $109.5 million in fiscal year '23, predominantly as a result of lower variable rate debt. This may change as a result of future share buybacks or acquisition activity. Our fiscal '24 effective tax rate is expected to be 21.3% compared to a rate of 20.4% for fiscal '23. The higher effective tax rate negatively impacts fiscal '24 EPS guidance by about $0.16 and diluted EPS growth by about 120 basis points. Guidance does not include any future share buybacks or significant economic disruptions or downturns. And guidance includes the impact of having one more workday in fiscal '24 compared to fiscal '23. This extra workday comes in our fiscal third quarter. We're excited about next year and beyond. The future of Cintas remains bright.  I'll turn the call back over to Jared.
Jared Mattingley: That concludes our prepared remarks. Now we are happy to answer questions from the analysts. Please ask just one question and a single follow-up as needed. Thank you.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question today comes from Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan Securities.
Andrew Steinerman: Hi. I'd like to talk about net realized price as part of the organic revenue growth in the fourth quarter and into the guide. And I think you might need to remind me, I think there's no explicit gas surcharge that Cintas puts on, but obviously, gas prices are down year-over-year. And how does that factor into pricing? And just overall, how has Cintas done in terms of raising price to their B2B customers versus the input costs?
Todd Schneider: Good morning, Andrew, thanks for the question. Yes, good question. We're -- from a pricing standpoint, as we have spoken about in past quarters, is our pricing has been certainly above historical during fiscal '23, as it needed to be because of the cost inputs. When we think about what that will look like moving forward in our '24 guide, we expect that pricing will return closer to historical and our cost inputs are in a similar spot, as you saw in the CPI report that came out yesterday and the PPI report that came out this morning. We are seeing inflation coming down. I think our team has done a pretty amazing job of managing input costs, both our operational team but our supply chain team which has really benefited us. So it's -- we do not rely upon pricing as the only lever to gain leverage to expand margin. We are committed to extracting out inefficiencies in our business, and you're seeing that. And you've seen that in fiscal '23. And our guide for fiscal '24 reflects incremental -- attractive incremental margins, and we're going to do it successfully, and we're going to expect that inefficiencies in our business to help us expand margins.
J. Michael Hansen: Thank you, Andrew, I might just add two things. One, specifically, we do not have a fuel surcharge. And secondly, you made a comment about our price increases offsetting input costs and I think the best -- the way to think about that is margins in the fourth quarter were up 110 basis points. Margin for the fiscal '23 year were up 70 basis points and our guidance implies margin improvement throughout the range of guidance for next year. So, keep that in mind as we think about pricing versus input costs, et cetera, we're still raising margins, improving margins. 
Andrew Steinerman: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question will come from Faiza Alwy with Deutsche Bank Securities.
Faiza Alwy: Yes. Hi, good morning. I wanted to talk about the type of economic or macro environment that you're embedding in your guide. I know you said that significant economic disruptions or downturn is not assumed, but give us a sense of what type of economic environment you're assuming?
Todd Schneider: Faiza, thank you for the question. We're not guiding towards a significant economic disruption. Trying to predict economic indicators is certainly very challenging. But I can tell you what's going on, what we're seeing in our business, which is we haven't seen much change in our customer behavior.  Our sales productivity is very good. Our customer retention levels remain quite strong. And there is -- there's still really good interest in our products and our services. Know programmers are still going very well. And there's still the majority of the new accounts that we sell. So we like that very much. We like expanding the pie and those customers are seeing value in what we're providing. We also like our vertical strategy that -- the vertical sales strategy that has been working quite nicely for us. So I would say, reasonably so business as usual is what we would expect. We recognize there will be ups and downs in macro environments, but we're not guiding towards anything -- any economic downturn.
Faiza Alwy: Great. Thank you. And then if I could just follow up on the -- you mentioned the Google partnership. Maybe give us a sense of where you see that partnership going over the next few years? What some of the benefits might be as you think about your digital transformation strategy?
Todd Schneider: Certainly. Our relationship with Google gives us a better, faster, smarter, cheaper way to store our critical data. But we see it as it can do so much more, due in large part because of the relationship that Google has with SAP and the relationship we have with SAP and now Google. As you all know, we have had a very successful relationship with SAP for over a decade now. And we've spoken in the past that it is much more than just a customer vendor relationship. It's a strategic relationship.  So you combine that with just a couple of months ago, SAP and Google announced that they have an expanded partnership. And what that's going to do is it's going to allow our SAP data to be connected with the Google Cloud Data and analytics technology, which will give us access to their advanced AI and machine learning capabilities. So we're excited about that. It's going to -- we think we can benefit for many years to come as this type of relationship.  But you asked Faiza for a few examples. So I'll give you a few to help give a little color around it. We see having these technologies connected, the opportunity to put in front of our sales organization instead of calling, I'll say, more blindly on who to try to sell our services to, we call it next best prospect for our sales team to have real technologies to push in front of them. Here's where you go spend your time. We think that's significant and can have an impact on our productivity and our retention and morale productivity, all those things. Next best product for the customer. So instead of just trying to figure that out, we can put that in front of our sales team to -- and our service team to make sure that they're talking to our customers about the next best product that would fit based upon other customer behaviors. We think certain customer service functions could be enhanced nicely over the coming years. There is -- we all use Google Maps, and we see an opportunity to leverage Google Maps to even further enhance our Smart Truck technology to make routing even more dynamic, which will save us time, saves us energy, saves us -- allows for more time in front of our customers instead of on the road. And then just one more, I would say is that, our service team, we're blessed to have a lot of customers. We want to make sure that they're spending -- they're in front of the right customers at the right time. And we see the potential to leverage that type of technology to point them in the right direction to make sure that they're focused on any at-risk customers and customers that we need to enhance the effort with them with the people in front of them. So hopefully, that gives you a little color around it. Again, this is not -- we don't see this as an event, we see this as a process and the coming years, we think it can be very impactful for our business and our customers.
Faiza Alwy: Great. Thank you so much. Really appreciate it. 
Operator: Next question comes from Ashish Sabadra with RBC.
Ashish Sabadra: Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to turn down into the First Aid and Safety Services we saw some material acceleration in growth there. I was wondering if you can talk about what's driving that strength. And then as you think about '24 any puts and takes that you would call out? Or how do we think about that momentum going forward? Thanks.
Todd Schneider: Thank you, Ashish. I'll start, and if Mike wants to chime in. The First Aid and Safety business is going quite well. We really like that business. We've -- we see significant opportunities in the future there. And we're getting leverage there, really growth -- the strong growth is really helping us get some real leverage but the mix of business is very attractive. We spoke about during the peaks of the pandemic now, there was more PPE sales and safety sales. And the mix is now back to what we really like, it's a cabinet sale that are repeat in nature and higher margin. So we really like the mix, but the growth in total is great.  And I would tell you that the value proposition is really resonating our customers are trying to make sure that they're reinvesting in their people. Health and wellness is a concept that is resonating very strongly in the marketplace, and we're leveraging that and benefiting from that. And on top of that, we're also -- we have inefficiencies in that business as well. So we're extracting out those inefficiencies. They're going to help us continue to expand our margins. But we like the position we're in, we like the tailwinds we have with the health and wellness, and we think the future is quite bright in that area.
Ashish Sabadra: That's very helpful color. I just wanted to drill down further on the vertical sales strategy. Obviously, you mentioned you're seeing some pretty good success on that front. I was wondering if you could drill down further on the key verticals. And then also on your health care initiative, how those are trending, but also any other verticals that you would call out? Thanks.
Todd Schneider: Certainly. Our key verticals where we're focusing our time is health care, education and government. We've organized around those verticals. We have products and services that are attractive to them. Certain service functions dedicated to them. And as a result, we're really benefiting from it. And we very much think that they're smart verticals to invest in. And as a result, they're growing really attractively. And customer retention is good, new business is good. And we think that there's a real long opportunity here for us to continue to invest in these into the future. Certainly, the demographics of health care are quite attractive. But education and government are doing well in addition, and we're going to continue to invest in those areas. So it's paying dividends for us.
Ashish Sabadra: That’s very helpful color. Thank you very much.
Operator: Your next question comes from Manav Patnaik with Barclays.
Manav Patnaik: Good. I think historically, you've talked about how almost two-thirds of that -- two-thirds of new sales come from those known programmers. I just wanted to update that and kind of tied to that. What is the competitive environment look like? Have there been any changes? Because your two public comps, obviously, there's a lot of changes going on at each of the organizations?
Todd Schneider: Yes, Manav, you were -- I couldn't hear the first part, but I think I understand your question. I'll try to answer it. And if I don't, then please let me know. The know programmers are -- it's going quite well. And it has historically been a significant portion of what we sell, and it continues to be a significant portion of what we sell. And we have products and services that are attractive to them. We have a sales effort that is, I'd say, skilled at identifying and delivering the message to those folks. And I think it's important to understand that with know programmers, it's not always -- I would say rarely is it just all incremental new spend to them. Many, many cases, we are able to -- they're spending those dollars somewhere in many cases, with other vendors, maybe not a direct competitor, but they're spending money on compliance and image and safety and cleanliness, those types of things. And as a result, we're able to redirect those dollars to us, in many cases, save the money. So don't think of it all as, oh my gosh, is there an end to that because if the economy -- there's any stress in it that they're not going to be able to sell know programmers there, quite the opposite. We're -- we see a very, very long runway there. So that's attractive. As far as the competitive set, I mean, we operate in a very competitive industry, a very competitive environment. I would say I haven't seen any changes to the competitive landscape from that standpoint. So I'll leave it at that.
Manav Patnaik: Okay. And then just one quick follow-up I had, I think I understand that the Google partnership the benefits it potentially brings with any sense of time line? Like when does this start happening, when you get the data on the cloud and then you start seeing some of these benefits?
Todd Schneider: Well, it's certainly going to be a process. We just entered into our relationship with them recently. We've had meetings with them to talk about where we're going to go here. And as I mentioned, it's not an event. It's a process. But we see some low-hanging fruit, I guess is the best way to say it. But as we have gone down this path, more ideas are coming out. So we think we can benefit for years to come with this opportunity. And I won't go into too much detail just because we see some competitive advantages there. And so as a result, we'll keep those to ourselves. But we think the runway is long and attractive.
Manav Patnaik: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: And our next question comes from Josh Chan with UBS.
Joshua Chan: Hi, good morning, Todd, Mike and Jared, congrats on a strong quarter. My first question, when you are selling First Aid and Fire, basically those adjacent businesses, how much of that growth is selling to existing customers? And how much of it gets you kind of entirely new customers that don't run uniform from you?
Todd Schneider: Yes. Josh, it's a good question. It's a mix. Cross-sell has been very helpful for us over the last number of years and will continue to be. But we love new customers. And the Fire and First Aid, there is some overlap, but not complete overlap. And so it allows us to get into speaking to customers about that. And the first time they may have done business with us at all. So -- and then we -- separately we have an enterprise sales organization that will call a customer or prospect.  And frankly, it doesn't really matter to us what they start with. It's whatever the customer is interested in. If a customer doesn't do any business with us and they want to start -- their interest is in Fire, wonderful, or if it's in First Aid, wonderful, or rental garments, then we go where the interest is and then we expand out that relationship from there. So we love the fact that there isn't complete overlap, and it gets us into new opportunities and then we cross-sell like crazy.
Joshua Chan: Great. That makes sense. Thanks for the color. And I guess for my follow-up, if I look at your incremental margin, it's climbed pretty steadily through 2023. I assume if you got better alignment between price and cost. So how are you thinking about the cadence of incremental margins looking into 2024?
J. Michael Hansen: Josh, our incremental margin for the total company in fiscal '23 was 26.8%, a little bit up from the previous year. And Josh, it's -- there can be ups and downs from quarter-to-quarter in the way that we invest or in the cost that we see. And so we don't necessarily try to predict one quarter at a time. We do certainly believe we can get incremental operating margins in that 20% to 30% range from quarter-to-quarter generally, but it's going to go up and down, again, based on what we are doing within the business, some initiatives that we may or may not roll out. So the bigger focus for us is on the full year, and our goal is to get those incremental attractive enough that it improves margins over the year. So I wouldn't call it linear at all, I wouldn't call it flat. It's going to be based on how we're managing the business.
Joshua Chan: That’s great. Thanks for the color and thanks for your time. 
Operator: Your next question comes from Justin Hauk with R.W. Baird.
Justin Hauk : Good morning, everyone. I wanted to -- I guess, my first question, maybe a follow-up on Andrew's question, just on the implied revenue growth, the 7% in 2024. And maybe you can kind of pull out the puts and takes, but that's coming off of a 12% you just did here in '23, that was off of already a really strong 10%. 7% is more, I guess, kind of in line with kind of your long-term historical organic growth. And so -- maybe you can just give us the puts and takes. Is it all pricing that accounts for the delta because it sounds like your new business and retention and kind of existing sales are all still very strong? So I'm just trying to understand the moving pieces?
Todd Schneider: Thanks for the question, Justin. I'll try to answer and see if Mike wants to expand upon it. So when you think about our growth, Q4 growth was around 10%, which is really nice growth, especially considering a strong comp of last year of 12.7%, which was our strongest growth of the year, that year.  So if you compare that 10% to the -- I'll call it the top end of our guide or in the mid-7s to higher 7s, you can think of that as really pricing returning back to closer to historical levels. And as I mentioned earlier, the reason that we see this as appropriate and is we're seeing an easing of inflation. And we saw that -- you can see that in the drop in the cost of energy that we've seen, the benefit we received in Q4. And as I mentioned earlier, also you saw it in the CPI report yesterday and the PPI report today. So -- and as you appropriately said, I mean, we're guiding towards a more historical type of growth volume growth is really good still. Pricing will return closer to historical appropriately so. But all that being said, we will still have -- we're guiding towards incremental margins and operating margin expansion. So pricing is a lever, but it's not our only lever available to us in order to expand margins.
Justin Hauk: Okay. No, that's helpful. I mean that's I guess, kind of what you were implying, but I wanted to clarify that, that was kind of the magnitude of the change. I guess the second question, just on the insurance cost increase, and maybe SG&A as a percentage of revenue in general, how much of an impact was that in the quarter?  And then is that kind of a run rate headwind that you'll face next year? And the reason why I ask is, obviously, you're implying margin expansion here, but your SG&A as a percentage of revenue is still pretty low versus kind of pre-COVID levels. And so just trying to understand how much structural SG&A leverage gain you have here versus returning to more of a normalized level?
J. Michael Hansen: Justin, because we are self-insured, those claims can -- they can kind of move up and down throughout the year. There's nothing that we would say is structural related to that. It's just a product of being self-insured. We ended the year at 26.9% in SG&A, that is, gosh, a couple of 100 basis points maybe lower than pre-COVID in the last few years, and you've heard us speak about this.  Look, we've worked hard to get it to that level, and we don't want to get back to historical levels. So our expectation is we're going to continue to find ways to better leverage SG&A, particularly G&A to make sure that it contributes to our margin expansion into the future. So we're going to continue to work hard to look for opportunities to bring it down and do not expect it to return to those higher 20 places that we were in pre-COVID. 
Justin Hauk: Great. Okay, I appreciate it. Thank you.
Operator: And we'll hear next from George Tong with Goldman Sachs.
George Tong: Hi, thanks. Good morning. You mentioned there hasn't been much change in customer behaviors based on what you're seeing. Can you elaborate on how customer budgets, sales cycles in the sales pipeline are evolving with the current environment?
Todd Schneider: Good morning, George. It's a pretty -- the environment hasn't changed significantly. The health of customers is varies based upon geographic, what type of business they're in, small, medium, large, those types of things. But generally speaking, the sales process and has not elongated the sales pipe looks very good. We like the spot we're in. And we have invested appropriately. We're in the right -- we've got the right products and services.  We've got the right focus on our customers, and we think that we're well positioned for the future. And we certainly are trying to make sure that we're planning for the long term. And we're -- as I mentioned earlier, not trying to be an economic forecasting business, but we are making sure that we're watching our business very closely and hoping for clear sailing ahead with the economy. That being said, we will find a way to be successful as we have in the past.
George Tong: Got it. That's helpful. And then I wanted to drill down further into your healthcare vertical, which you touched on earlier, COVID certainly provided a notable lift to the health care business. Can you talk a little bit about how quickly the health care business is growing, what new business trends there look like and what mix of revenue we currently represent?
Todd Schneider: Certainly, George. The healthcare business has been strong for us for a number of years. And is large part not just having a sales focus, but organizing around those customers, products, services, our service organization. So it's more than just sales. It is making sure that we look at it as a business. And it's growing -- it's accretive to our growth rates. We see very long runway there. As I mentioned earlier, the demographics are really attractive. But the pipeline of sales growth looks robust. And that's because of years of investment in making sure we're really well positioned, and we see that continuing.
George Tong: Got it. And just the mix of revenue?
J. Michael Hansen: I don't have that in front of us, George, right now. In the past, it's been about 7%. And it's -- I'd say that it's growing faster than average.
George Tong: Got it. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from Tim Mulrooney with William Blair.
Tim Mulrooney: Yes. Good morning. On the First Aid business, specifically, pre-pandemic operating margins were closer to 15%. They went down several 100 basis points. I know from the sell through a lower-margin PP&E in '21 and '22. But now it looks like you're sitting at 19%. I mean that's a big jump from pre-pandemic levels. Would you expect, I guess, Mike or Todd a little bit of a give back at some point? Or do you expect to keep and build on those margin gains that you've made this year?
Todd Schneider: Yes, Tim, we do not expect to give back, we expect to maintain and build on those improvements. And we're leveraging certainly the total growth, the benefits of health and wellness being important to people in the marketplace. The mix of business being attractive and we've fundamentally focused on extracting out inefficiencies in the business. So -- and we're not giving those back. So yes, we see the future is bright for that business. 
Tim Mulrooney: Yes. Okay. It was more than just sales mix. It sounds like you did some structural things. 
J. Michael Hansen: Yeah. Tim, we talk a lot about the mix certainly returning, and that's being -- that's a big part of it. But as Todd mentioned, our first aid safety partners have a lot of things going on in terms of business improvement opportunities from sourcing better, to routing better, to sales productivity improving, to penetration opportunities. There's a lot going on in that business.  And we've attributed a lot, you're correct, to the revenue mix, and that has been important in terms of the height of the pandemic to today. But there's also a lot that's going on in the business that is working towards structural improvements in the business that create long-term efficiencies and you're seeing that. And that's why we don't expect to give it back. There's nothing that we are underspending or underinvesting in to get these margins. These are real business improvements that are sustainable. And that's what we love about the business. It has been growing nicely, it's resonating with our prospects and customers. And it's pretty exciting to think about that business in our fiscal '24 topping $1 billion for the first time. So we do love the business, and there's a lot of good work going on there.
Tim Mulrooney: That is exciting, and I appreciate the extra color there. Mike, that's very clear. If I could just shift gears really quickly. One of your competitors recently commented that they saw customer retention rates come down a little bit recently. But it was kind of more of a normalization, okay, like following a boost over the last several years, when things were good. Now that kind of back towards historical rates. I'm curious and some investors are curious if you guys saw something similar to any material degree, did you see retention rates kind of jump up a little bit in fiscal '22 and '23? And have you seen that pull back or normalize, so to speak, more recently? Thank you.
Todd Schneider: Great question, Tim. So, over the past few years, we've seen a nice improvement to our customer retention levels through the pandemic. We think that we handle that really strategically, intelligently and thought about the long term. And we saw our customer satisfaction scores go up at that same time. And we've continued to see those same levels of customer satisfaction and retention levels.  So no, we have not seen a change from that standpoint. And we're always working on improving our business and making sure that we are super focused on making sure we're taking great care of our customers and staying attentive to their needs, is a big part of what makes us successful. So we've not seen a change, and we're focused on making sure that doesn't happen.
Tim Mulrooney: Got it. Thank you.
Operator: We'll hear next from Kartik Mehta with Northcoast Research.
Kartik Mehta: Good morning. I wanted to ask your expectations for ad stops as we go into fiscal '24. It seems as though companies are starting to slow down their hiring. And I'm wondering what type of impact that's included in the guidance or what you're anticipating?
Todd Schneider: Kartik, we have not seen a change to our ad stops metrics, and we are expecting that, that will continue. We're -- part of it is because of the diversity of our customer base, not just good producing services providing and the broadness of our customer base. We're not dependent upon any one particular area and we expect to grow in multiples of GDP. And all that being said, we expect that and stops metrics will continue on its path.
Kartik Mehta: Perfect. And then Mike, you might have said this, so I apologize if you already talked about this. But just the impact from energy costs in FY '24 versus FY '23, what you've included or anticipated.
J. Michael Hansen: So let me -- I'll give you a couple of numbers. Fourth quarter total energy for the total company was 1.8% for the fourth quarter. For the year, that was 2.2%. So for the year -- this year -- fiscal '23 compared to '22, it was down 10 basis points. So it's roughly flattish. As we think about '24, look, the prices at the pump spiked in June of last year. And so our first quarter numbers of last year were fairly high. And so we may get a little bit of a tailwind in Q1 and then our expectation is we'll turn roughly flattish. 
Kartik Mehta: Okay. Thank you very much. I really appreciate it.
Operator: Next, we'll hear from Seth Weber with Wells Fargo.
Seth Weber: Good morning. I wanted to just circle back to the revenue guidance point again for a second. I'm just -- it sounds like First Aid Safety and the Fire business both have very strong momentum, so I'm just trying to understand the construct of the revenue guide, whether you think all three segments will be in that kind of 6% to 8% range or will there be some above and some below to kind of put out to that 6% to 8% range? Because it seems like there's still a lot of momentum in the First Aid Safety and Fire business.
Todd Schneider: Well, Seth, good morning. We like the momentum in all of our businesses. So will there be some above, some below? Yes. But it's -- but generally speaking, we see in the mid-to-high single digits would be probably where you can think of it. And it's -- and as I mentioned earlier, the -- we're up against comps that are significant, partly because of pricing being above historical in the past, well above historical, now it being closer to historical.
Seth Weber: Okay. Maybe, Mike, my follow-up question just on CapEx. It's kind of pushing up towards that 4%ish number again. Is that the right way to think about it for fiscal '24? And then can you just give us any color on what that -- whether that's brick-and-mortar or whether just where that spending might be going from a capacity perspective or whatnot?
J. Michael Hansen: Sure. Yes, we would expect 3.5% to 4% of revenue. Look, when we've had a really good couple of years of volume growth, we have capacity needs in certain places. Capacity is local in our business, but we have capacity needs. And we want to continue to invest for growth. And so there will be everything from added washers and dryers and specific wash alleys to some of a few bricks and mortar new buildings and other investments in the business that allow us to continue to have the capacity we need to grow. So it is kind of back to that historical 3.5% to 4% range. That would be our expectation.
Seth Weber: Got it. I appreciate guys. Thank you very much.
Operator: And we'll move next to Heather Balsky with Bank of America.
Heather Balsky: Hi, thank you for taking my question. I know you've got a question earlier about sort of the trend in sales and the difference is related to pricing. I'm curious, focusing specifically on the uniforms business. You've been growing organically 9% to -- and 11% the last few quarters. If presumably were well past the COVID recovery period. I'm just curious what's enabled you to drive that outperformance versus kind of pre-COVID levels? And if you think that sustainable going forward?
Todd Schneider: Good morning, Heather. So yes, our Uniform Rental business is performing quite well. We've -- we think we have invested appropriately in the sales organization. We really like where we're going there. We like the productivity levels. They've continued to go up. And there's plenty of inputs to productivity and it's whether it's products that we launch, services that we launch, the retention levels of our people, the leadership of the organization to make sure that we're driving items that make them more successful.  So no, it's going well, and our service organization is doing an outstanding job with customer retention, making sure, as I mentioned earlier, our customer satisfaction scores are near all-time highs. And as a result of that, our lost business, our customer retention, the appropriate way to say it. Our customer retention is really attractive. So our new is up and our customer retention is improved over pre-COVID levels. So those are big for us and having a really positive impact on the business.
Heather Balsky: Great. Thank you. That's really helpful. And I feel like I have to ask an AI question here. You guys talked about being early in your digital transformation journey. Are you guys looking at any investments on the AI side in terms of efficiencies and sort of behind the scenes type benefit? I'm just curious. Thanks.
Todd Schneider: Yes, Heather, we're certainly investigating and investing in opportunities. And we think we're with the right partners. When you think about Verizon, SAP and Google, having those three as the -- our technology -- our strategic technology partners, we think we're with the right folks. And we don't just have a customer vendor relationship with them, we have a strategic relationship with them, and they're helping us -- they are and will help us to leverage those opportunities in the marketplace.  So I can't lay out specifics for you, but I'll just tell you this, we're -- we see the opportunity to invest in that area, and we are doing so appropriately because we think it will pay big dividends. That being said, it will be -- we'll be speaking about this for many, many years to come because we think the benefit has a real -- has a lot of legs to it. 
Heather Balsky: That’s really helpful. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer.
Scott Schneeberger: Thanks very much. Guys, kind of a cautionary question. It sounds like things are going really well and recent economic indicators feel pretty good, but just curious to hear what the plan is if -- as your guidance expects no softness in the economy, how are you looking at what levers would you pull on the efficiency side? What should give us assurance you'll be in good shape if you're not able to get some of the leverage you've been getting on the top line? Thanks.
Todd Schneider: Scott, let me make sure I understand. You're saying if we can't get to leverage or if the economic environment changes?
Scott Schneeberger: If the economic environment dips in below kind of status quo and really deteriorate, just curious what kind of leverage you guys would pull to maintain the financial sense?
Todd Schneider: Yes. Certainly. Good question. I -- we have a very tenured, very experienced leadership team, management team that has been through the cycles. It seems like you name it, we've been through it, and we expect to be successful in all environments. Now -- so your -- the question is a tough one to answer because the economic downturn, how deep is it? How long is it? How broad? And so trying to understand that is challenging. But we expect to be successful in all economic environments.  If you're talking about a massive downturn in '08, '09, that might be different. But we're ready. We know how to do this. We have demonstrated our ability to be successful in and all these different types of economic environments. We have grown our sales and profits in 52 -- in the last 54 years. And my expectation is we will absolutely do so and we will find and fight and a way to be successful in whatever economic environment. So plenty of levers available to us. And we think we've got the right team in place to manage that.
Scott Schneeberger: Thanks. I appreciate that. And then for the follow-up, it's a bit of a two-parter and one to your housekeeping. I was just curious, your -- thanks for answering on Seth's question on CapEx, what that will look like, just other uses of capital as we head into fiscal '24, thoughts on buybacks, thoughts on M&A, any other cleanup on the balance sheet you were considering? And then that second part would just be, if you could remind us what a one day -- one extra workday quantitative impact is that in fiscal '24 versus '23?
J. Michael Hansen: Sure. From a capital allocation, I'll start with our expectation is that cash flow is going to continue to be very good in fiscal '24. And secondly, our balance sheet is in great shape. We -- as of May 31, we have no variable debt. And so we can do a lot of things with great cash flow and a great balance sheet. We would love to use that on M&A if the opportunities come along, and we'll be as aggressive as we can be in terms of looking for them and making sure that they come at the right value, but we love that opportunity. Buyback is another great opportunity, again, with good cash flow and a great balance sheet, we can put that cash to work, and we certainly could do it in the form of a buyback. So, look, our capital allocation philosophy and strategy hasn't changed. And with -- again, with a healthy balance sheet and a healthy cash flow, we can do some good things with that as we look forward to fiscal '24. Your second question of the one workday for a fiscal year. In this case, it would be about a 40 basis point benefit to growth -- sales growth. And think about it as about a 12 basis point benefit on bottom line on operating margin.
Scott Schneeberger: Great, thanks. Appreciate all the color.
Operator: Your next question comes from Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel Nicolas.
Shlomo Rosenbaum: Hi, thank you for taking my questions. I wanted to just ask a little bit more on kind of the hiring environment at your clients. You said you're not expecting it to change. It's been a very strong hiring environment for the last several years since that kind of initial dip in COVID. Is there a way that you think about it in your mind in terms of the strong hiring environment and just kind of clients adding personnel driving some of that revenue growth, particularly in the Rental Uniforms division? Or do you think it's really a lot more of the company's own efforts in terms of cross-selling, finding new customers and pricing? Then I have a follow-up.
Todd Schneider: Good question, Shlomo. We love it when our customers are hiring more employees and it certainly allows you to swim a little bit downstream then. But we've got to find ways to add value to customers even when they're in the more flattish type environment. That being said, there is still almost 10 million job openings. So that's very encouraging.  We'd love to see those jobs filled. But we are -- we're going to find a way to be successful whether our customers are hiring at rapid rates or at much lower rates, we're going to find a way to be successful. And that is impacted by our ability to -- we would call it cross-sell, bring more value to the customers in other products and services that they may have with maybe a new business unit, but maybe within that business unit just selling more items. So there's a lot of inputs to that and how we categorize it. But we're -- we like the spot that we're in. And we think the products and services and the value proposition that we're providing is resonating with people. And would certainly love the economic to continue or even improve.
Shlomo Rosenbaum: Okay. Great. And then just on a follow-up. Maybe you could talk a little bit about the margin just on a sequential basis of looking at the First Aid and Safety. And then kind of the other division, you had a sequential decline despite revenue going up in the Rental Uniforms you have continuing to go up? Or was there something particular on the insurance side that hit the other divisions? Or is there some particular investments that are going on right now? Just if you can give a little bit of a sequential color on what's going on with the operating margins?
J. Michael Hansen: Sure, Shlomo. Look, the First Aid margin was at 18.8% in Q4, still a really healthy place to be. And nothing noteworthy other than growth is -- organic growth still is very good, gross margin is still very good, and we continue to invest for the future. So nothing noteworthy there. From the all other perspective, the Fire operating margin in Q4 was slightly over 20 and so that's a great place for us in that business. The direct sale business was 3.5%. So quite a bit lower. And that business can move up and down and have a little bit more volatility than the other businesses just because of the nature of it. We still love the business. It grew nicely, but mix can have an outsized effect on that operating margin and it sort of did in the fourth quarter. As we move forward, from a First Aid perspective, we still expect the really positive margins that we've seen as we've discussed a few minutes ago. And we still expect Fire to continue to perform very, very well like it has in fiscal '23.
Shlomo Rosenbaum: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from Toni Kaplan from Morgan Stanley.
Toni Kaplan: Thanks for squeezing me in. I wanted to follow up on First Aid growth. You talked about the Cabinet business contributing it again, which is great. I was hoping you could talk about, is that sort of an industry penetration is growing? Or is it the product set relatively new. I know you're investing in it during COVID. Have you been sort of incentivizing your sales force to sell more cabinets? And are you taking share? Just wanted to get a sense on how long the sort of 20% growth in cabinets can continue and if there are any other factors you'd call out as well? Thanks.
Todd Schneider: Thank you, Toni. We -- the answer is yes. All the above is what we're doing. We see a long runway in the First Aid business. We're -- the vast majority of what we sell are people that are do-it-yourself. There's -- as you think about, there's 16 million businesses in North America, there is a significant opportunity to sell our First Aid cabinet services, but our other services as well, whether they be AEDs, wash stations, those types of items that really have value to customers. And that health, safety, compliance tailwind, we don't see that changing.  People are investing in their organizations, and we see that as a tailwind for many years to come and the market is really, really big. So that's where we're -- we love the growth that we're seeing in that business, and we're continuing to invest appropriately to make sure that it continues.
Toni Kaplan: Terrific. And this should be a short one, but hoping you could talk about maybe the sensitivity of the business from inflation. So presumably, your costs come down as if inflation comes down, so how should we be thinking about maybe like the impact to margin for each point inflation comes down or however you want to frame the sensitivity there? Thanks.
J. Michael Hansen: Toni, that's a really difficult thing to try to say one point of inflation equals x points of margin. That's pretty difficult to do. But I'd maybe say this. When you think about our cost structure, we've got a really nice mix of cost types, if you will. So we certainly have things like labor that are impacted by inflationary pressures. And we work very, very hard on that over the course of the last five years, I would say. And we're in a good spot. But then we also have this large part of our cost structure that is amortizing. And it allows us to effectively see any inflationary impacts coming if they are coming and plan for them accordingly. And so we may plan for that in terms of our pricing approach, we may plan for that in terms of other initiatives. But the point is, because we're amortizing those costs, it takes a while for inflation to get to us, and during that period of time, we can plan and we can anticipate better. While we're on that bucket, I would say our global supply chain really does a nice job of not being single sourced. And so when there are some inflationary pressures in various parts of the world or in our supply chain, because we're not single source, we have the ability to move volume a little bit in flex, we have choices. And that's important for us. And it has been important for us over the course of the last two years in the high inflationary environment. And then the third bucket that I would throw out is sort of that infrastructure. We've got a large infrastructure, 400-plus locations around the country. And when we are growing really nicely, we're leveraging it very, very well, and we've done that over the course of the last few years. And so Toni, we're not a product company that is dramatically affected by today's inflation. And you hear us talk about pricing is just one lever that we have to get margin improvement.  And that's because of, number one, we've got this sort of diverse cost structure. And number two, we've got a lot of initiatives and things that we're working on. And it gives us choices. And that's the -- that's really the key for us in terms of fighting inflation. So hopefully, that answers the question. It's not an easy metric for us because of the cost structure that we have and the initiatives that we have, and it also depends on where the inflation comes from.
Toni Kaplan: Super. Thanks a lot.
Operator: And this concludes our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the call back to Mr. Mattingley for any additional or closing remarks.
Jared Mattingley: Thank you for joining us this morning. We will issue our first quarter fiscal '24 financial results in September. We look forward to speaking with you again at that time. Thanks.
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for attending.

===== 2023 Q3  (2023-03-29 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Cintas Corporation Announces Fiscal 2023 Third Quarter Earnings Release Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Paul Adler, Vice President, Treasurer and Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
Paul F. Adler: Thank you, Ross, and thank you for joining us. With me is Todd Schneider, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Mike Hansen, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We will discuss our fiscal 2023 third quarter results. After our commentary, we will open the call to questions from analysts. The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a Safe Harbor from civil litigation for forward-looking statements. This conference call contains forward-looking statements that reflect the company's current views as to future events and financial performance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those we may discuss. I refer you to the discussion on these points contained in our most recent filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. I'll now turn the call over to Todd.
Todd M. Schneider: Thank you, Paul. Third quarter total revenue grew 11.7% to $2.19 billion. Each of our businesses continue to execute at a high level. The benefit of our strong revenue growth flowed through to our bottom line. Excluding a gain in the related tax benefit in last year's third quarter, operating income margin increased 110 basis points to 20.4% and diluted EPS grew 16.7% to $3.14. I thank our employees whom we call partners for their continued focus on our customers, our shareholders, and each other.  The Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segment revenue for the third quarter of fiscal 2023 was $1.72 billion compared to $1.55 billion last year. The organic revenue growth rate was 10.8%. While price increases contributed at a higher level than historically, revenue growth was driven mostly from increased volume. Our sales force continues to add new customers and penetrate and cross-sell our existing customer base. Businesses prioritize all we provide including image, safety, cleanliness, and compliance.  Our First Aid and Safety Services operating segment revenue for the third quarter was $231.6 million compared to $213 million last year. The organic revenue growth rate was 7.8%. The segment was up against a difficult revenue comparison because last year's third quarter revenue included about $15 million in sales of COVID-19 test kits that did not repeat this year. Excluding the prior year test kit sales, the organic revenue growth rate was 16%. We continue to have good momentum in our First Aid Cabinet business, which continues to grow greater than 20%.  Health and safety of employees remains top of mind. We provide businesses with access to quick and effective products and services that promote health and well-being in the workplace. Our Fire Protection Services and Uniform Direct Sale businesses are reported in the all other segment. All other revenue was $242.2 million compared to $194.3 million last year. The fire business revenue was 105 -- $155.8 million and the organic revenue growth rate was 20.7%. Uniform Direct Sale business revenue was $86.5 million and the organic growth rate was 32%.  Now before turning the call over to Mike to provide details of our third quarter results, I'll provide our updated financial expectations for our fiscal year. We are increasing our financial guidance. We are raising our annual revenue expectations from a range of $8.67 billion to $8.75 billion to a range of $8.74 billion to $8.80 billion. The total growth rate of 11.3% to 12%. Also, we are raising our annual diluted EPS expectations from a range of $12.50 to $12.80 to a range of $12.70 to $12.90, a growth rate of 12.6% to 14.4%. Mike?
J. Michael Hansen: Thanks, Todd, and good morning. Our fiscal 2023 third quarter revenue was $2.19 billion compared to $1.96 billion last year. The organic revenue growth rate adjusted for acquisitions and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations was 11.8%. Gross margin for the third quarter of fiscal 2023 was $1 billion compared to $898.2 million last year, an increase of 15.1%. Gross margin as a percent of revenue was 47.2% for the third quarter of fiscal 2023 compared to 45.8% last year, an increase of 140 basis points. Energy expenses comprised of gasoline, natural gas, and electricity were a tailwind, decreasing 15 basis points from last year. Strong volume growth from new customers and the penetration of existing customers with more products and services helped generate great operating leverage. Gross margin percentage by business was 47.1% for Uniform Rental and Facility Services, 51.6% for First Aid and Safety Services, 48.5% for Fire Protection Services and 35.8% for Uniform Direct Sale. Operating income of $446.8 million compared to $407.6 million last year. Operating income as a percentage of revenue was 20.4% in the third quarter of fiscal 2023 compared to 20.8% in last year's third quarter. Fiscal 2022 third quarter operating income included a $30.2 million gain on an equity method investment transaction. The gain was recorded in selling and administrative expenses. Excluding this gain, fiscal 2023 third quarter operating income as a percentage of revenue was 20.4% compared to 19.3% in last year's third quarter, an increase of 110 basis points.  Our effective tax rate for the third quarter was 22.1% compared to 18.2% last year. The fiscal 2022 third quarter equity method investment transaction included a significant tax benefit. Excluding the transaction, the effective tax rate for the third quarter of fiscal 2022 was 19.6%. Net income for the third quarter was $325.8 million compared to $315.4 million last year. This year's third quarter diluted EPS of $3.14 compared to $2.97 last year. However, fiscal 2022 third quarter diluted EPS contained $0.28 from the gain on the equity method investment transaction, which included a related $0.07 tax rate benefit. Excluding this gain and the related benefit -- the related tax benefit, fiscal 2023 third quarter diluted EPS of $3.14 compared to $2.69 in last year's third quarter, an increase of 16.7%. Cash flow remains strong. On December 15, 2022 we paid shareholders $117.4 million in quarterly dividends, an increase of 18.6% from the amount paid the previous December.  Todd provided our annual financial guidance related to the guidance, please note the following: fiscal 2022 included a gain on sale of operating assets in the first quarter and again on an equity method investment in the third quarter. Excluding these items, fiscal 2022 operating income was $1.55 billion, a margin of 19.7% and diluted EPS was $11.28. Please see the table in our earnings press release for more information. Fiscal 2023 operating income is expected to be in the range of $1.77 billion to $1.80 billion compared to $1.55 billion in fiscal 2022 after excluding the gains. Fiscal 2023 interest expense is expected to be $112 million compared to $88.8 million in fiscal 2022 due in part to higher interest rates. Our fiscal 2023 effective tax rate is expected to be 20.7%. This compares to a rate of 17.9% in fiscal 2022 after excluding the gains and their related tax impacts. Our financial guidance does not include the impact of any future share buybacks and we remain in a dynamic environment that can continue to change. Our guidance contemplates a stable economy and excludes significant economic disruptions or downturns. I'll turn it back over to Paul. 
Paul F. Adler: And that concludes our prepared remarks. Now we are happy to answer questions from the analysts. Please ask just one question and a single follow-up if needed. Thank you.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. And our first question comes from Manav Patnaik from Barclays. Please go ahead, Manav. 
Manav Patnaik: Thank you. Good morning. I was just hoping you could talk about -- clearly, you had strong results in the quarter, so I assume all the trends that you're hearing from your customers were solid but have you seen any changes more recently with all the events that have occurred out there in the banking world and if that's impacting kind of the small business confidence where you guys have more kind of exposure to?
Todd M. Schneider: Good morning Manav. Thanks for the question. It is -- we're watching it very closely. Certainly, there's rumblings when you read the newspapers every day and what's going on in the marketplace, but our customers seem still quite solid. And it's always a very competitive marketplace, and we're competing quite well there. They like our products and services, and we help them run their business better. So -- and help free them up to take care of items to where they can focus on their business. So we like our value proposition and -- but we certainly prefer an environment where our customers are in a great strong economy. But we're not seeing it just yet. And -- but we're certainly watching it very closely and monitoring it and making sure that we're focused on providing great value for our customers.
Manav Patnaik: Got it. And then just as a follow-up, the growth has obviously been pretty strong, better than I think what we were expecting to, but you said most of that growth was mostly volume. And so I was just wondering on the volume piece, is it that you're taking maybe more share than normal? Or is it just that these businesses are starting to get back to more normal capacity, and so there's more of that volume recovery that's aiding that?
Todd M. Schneider: Yes, it's a good question. There's a whole lot of inputs to our success in growing our revenue at the levels that we're growing at, and it is exceeding our expectations. Certainly, new business is quite good. We really like that. Our retention levels are very attractive. Cross-sell that we've spoken about in the past is continuing to improve. And as we mentioned, pricing is above historical, but the volumes are really coming from the three areas that I mentioned. Keep in mind, the majority of the new accounts that we sell are new to our segment, meaning we call them new programmers, so we're growing the pie, not taking -- just taking share. We certainly love to do both, but growing the pie has been something that we are quite good at and have done consistently over the years, and we still -- we think the future is quite bright there.
Operator: And our next question comes from Andrew Steinerman from JPMorgan Securities. Please go ahead, Andrew. 
Andrew Steinerman: Hi. Without just one quarter left in the fiscal year, I just wanted to ask what the organic revenue growth year-over-year for the fourth quarter 2023 is implied in the upgraded fiscal 2023 guide?
J. Michael Hansen: Andrew, the fourth quarter guide would contemplate 6.5% to 9.5% revenue growth. But keep in mind, we've talked a lot about the direct sale business, which grew 32% in the third quarter, and it is coming up against tougher comps. And so we just don't see that kind of growth continuing and settling back into what we would say is a typical growth rate for direct sale in that low single digits. So that's the primary change that we see in the fourth quarter.
Andrew Steinerman: Right. And so for the rental business, you're expecting a similar growth rate in the fourth quarter than you had in the third?
J. Michael Hansen: Well, I'll say this, Todd, just talked about the -- we haven't seen much change in customer behavior and the demand has still been really good and the momentum in the rental business is good. And while I'm not ready to say we're guiding to a specific number, we don't see much change to it coming into the fourth quarter. Momentum still is strong.
Operator: And our next question comes from Faiza Alwy from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead, Faiza. 
Faiza Alwy: Yes. Hi, good morning. I was hoping to talk a little bit about -- you've historically seen your results have accelerated beyond what the [Technical Difficulty] would suggest, and you've talked about new verticals and the benefits at the implementation. So curious, how much more run rate do you see in both of those areas as we look ahead to next fiscal year and potentially [Technical Difficulty]?
Todd M. Schneider: Faiza, I'll start, and then Mike can certainly chime in. As far as our results are quite good, we usually do grow in multiples of GDP. And -- but we like where we are and where we're heading. Regarding SAP, we're very much in the early innings of SAP. That is the umbrella of our technology investment or the digitization of our business. And we went through all the implementation, which we're still -- there's always work to be done there. But nevertheless, we're seeing benefits from our technology investments. Our customers are seeing benefits from our technology investments. And we certainly love when we derive efficiencies from technology, but we get even more excited when our customers see benefits, giving us a competitive advantage in the marketplace. So we've talked in the past about the certain advantages that we get with technology investments. My Cintas portal is one of the more obvious ones that the customers see an advantage. They get to be able to manage their account. They make request the majority of our requests are done outside of normal business hours. So our customers don't always just want to be able to deal with our service provider in person or call our office during normal business hours. So they like to be able to do the flexibility to do business on their time and to get things off their list and move it on to ours. And that portal allows that flexibility for them and it's showing up in customer satisfaction and customer loyalty. So yes, very much on the early innings of our technology deployment, I can certainly speak more to that, if you like.
J. Michael Hansen: Before you get into that, Todd, I just might remind -- provide a reminder that, look, we love the market opportunity also for our business. And it's -- we look at it as a very, very big opportunity. So in other words, when we talk about we have a little bit over 1 million customers, there are 16 million customers or 16 million businesses in the U.S. and Canada, we're just continuing to try to highlight that there is a great market opportunity, and Todd brought up the point that when the majority of our new business is expanding the served market or tapping into that large market potential, it means that we can grow in those multiples of GDP and employment growth for a long period of time. I think it's important to keep that in mind as you think about the growth potential over the longer term, that market opportunity is great.
Faiza Alwy: Great, that's really helpful. Maybe on the -- I mean, I would love to hear more about the technology so I'll leave it up to you in terms of how much more you'd like to share. But maybe specifically on the healthcare vertical, could you talk about what the growth trends have been like there, what they were like this particular quarter and sort of how they've been trending?
Todd M. Schneider: Certainly, the healthcare business is a great vertical for us. We have spent years organizing appropriately around that with our service providers, our sales partners, and we've organized around products and services that they find attractive. And so a good example of that is -- let me back up, so our growth rates are very attractive there. They're in excess of where we're running in totality and they're primarily due to what I just described, but also some specific products that we have launched. And we've spoken a little bit about the scrub business. When the scrub business historically was not a real attractive business for us and the reason being it was low-quality products, heavy low margin, and just they were kind of not treated as a disposable, but pretty close to a disposable product. And we changed the game on that when we launched our garment dispensing service there, which controls the inventory levels for our customers. And here's the big thing is it what it -- because the technology controls it and only allows what the administrator of the hospital says each person can get, then what allows us to do is to provide a higher quality product but not be dealing with such low cost, low margin products. The customer is happier, we control the cost so much better because the inventory is controlled. So that's a great example of one of the innovations that we brought to the healthcare industry. That certainly is a technology that people value, and it's helping us grow that business really attractively. And we're still very much in the early innings of that. So hopefully, that gives you a little more color.
Operator: And our next question comes from George Tong from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead George.
George Tong: Hi, thanks, good morning. I wanted to dive a little bit more into the selling environment. Can you discuss what you're seeing with client sales cycles, budgets, and client headcount and what the implications are for the business?
Todd M. Schneider: Yes, thanks for the question George. I would say that the selling environment is very similar. It has not really changed much. Sales cycles, they're not elongating the -- what's going on with our customers, they're still fighting to bring people on to make sure that they're providing the right levels of service. And in these types of environments, we help provide value to them. We provide a benefit to them running their business. And in many cases, we're able to help customers save money from what they were doing. So I spoke earlier about when you walk into a customer and they're not a programmer, well they still have products that -- probably that they have procured on their own kind of a do-it-yourself and they're struggling to keep up with that. And in many cases, because of our scale and our ability to source products and the fact that we are already there, servicing them in many cases, we can provide great value for them and actually help lower their costs. So -- and we've seen that throughout the years, and that's a real benefit as we go through trying to provide value for our customers. So, generally speaking, George, I would say the selling environment is pretty similar -- not a whole lot of change over the past six months or so.
George Tong: Got it. That's helpful. And as a follow-up, you increased your full year guidance pretty much across the board. How much of that increase was driven by fiscal 3Q outperformance versus your internal expectations compared to a stronger fiscal 4Q outlook?
J. Michael Hansen: George, I don't know if I can specifically separate the guidance raise. But clearly, we had a nice third quarter and the performance was strong from the organic growth to the gross margins to the operating margin. So a pretty solid quarter all the way through. And our guide for Q4 would suggest we expect more of the same. So the guide would suggest we expect another nice quarter. Hard to separate though for us exactly what the difference is because our internal expectations are a little bit different than our external, I'll say, consensus and guide.
Operator: And our next question comes from Stephanie Moore from Jefferies. Please go ahead Stephanie. 
Hans Hoffman: Hi, this is Hans Hoffman on for Stephanie. Thanks for taking my question. Just wanted to ask on margins, specifically the First Aid and Safety gross margin. Obviously, really strong and almost 52%. Is that just a function of kind of lower margin PPE sales rolling off and higher-margin cabinets business kind of becoming a larger part of the mix or is there anything else kind of to call out on the performance there and how should we be thinking about margins in that business on a go-forward basis?
Todd M. Schneider: Yes, Hans, it's a good question and good morning. Certainly, we're very happy with the trends that we're seeing in the gross margin in the First Aid business, but we're very happy in general with the First Aid business. It is -- execution is at a very high level. Certainly, the mix of business is we're benefiting from since PPE sales and safety sales tend to be lower margin, but there is strong demand for what we are providing. Health and Wellness is resonating in the marketplace. The mantra that we have in that business is what's more important to a business than the health and safety of their people. So -- and that is resonating. And so we're getting good leverage from the growth and the mix, but strong execution and we really like how we're operating in that business.
Hans Hoffman: Got it, thanks. And then just for my follow-up, I wanted to ask on the -- all other segment. Clearly, really strong growth there in the quarter. And I know last quarter, you guys kind of talked about tougher comps, specifically in the Uniform Direct business in the second half of this year. I was just kind of curious what kind of drove the strong performance this quarter, as I think a lot of us kind of expected that to kind of show up in Q3?
Todd M. Schneider: Yes. It's -- certainly, the comps in Q4 are quite challenging and as Mike mentioned, we do expect that to moderate. The Uniform Direct Sale business is a little lumpier and sometimes, things come through based upon customer demand a little faster or what have you. But certainly, the comps in Q4 are tougher, and that's part of our guide.
Operator: Our next question comes from Andrew Wittmann from R.W. Baird. Please go ahead Andrew. 
Andrew Wittmann: Yes, great, thanks. And good morning everyone. I guess I was hoping, Mike, you could talk a little bit about some of the relevant inflationary factors that are driving so much, the stress in the overall economy. But specific to your business, I was wondering if you could talk about the -- basically the COGS or merchandise costs, whether it's for uniforms, mats or the ancillary services that you provide as well as address how labor is progressing in your business, have those things generally been -- have you been able to get leverage on those items despite the challenges, in other words, are those down as a percentage of revenue in the quarter, can you just talk about the trend lines that you're seeing in those if there's any moderation or acceleration in them?
J. Michael Hansen: Sure. So I'll start with material cost, Andrew. Let me start with we source or direct the sourcing of more than 90% of our volume and more than 90% of our items have more than one source. And that's really important to keep in mind so that when our vendors may have inflationary pressures on them, the thing to remember is we have choices. And so sometimes that means we do have to take increases, but many times, it means we have -- we can flex and we can negotiate and we can -- again, we have choices. And so we don't always have to accept every vendor price increase that comes our way when we direct to sourcing ourselves and when we have multiple sources, that's really important. The other thing is, obviously, the amortization of this bucket of expenses allows us to see ahead, to anticipate what's coming.  So as you can imagine, when a vendor does come to us and has a price increase, that -- it takes a while to, first of all, build the inventory and then it goes to our distribution centers. And then for after a turn, it comes into our rental locations, and that's where the amortization starts. And in month one, we have 1/18th of that inflation for garments, for example, 1/48th of that for entrance mats. And so you can kind of get a feel for it. It takes a long time for those inflationary pressures to come to us. That means we can do lots of planning. We can think about initiatives that we have going on, and we can accelerate some of those. We can think about process improvement and we can implement those, but we can also give in at least one annual price increase and maybe multiple price increases before that full inflation hits us. So we can really get ahead of that kind of cost. So we have choices, and we can really see ahead of that. And that gives us a really nice opportunity to plan the business without a lot of disruption.  The other thing I'll say, Andrew, is we've got a lot of infrastructure. We've got a lot of facilities and trucks and things, rents. And those aren't quite as disrupted by inflation or at least immediately. And so again, we can get with our great growth, we can get some really nice leverage on that part of our cost structure. And then when you think about labor that you touched on, Andrew, we certainly want to make sure that we are maintaining the absolute best partner engagement that we can, and that means we like to be at market or slightly above market rates, that's important for us in terms of the labor rates. But we've talked about -- we've had a couple of things happen over the course of the last five or six years. One is, we had a lot of gene case synergies being realized over the course of the last six years, and that allowed us to be a little bit more aggressive on raising rates. So we were never caught flat footed in terms of when the labor challenges hit. That was -- that's been important to us, and it's been -- it has allowed us to kind of keep disruption down.  But the other thing is, we've talked a lot about initiatives like Smart Truck. We talked a lot about the technology impacts in our facilities that allow us to be more efficient. So that means as we are growing, we don't need to add as many resources within the plants or on the routes, and that allows us to leverage that labor environment even in this period of time where we've got raising labor rates.
Todd M. Schneider: Mike, if I can add, Andrew, certainly, in this type of inflationary environment, it's challenging to grow gross margin. We've been quite successful in doing so. Getting good leverage on that revenue has been key for us. But managing our variable costs, it's -- that is just simply part of our culture, managing it very, very closely. So that's been big. But to Mike's point, in leveraging some of our digital transformation, Smart Truck has been very important to us. And then also the -- managing our inventory at our used stock rooms has been really important. And we have good systems in place there that allows us to get better reuse, which is better for the customer because the speed at which we can provide products goes up because it's right there available locally, don't have to get it from a distribution center and ship it into us. And it also, obviously, helps the amortization schedule when you can get better reuse of that current product that you're already paying for. So, the leverage that we're getting as a result of the systems and processes we put in place with technology have -- are paying off.
Andrew Wittmann: Great, that's helpful. I guess just for my follow-up, I wanted to ask about, I guess, the balance sheet, Mike. I mean by -- in the next quarter or two, you'll be at about one times leverage, which is on the lower end of where you've historically run the company. And with the company doing effectively $2.2 billion of EBITDA and growing, there's a cash flow being very strong, you're going to have not only the ability to leverage the balance sheet plus the cash coming in, that's a lot of capital to deploy. How do you deploy that capital in a world where we haven't seen that amount of capital being -- having been deployed really since you guys did G&K, like you said six years ago, how do you keep the balance sheet geared appropriately and what are the opportunities that are out there for you?
J. Michael Hansen: Well, the first thing that I'll say is the most important thing for us is to make sure that we're investing in the right way for a long-term success of the business. And so we want to make sure that we are growing capacity as needed with our growth, that we're training our partners, that we're doing the things that we need to do to continue to grow long term. We are still -- we still want to be very acquisitive. It's hard to pinpoint when those may or may not happen, but we want to continue to be acquisitive. We talked about the dividend a little bit and that we've raised it almost 20% this past year. And certainly, while we didn't do any buybacks in the last quarter, that remains an opportunity for us as we look forward. Andy, we want to make sure that we are prudent in the way that we invest our cash. And so sometimes that means we may take a little bit longer to deploy cash but we want to make sure more than anything. Job number one is, long-term growth of the business, both on the top line and on the bottom line and are we doing the right things in order to make that happen and then prudently look for ways to enhance that.
Operator: And our next question comes from Tim Mulrooney from William Blair. Please go ahead Tim. 
Samuel Kusswurm: Hey, this is Sam Kusswurm on for Tim. Thanks for taking my questions here. I guess to start on the margin side, lower energy costs were 15 basis point benefit during the quarter. I'd imagine this dynamic is going to continue for the next few quarters. I was wondering if you could help frame for us the pacing and size of any benefit you're expecting, if you have any color to provide there?
Todd M. Schneider: Well, certainly Sam, we watch the energy prices very closely. Fuel, as in diesel and gasoline, hasn't changed that much year over prior. Natural gas, we're watching, and we expect that, that will be a benefit in the near future and the electricity it doesn't change a whole lot. So I wouldn't say that you can count on significant tailwind there. We are certainly not when you think about energy as a percent of sales, I think we came in at 2.15% energy as a percent of sales. So we like when they're coming down, and we manage it as they're going up, but I wouldn't expect a real change there.
J. Michael Hansen: Yes, just to frame it a little bit, Sam. Last year in the fourth quarter, our total energy was 2.5% of revenue. In the first quarter, it was 2.4%. This time, it was 2.15%. So we may see a little bit of a benefit in Q4 and Q1. But boy, we've worked so hard to get this to be such a small part of our cost structure that I'm not sure the benefit is going to be that significant one way or the other.
Samuel Kusswurm: Got you. I appreciate the color there. I guess for a follow-up, you've spoken before about Smart Truck and I think you just mentioned the question previously for the riding software. Now it's been over a year since kind of for filling it out. I guess I'd be curious if you could help quantify a benefit to your margins and if you still think there is a sizable benefit remaining there from further durations or adoption?
Todd M. Schneider: Yes. Good question, Sam. Yes, we absolutely see opportunities still to come with Smart Truck. It's -- one of the things that we are very careful about is it's -- when you route a new customer, that's one thing. But when you are rerouting your existing customer base, we're very judicious about that because changing the face of the service provider can sometimes bring issues, meaning they love their service provider and now you change it. So you got to be really careful with that. So you're going to see -- I would expect benefits in that area for years to come. And that shows up in energy, in emissions, but it shows up also in productivity because our partners have more time to spend with the customers and they can provide more value to the customers. And as one of the things we talk often about here is, we don't generate any revenue when the wheels are moving. It's only when the wheels stop. So we're very focused on that, but you're going to see it, I think, for years to come.
Operator: And our next question comes from Seth Weber from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead Seth. 
Seth Weber: Hey guys, good morning. Hey Mike, I just wanted to ask about free cash flow. It was a little bit below what we were looking for in the quarter. Is that -- do you feel like just a transitory function of revenue growth ramping a little bit better, and you're just kind of getting a little bit behind on working capital or can you just talk us through how you're thinking about working capital going forward? Thanks. 
J. Michael Hansen: Well, I'll say free cash flow, I think your point is a good one from the perspective of -- it's a little bit transitory, but in the way of, look, we're coming off of a fiscal 2021 year where there wasn't a lot of growth and then really getting some nice acceleration into fiscal 2022 and 2023. And so there is a little bit of -- as we have used capacity through the pandemic, we've gotten back into a time period where we need some capacity here and there. And we've been really good at managing the capacity in many different ways, whether it is, for example, better efficiency in our existing wash alleys to adding a washer to adding a dryer to maybe then adding a new facility. But we've gotten to the point where it's time to add capacity again, and that's healthy. But I would call that there is a little bit of a mismatch there that we're catching up a bit from that. Having said that, look, we still expect free cash flow to be very, very strong. And whenever we're growing nicely, we're going to use some working capital. That's just the nature of our business. And that's a good thing. But you're right, there's a little bit of a catch-up in our capital expenditures, and we'll start to I'll say, those will get more in sync as we go into the next year and following years, assuming there's no other economic disruption.
Seth Weber: Okay, that's helpful. And so do you think CAPEX could go back to that 4% of revenue range where you kind of work towards the end of the last decade or -- and then it went to like 2% a couple of years ago, I'm just trying to understand where...?
J. Michael Hansen: Yes, it's going to be close -- we certainly don't expect it to be down at that 2% level. It's going to be closer to that 4% level as we think about moving forward.
Operator: And our next question comes from Heather Balsky from Bank of America. Please go ahead Heather. 
Heather Balsky: Hi, thank you. You talked a fair amount during the call about your success with new customers and that a lot of them are what you call non-programmers. And I think a key theme that's been discussed on multiple calls is the shift to outsourcing and an acceleration kind of in that trend. I'm just curious, as you kind of look to what happened in the third quarter and as you're looking out, kind of your thoughts on how that trend continues, do you see it normalizing, or do you think there's further momentum into the next few years? Thanks.
Todd M. Schneider: Yes, good morning Heather. I'd say that trend continues. There's still people, our customers still are -- there's still 10 million job openings, folks trying to attract talent and trying to run their business and provide the levels of service that their customers expect. And when we have the ability to outsource items for them at very competitive rates, and again, in many cases, because we're already there, then that makes it quite attractive. And it's one of these like, oh my gosh, you can take this off my plate, then please, take it off my plate. And we leverage that and we'll continue to leverage that. So economic cycle aside, customers still need to take care of their customers and we can help them do exactly that. So we'll be focused on providing that value and managing our cost structure so that we can do it at very competitive rates.
Heather Balsky: Great, thank you. And I guess as my follow-up, you discussed earlier that you are looking for M&A opportunities, although you don't know kind of when those might occur. I'm curious, can you talk about your priorities with regards to M&A, are there white space areas you want to fill in, is it geographic opportunities, just what are your priorities? Thanks. 
Todd M. Schneider: Yes, good question, Heather. So we're interested in M&A, certainly in our rental business, in our First Aid business and our Fire business. And we make acquisitions every year, every quarter, it seems in each of those businesses. But they're usually reasonably small. Some of them are geographic expansion, some of them are tuck-in. So it's a real mixture. And M&A tends to ebb and flow a bit. It's tough to predict timing, but we're interested in M&A in all those businesses. They have to be the right businesses, meaning well-run businesses, but large, medium, small, we are interested in all and each of those businesses.
Operator: And our next question comes from Toni Kaplan from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead Toni. 
Toni Kaplan: Thanks so much. Wanted to ask about your staffing right now, are you being more cautious now because of the environment or not because I know you mentioned you haven't really seen a slowdown yet in your customer base. So maybe nothing has really changed, so I just wanted to think about how you're thinking of staffing going forward?
Todd M. Schneider: Yes, Toni, [Technical Difficulty] today. The labor market in general is easier than it was six months ago. It's certainly not easy still. And so we're focused on staffing at the level to make sure that we provide really good customer service. And so that's where we are. We will adjust accordingly if the economic cycle changes. And we're watching it really closely, as you can imagine, to make sure that we're providing the right service, the right value to our customers. But we certainly have a watchful eye out to understand if demand starts to change based upon what's going on in the broader economy.
Toni Kaplan: Terrific. And I wanted to ask about pricing. You mentioned a couple of times on the call that price contributed more this quarter versus in the past. And so is that -- I just wanted to understand, is this a function of you had been raising prices a lot and now you are sort of at -- and you're still raising or like is the rate of change on pricing still higher versus before or it's just the prior price increases still coming in? Thanks. 
Todd M. Schneider: Yes, Toni. So our pricing, it varies based upon -- pricing is a local subject. So we handle it differently in different businesses and different geographies. So that being said, yes, our pricing is above what it has been historically. That being said, the volume growth is the majority of our growth. And the reason being is the inflationary environment is such that we have to pass on a larger price increase than we do historically. Fortunately, the customers are -- they understand that. They understand the environment, and we've been very successful in providing the right levels of service so that they are open to those adjustments. We're not here to give guidance beyond Q4 but certainly, if the work of the Fed is such that it brings inflation down, then we'll manage our business accordingly to match that.
J. Michael Hansen: Toni, I might just add that the pricing that Todd talked about earlier is relative to historical levels, not -- we were not pointing out that there is a sequential increase in that level of pricing. So if that's where your question might have been coming from, it's really that relative to the historical levels of pricing. We're certainly above that, but not a real change in practice sequentially.
Operator: And our next question comes from Shlomo Rosenbaum from Stifel. Please go ahead Shlomo. 
Shlomo Rosenbaum: Hi, thank you very much. I want to ask back on kind of the questions Manav was asking about initially. Just in terms of the client base that you have, it's interesting like the ADP National Employment Report is talking about small businesses have been shedding jobs basically since August. Are you not seeing that at all in your client base or is it that you just skew more towards midsized and larger clients, I just want to get a little bit further into how to read some of the kind of economic reports versus the very strong results that we're seeing at Cintas?
Todd M. Schneider: Yeah, thank you Shlomo for the question. We have a really diverse customer base. And so no, we are not more geared towards the medium-sized -- small, medium, large customers, geographic, different verticals. We have a really diverse customer base. And when you think about our business now, it is more geared towards the service economy than it is just goods producing. And so you name it, we've got it. We've got some small customers that are struggling. We've got some that are thriving. And that is really more dependent upon their business, there maybe -- their particular environment. And the same goes for the medium and the larger customers. It's a real mix and we work with them. So we have a customer who is particularly struggling, then we pivot and try to adjust accordingly. If their demand is such that it's coming down, then we pivot and handle it accordingly. But again, we also have other products and services that they might be procuring elsewhere where we might help them and provide cost savings to them. So, it varies based upon the customer but we are focused on providing that value and we will continue to focus on that. 
Shlomo Rosenbaum: Okay, great and then just following up on Toni’s question on the pricing, is there any change at all in customer behavior in terms of the continued pricing, is there any more pushback or its kind of the same that you have had over the last say two to three quarters?
J. Michael Hansen: Yeah, well there is always pushback from customers, always have and always will be. The current environment with inflation levels make it an opportunity for us to do so better than historical, larger than historical. But I wouldn’t tell you that the environment has changed dramatically. But certainly inflation is starting to, it appears to come down and so we are managing our business accordingly and we will manage our customers accordingly as well. 
Operator: And the next question comes from Scott Schneeberger from Oppenheimer. Please go ahead Scott. 
Scott Schneeberger: Thanks, good morning everyone. I guess, on -- the focus on margin question, could you provide a little bit of attribution, a 110 basis points just operating income improvement year-over-year is really impressive, could you kind of provide what was that via the topline as opposed to where were you getting efficiencies on the cost lines, and maybe elaboration to the extent you are able of what was Smart Truck, what was just automation in the facilities, what was SAP, really, that's where the question is focused on the cost lines, where are you getting the most benefit presently? Thanks. 
J. Michael Hansen: Well Scott, look, it starts with great growth. And when we are growing our top line at healthy levels, we're going to get some nice leverage. I talked a little bit about in a previous response, I talked a little bit about that the cost structure of having some costs that are a little bit in that infrastructure type of a bucket that when we grow real nicely, we get some great leverage. And that happened in all of our businesses. The growth that we saw in the third quarter was broad-based in all four of our businesses, and that leads to some really nice leveraging in each of those businesses. I talked a little bit about that amortizing aspect of material costs, particularly within the rental business, and again that allows us to see things coming, and it allows us to plan accordingly. And so again, the growth helps in that area, but it also allows us to think about things like process improvements, Smart Truck that you mentioned. And in all of our businesses, we've got those kinds of initiatives. And all of them are -- we're hard at work in all of them. And so we're seeing benefits from process improvement. Some are just simply better improvements, better training, and some are technology related, like the Smart Truck. We've got all of them in each of the businesses, and that is adding to it.  Now certainly, the First Aid margin moving from 12.4% last year to 20.4% this year, there is the mix benefit that we're certainly getting in that space. But we also have lots of other good things going on in there. We are sourcing better in First Aid and Safety. And we do have some really nice process improvement opportunities going on there, and we've initiated Smart Truck in the First Aid and Safety business and in the Fire business. So certainly, First Aid has been a big part of that margin improvement, but we've seen it all. So it's hard -- I don't have specific numbers to give you, Scott, but it starts with great growth and leverage and then we get into better sourcing, process improvement, technology gains, and certainly then healthy mix. All of those things have contributed.
Todd M. Schneider: Scott, I'd just like to add, certainly what Mike was talking about, it starts with great growth. That is so critical to us. But part of our culture here is we're focused on extracting inefficiencies out of our business. And we've -- and I spoke earlier that there's a lot of inputs to revenue growth, and there's a lot of inputs to margin improvement. And Mike went through a list, which was pretty darn comprehensive. But generally speaking, the -- I'll just say that we're focused on and we're not going to just grow through pricing, and we're going to find a way in these types of environments to extract the inefficiencies so that we can grow margins, which in these type of inflationary environments are certainly is very challenging, but the team is doing a heck of a job, and we're quite proud of it.
Scott Schneeberger: Sounds good, I appreciate the overview. Sounds like a lot of good momentum. You all touched upon My Cintas portal earlier. It sounded like maybe a little bit more you're willing to share. Just curious what percent penetration do you have there, where do you anticipate that to go? And you mentioned that gets used at all hours of the day, but I'm just wondering what inning are we in, and any quantification of benefit of if customers are using that, how much more is that efficient in financially if there's anything you can share on that? Thanks. 
Todd M. Schneider: Yes. Certainly, Scott. It is -- you're talking about changing behavior within customers. So it tends to be a higher percentage of new customers that are coming on board that are participating at a high level. And the reason being is, it's new behavior, period. So then changing the customer -- the current customer behavior takes longer. And because they're used to a certain way of how we're doing business and some are leaning into it faster than others. But we're -- we see a very long runway here of benefits that we're going to get. And where does it show up? It shows up in so many places, but certainly trying to be easier to do business with is a focus here, and it makes it easier to do business with us. So I think you'll see that benefit for years to come.
J. Michael Hansen: It's a little bit of an evolution with My Cintas in that a customer starts to use it and they like the benefits. And so there's -- they then start to grow in the way that they use it and expand. And as we continue to see that growth too, we can add more options and other functionality to that, that over time grows and grows. And so this is not a -- we have flipped the switch on My Cintas and now let's see how many people we get, how many customers we get adopting. This is really -- we've opened it and this is going to grow -- just the product itself is going to continue to grow and add opportunity for us. So more and more customers will be added, but also more and more functionality will come with it into the future. And so to Todd's point, this is a journey, and it's an evolution, and we are in the very early stages of it.
Operator: And at this time, there are no further questions. I'd like to turn the call back over to Paul Adler for closing remarks.
Paul F. Adler: Okay, Ross. Thank you all for joining us this morning. We will issue our fourth quarter fiscal 2023 financial results in July, and we look forward to speaking with you again at that time. Good day.
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2023 Q2  (2022-12-21 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Cintas Second Quarter Fiscal Year 2023 Earnings Release Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Paul Adler, Vice President, Treasurer and Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
Paul Adler: Thanks, Russ, and thank you for joining us. With me is Todd Schneider, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Mike Hansen, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We will discuss our fiscal 2023 second quarter results. After our commentary, we will open the call to questions from analysts. The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a Safe Harbor from civil litigation for forward-looking statements. This conference call contains forward-looking statements that reflect the company's current views as to future events and financial performance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those we may discuss. I refer you to the discussion on these points contained in our most recent filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. I'll now turn the call over to Todd.
Todd Schneider: Thank you, Paul. Second quarter total revenue grew 13.1% to $2.17 billion. Each of our businesses increased revenue at a double-digit rate. The benefits of our strong revenue growth flowed through to our bottom line. Operating income margin increased 70 basis points to 20.5% and diluted EPS grew 13% to $3.12. I thank our employees whom we call partners for their continued focus on our customers, our shareholders and each other. Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segment revenue for the second quarter of fiscal '23 was $1.71 billion compared to $1.54 billion last year. The organic revenue growth rate was 11.3%. Revenue growth was driven mostly from increased volume. Our sales force continues to add new customers and penetrate and cross-sell our existing customer base. Businesses prioritize all we provide including image, safety, cleanliness and compliance. Challenge with labor scarcity and rising costs, businesses continue to turn to Cintas to help them get ready for the workday. Additionally, price increases contributed at a higher level than historically. We believe such a mix of revenue drivers, volume and price is healthy and supportive of continued long-term growth. Our First Aid and Safety Services operating segment revenue for the second quarter was $236.0 million compared to $202.2 million last year. The organic revenue growth rate was 15.1%. This rate reflects the continued momentum of our First Aid cabinet business, which continues to grow more than 20%. Whether it is COVID-19 or influenza, the health and safety of employees remains top-of-mind. We provide businesses with access to quick and effective products and services that promote health and well-being in workplace. Personal Protective Equipment or PPE, while still elevated compared to pre-COVID levels, declined slightly on a sequential basis. The revenue mix-shift benefits our financial results because the cabinet service is a more consistent revenue stream and has higher profit margins than PPE. Our Fire Protection Services and Uniform Direct Sale businesses are reported in the All Other segment. All Other revenue was $228.9 million compared to $184.9 million last year. The Fire business organic revenue growth rate was 18.0% and the Uniform Direct Sale business organic growth rate was 33.9%. Before turning the call over to Mike to provide details of our second quarter results, I'll provide our updated financial expectations for fiscal year. We are increasing our financial guidance. We are raising our annual revenue expectations from a range of $8.58 billion to $8.67 billion to a range of $8.67 billion to $8.75 billion, a total growth rate of 10.4% to 11.4%. Also, we are raising our annual diluted EPS expectations from a range of $12.30 to $12.65 to a range of $12.50 to $12.80, a growth rate of 10.8% to 13.5%. Mike?
Mike Hansen: Thanks, Todd, and good morning. Our fiscal 2023 second quarter revenue was $2.17 billion compared to $1.92 billion last year. The organic revenue growth rate adjusted for acquisitions, divestitures and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations was 12.8%. Gross margin for the second quarter of fiscal '23 was $1 billion compared to $885.1 million last year, an increase of 15.5%. Gross margin as a percent of revenue was 47% for the second quarter of fiscal '23 compared to 46% last year. Energy expenses comprised of gasoline, natural gas and electricity were a headwind, increasing 10 basis points from last year. Strong volume growth from new customers and the penetration of existing customers with more products and services helped generate great operating leverage. Gross margin percentage by business was 47% for Uniform Rental and Facility Services. 50.5% for First Aid and Safety Services. 47.4% for Fire Protection Services, and 37.2% for Uniform Direct Sale. Operating income of $444.9 million compared to $381.2 million last year. Fiscal '23 second quarter operating income increased 16.7% and operating income margin increased 70 basis points to 20.5% from 19.8% last year. Our effective tax rate for the second quarter was 22.1% compared to 18% last year. The tax rate can move from period-to-period based on discrete events, including the amount of stock compensation expense. Net income for the second quarter was $324.3 million compared to $294.7 million last year, an increase of 10.1%. This year's diluted EPS of $3.12 compared to $2.76 last year, an increase of 13%. We had to overcome higher inflation, interest expense and tax rate, therefore we are especially pleased with these financial results. Cash flow remains strong on September 15th, 2022. We declared dividends and pay them on December 15th, 2022 in the amount of $117.4 million in quarterly dividends. To provide our annual -- Todd provided our annual financial guidance related to the guidance. Please note the following. Fiscal '22 included a gain on sale of operating assets in the first quarter and a gain on an equity method investment in the third quarter. Excluding these items, fiscal '22 operating income was $1.55 billion, a margin of 19.7% and diluted EPS was $11.28. Please see the table in our earnings press release for more information. Fiscal '23 operating income is expected to be in the range of $1.75 billion to $1.79 billion compared to $1.55 billion in fiscal '22 after excluding the gains. Fiscal '23 interest expense is expected to be $113 million compared to $88.8 million in fiscal '22 due in part to higher interest rates. Our fiscal '23 effective tax rate is expected to be 20.7%. This compares to a rate of 17.9% in fiscal '22 after excluding the gains and their related tax impacts. Please keep the following in mind when modeling third quarter versus fourth quarter financial results. The number of work days in the third and fourth quarter of fiscal '23 are unchanged from fiscal '22. There are 64 days in the third quarter and 66 days in the fourth. Less work days results in less revenue to cover certain fixed and amortizing costs. In last year's third quarter, First Aid and Safety sold about $15 million in COVID test kits. We don't expect that revenue to repeat this year. Uniform Direct Sale organic revenue growth rates have been very strong year-to-date, however we expect these rates to be pressured in the second half of the fiscal year as the business faces increasingly challenging comparisons. Payroll taxes reset in our fiscal third quarter, increasing our SG&A costs on a sequential basis. Our financial guidance does not include the impact of any future share buybacks and we remain in a dynamic environment that can continue to change. Our guidance contemplates a stable economy and excludes pandemic related setbacks or economic downturns. I'll turn it back over to Paul.
Paul Adler: That concludes our prepared remarks. Now we are happy to answer questions from the analysts. Please ask just one question and a single follow-up if needed. Thank you.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Faiza Alwy from Deutsche Bank Securities. Please go ahead, Faiza.
Faiza Alwy: You've had really good results. So congratulations on that. I'm curious how would you characterize your outperformance. Has it been more because of new business? Has pricing come in sort of better than you expected? And maybe as part of that, if you could talk about your SAP program, like how much of a benefit do you think that has had over the during the course of this year?
Todd Schneider: Good morning, Faiza. Thank you for your question. Yes, we, our beat on the revenue side are driven significantly by new business, it's continues to be a very attractive for us. But we are selling more items into our customer base. So it's pretty broad. I mentioned in the prepared comments that pricing is above what our historical experience has been. As you can imagine, due to the experience with inflation that we're seeing across our organization. But it is -- but the primary drivers volume growth and we're benefiting from that. We're investing for that and things are -- we like the trend there. As far as on the margin side, we are committed that we are not going to be solely focused on growing margins because of pricing. In fact, we are dedicated to finding efficiencies in our business, some of that is through revenue leverage just general revenue leverage that we get, but we are focused on finding efficiencies and you mentioned SAP certainly that technology is helping us significantly. We've had -- we've talked about our -- the digitization. Our digital transformation of our business that has been very, very important to us and we're seeing benefits whether it's in our routing efficiencies, productivity of our sales partners, be getting better reuse of our products, in-service inventory because of SAP. Those are all benefits that we're seeing and the marketplace is noticing it and it's helping us with a competitive advantage in the marketplace.
Faiza Alwy: Great. And then as we look ahead some companies have started talking about, started sounding a little bit more cautious, as you know, a lot of economists are forecasting a potential recession. Talk about how do you, how does, you talked previously about how your business might get impacted, but talk about like what's the sales pitch during a recession. I think that would be helpful for us to hear.
Todd Schneider: Great. First off, we continue to watch our customer base very closely. We're looking at all of our data to see if there's some trends that we might see if customers are consuming less and what have you. So we're watching that. Now as far as in a recession every recession that I've been -- I've experienced while at Cintas over the last 33 years, we've always sold an attractive amount of new business. And the reason being is, we hope businesses and in an environment, that we help them, position them for success as far as, if they're in the business and they have less people, then somebody still has to take care of certain functions. So we're able to sell value there. If they are in an environment where they're looking to save money, there's in many cases we're able to save them money. It's not that they are. We're always asking for increased spend. It's just redirect the spend to us. And in many cases, we're able to help customers with that instead of spending it with some other vendor or with an outsourced item that they bring it to us. And we can bring efficiencies to them. So we fully expect that we -- our new business will be attractive in any type of economic environment. Certainly, we prefer when the economy is growing robustly, but we'll find ways to be successful in whatever the environment.
Operator: And our next question comes from Ashish Sabadra from RBC. Please go ahead, Ashish.
John Mazzoni: Hi, this is John, filling in for Ashish. Congratulations on the strong results. Maybe just following-up on Faiza's question, could you talk more about kind of retention, as well as just what the current customer conversations are going like today? Thanks.
Todd Schneider: Yes, thank you, John. I'll speak to it if, Mike, if you'd like to contribute on this subject. But, first off, our retention levels are quite attractive. We very much like where they are. We're focused on making sure that our customer is - it's why we wake up in the morning, is to take care of them, and that focus that culture is pervasive and we're making sure that our partners are positioned to be able to make sure they can take care of them and exceed their expectations. So all that is attractive for us and keep in mind we have a really broad customer base. So we serve over million customers that we see on a very consistent basis. Some are doing some are challenged in the current economic environment, whether they struggle to find people or they're struggling with the wage inflation or inflation in general and then we have other customers that are thriving in this type of environment and frankly we have everything in between. And but generally speaking, what we see are, it's still -- we still like what we see with our customer base. And I think that broad customer base is a real benefit for us.
John Mazzoni: That's great color. Thank you. Maybe quickly to follow-up. Could you just talk about capital allocation and if there's any change there, just what you're seeing today in M&A given some of the more challenging headwinds with inflationary pressures?
Mike Hansen: Sure, John. This is Mike and we haven't changed our philosophy in terms of capital allocation. We want to continue to invest in the business. And certainly, as we've seen the accelerated growth over the last three quarters, we are investing in the business, but we love M&A and we continue to have all of the discussions to try to keep that pipeline active, but it always takes to come to a decision and we are working those conversations hard and our expectation is that we will be able to continue in the M&A path, but that's we certainly love that option. And certainly, we -- I misspoke a minute ago on dividends. We paid a dividend in September - on September 15th, we paid another one on December 15th, and we certainly have increased the dividend every year we've gone public. We like that option as well and then the buyback continues to be an opportunistic alternative for us when we have excess cash, so no philosophy changes. We're still working all of those in the same way that we have.
Operator: Our next question comes from George Tong from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead, George.
George Tong: You mentioned you're continuing to sell more items to your existing customers. Can you describe how overall customer spending behaviors have evolved with the overall economy and if sales cycles have changed at all?
Todd Schneider: Thank you, George, for the question, and good morning. Again, we have a very broad customer base. And we have a very broad product offering and we're blessed to have both and as a result we're organized in a manner where we're trying to make sure that our customers know everything that we have to offer, they don't always. We've spoken in the past about how going through the pandemic was really, really challenging. One of the positive outputs of that was the fact that our customer base saw the broadness of our offering and in many cases didn't realize we had products and services that we have. So we're focused on that. We're trying to provide more value. When we do that, it is, it helps us because we're -- when we stop our truck and the invoice is larger that's good leverage for us. So we'll provide more value to the customer and we're getting leverage in that manner. So all that's positive. So as far as the sales process being elongated. We're not saying that at this point. And as I mentioned earlier, we are certainly seeing a mix out there. Some customers are struggling and some are doing quite well and everything in-between. But generally speaking the customer base continues to head in a positive manner.
George Tong: Got it. That's helpful. The upside in revenue this quarter was driven I think significantly by new business. Approximately how much of the new business growth in the quarter came from the no programmer market or Uniform Rentals?
Todd Schneider: Yes, good question, George. So no programmers continues to be a really great opportunity for us. The majority of our new accounts that we sell are in the no programmers section. And so we've been focused on that. We train our partners on that. And those that set of prospects sees value in what we provide. And as a result, the TAM is massive and so that's very exciting for us and we see very nice growth opportunities into the future.
Operator: And our next question comes from Andy Wittmann from R.W. Baird. Please go ahead, Andy.
Andy Wittmann: I guess I wanted to ask on the First Aid segment, Mike. The margins in particular I think really stood out. You made the comment that you're getting some favorable mix shift as the PPE is rolling out. Last quarter's margins were also very good. I think better than most people expected. So it feels like there's something pretty sustainable in the margin rates. Would you agree with that assessment or is there something in there that we should be aware of as we come to 2Q fiscal '24 as a tough comp or something, maybe just some detail as to what's really driving these margins that are really frankly kind of a step function better than what you put up in the past?
Todd Schneider: Yes, Andy, you're right, the margins are better than historical. The mix shift has been great. We have a -- there's a number of areas where we're able to gain leverage. Certainly the new business is a very nice lever for us. The change in -- I'll call it society and the focus on health and wellness is a real tailwind for us. And so as a result of that cabinet revenue growth is very attractive for us that affects the mix, but we are also finding, I mentioned we've got -- we're finding efficiencies in throughout our business. And First Aid is included in that. And so whether it's routing technology. We've been on SAP and First Aid for a little bit longer, but we're finding efficiencies and we have a very strong supply chain that is finding opportunities to source better and improve our overall operating margins. And Mike, anything you'd like to contribute there?
Mike Hansen: The only thing I might add is to specifically, Andy, nothing to call out that there is one-time or short-term in nature. It's just that the business is performing very, very well.
Andy Wittmann: Great. I guess kind of similar question, different segments on the Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment. Obviously, you're getting good gross margin leverage, which says a lot about all the things you've already talked about. You mentioned making investments in the business. It appears that the SG&A line and the Uniform Rental segment in particular has been seeing investments there. And I was just wondering maybe you could provide some detail as to what kinds of investments you're making or if it's maybe just still kind of return from COVID and getting some travel and T&E back in there. Maybe just a little detail about SG&A in the rental segment.
Todd Schneider: Yes, Andy, good question. We're excited about the gross margin improvement that we're seeing in that business. Despite a 20 basis points headline that we're that we're up against in energy still. So, you're right, the SG&A is up. It's there is we're making investments in the business and appropriately so. Also some G&A medical costs, workers' comp and what have you are higher this quarter and there's always some puts and takes as it relates to that, but we are guiding towards for the whole year in that business, incrementals in the 20% to 30% range and we are, as I mentioned, that margin expansion is going to come in a number of ways, but revenue growth leverage, productivity, which is a broad word, right. There are so many areas where we get productivity improvements and pricing. But, yes, so we're focused on improving the margins there and we'll manage through the G&A investment, the SG&A investment as we move forward.
Operator: And our next question comes from Tim Mulrooney from William Blair. Please go ahead, Tim.
Tim Mulrooney: Two questions. One on labor. We've heard from others -- other industries and companies that labor availability today still remains somewhat a governor growth. I mean has that been the case for you guys? Are you holding back in certain markets due to constraints around qualified labor and just generally how would you characterize the labor availability situation today versus say last quarter?
Todd Schneider: Thanks for the question, Tim, good morning. As far as labor is concerned, the -- I'll call the labor market in totality, easier, but not easy. It is still certainly challenging there. We care passionately about how that looks for our customers and how it impacts our customers. I mentioned some are struggling to staff still and as a result, that affects their business, which impacts us. So but from his standpoint of Cintas and how we're staffed that is not affecting our growth rate, it would be more about how our customers are impacted. I can tell you it wouldn't go well here. If someone said I can't grow as fast as you think I should because I can't staff. We figure that out and we think the environment that we provide for our partners where they have great opportunities and a great wage and benefits and great security and great development is a real advantage for us in the marketplace. So as far as Cintas staffing that is not slowing us up. Certainly, our customers could be impacted by that to some degree.
Tim Mulrooney: That's good. That's good color, Todd. I mean, it's good to know, I mean there are some companies we've talked to that are literally dialing back on sales and marketing costs just because they can't find a labor to support the growth. So that's good to know you guys aren't in a situation. One more from me on wage rate inflation. I'm curious what that's running at approximately right now for your folks actually out on the routes and how does that compare to your historical averages? Thank you.
Todd Schneider: Yes. Wage rates. I don't have an exact number to give you, but we start with the answer and work backwards. And the answer is, we've got to have great people, we've got to have really well-trained and prepared people who can help us be successful and take care of our customers. So is above historical. Yes, it is above historical but nevertheless we're focused on putting the very, very best team out on the field, so that we can take great care of our customers and prepare us for the future of this organization.
Operator: And our next question comes from Manav Patnaik from Barclays. Please go ahead, Manav.
Manav Patnaik: Thank you. I guess just to follow-up a little bit. There's a lot of press out there around C-Suite anxiety, right. And I just wanted to know, historically, I guess, how long before that starts flowing all the way down to kind of your direct customers on the street and how quickly can you react because your current guidance obviously is through me. And so things might be fine till then I was just curious if there is a timing element that we should be considering to.
Todd Schneider: Yes, Manav, thanks for the question. Yes, we always have anxiety, right. It's part of making sure you're sharp and but nevertheless it is, we do worry about do our, as an economy, do we talk ourselves into pulling back and is that happen to our customer base and does that happen as a ripple effect and but we're not seeing it. We're again, our customer base. It's so broad. Some are doing great. Some are not. But in general we like the direction of our customer base and we in many ways we hope they don't read the press and they stay focused on taking care of their business and investing for the future. And but we'll see what that holds and how the Fed handles things and how that might impact the general economy.
Mike Hansen: Manav, I might add, you go back 2.5 years to the pandemic to the beginning of the pandemic. I think we show that we can be pretty nimble when it comes to our cost structure and adapting to changes in the environment.
Manav Patnaik: Yes, that's fair. And Mike maybe if I could just ask a follow-up just on CapEx and free-cash flow expectations for the year. Any changes or help there?
Mike Hansen: Well, look, we -- what you've seen maybe in the first half of this year is when we grow and we've seen three quarters now straight of double-digit organic growth. So a nice actually four quarters, so a nice acceleration in the performance. And when we grow and the volumes are healthy, we certainly invest in the business and that investment can come through in the way of working capital. And so you see a little bit more working capital usage in our cash flow statement. And that's not necessarily unusual for us when we see an acceleration in the growth rate. But we like our cash flow. It will continue to be strong and this year should not be an exception to that. And that cash flow. I talked a few minutes ago about capital allocation and the cash flow that we've got going on this year will not force us to make choices. We can still do all of the capital allocation that we typically think about. So we like where we are.
Operator: Our next question comes from Andrew Steinerman from JPMorgan Securities. Please go ahead, Andrew.
Andrew Steinerman: Hi, Todd, Mike and Paul. I wanted to ask a little bit about merchandise amortization, kind of given the strength of Cintas' new business, which usually has uniforms going into service. You know, how did merchandise amortization affect gross margins? I mean rental gross margins in the second quarter? You know, obviously, I know rental gross margins were up despite any effect of merchandise amortization. And do you expect rental gross margins to be up in the second half of the year, year-over-year?
Todd Schneider: Andrew we -- as it relates to the amortization, certainly you've seen the growth that I've talked about a few times and that translates into more garments and other products being injected into our in-service inventory. And we love that. We love when that happens. And so we're seeing growth in the amortization. But we're able to leverage that pretty nicely so far. And you know our business well. We amortize many of those rental products. And so we have good foresight or visibility into what's coming. And that means we can plan, we can source, we can increase prices when necessary. So the visibility gives us a nice advantage in terms of how we think about other ways of operating the business. And as it relates to the second half of the year, look, we don't typically provide guidance on gross margin specifically. But certainly the guidance that we've provided contemplates improvement in our operating margins in the second half of the year and the growth that we have on the top line and all of the other initiatives and things we've got going on. They are performing well and enabling us to do that, to do that margin improvement even in a difficult period of time.
Operator: And our next question comes from Heather Balsky from Bank of America. Please go ahead, Heather.
Heather Balsky: Hi. Thank you for taking my question. So your guidance for the rest of the year, I guess, for the back half implies growth probably on the sales side and the 8% to 9% range, which is moderating from what you did in the first half. I'm curious if you could just walk us through kind of where you're assuming there might be some deceleration. Is that just as you come off lapping the COVID recovery and maybe where there might be opportunity for upside just based on the strength you've seen year-to-date?
Todd Schneider: Heather, thanks for the question. Yes, so a slight, but still very attractive growth. We like where that is. We're preparing for that. And but we are certainly up against some tougher comps in the back half, specifically with First Aid and Uniform Direct sale. So we'll be lapping those and but we like the growth levels and we find them quite attractive. And that's what we are preparing for.
Heather Balsky: Thank you. And do you think, you know, are there areas that you're seeing in your business. You know, you've done well year-to-date. You've raised your guidance sort of I know First Aid and Safety is very strong right now. Other sort of areas in your business, whether it's certain customers like your opportunity in health care or other business lines where you're really seeing outperformance and kind of growth beyond your typical run rate.
Todd Schneider: Yes, good question. So again, our customer base is very broad, but I'll tell you this that our verticals where we're investing are, you know, health care, hospitality, education, government are performing quite well and they're growing at an accretive rate to our growth. And we think we choose them wisely and invested in them appropriately. And that customer base is doing well. Within that customer base, again, you get a mix, but nevertheless in general we like that area and it's growing very attractively for us.
Operator: Our next question comes from Kartik Mehta from Northcoast Research. Please go ahead, Kartik.
Kartik Mehta: Thank you. I mean I know you've talked about the economy a few times. I'm wondering, as you look at some of the benchmarks for your business and maybe your customers businesses. Anything that stands out either that is positive that maybe you were anticipating would decline or anything that's negative that you are anticipating would be the other way.
Todd Schneider: Kartik, it's a good question. I continue to talk about how broad our customer base is. So you name it, we see it. But the scarcity of employee -- of workers is an issue. Unemployment is still at a very, very low level. There's still, I think, 10 million job openings in the U.S. economy. So as a result of that, you know, people are, I think, careful about how they're handling their employees and being judicious about that.
Kartik Mehta: And then just last question. Just from an energy standpoint, obviously fuel prices are coming down. It seems as natural gas prices are coming down as well. Is the headwind you're anticipating from energy prices maybe what you anticipated at the beginning of the year when you gave guidance to now? Has that changed at all?
Todd Schneider: Yes. So we still see energy as a headwind. And when you go to the pump right now, it is certainly a little bit lower than it was a quarter ago. But about 40% of our spend on energy is in natural gas for our production facilities and electric. And that is not heading in the right direction. Natural gas prices are up and electric prices are up. And so but certainly the attention more gets to everybody fills up at the pump for the most part, but not as much focus on natural gas or electric. But we're seeing it and it's I'm sure it's affecting households as well.
Operator: And our next question comes from Seth Weber from Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead, Seth.
Seth Weber: Hi, guys, good morning and happy holidays. I wanted to ask another margin question. Mike or Todd, I mean, the guidance for this year, the back half, it seems like you're the guidance kind of implies a higher than normal incremental margin. And I think, Todd, you mentioned the Uniform business could be 20% to 30% incrementals this year. Is this -- are we moving into a scenario where incrementals could be higher than your normal call it 20% to 25% range and maybe are you more comfortable talking in like a 25% to 30% range for the business going forward. Thanks.
Mike Hansen: Well, we haven't, Seth, we haven't really changed the narrative on that in terms of the 20% to 30%. But you know as -- there are different ebbs and flows within the business. And sometimes there are periods where we are investing maybe a little bit more than in other quarters et cetera. And, you know, Todd's focused on the full year results and the longer term results. And so there can be ups and downs, certainly, based on our guidance, we are contemplating margin improvement in the back half of the year. And I don't know that it's anything that we're ready to say is a new norm. It's just simply we look at the year and say we've got some really good incremental margins in that 20% to 30% range that will cause the full year margins to go up. But I wouldn't look at it as a new normal type of a thing. It's just simply there are ebbs and flows within the business and timing of investments, et cetera.
Seth Weber: Okay. That's helpful. Thanks. And then just on the Fire business, the organic growth in the Fire business continues to be in this sort of mid to high teens range. Is that a sustainable number or do you feel like for Fire and just sort of maybe any color on really what's driving that unusually strong organic growth. Thanks.
Mike Hansen: Yes, Seth, I'll take that one. We love the Fire business. It's a very attractive business for us, it's the only business we're in where every business legally has to comply with the local laws around it. So the TAM is absolutely massive. And our sales team is doing really well and we're selling into additional customers. We're selling more into our existing customers. We've got a great offering. We really like our position in the marketplace. And the team is doing a heck of a job. So, yes, we would like to continue to grow that business at double-digit rates. Can it achieve the levels that where we are today, that would be outstanding. But certainly double-digits is our focus for that business.
Operator: Our next question comes from Shlomo Rosenbaum from Stifel Nicolaus. Please go ahead, Shlomo.
Shlomo Rosenbaum: Thank you very much. I want to get a little follow-up on some of the questions on client hiring, which obviously could impact Cintas volumes. Do you feel like you really sell at a level in the organization that you get kind of an advance look at the hiring plans? Or is it really kind of you monitor it as it happens? So like in current you need to react because clients will just kind of add or subtract people kind of in the moment, but you don't -- it's not that you're getting a heads up on that. I'm just trying to understand like your view. Obviously, it's a very broad client base, but just in more generalities. And then there have been any changes, you used to talk about kind of an add stops metric. And I'm wondering if there's anything materially different in what that would look like now.
Todd Schneider: Shlomo, great question. It really depends upon -- our view of the what the staffing levels of our customers will be. It really depends upon where our relationship is some they'll share with us. Hey, calendar '23, here's what we're thinking. Others, they don't depending upon our relationship levels or their planning level. And so in that case, it's a little bit more reactive. So, you name it, we have that type of experience where it's very transparent and we have a good. We can see around the corner with our expectations there. And then some are just very reactive and we have to see what's going on with their customers. So but generally speaking with add stops, I would say, we see our experiences continues and the patterns that we have in the past. And I mentioned earlier that, I don't know, certainly Q1 speaking of the economy Q1, Q2 was GDP shrunk. Q3 was slightly positive. We'll see what Q4. holds in store for GDP. It's tough to tell, if we're in a technical recession or if we're not and what calendar '23 holds in store for us. But the employment situation in the U.S. is still tough to get people and as I mentioned there's 10 million job openings. We'll see if that continues to decline. But we're trying to make sure that we're positioned to grow and but as Mike mentioned, if the economy affects our customer base in a very negative manner, we'll be prepared to pivot and manage our cost structure appropriately and we're planning on being successful in whatever the economic environment brings to us.
Shlomo Rosenbaum: Thank you. Just one follow-up on just on the pricing. Is it kind of normal now for the clients to expect these pricing increases or is it are you getting any material push-back on them as this time is going on?
Todd Schneider: Shlomo, as I mentioned, in our prepared remarks, pricing is -- has always been a component of our growth. Same is the - what we went through with some serious economic turbulence with COVID-19 and what have you. So that being said, we're planning on growing our business most attractively through volume growth and getting leverage there and planning on growing margins via leverage on that revenue growth and finding efficiencies in our business. That being said, it's a very competitive environment. And as we talk to our customers, they certainly challenge us. And they want us to find efficiencies in our business and not just pass along cost to them and that's what we're focused on.
Operator: Our next question comes from Scott Schneeberger from Oppenheimer. Please go ahead, Scott.
Scott Schneeberger: Thanks very much. Good morning. Happy Holidays, everyone. First question in Uniform Rental. I'm just curious about the winning business you guys have obviously highlighted penetration of existing customers, strong volume growth, new customers. Could you speak to what is no programmer versus what is competitively won? Is there a lot of that activity right now of competitively won? And then if you could just kind of differentiate what you're seeing with large customers versus may be small and midsize in the context of that question. Thanks.
Todd Schneider: Yes, Scott. I'll start, Mike, if you want to contribute on this subject there. As far as the market, the competitive market. We sell a lot of no programmers. Certainly we do take business from our competitors, but that's, we find that there are so many businesses out there that say, wow, I didn't realize that you would serve a business of my size or I didn't realize you had those types of products and services and they see great value in what we do and so we're very focused on that. As far as the customer base, the larger customers, some of them are struggling, smaller ones are certainly some of them are struggling, but I would say, generally speaking, the smaller ones are probably a little under a little bit more pressure just because it's tough to attract retain staff, pay people and at the levels that you have to be competitive in the marketplace. So that's kind of a generalization that may not be completely fair and I could give you plenty of examples of smaller businesses that are thriving. But that's kind of a generalization I thought I might share with you.
Scott Schneeberger: Great. Thanks. And then as a follow-up, specifically, Uniform Direct sales, I think it was about 33%, 34% organic growth in the quarter. Very strong. I heard you mentioned on an earlier question that would be a segment facing some tougher comps in the back half of the fiscal year. If you just speak to kind of what the business activity has been there, what's driving the strong growth right now? What type of customers? Has it been particularly lumpy or is it been just a solid, broad based versus maybe just one or two big customer wins? Just a little bit more elaboration on that business line. Thanks.
Todd Schneider: Sure. Good question. Very broad based. It's not one customer or a couple customers. It's very broad based. And when you think about that, that area, certainly hospitality is a big component of it, but there's other customers that are national and scope type customers. But hospitality specifically I'll speak to, yes, they're struggling to staff, but there's a lot of demand out there in the hospitality sector. And as a result they need help. And you know and when you think of that, when they're struggling to staff and they have to provide products and services, we've become a very attractive opportunity for them to sole source and to provide products that they can get quickly and that are very attractive and allow them to provide the proper guest experience that they want to provide for their patrons.
Operator: And our next question comes from Toni Kaplan from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead, Toni.
Toni Kaplan: Thanks very much. I wanted to ask a follow-up on pricing. I know you've been sort of putting through a higher level of price than normal recently, and now it sounds like, you know, obviously you've mentioned a couple of times that volume is going to be a bigger driver to growth. But I guess my question is pricing going to be more of a normal increase versus prior years or, you know, based on, you know, like the challenging macro, although you said you're not seeing it yet, like is it going to be lower than normal or roughly around sort of a normal year for pricing in calendar '23?
Todd Schneider: Yes, Toni, good question. As we think about pricing in the future, it certainly is above historical today. It's tough to predict what inflation holds in the future. But presuming that comes down, I'd say you'd see us closer to historical from a price adjustments. But it really depends upon what happens with the Fed, what happens with the economy, what happens with wage pressures are so many inputs. And that one's tough to predict. So but we're watching it very closely.
Toni Kaplan: Great. And then when you think about the margin expansion implied and you mentioned sort of higher margin expansion in the back half of the year, is that like I guess how much of it is a result of like energy costs coming down from prior levels or maybe inflation having reached its peak and coming down like I guess how much of it is that versus scale or initiatives, if you could give any sort of breakdown or examples of where the margin expansion will come from? Thanks.
Mike Hansen: Toni, I would say, it comes from a lot of different places and it's hard to put a number on any particular one of them. But, you know, a couple examples. Energy, we've kind of looked at that, as Todd mentioned earlier, still is a little bit of a headwind going forward. So we're not necessarily expecting we'll get a bunch of energy benefit in the second half of the year, but our revenue growth has been really strong and the performance the momentum has been good and that certainly will continue to help in the second half of the year when we grow at real nice levels like we've guided towards and like we've had in the first half of the year, that always helps our ability to drive better margins. But we've talked over the last year or so about important initiatives that we have. Those remain and continue to do well and those are things like our routing improvements through our smart truck initiative. And we have more of those, whether it is sourcing initiatives that Todd touched on in First Aid or others. But those initiatives become very important to us, too. And then there are just some timing of things, maybe some investment in the first half of the year that was really helping propel our growth and continue our momentum. That may not be at the same type of level in the second half of the year. So it's a lot of those different pieces that kind of fall together. And it's, you know, it's hard to put numbers on every single one of those.
Operator: And at this time there are no further questions. I would like to turn the call back to Paul for closing remarks.
Paul Adler: All right. Well thank you for joining us this morning. We will issue our third quarter of fiscal '23 financial results in late March and we look forward to speaking with you again at that time. Take care.
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2023 Q1  (2022-09-28 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to Cintas First Quarter Fiscal Year 2023 Earnings Release Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Paul Adler, Vice President and Treasurer, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Pardon me, interruption, Mr. Adler, we're unable to hear you.
Paul Adler: Thank you. Yes, we were still on mute. So, thank you for joining us. With me is Todd Schneider, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Mike Hansen, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We will discuss our fiscal 2023 first quarter results. After our commentary, we will open the call to questions from analysts. The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a Safe Harbor from civil litigation for forward-looking statements. This conference call contains forward-looking statements that reflect the company's current views as to future events and financial performance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those we may discuss. I refer you to the discussion on these points contained in our most recent filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. I'll now turn the call over to Todd.
Todd Schneider: Thank you, Paul. We are pleased with our start to our fiscal year 2023. First quarter total revenue grew 14.2%. Each of our businesses increased revenue at a double-digit rate. The benefits of our strong revenue growth flow through to our bottom line. Excluding a one-time gain recorded in last year's first quarter selling and administrative expenses, operating income margin increased 20 basis points and EPS grew 12.3%. Our sales force continues to add new customers and penetrate and cross-sell our existing customer base. Businesses prioritize all we provide, including image, safety, cleanliness and compliance. In challenge with labor scarcity and rising costs, businesses continue to turn to Cintas to help them get ready for the workday. I thank our employees, whom we call partners, for their continued focus on our customers, our shareholders and each other. Turning now to our business units. Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segment revenue for the first quarter of fiscal ‘23 was $1.70 billion compared to $1.51 billion last year. Organic revenue growth was 12.3%. Revenue growth was driven mostly from increased volume. Additionally, price increases contributed at a higher level than historically. We believe such a mix of revenue drivers volume versus price is healthy and supportive of continued long-term growth. Our First Aid and Safety Services operating segment revenue for the first quarter was $234.2 million compared to $199.1 million last year. Organic revenue growth was 15.8%. This rate reflects the continued momentum of our First Aid cabinet business, which continues to grow more than 20%. Personal protective equipment or PPE, while still elevated compared to pre-COVID levels declined again on a sequential basis. We welcome this mix shift because the cabinet service is a more consistent revenue stream and has higher profit margins in PPE. Our Fire Protection Services and Uniform Direct Sale businesses are reported in the All Other segment. All Other revenue was $234.5 million compared to $189.7 million last year. The Fire business organic revenue growth rate was 17.4% and the Uniform Direct Sale business organic growth rate was 44.1%. Before turning the call over to Mike to provide additional details on our first quarter results, I'll provide our updated financial expectations for our fiscal year. We are increasing our financial guidance. We are raising our annual revenue expectations from a range of $8.47 billion to $8.58 billion to a range of $8.58 billion to $8.67 billion. Also, we are raising our annual diluted EPS expectations from a range of $11.90 to $12.30 to a range of $12.30 to $12.65. Mike?
Mike Hansen: Thanks, Todd, and good morning. Our fiscal 2023 first quarter revenue was $2.17 billion compared to $1.9 billion last year. The organic revenue growth rate adjusted for acquisitions, divestitures and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations was 13.9%. Gross margin for the first quarter of fiscal ‘23 was $1.03 billion compared to $902.8 million last year, an increase of 13.9%. Gross margin as a percent of revenue was 47.5% for the first quarter of fiscal ‘23 compared to 47.6% last year. Energy expenses comprised of gasoline, natural gas and electricity were a headwind increasing 30 basis points from last year. Gross margin percentage by business was 47.5% for Uniform Rental and Facility Services, 49.6% for First Aid and Safety Services, 48.8% for Fire Protection Services, and 37.3% for Uniform Direct Sale. Operating income of $440.1 million compared to $394.1 million last year. Excluding last year's first quarter gain totaling $12.1 million and recorded in selling and administrative expenses, fiscal '23 first quarter operating income increased 15.2% and operating income margin increased 20 basis points to 20.3% from 20.1% last year. Our effective tax rate for the first quarter was 14.8% compared to 11% last year. The tax rate can move from period to period based on discrete events, including the amount of stock compensation expense. Net income for the first quarter was $351.7 million compared to $331.2 million last year. Last year's first quarter diluted EPS contained $0.09 from the previously mentioned gain and related income tax expense. Excluding the gain and the related income tax expense, this year's diluted EPS of $3.39 compared to $3.02 last year, an increase of 12.3%. First quarter operating cash flow increased 13.8%. On June 15, 2022, we paid shareholders $97.7 million in quarterly dividends. Also during the quarter, we purchased $210.8 million of Cintas common stock under our buyback program. We continue to allocate capital in many ways to improve shareholder return. Our strong balance sheet and cash flow enable us to do so consistently. Todd provided our annual financial guidance. Related to the guidance, please note the following. Fiscal '22 included not only the gain on sale of operating assets in the first quarter, but also a gain on an equity method investment in the third quarter. Excluding these items, fiscal '22 operating income was $1.55 billion, a margin of 19.7% and diluted EPS was $11.28. Please see the table in our earnings press release for more information. Fiscal '23 operating income is expected to be in the range of $1.72 billion to $1.76 billion compared to $1.55 billion in fiscal ’22 after excluding the gains. Fiscal ‘23 interest expense is expected to be approximately $110 million compared to $88.8 million in fiscal '22 due in part to higher interest rates. Our fiscal ’23 effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 20%. This compares to a rate of 17.9% in fiscal ’22 after excluding the gains and their related tax impacts. The expected higher effective tax rate will negatively impact fiscal '23 diluted EPS by approximately $0.32 and diluted EPS growth by approximately 290 basis points. Our financial guidance does not include the impact of any future share buybacks and we remain in a dynamic environment that can continue to change. Our guidance contemplates a stable economy and excludes pandemic related setbacks or economic downturns. I'll turn it back over to Paul.
Paul Adler: That concludes our prepared remarks. Now we are happy to answer questions from the analysts. Please ask just one question and a single follow-up if needed. Thank you.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We'll now take our first question from Ashish Sabadra of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Ashish Sabadra: Thanks for taking my question. I was wondering if you could just comment on the new business trend, specifically around signing up new customers. Have you seen any changes there? And any signs of elongations of sales cycle, particularly for larger customers? Thanks.
Todd Schneider: Good morning, Ashish. This is Todd. Thanks for the question. Yeah, our new business is quite robust. We continue to be very successful in converting over no programmers into our programs in all of our businesses with the exception of fire, which obviously – they were all -- everyone's a programmer in that business, but we're having really good success there. And we look at the total addressable market and it's still incredibly large and growing. So that's exciting for us. But as far as the sales cycle, I haven't seen anything that would lead me to believe that the sales cycle is elongating. We've got really good momentum in our new business. I'm very encouraged by that. And as we've spoken about in the past, some of our investments that we have made are really paying off big in the form of some of our unique products in our rental line with our Carhartt products, our Chef Works and we've got a CareFlex line of scrubs through land out that's really successful in our unique restroom lines. And then our First Aid business, just the breadth of products that we're offering is really helping us get in the door and provide great products and services to our customers. They're also seeing our investments and technology that we've made, whether it's our garment tracking that is giving us a real advantage in the marketplace, our garment dispensing that we've seen. And I've spoken about our myCintas portal, which is unique and advantage in the marketplace. It makes it easier to do business with us and that's important for our customers and gives our sales partners confidence in walking in the door. So some really good things in -- heading in that direction.
Ashish Sabadra: That's very helpful color and obviously great to see that strong momentum in the top line. Maybe just on the margins, the question around energy looks like, oil prices might be rolling-off here or at least the fuel prices may be rolling-off, but the natural gas prices are going up. How should we think about those puts and takes on the energy front for the rest of the year? Thanks.
Todd Schneider: Yeah. So when you think about our energy spend, certainly, it's up over where we were a year over prior. It's down 10 basis points sequentially. Trying to anticipate exactly where that's going to head is challenging. Certainly, but I can tell you this, we are focused on efficiencies that we can drive in our business that will lower our needs for natural gas and lower our needs for gas at the pump. and we're leveraging those and that's helping us. That helps us with our CO2 emissions and it helps us with our efficiencies in our business and our spend. And we're confident we can continue to make strides there. So that's where exactly natural gas prices will go this winter, what's going on in Europe and other areas. It's tough to tell for sure, but we'll manage through it and we see opportunities to improve in our business and we're leveraging that.
Mike Hansen: Ashish, I might add that right around 60% of our energy spend is the gas, or -- gas and diesel and the remainder is electricity and natural gas. So the natural gas is a smaller component of that energy spend. More of it is the price of the pump, which as you suggested, is coming down.
Ashish Sabadra: That's very helpful color. Thanks again.
Todd Schneider: Thank you.
Operator: We will now take our next question from George Tong of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
George Tong: Hi. Thanks. Good morning. In the quarter, approximately what percentage of new business growth came from the no programmer market?
Todd Schneider: Good morning, George. This is Todd. The majority of our accounts are -- come from no programmers. So that is -- that trend has been consistent over the years and continues. And in a marketplace where it's still difficult for employers to find people to work, offering a value of this and the way we handle it with uniforms is attractive for them. So it's another benefit for customers and they see that as an opportunity to attract their employees and retain their employees and we have one heck of an offering when it comes to that, that makes it really attractive for people. So I'd say those trends continue as they have in the past.
George Tong: Got it. Can you provide an update on uniform demand trends from the healthcare vertical?
Todd Schneider: Yeah, certainly. So the healthcare vertical is a very attractive vertical for us. It's growing nicely. Demographics are such in the United States and Canada that demand will continue. And we're seeing -- we have some unique offerings in that area with garment dispensing and our unique scrub line that makes it attractive. There's certainly other items that are -- that we rent into the healthcare market, whether it be an acute or non-acute. But we really like what we're seeing there from that demand. And I'll give you one example of a hospital that about six months ago, we sold a scrub rental program into that account. And it was a nice -- very nice sized customer that you would recognize a name. In that case, the nurses that we were providing the program to, they were wandering the products at home and the nurses voiced a concern about safety. Meaning, hey, what am I taking home? Am I wandering it? Am I wandering it correctly? And in that case, they chose Cintas because of a few things. One is, our technology that we've deployed that's unique that allows us to manage inventory for them, which provides the requisite access to the product, which is really, really important. And also helps control their costs based upon how we manage that inventory. But also improves the safety aspect of it, so separate from being an employee benefit, because those what I'll call potentially contaminated goods or scrubs. They don't go home. We laundry them appropriately via our hygienic process, hygienically cleaning process, which allows them to have the confidence that their process correctly and when that it's improved safety. And just as an anecdote, I mentioned that was about six months ago, just recently, we sold a microfiber wipe rental program to that same hospital. And so they use microfiber wipes in many ways, but the most obvious one is when they're cleaning guest rooms or patient rooms, we should say. In this case, that particular hospital they were purchasing those wipes and then they're having the, I'll call them hospital employees or EBS type folks that were cleaning those on their on-premise laundry. And in that case, they chose Cintas because it was able to -- we were able to reduce their labor costs. They're having trouble getting access to labor. And then again, we're processing those in a manner where they can have great confidence that they're processed correctly with a hygienically clean process. So you asked your original question, George, was about uniform demand in hospitals, which is quite good. But it also, there's so much that we can provide to those hospitals. And I just want to give one example to just give a little color around that.
George Tong: Very helpful. Thank you.
Todd Schneider: Thank you.
Operator: I will now take our next question from Andy Wittmann of Baird. Please go ahead.
Andy Wittmann: Great. Thanks for taking my questions. I guess, Mike, I just wanted to talk a little bit about what is implied in the guidance here. Maybe couple of different ways to think about that. But how much conservativism is baked into the guidance? And I made a couple of comments in the prepared remarks. Is there any change maybe sequentially to the guidance the way you're factoring in the macro outlook? And maybe any leading indicators that you can give us -- that gives us confidence that the economy is performing at the rate that you think it is?
Mike Hansen: Well, so let me start, Andy, with the guidance. The guidance implies and we're 60 days past when we gave the initial guidance. The guidance implies really good growth through the rest of the year. But as you know, we do face some tougher comps as we saw the business pick up last year throughout the year. And so we would expect a little bit of deceleration from the growth levels of where we are, but still healthy growth and ending the year in a range of 9% to over 10%. And we like the momentum of the business today and our expectation right now is that we're not seeing any change in the value that our customers are seeing and we're not changing -- we're not seeing any change in the way in the economy, I'll say. Now -- maybe I'll flip to margins briefly. Our margin expectation remains that we will see margin improvement during the year and that range that we provided certainly contemplates that margin improvement even in a pretty challenging type of economic environment. So the guidance is a little bit better than we gave 60 days ago, part -- because of the first quarter, part because of the momentum that we see in the business. Now as it relates to -- trying to dissect what the economic picture is going to look like for the rest of the year, look, that can be pretty difficult, right? I mean, there are -- some who say we may be in a recession today. There are some who say we may be in a recession early ‘23. Some who say, we may be in a recession late in ‘23. The Fed has come out and said GDP for ‘23 is going to be 1.2%. It's hard to predict what we're going to see in the economic picture as we move forward. But what we know is that the momentum in our business today is really good. The value proposition that our customers see and our prospects see, they're reacting very positively to it. And because of that and many other factors, we believe that momentum can continue along with healthy margins. And that's what we've given you in our guidance. Does that help answer that question a bit?
Andy Wittmann: It does. Thank you for that. I guess, I wanted to -- then follow-up with a question on, I guess, overall customer retention levels. Considering that you're getting above historical averages in price increases, I thought maybe it would be helpful to comment on that. And you guys have talked about the sales momentum in a couple of different ways, but if you look at sales productivity on a per head basis, is that metric up on a year-over-year basis as well?
Todd Schneider: Andy, thanks for the question. This is Todd. First off on retention, yeah, retention is very good. We like where that is. We like the momentum around that. We're organizing around it appropriately to make sure that we're meeting and exceeding our customers' demands. And we like our -- the product and service offering that we have and the customers find it attractive. I mentioned some of the products and the technology that we have that are unique and the customers like it. I think they also like our approach that we took over the past couple of years about being really flexible and empathetic with them as they were going through, -- what they went through the various businesses through calendar '21 and calendar '22, -- '20and '21, I should say, with the pandemic. So I think that was -- that is benefiting us because they saw that we were -- we understood what they were challenged with and we pivoted to provide them what they needed instead of just telling them, hey, here's what you contracted to buy. So I think all that is paying off. As far as productivity in new business, yeah, we like it. It's up and we are -- certainly, we love our sales force. We think they're well trained, well positioned when sales partners have confidence in the products and the technology and the services that they're going to provide, that confidence is powerful and it's showing itself in productivity and we like that. We're also deploying up (ph) types of technology, via our investment with SAP, that's paying off in a number of ways. I'll just give you one as it relates to sales, which is investing in technology that allows for what I'll call best next prospect for a sales partner. Meaning instead of just calling blindly on businesses, we want to drive to our sales team who will be the next best prospect to call, which through analytics, we can tell them where to spend their time. And that's better for the partner, that's better for our company, again that provides more confidence. And yeah, so those types of investments are paying dividends for us.
Andy Wittmann: Great. Thank you.
Todd Schneider: Thank you.
Operator: We can now take our next question from Tim Mulrooney of William Blair. Please go ahead.
Tim Mulrooney: Yes. Good morning. We know energy was a slight headwind to margins in the quarter relative to last year, but gross margins were only down 10 basis points. So I was curious, how some of the other cost buckets are trending? How are labor costs trending? Were those a headwind or a tailwind to margins? And anything else big to point out here like maybe materials and supplies?
Mike Hansen: Tim, maybe I'll start on that. From a gross margin perspective, you're right. We're down 10 basis points from last year in a period where total energy expenses are up 30 basis points. We're up 190 basis points sequentially and so we've seen some nice improvement there. And look, when you think about that rental number of 47.5% that's a really good gross margin for us. We've only been higher than that a few times and that certainly is a much greater gross margin than we saw pre-pandemic. So we like the -- where we are in that space. We like the sequential improvement in the gross margin, which is pretty good. And we're doing it while we have -- we've seen such good growth in volume over the course of the last year and we're able to be pretty flat overall in gross margins while we're investing in the business. So in other words, that volume growth over the last 12 months has, we certainly created the need for additional capacity, particularly in our laundry facilities and we're investing as we should because we certainly want to make sure we have the capacity to serve the customer. And so nothing -- I would say nothing unusual to point out in there other than we continue to make the progress that we want to make. The only other thing I might say about that gross margin is, we're seeing an all-time high in our First Aid and Safety business. And we continue to like the way that business is trending and the mix back towards that First Aid business that we love so much. Todd mentioned that the First Aid part of that business is over 20% growth still. And we've seen some really nice movement there. So again, nothing real specific to point out other than making good sequential progress and certainly continuing to invest for our future growth.
Tim Mulrooney: Yeah. Thanks, Mike. I guess my follow-up will just stick on that point. The First Aid and Safety gross margin really stuck out to me in the quarter. I mean, you're almost at 50% gross margin in that business, well above what we normally see there. Are there any extraordinary items to call out there that help drive those strong results that wouldn't necessarily repeat moving forward? Just trying to understand how to think about gross margins in First Aid moving forward as we model out the business for the rest of the year?
Todd Schneider: Sure. Tim, it's Todd. We're proud of the gross margin improvement that we've made in the First Aid business. It is reflective certainly of the shift of the mix of the business. But I wouldn't say that there's anything that is out of the ordinary, where you'd say, oh, my goodness. Is there something that a one timer? So, no. Now that being said, we're -- certainly there will be puts and takes of the First Aid business gross margin throughout the year, don't think of it as a linear progression upward. It's -- we're making investments. We're growing that business really attractively. We are certainly leveraging -- trying to leverage as very much as best we can. The revenue growth that we're getting, but we've got to -- we've -- as Mike pointed out in all of our businesses, we've got to invest to meet the demand. And we're doing exactly that and trying to do it as intelligently and as efficiently as possible. But we're really happy with the demand levels that we're seeing and make sure we're positioned to meet those demand levels.
Tim Mulrooney: Okay. That's really helpful. Thank you, guys and congrats on a nice quarter.
Todd Schneider: Thank you, Tim.
Mike Hansen: Thank you.
Operator: We can now take our next question from Manav Patnaik of Barclays. Please go ahead.
Manav Patnaik: Thank you. Good morning. I can appreciate, obviously, all the trends are very strong today. As you said, no economic weakness you're seeing in your businesses, but maybe you can help us with typically if that does start impacting your customers, like, how quickly do you see it, how quickly do they react? And I guess what do you do in response to that?
Todd Schneider: Yeah. So Manav, good question. We are not seeing it in our customer base today. And as a reminder, -- as of Friday, there'll be four months into our fiscal year. And will we see it how well -- what's this recession? Are we in one, as Mike said, is there one coming in the first half of '23, the back half? We're not trying to predict all that, but we are staying acutely aware, but we're positioning ourselves to make sure that we can grow in all types of economic cycles. And as a reminder, we've grown in 51 out of the last 53 years. The only exception being the great recession. We certainly hope that any recession that comes is not as severe as what that was. And so what I'll call in, whatever the traditional type of recession, if that comes, then we expect good performance. We expect to grow. We have traditionally grown in multiples of GDP and jobs growth in the past. Mike spoke of our products and services are highly valued. You think about cleanliness, safety, image and compliance. Those are buying motors that are stronger today than they were in the past, certainly stronger than what they were even pre-pandemic. Our products and services are more diversified today. Our customer base is more diversified today than it was in the past. Today, we're 70% services and 30% goods producing. So that diversification we think will help us. And when you think about NAICS codes, we have no three digit NAICS codes that is greater than 10%. So again, a really nice diversification there. We have also invested as we've talked about in the past calls in our vertical sales approach which we think gives nice diversification into when you think about government and you think about healthcare, higher education, those types. We've spoken about our momentum that we think is really, really good. And also our strong cash flow, we think that will allow us to be opportunistic as we -- whenever we are into a recession if that is today or in the future, we're going to be well positioned to make sure we're successful.
Manav Patnaik: Okay. Got it. That's helpful. And then maybe Mike, if you could just remind us of your mix on the debt side between fixed and floating, whether you hedge just as we track these interest rate increases?
Mike Hansen: Sure. We have -- as of the end of August, Manav, we've got about $500 million in commercial paper or other short term variable debt. And the rest of our debt is fixed or senior notes. We do have some of our 27 maturities the interest rates locked on those. Those are right now, as you can imagine, a fair amount in the money So that's where we are today and look that the -- we like that, we like a little bit of that short-term debt because it gives us optionality. We can pay that down if we feel like we want to or we can certainly have more space to use that if we needed to.
Manav Patnaik: All right. Thank you.
Operator: And we can now take our next question from Andrew Steinerman of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Andrew Steinerman: Hi. It’s Andrew. I just wanted to get a quick thoughts from you about organic revenue growth for the balance of the year from kind of each First Aid, Fire, Uniform Direct. Those had particularly strong first quarters. I definitely heard your general comments about tougher comps. And like, do you think each of these three should be double-digit organic growers this year?
Todd Schneider: Andrew, thank you for the question. When I think about each of our businesses, we don't give guidance based upon each of them individually, but I'll just provide some maybe some top line thoughts. I'm really -- I haven't done the calculus on what it would be for the year, but I'm just thinking about Qs two through four for each. I would think about from rental, Fire and the First Aid business all being high-single digits of the balance of the year. Keeping in mind that there was some PPE in the First Aid business in Q3 which will provide a tougher comp for sure. And then in our Uniform Direct Sale business, we're going to be up against much tougher comps. So I would think of that from high-single to flat, maybe even negative in Q4 based upon the significant comps that we're up against there, which is obviously a little bit more lumpy business.
Andrew Steinerman: Just say that last part again about Uniform Direct Sale, high-single digit. And then you said flat, just -- you were talking about two through four. So just say the last part again about Uniform Direct Sale.
Todd Schneider: Yes. So when you think about Uniform Direct Sale business, again, a lumpier business, high single to -- from Q2 through Q4. Think about high-singles down to closer to flat to maybe even negative in Q4, due to sales growth due to the significant comps that will be up against on the back half of the year.
Andrew Steinerman: Makes sense. Thank you so much.
Todd Schneider: Great. Thank you.
Operator: And we can now take our next question from Faiza Alwy of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Faiza Alwy: Yes. Hi. Thank you. Good morning. I guess, I'm curious, like what has gone better than what you expected, when you first gave the guide a couple of months ago, especially as it relates to revenues. I know you mentioned better pricing and I'm curious if the pricing update has been better than expected or is that better new business? I know you mentioned the healthcare vertical in particular. So just more perspective on like what you think really drove the outperformance, specifically in the rental business?
Todd Schneider: Great. Faiza, thanks for the question. It's Todd. I'll start if Mike you want to chime in. There's many contributing inputs to our positive growth that we're seeing. New business is quite good as we spoke about, but retention and penetration is very attractive as well. We continue to improve upon our cross sell. And as you mentioned, pricing is certainly playing a larger role than it did historically, as it should because of the levels of cost increase that we are seeing via whether it's labor or material cost and what have you. So I think just generally speaking, we like the key inputs that we're seeing. I mentioned earlier our diversification into those various businesses, verticals, et cetera., they're all -- we like the momentum we're seeing in all those, so pretty widespread.
Faiza Alwy: Great. Thank you. And then just a follow-up on the labor environment. I don't know if you're seeing some easing in the environment in your business at this point. And I'm curious how you think about that going forward sort of, is that as a labor environment eases, is that a benefit for you? Or is that maybe more of a headwind from a competitive perspective?
Todd Schneider: Good question on labor. I'd say, easing a bit, but that's relative. It is still a very challenging environment. But maybe not as quite as challenging as it was six months ago, eight months ago, but still quite challenging. And we are in constant pursuit of a tracking and retaining the very, very best people. We think that gives us competitive advantage in the marketplace. So when we look out and say, okay, what does that mean to us? We're constantly in pursuit of that. So any easing of the labor market would certainly be welcome from a standpoint of making a little bit easier to run at lower RPMs. But here's what I know is we -- our team figures it out and they have -- they are staffed at the appropriate levels to meet our customers' demand. They've done one heck of a job in fighting through all these challenges over the past couple of years to make sure that we're positioned to be successful. So whatever the environment, our team will figure it out. We've shown that they'll be in the past. We’ll pivot appropriately, but -- so we'll manage through it.
Faiza Alwy: Great. Thank you so much.
Todd Schneider: Thank you.
Operator: We will now take our next question from Heather Balsky of Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Heather Balsky: Hi. Good morning and thank you for taking my question. On the new customer growth front, could -- you already touched on healthcare earlier in the Q&A, but where else are you seeing some of the momentum? Are there additional verticals where you're seeing outside growth or you're targeting verticals you haven't been in the past? It'd be great to get color on that. Thanks.
Todd Schneider: Heather, thanks for the question. Again, our experience is very broad in our successes that we're seeing. I'll just give you one another example that might provide a little color. In one of our verticals, where we're calling on the government sector. There's one particular city that I won't mention, but you'll know the name of it. About a year ago, we sold a uniform program into that city. And as an example there, that was into the sanitation, transportation, parts and recreation type departments. And in that case, they were using a local provider before we took over that account. And they chose us in that case because they liked our garment offering was better, meaning they thought we had better, more attractive garments that their employees wanted to wear. Our garment tracking technology help them to reduce costs, meaning less lost garments and what have you. And then as I mentioned earlier, our investment into our My Cintas web portal makes it may be easier for them to do business with us. So which reduces their administrative time and just helpful for them. So that was about a year ago and then, If you fast forward just recently, we sold them a First Aid cabinet service to all those departments and even more municipal buildings. And in that case, previously they had ordered all their first aid products online. So they were a no programmer. They were ordering it from whomever online and then they were essentially doing all that work and filling those candidates themselves. Inquisidentally, the sales lead for that opportunity came from our uniform service provider. So while they're the uniform service provider was speaking to the customer and they said, hey, we need help here. So the uniform service provider pass it on to our -- the appropriate person in our First Aid service provider. In that case, they chose us because, again, a better management of the products and we're able to help them manage the products better, improve their compliance, reduce their costs and remove their need to administer the program. So you think about what businesses are challenged with. In this case, it was a city government, but it's still, they're still running it as a business where they have to meet their customers' demands and their employees' demands. And I think another example of just how we are growing our business and why it's attractive for businesses, sticky, good retention, good cross sell and that shows itself in new business. Hopefully that color helps a little bit.
Heather Balsky: Yeah. Thank you for that. And then just a question on pricing. Can you just walk us through where you are in the process of taking, I guess, this outsized pricing you've been taking? When did it start? Kind of when do you start to anniversary it? Just trying to think through the flow through as we progress over the next few quarters.
Todd Schneider: Well, Heather, pricing is a local subject. It's a customer by customer subject. Meaning some businesses are doing better than others. And -- but as we look at that, when inflation kicked in to much higher degrees than that required us to make sure that our price adjustments were higher than historical as well. So you can think of about it that way when inflation was -- went to above historical levels. That's when we adjust to pricing at above historical levels. And as far as what that means moving forward, that will depend upon the -- what inflation does moving forward. So I don't have a crystal ball as it applies to that or a recession what have you, but we're paying very, very close attention to all those inputs and we'll manage it appropriately.
Heather Balsky: Thank you.
Todd Schneider: Thank you.
Operator: We will now take our next question from Seth Weber of Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.
Seth Weber: Hi, guys. Good morning. I actually had a pricing question as well, kind of a similar question. So, Todd, I guess I'm trying to understand if how much of the price increases that you guys have been pushing through are just purely tied to inflation and how much of it is, since I was just trying to get more for the value prop that you're off offering today? So I'm trying to understand, will pricing revert back to its traditional level if inflation receives? Or do you think that pricing can be structurally higher for Cintas just based on the greater value that you're offering to your customers kind of today versus history, that makes sense?
Todd Schneider: Yeah, Seth. It's a fair question. As I think about our customer base, we're such a broad customer base. So some of them, we have contractual commitments, some of them we have the ability to adjust prices closer to inflation and what have you. So it's very, very broad and it really depends on the particular customer and the health of that customer as well. But here's what I can tell you is that we take a long term approach. We don't think about our customers and quarters or fiscal years, we think about them in over decades. And that approach has really paid-off big dividends for us. Now, we are constantly trying to improve the value that we provide to our customers. That being said, when inflation is at the levels it's at, it requires us to adjust prices at above historical. When inflation comes back down and we certainly hope and expect that that will occur. Then I think you can think of our price adjustments to be back closer to more historical. We're now -- am I constantly trying to improve the value to our customers? Absolutely. That pursuit will be in perpetuity and the marketplace determines how that pricing is handled appropriately.
Mike Hansen: Seth, I might add two things. One, you bring up kind of the structure of our pricing and we're generally the highest price relative to our competition in the space. So in other words, we don't leave with price generally. We believe that our products, our service, they are better and that generally means we are at higher price points than our competition. And I don't expect that that would change. As Todd said, we are continuing to look for ways of even improving that value more in the future. But I don't see that type of pricing changing because of the inflation going up and down. We believe that we can command the best prices because our products are better like, car hard and other products like that and our service is just better. The other thing I might add is, our pricing is, as Todd said is customer by customer and local and it's not necessarily a -- we have to offset or we look to offset inflation immediately. Generally speaking, we want to do the best for our customers and continue to add the right value, but we also know that given the way our cost structure works, we don't have to necessarily immediately offset inflation. We get, for example, the products that we rent in our rental business, we get to amortize them, right? And so if we do have to take a cost increase, we get -- we certainly get visibility before that hits our P&L because that has to go through the manufacturing process, then it gets to our locations and then it amortizes over a period of time. And so we can have multiple price increases before that hits our P&L. And that ability to anticipate and manage our cost structure as well as our pricing, it's reflected in the fact that even in this pretty darn difficult environment, we've been able to increase our margins year-over-year, certainly, excluding those one-time gains, but we've been able to continue to increase our margins during that period of time. So I just give you that color to say, we are very thoughtful about the way we price and we are thoughtful about the way we anticipate the costs within our cost structure. And it works because we're able to increase our margins in a pretty difficult inflationary environment in each of the last four quarters.
Seth Weber: Yeah. No, it makes total sense, Mike. I appreciate it guys. That's super helpful and that's really all I had today. Thank you.
Operator: We'll now take our next question from Shlomo Rosenbaum of Stifel. Please go ahead.
Shlomo Rosenbaum: Hi. Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. It's pretty noticeable that the cost of goods sold is up only like $10 million sequentially. But when I look at the SG&A, it's up like $46 million. And usually when you have some kind of inflationary prices, I would have thought it'd hit the COGS more. Maybe you could explain to us what the changes were in SG&A and was there some kind of significant investments in production or anything like that? And maybe if you can bring it down to kind of the unit level?
Mike Hansen: Well, Shlomo, I'll speak to the SG&A piece of this. Yes, we did have some sequential increase. But Shlomo, if you look at going back to -- I've got going back to fiscal ‘15. Our first quarter SG&A is usually the highest of the year. I'll throw out the pandemic impact a year. But our first quarter is usually the highest SG&A quarter of the year and that's been consistent for a number of years. And that's simply because of some things like, we have higher payroll taxes when our equity compensation vest at that period of time. It usually happens in the first quarter. We tend to have a little bit more stock options that create more payroll taxes. We tend to have some beginning of the year meetings and other things that happen. But year-over-year, if you pull that gain out that we've been talking about, our SG&A is down 40 basis points. And so we like -- we do like the movement of that SG&A. And gosh, if you go back to pre-pandemic Q1 of 2020, we're down almost 300 basis points. If you go back to 2019’s SG&A were down 260 basis points. My point Shlomo is, this is not unusual for us to have a first quarter higher SG&A because of just the way that our business works and the timing. But year-over-year, we continue to make really good performance in that. And in this case, down 40 basis points.
Shlomo Rosenbaum: Okay. Thank you. And then maybe you can also talk about the higher revenue kind of translated into margin for two of the units, but for kind of the other unit, it didn't look like it's translating exactly the same way. Is there something that was -- is there a mix item in terms of what was being sold over there? And then just maybe you can just touch on your expectation for cash flow through the year with such strong revenue should we expect there to be a working capital drag. So we wouldn't necessarily see revenue grow the same way that we would see earnings grow.
Mike Hansen: Shlomo, I'll talk to the All Other first. I'm not sure, if you're talking year-over-year that gain that we've referred to a number of times is in the All Other. And so you have to make sure that you're stripping out that gain 14.7% for the quarter for us that is a pretty good quarter. But as Todd mentioned a little bit ago, that Uniform Direct Sale piece that can tend to move up and down a bit and be more inconsistent from quarter-to-quarter and that's a bit of what we've seen in this quarter. So once you pull out the gain from last year where we had that outsized operating margin in All Other. We're at a pretty good spot at 14.7% and it more than anything is attributable to that lumpiness in the Uniform Direct sale business. As it relates to our cash flow, look, we like where the cash flow is where our operating cash flow is up 13.7% year-over-year. Free cash flow is up 7%. And look from quarter-to-quarter, there can be puts and takes. But generally speaking, our cash flow is really good and I expect that we'll see a continued very good conversion from net income to operating cash flow. Now, when we grow and we've been growing quite nicely, we have always been a bit of a drag in working capital because our AR tends to go up as we grow. Our uniforms in service and other items in service tends to grow -- go up as we grow and that certainly has happened. But we're still turning that into really good cash flow and I would expect that that's going to continue for the rest of the year. We're going to probably be a little bit higher in CapEx during this fiscal ‘23 year because we've -- again, we've kind of come from a pandemic period where we didn't need to grow capacity and we've really seen some nice growth over the course of the last -- more than fiscal year. And that certainly means we do some investing. And so you're going to see a little bit of an increase in CapEx, but right in the range where we've guided to that 3% to 3.5% of revenue.
Shlomo Rosenbaum: Great. Thank you.
Operator: And we can now take our next question from Scott Schneeberger of Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.
Scott Schneeberger: Thanks very much. Good morning, guys. I mean, kind of go back to the recession question and the essence of the question is going to be visibility. It's been asked a few times on the call, but your guidance, your quarter is obviously quite strong. The guidance is certainly ambitious. And I view you guy has generally pretty conservative. So things must look really good to you right now and through the end of the fiscal year. So no one have kind of asked this, but I want to delve in a little bit deeper. When do you see when you're working with your customer or something like going back to past recessions. What are the first signs you see? How do they manifest? And what type of visibility do you have into OOK (ph) that's going to affect our numbers, weeks, months, quarters later. If you could just tell us kind of going back to pass through session, how that takes shape? Thanks.
Todd Schneider: Scott, this is Todd. Thanks for the question. Mike, certainly if you want to chime in. When we think about, again, are we in a recession technical? It's one coming in early '23, late '23 how severe we don't know those items, but we are watching it very closely. When you think about our customer base, how might it show up? We'll customers if their demand is being impacted then they're going to look for ways to cut their costs. Is that in getting a no look at their P&L and say, okay, what's the biggest things I can move on? And frankly, we're not usually top of their list. So -- and the reason being is because our spend per customer is pretty small. But that being said, we'll -- will they reduce their needs for certain services, reduce quantities of products that they need. Certainly those types of things can happen if their demand is being impacted. So those are the items that we look for is, our customers reducing their needs because their demand of their business is such that they don't need as much. So I'd say that would be one of the certainly bigger categories that we look for. Mike, any other thoughts, but those are the first one that came in mind.
Mike Hansen: Yeah, I think that's true. We may see some of those kinds of signs. We may see a couple of our customers go out of business depending on the type of recession. But the other thing that I think is really important is we've grown through lots of recessions in the last 50 years. And we have also sold a lot of new business through every recession. And so even if we start to see some signs that the customers are paying a little bit more attention to their spending. We know this that we're not asking them generally to spend new money. It's spend it with us and we will help them with our programs to reduce their own work content. In other words, they can -- they find their people can do more with less because we're able to take some work away from them and we're not necessarily asking them to spend new dollars. So we -- look, we're going to be paying attention to all different kinds of things within the economy, but we know this. We're going to sell a lot of new business. We're going to sell the no programmers. We're going to help our customers reduce their own work content. And that's why we feel, we not only do, we love the momentum that we have, but as we look forward, that value proposition is still resonating very, very well. We've said that a number of times and we don't see that changing And so we feel pretty good and we generally -- our guidance is a reflection of that and we like where we're headed.
Scott Schneeberger: Excellent. Thanks guys. That sounds good. I think a good follow on there. You've alluded to M&A, but we haven't really discussed it on this call. How is the environment right now? Are you seeing more opportunities or is that pretty steady? Any commentary on multiples? Is that something that's what more attractive, less attractive? Thanks.
Todd Schneider: Yeah, Scott. This is Todd. Our deal flow is good. We love our balance sheet, who love our position in the marketplace. That being said, those M&A type of opportunities, they -- tough to pay some, toughed there are various items that cause things to flip the switch for someone to sell their business. But I can tell you this, we're really well positioned. Love our balance sheet, love our team and the ability to manage through any M&A. And we think that that's going to be an opportunity for us in the future and we're well positioned for it. That being said, again, it's tough to pace them, but deal flow looks good and I don't see anything that's all that different from a multiple standpoint in the marketplace. So we're interested in any and all opportunities from an M&A standpoint and we'll continue to push for those.
Scott Schneeberger: Thanks, Todd. Excellent. I'll turn it over.
Todd Schneider: Thank you.
Operator: We can now take our final question from Toni Kaplan of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Toni Kaplan: Thanks. I wanted to ask a longer term margin question. If I look back about two years ago, your EBITDA margin like really meaningfully stepped up to mid-20s. But at the beginning, I think you're benefiting from travel, reduced travel during the pandemic and healthcare costs. You've really been able to keep it at that level. And I know you talked about adjusting your cost structure at the beginning of the pandemic, but basically what type of expenses have you been able to adjust so that you can stay at this mid-20s EBITDA level. Just how sustainable is it? It seems like it is, but wanted to just get some additional color there.
Todd Schneider: Yeah, Tony. It's Todd, you're absolutely correct. And when we look forward, we see incremental margins. We've talked about 20% to 30% and we see that in our future. And we are leveraging certainly the top line very nicely. We manage our variable costs. I think quite well, the team is very, very good at that. But we're also getting efficiencies from some of our digital transformation that we've talked about in the past. You see that certainly energy is a big subject today, but we've talked about our Smart Truck proprietary routing technology that's helping us reduce idle time and drive time, which obviously helps with energy spend, but it helps with CO2 emissions as well. And one of the things, we talk about around here is that we don't make money when the wheels are moving on our trucks. So getting those efficiencies is very important. We're extracting other efficiencies via our investment with SAP, with our inventory control programs that are allowing us to get better reuse of our products in our stockrooms, which also helps improve turnaround time for our customers. We think it's very, very important which gives us an advantage in the marketplace. I mentioned in our last call, we have an operational excellence dashboard that provides us better transparency into the efficiency levels at each of our production facilities. So that is significant, right? So we're able to understand the efficiency levels of our facilities not by having to be there in person every day, but by understanding the metrics of our operational excellence dashboard in real time. So I guess it's a blessing that we have those opportunities to improve. It's frustrating that we have opportunities to improve, but we're focused on improving those and extracting those efficiencies. So that will allow us to continue to provide good incremental margins separate from the items that I mentioned before with some of the other technologies that we deployed with making it a better win for customers and how they're doing business with us. So yeah, as we look forward, we're going to continue to those efficiencies and provide what we think are attractive incremental margins.
Toni Kaplan: Great. And on a more sort of current basis, any changes to contract structure, changes in contract lengths, any increasing the minimum thresholds for clients, anything to call out there?
Todd Schneider: Tony, I would say, it's nothing out of the ordinary, certainly, we take a very long term approach with our customers. They take a long term approach with us and we make sure that, that we're positioned to meet their needs and exceed them and provide products and services that they really value. And so that's what we're doing in the marketplace and that tends to show itself in -- I’ll just call it long term relationships. Others might call those contracts, but I call long term relationships with our customers.
Toni Kaplan: Thanks a lot.
Todd Schneider: Thank you.
Operator: This concludes the question-and-answer session. I would now like to hand the call back to Mr. Paul Adler for closing remarks.
Paul Adler: Well, thank you for joining us this morning. We will issue our second quarter of fiscal ‘23 financial results in late December. We look forward to speaking with you again at that time. Have a good day.
Operator: This concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2022 Q4  (2022-07-14 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, everyone. And welcome to the Cintas Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2022 Earnings Release Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Paul Adler, Vice President and Treasurer, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
Paul Adler: Thanks Darren. And thank you for joining us. With me is Todd Schneider, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Mike Hansen, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We will discuss our fiscal 2022 fourth quarter results. After our commentary, we will open the call to questions from analysts. The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a Safe Harbor from civil litigation for forward-looking statements. This conference call contains forward-looking statements that reflect the company's current views as to future events and financial performance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those we may discuss. I refer you to the discussion on these points contained in our most recent filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. I'll now turn the call over to Todd.
Todd Schneider: Thank you Paul. Our fourth quarter financial results are led by a strong revenue increase of 13.0% to $2.07 billion. Despite strong inflationary headwinds, operating income margin increased 10 basis points to 19.5% and EPS grew 13.8% to $2.81. Our sales force continues to add new customers and penetrate and cross-sell our existing base. Businesses prioritize, [all we] [ph] provide including image, safety, cleanliness, and compliance. Challenge was finding labor to run their business, heighten concerns over sanitization and the inflationary labor and purchasing costs, businesses increasingly outsourced to Cintas to help them get ready for the workday. We were able to deliver increased operating margin and EPS despite this period of significant inflation by productively selling new business, penetrating existing customers with more products and services, providing excellent service while driving operational efficiencies and obtaining incremental price increases from our customer base. Fourth quarter free cash flow increased 15.2% from last year. On June 15, we paid shareholders $98.2 million in quarterly dividends. And during the fourth quarter and through July 13, 2022, we purchased $496.5 million of Cintas common stock under our buyback program. We continue to allocate capital in many ways to improve shareholder returns. We are pleased with our fourth quarter financial results. They conclude a fiscal year of significant accomplishments, including the following: Fiscal year 2022 revenue was a record $7.85 billion, an increase of 10.4%. The organic revenue growth rate was 10.2%. Excluding two gains recorded this fiscal year and one recorded last fiscal year, operating income margin increased 50 basis points to 19.7%. We allocated capital to improve shareholder return. Acquisition spend was $164.2 million. In fiscal 2022 and up until today, we repurchased 4.3 million shares of Cintas stock for a total of $1.62 billion. Also, we increased the dividend 26.7%. We have increased the dividend every year since going public, which is 38 consecutive years. We made significant progress on our digital transformation journey. Our customers continue to find [added value] [ph] in managing their program through our online solution. We expect the ease of doing business with us to drive greater customer retention and faster revenue realization. We are actively using our new rolled out proprietary routing technology, which we call Smart Truck. This technology helps us make smarter routing decisions, enabling us to spend more time with our customers on service and sales, and also allows us to reduce energy usage and expense by driving fewer miles. We also made great strides in data analytics and enhanced business reporting, helping us target penetration, cross-selling, operational efficiencies, and pricing opportunities. In addition, as part of our steadfast commitment to corporate responsibility, we issued our second environmental social and governance or ESG report. It's a more robust report. Cintas was founded on a sustainable business model. Our corporate culture is based on doing what's right and challenging ourselves to improve. With this in mind, we announced our ambition to achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. And finally, our actions are being recognized. We were again named to the prestigious Fortune 500. It's an honor to be recognized among the most successful and respected companies. We were also recently added to the FTSE4Good Index Series. The Index Series includes companies demonstrating strong ESG practices. I thank our employees, whom we call partners, for their continued focus on our customers, our shareholders, and each other. Cintas has grown revenue and adjusted EPS in 51 of the past 53 years. And our prospects for continued profitable growth are great. They result in part from a strong value proposition and a vast total addressable market. Every business, goods producing or services providing, has a need for image, safety, cleanliness, or compliance. Operating a business is increasingly complex. Rather than doing it themselves, businesses increasingly outsource to Cintas. We provide the products and perform the services better, faster, and economically [frame businesses] [ph] to concentrate on their core competency. Since every business has a need for image, safety, cleanliness, or compliance, our total addressable market is vast. The prospects for Uniform or workwear rental are significant. The unserved workwear rental market is tremendous. Tens of billions of dollars of workwear are sold by retailers each year to workers in every sector of the economy. There are millions of people in healthcare alone, hospitals, urgent care, doctors office, dentists offices, and long-term care going to work every day in shrubs purchased from retailers. We focus on targeting these retail customers converting them to a rental program. The fact that consistently 60% of our new customers are converted from retail to a rental program speaks to the size of the opportunity, as well as our continued success. Plus, we are more than just a Uniform Rental company. More than half of our revenue is from facility services including hygiene, floor care items such as dust mats and mops, cleaning tools like microfiber mops and towels, first aid cabinet services, and fire protection services including test and inspection of extinguishers and alarms. Every business that has a door, floor, wall, bathroom, and employees is a sales prospect. Our organic revenue growth rates are indicative of our compelling value proposition and tremendous market size. We grow revenue in multiples of GDP and jobs growth because of ample supply and demand for our products and services. Our growth in revenue is profitable growth and our operating margins have a long runway for expansion. Growth results in more buying power with our suppliers. It produces operating leverage. Route density increases reducing energy expenses and providing more time to spend with customers on service and sales. Growth means more volume in the plants, covering fixed cost of building, machinery and equipment. And when we penetrate existing customers with more products and services, the incremental operating margins are even stronger because we realize more revenue per service step. The future of Cintas remains bright. I'll now turn the call over to Mike to provide the details of our fourth quarter results and our financial expectations for fiscal 2023.
Mike Hansen: Thanks, Todd, and good morning. Our fiscal 2022 fourth quarter revenue of $2.07 billion compares to $1.84 billion last year. The organic revenue growth rate adjusted for acquisitions, divestitures, and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations was 12.7%. The Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segment revenue for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 was $1.63 billion, compared to $1.47 billion last year. Organic revenue growth was 10.5%. Our First Aid and Safety Services operating segment revenue for the fourth quarter was $218.2 million, compared to $186.9 million last year. Organic revenue growth was 15.1%. This strong growth rate reflects the growing momentum of our First Aid Cabinet business, which grew 25% in the fourth quarter. While personal protective equipment remains elevated compared to pre-COVID levels, PPE revenue was about 7% less than the fourth quarter of last year. Our Fire Protection Services and Uniform Direct Sale businesses are reported in the All Other segment. All Other revenue was $226.2 million, compared to $181.9 million last year. The fire business organic growth rate was 18.3% and the Uniform Direct Sale business organic growth rate was 53.5%, both businesses finished the year strong. Gross margin for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 was $946.2 million, compared to $859.1 million last year, an increase of 10.1%. Gross margin as a percent of revenue was 45.6% for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, compared to 46.8% last year. Gross margin percentage by business was 45.7% for the Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment, 46.1% for First Aid and Safety Services, 47.5% for Fire Safety Services, and 39.3% for Uniform Direct Sale.  Operating income of $404.4 million, compared to $356.4 million last year, an increase of 13.5%. Operating income margin was 19.5%, compared to 19.4% reported last year, a 10 basis point increase. Our effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 22.8%, compared to 19.4% last year. The tax rate can move from period-to-period based on discrete events, including the amount of stock compensation expense. Net income for the fourth quarter was $294.5 million, compared to $267.7 million last year. Diluted EPS was $2.81, compared to $2.47 last year, an increase of 13.8%. Note that the higher effective tax rate in this year's fourth quarter was a 500 basis point headwind to the EPS growth rate and a $0.12 headwind to EPS. For our fiscal year 2023, we expect our revenue to be in the range of $8.47 billion to $8.58 billion, an increase of 7.8% to 9.2% over fiscal 2022. We expect diluted EPS to be in the range of $11.90 to $12.30. Please note the following: Fiscal 2022 included a gain on sale of operating assets in the first quarter and a gain on an equity investment in the third quarter. Excluding these items fiscal 2022 operating income was $1.55 billion, a margin of 19.7%, and diluted EPS was $11.28. Please see the table in our earnings press release for more information. Fiscal 2023 operating income is expected to be in the range of $1.68 billion to $1.73 billion, compared to $1.55 billion in fiscal 2022 after excluding the gains. Fiscal 2023 interest expense is expected to be approximately $110 million, compared to $88.8 million in fiscal 2022 due in part to higher interest rates. Our fiscal 2023 effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 20%. This compares to a rate of 17.9% in fiscal 2022 after excluding the gains and their related tax impacts. The expected higher effective tax rate will negatively impact fiscal 2023 diluted EPS by approximately $0.32 per share and diluted EPS growth by approximately 290 basis points.  Our financial guidance includes share buybacks through July 13, 2022, but does not include the impact of any future share buybacks. And we remain in a dynamic environment that can continue to change. Our guidance contemplates a stable economy and excludes pandemic related setbacks or economic downturns. I'll turn it back over to Paul.
Paul Adler: That concludes our prepared remarks. Now we are happy to answer questions from the analysts. Darren, I'll turn it over to you.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We will now take our first question from Faiza Alwy from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Faiza Alwy: Yes. Hi. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for taking the question. I guess my first question is just around, you mentioned that your guidance contemplates a stable economic environment and does not contemplate any economic downturn. Could you maybe talk to us more about that? I know that historically you've outperformed the economy, but to the extent as you know there are a lot of concerns around the potential recession in the United States and globally, could you maybe talk a little bit about how your outlook may change to the extent that we run into an economic downturn?
Todd Schneider: Certainly, Faiza. Thank you for the question and good morning. When we think about our guidance for next year, for fiscal 2023, we like our momentum. We like where we are through this point in our fiscal year. We like our sales productivity. We like our leverage that we think we're getting. And we are not trying to predict the next recession and certainly not the depth or breadth of that recession. In many ways I hope that my customers don't read the newspaper or look at – I ever listened to the news because, yes, what you hear, they're certainly scattered approaches out there, but what I can tell you is, we like what we're seeing in our business. We like the momentum that we're seeing in our business. And if a recession occurs, a downturn occurs, then we will manage it appropriately, which we have always done and we'll continue to do so. And we're quite confident in our ability to do so and we remain poised and we're watching it very closely.
Faiza Alwy: Excellent. Just as a follow-up, could you talk about energy costs? As you know, there's been quite a bit of volatility as it relates to oil prices. You've historically disclosed, sort of how much energy impacted your margins. Maybe could you just talk to us about what the impact was this quarter and what you're anticipating for 2023?
Mike Hansen: Sure, Faiza. Our fourth quarter energy for the total company was 2.5%, that's up 40 basis points from a year ago. In our rental segment, energy was up 50 basis points. So, just a little bit more in that business. Our expectation is, on the whole, fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022, we're going to see an increase of call it 20 basis points to 30 basis points. We certainly have seen the energy high in June in the first part of our quarter here, but it's nice to see that the price of the pumps come down just a little bit in the last couple of weeks. And our expectation is that it's not going to stay at this elevated level, but certainly higher than our fiscal 2022 year.
Faiza Alwy: Understood. Thank you so much.
Mike Hansen: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. We will now take our next question from Hamzah Mazari from Jefferies. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Hamzah Mazari: Hi, good morning. My first question is just around labor challenges, labor availability, could you give us a sense of how much demand could you not meet because labor was an issue? And is that fair? Was there demand out there that you couldn't meet because of labor challenges? And if so, what would the growth have been if labor wasn't an issue? And do you see labor normalizing at some point? Do you have some ability into that? Any thoughts there?
Todd Schneider: Hamzah, it is – thank you for your question, it is certainly a challenging environment on the labor side. But I'm quite happy where we are staffed and our team has done an incredible job in managing through that process. The demand for our customers as you can see is quite robust and we're meeting that demand. And so it wouldn't be popular here if someone said that, hey, I can't meet the demand, so my revenues aren't going to be as good. That's not how we run our business. And we're proud of the fact that we're staffed well. We've got a really great team that is meeting the customers' needs and exceeding them. And as far as labor in the future, that's a tough one, but you would think that it might be easing a bit, but we're really not seeing it. It’s trying to attract and retain and develop really good people is challenging today as I can ever remember in my career, but when things are really hard like that, we think it gives us a chance to shine. And I think we're doing just exactly that.
Hamzah Mazari: Got it. And just my follow-up question is just around M&A. Clearly, balance sheet is under levered. Clearly, you bought a lot of stock back and continue to – are valuations just too high or were you looking for a larger deal that, sort of didn't pan out, just sort of any thoughts there? I know one of your competitors is spinning off their business and I know you don't comment specifically on M&A, but maybe just thoughts on M&A environment, what you're seeing there? Have valuations come in with the market coming in, and with some of the labor challenges, maybe private operators are more in distress than your business?
Todd Schneider: Great question. We don't comment specifically on M&A, but what I can tell you is this that we are actively pursuing deals of all shapes and sizes. And certainly, valuations matter certainly. But it really takes two to dance. And we got to find – the right situation has to occur for [indiscernible] of an organization – shareholders of an organization to be willing sellers. And that tends to pace it more than anything. As you mentioned correctly, our balance sheet, we love our position and we're ready, willing and able to make deals of all shapes and sizes.
Hamzah Mazari: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. We'll now take our next question from George Tong from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Your line open.
George Tong: Hi, thanks. Good morning. Can you provide an update on how customer purchasing behaviors have changed in the current environment? How have ad stops in cross-selling evolved among your customer base?
Todd Schneider: George, the current customer penetration, the current customer buying patterns have been good. As you can see in our revenue, over the course of the year, our revenue has accelerated each quarter and that's due in part because of really good new business, but our existing customers and the penetration we're seeing at those customers has gone very well and that certainly has been a part of the contribution of the accelerating growth. Todd mentioned, we love our momentum as you can certainly see through the quarterly growth throughout this year and a pretty good guide. And we just – we haven't seen a change in their behavior. Our value propositions that Todd talked about in our script and the outsourcing needs and the difficulties that are facing businesses because of the labor challenges that they're facing, it has resonated. Our value has resonated really well with those customers. And so the outsourcing has been good. So, all-in-all, George, we like the momentum and the performance of those existing customers has been really good.
George Tong: Very helpful. Thank you. And then with respect to pricing trends, can you talk a little bit about how that's also changed in the current environment? And if your latest pricing increases are fully offsetting input cost inflation or more than offsetting input cost inflation?
Mike Hansen: George, great question. As I mentioned earlier, it's a very challenging environment. We've said all along that we're not immune from inflation, but we really like our plan and our investments. And clearly, pricing is a component of our strategy. It has to be – input costs are significant because specifically labor and material costs, but we think we're doing a great job with that. Our price adjustments are certainly above historical as they need to be to address the costs that are coming through organization. We've done a really nice job of leveraging SG&A to provide us room to invest in other areas where we've had to add people and certainly labor rates etcetera, but it's working nicely. And part of our focus, a big part of our focus is we are looking at customers from a long-term standpoint and saying, yes, we have to adjust price and it will be above historical. However, we are going to find a way to grow margins and do so in ways other than just pricing. And we're doing that in certainly many key initiatives to help improve and find efficiencies in our business. So, you didn't ask specifically about that, but I think that's what you're getting at. And I'll just provide a little bit more color on that because I think it might be helpful for folks to understand that as we take this long term approach with customers, we'll adjust price, but we're going to go find efficiencies so that we can still improve our business and improve margins. I mentioned in our script and by the way most of this, of our efficiencies are tied to SAP and our digital transformation. SAP is the backbone of how we run our business and how we find – how we're able to enjoy the digital transformation that we're experiencing and our customers are experiencing as well. So just bear with me. I'll walk through a few of these for some color. I mentioned [in] [ph] My Cintas online portal, which – it provides us really nice leverage. It provides us improved revenue via sales and retention because customers value the ability to manage their program and pay their bills on their time, not just when our office is available. So that's great, but it also provides us some improved productivity because it allows customers to self-serve instead of our partners having to take care of that as well. I mentioned in the script as well, our Smart Truck technology, which is proprietary routing technology, it allows for more efficient routing and tracking of our vehicles. Where does this help us? It helps us and provides us more time that we can spend with customers instead of driving. That's more productivity. It provides real time tracking to assist with customer needs. It helps us reduce idle times, which is obviously important to us. Lower fuel consumption and obviously lower GHG emissions as a result. And in fact, over the last three quarters within our rental division, our distance between customers has reduced 5%, which is just – it's just finding an efficiency in our business by leveraging technology and because driving, as we've always said, when the wheels are moving, we don't generate any revenue, it’s when we’ll stop.  So that's important to us. And then, we also have something that we've rolled out through our technology transformation or digital transformation. What we call our operational excellence dashboards, which allows for us the ability to evaluate our production facilities, our plans to see how they're performing without having to be at each plant physically to evaluate performance. So, in the past, you had to be at a plant to see how they were performing and were they on time and were turn times in our washout. We track everything. And now we have technology that allows us to do that. And so it's all driven because of our SAP platform. Many of this, it ends up showing up in faster turnaround of product, better utilization of in service inventory, which helps offset purchases. It's been significant for us. And I thought I'd just provide a little color because I thought it might help you as you think about pricing and how we're fighting inflation.
George Tong: That's very helpful color. Thank you very much.
Mike Hansen: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. We will now take our next question from Ashish Sabadra from RBC. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Ashish Sabadra: Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to focus on the healthcare, government and education vertical, those three key verticals that were a key area of focus. How's the progress on that front? And then maybe a more broader question is around the economic sensitivity of your end market. Just wanted to follow-up on the earlier question like how much of the revenues really generated from more sensitive end market versus more recession resilient end markets? Any color on that front will be helpful. Thanks.
Todd Schneider: Ashish, thanks for the question. Our verticals are quite robust. We've invested significantly there. And we look at those as businesses. How we operate the products, the services that we're providing the tools to our partners, and that provides us advantages in the marketplace and helps us – positions us to provide better services to our customers, which is important to us. And certainly, the education sectors had – the last two years have been a bit bumpy for them. It seems like they're meaning with closures and what have you that appears to be behind them hopefully. The government sector has been very consistent for us. Hospitality, as you read, has been quite robust and continues the demand and the hospitality sector seems to be quite good. And when we think about our Fortune 1000 and corporate accounts sectors, our customers seem to be doing quite well and trying to see into the future and see what will occur. Is the recession imminent? Are we in one? Is it going to be next year? Here I can tell you is, our value proposition, what Mike spoke about of – the items that we provide are important to people, provides compliance and sanitization, image, health, wellness, those things are very important. And then, when you combine that with the fact that it's – there's still over 11 million job openings in the country. And as a result, it's tough for our customers to hire and train and keep their people and they're looking to us to outsource items. And we're in a great position to take that on and we're happy to take that on and help them with those functions.
Ashish Sabadra: That's very helpful color. And maybe just a quick one on the follow-up on the healthcare. I know the last disclosure was I think almost 7% of the revenue with the opportunity to be 10% of the revenue in the mid-term. I was wondering if it's possible to provide any update on that front, particularly on the healthcare side?
Todd Schneider: Yes. The healthcare has been an absolute great vertical for us. It's a very important one. It's our largest vertical, as we look at the opportunities still – it’s still under 10%. We see an amazing runway there. And big items in the future when you think over the coming years, because again, we're organized appropriately to meet the needs of those customers. We know them really well and we listen to what their needs are. And we're addressing them and continuing to invest in technology that will help them to be more successful to help them run a better business and we're quite bullish on that vertical.
Ashish Sabadra: That's great. Congrats on the strong momentum in the business.
Todd Schneider: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. We will now take our next question from Andy Wittmann from Baird. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Andy Wittmann: Hi, great. Thanks. I was just wondering if, as you look back at the fact that you grew margins during COVID, so recently just a couple of years ago, does that limit any flexibility that you have on your margins or excuse me, on your P&L, if we were to head into the next recession? 
Mike Hansen: Andy, thanks for the question. It depends upon the when, how long, how deep that recession is and that's for others to try to forecast. But we see – fortunately, we have plenty of runway on finding efficiencies in our business. When we think about the value that we're providing our customers, you know when our customers are healthy, our business is that much better, but we will fight through whatever recession comes our way. We've done that and we've shown the ability to gross sales and profits in, I'd say, just about every operating environment out there. 51 of the past 53 years, the exception being the 2008, 2009. I certainly hope that it's not that deep, [nasty] [ph] for recession, whatever comes next, but we'll be prepared to manage through that as you've seen us do over the years.
Todd Schneider: Andy, I might just add, you know we certainly adjusted at the beginning of the pandemic our cost structure and we're able to pull costs out, but as you can imagine for the last, I'll call it, five quarters, our revenue growth has been really solid and accelerating, and so along the way, there have been investments that have been necessary and investments that we've wanted to make, and that means we've added growth routes back that we took out in the early days of the pandemic. We've added capacity in our production facilities to handle this great volume growth that we've had. And so, we've got this investment going on right now. And as Todd said, look, if the environment changes and we need to pivot you've seen us pivot pretty effectively certainly in the last few years and we'll do that again if the economic situation requires us to do so.
Andy Wittmann: That's helpful color. Mike, I just, I don't usually ask about the all other segment, but there was a big number on the direct sale. I think you said plus 53% year-over-year. Obviously, comps were relatively easy, but was that just a program that was contained in the quarter or do you – is there something changed in the outlook that could either flow into 1Q or more sustainably change in how that business is going to market or how customers are reacting?
Mike Hansen: Great. Thank you, Andy. And the partners in that area, thank you for asking about it as well. As you know, that can be a little bit more spiky, the direct sale business, but the comps were easier, but nevertheless, we like the momentum we have in that business. We've diversified our customer base. We're selling to a broader area. We've got nice position in that market. And yes, we like where we are. Now, certainly comps will get tougher next year. So, even more so in the back half of the year, not just for that business, but all of our businesses. But we really like the momentum and the position in the marketplace in that business.
Andy Wittmann: Great. Thanks guys.
Mike Hansen: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. We will now take our next question from Manav Patnaik from Barclays. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Manav Patnaik: Thank you. Good morning. Todd, thank you earlier for all those kind of productive examples we talked about. And despite the high inflation environment, you guys have one of the few companies that are showing margin expansion. And so, I was hoping that maybe you or Mike could remind us of the big cost buckets and how you are being able to manage through [differentiation the environment] [ph] to show this margin expansion and how perhaps sustainable it could be?
Mike Hansen: Sure Manav, certainly when you think about the cost structure and I'll speak mostly to our rental business. Certainly, labor is an important bucket for us. And as you've heard Todd explain over the last four quarters or so, we've worked really hard over the last several years to improve the – or increase the rates at higher than I'll say historical averages and that left us not flat footed in this challenging environment and it's allowed us to continue to raise, but not in an alarming rate that maybe some of our other competitors have had to do. And we'll continue to manage that very, very appropriately. The other bucket that I'll mention is, our material costs. Certainly material cost is a big component. And as you know, we are able to amortize the rental items. So, the items that we are reusing in the business in a recurring nature garments, dust mats, mops, etcetera, shop towels. And so, we're able to amortize those and so we don't get inflation impact immediately. This amortization allows us to understand what's coming and it allows us to anticipate and that allows our global supply chain to flex when we need to, to change volumes around. And that's very important for us to be able to see ahead, and the other thing it allows us to do, it allows us to potentially get a couple of price increases in, before that, I'll say higher cost even hits our P&L. So for example, when we have – if we have cost increases in our materials, and we amortize those over 18 months. That first high – that first months of higher cost, we have [one-eighteenth] [ph] of it. The second month, we get [two-eighteenth] [ph] of it. So, it doesn't fully hit our P&L for eighteen months. We can adapt, make decisions, including pricing decisions before that fully hits us. So, we have this, we've got this nice, I'll call it, hedge in that part of the cost structure and that certainly is an important part of our cost structure. And the other thing I'll say is, certainly we've got some infrastructure and we can leverage that infrastructure pretty well with revenue growth like we've got it today and the momentum. And so, we've been able to manage all of those buckets in different ways, but quite appropriately. And then when you couple of those – the way we manage those different buckets with the initiatives that Todd spoke of to get efficiencies, labor efficiencies, productivity improvements, technology improvements, those things can really help us as we face inflation and as Todd laid out, we've got a pretty good game plan against it. As you've seen, we've in this year just ended, in a pretty difficult inflationary environment, we were able to raise our operating margins 50 basis points.
Manav Patnaik: Thank you, Mike. Yes, I think that's very helpful. We get a lot of this question. Just as a follow-up, the 164 million that you spent on the deals, can you just give us a flavor of, kind of where, how many, the size of those deals and perhaps what that small tuck-in pipeline looks like?
Todd Schneider: Sure. We're always working that pipeline and we've made some very nice deals in our rental segment this year. We also certainly made some very nice deals in our first-aid and fire businesses as well. And then we had the equity investment that we effectively bought out and that is more of a global supply chain impacting acquisition. But we like all of them and they have certainly provided some nice synergies in a tuck-in nature for the year. And we'll continue to work on those as we move forward. We think the pipeline is good.
Manav Patnaik: All right. Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. We will now take our next question from Andrew Steinerman from J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Andrew Steinerman: Hi. Two questions. The first one is, in the 2023 revenue guide that you gave percentages in dollars, could you just also give that in terms of the percentages in organic constant currency numbers as well? Because I assume FX makes difference and M&A might have [a some needle moving] [ph]. And the second question, I just want to hear more about your First Aid business, like particularly the Cabinets business? Like what percentage of First Aid is in Cabinets now versus pre-COVID? How fast is your Cabinets business growing and then you also introduced a new product COVID testing and – COVID test kits, and how is that going?
Mike Hansen: Sure. Andrew, I'll tackle the first part and turn the First Aid question over to Todd. So, as it relates to our revenue guidance, 7.8% on the low-end, 9.2% on the high-end. In the fourth quarter, we had 30 basis points of organic benefit and FX impact. I would expect that we'll see that continue for let's call it the first half of the year. And depending on then the acquisitions that we make in fiscal 2023, we may see that continue, but any future acquisitions are not baked into those numbers.  So, call it the first half of the year we’ll continue with something in the way of 20 basis points to 30 basis points of M&A and FX. And that's probably going to decrease then without any new M&A activity in the back half of the year. Does that answer your question Andrew?
Andrew Steinerman: Yes.
Mike Hansen: Okay. And then Todd, I'll turn it over to you for the first aid.
Todd Schneider: Great. Thanks for the question, Andrew. Yes, our – certainly as a percent – our first aid cabinets dropped during the COVID, but it's coming back and coming back quite nicely. In fact, it grew 25%, our first aid cabinet business did in Q4 and that's very, very encouraging. And it's showing up in our margins as well. So, we will continue to be opportunistic in helping customers with the breadth of our offering. Certainly don't know exactly what COVID will bring this fall, but we're focused on growing our first aid business in helping all of our customers in that area. If that means they need COVID test kits, we'll help them if they need masks, we’ll help them. You name it. But our focus is on trying to make sure that we're growing that profitable consistent first aid cabinet business and we're very encouraged by the trends.
Andrew Steinerman: Okay. Thank you very much.
Todd Schneider: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. We will take our next question from Seth Weber from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Seth Weber: Hi, guys. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe for Mike, can you just talk about – I mean, the free cash flow is really strong here. Can you just talk about how you're thinking about CapEx going forward? And just talk maybe, give us a sense for kind of where you're at from a capacity utilization perspective and whether you have enough capacity or CapEx needs to go higher from here? Thanks.
Mike Hansen: Sure. Yes, Seth. Our free cash flow has been good. Our expectation is that that's not going to change in this upcoming fiscal 2023 year. Our CapEx look, we expect it to be in the 3% to 3.5% of revenue type of a range. If you look over the last 10 years, that's maybe a little bit down from where we've been, but we're going to keep investing in the business. As it relates to our capacity, we have had some really good growth this year. And there are spots where we've had to add capacity, but generally speaking, I don't expect that we'll have significant and I'll say lumped together type of capacity investments that will happen over time as we continue to grow. So, our expectation is our good and healthy free cash flow will continue in fiscal 2023.
Todd Schneider: Seth, as I spoke about it earlier, one of the items that we're focused on is, making sure that we leverage our infrastructure to its fullest whether that be our fleet, but also our production facilities. And as I mentioned, our operating excellence technology platform is helping us to make sure we're finding all the efficiencies in our business and in certain cases that's allowing us to forgo CapEx as a result because we're able to find efficiencies in running our business and our production facilities as well. And we'll continue to do that as the very best we can.
Seth Weber: Okay, thanks. And then maybe just on the fire business, can you just give us a little bit of color what's driving the strength there, double-digit revenue strength seems – it's been double-digits for a while now and is that just you're taking share from smaller operators? Is that where some of the inorganic growth is coming from? Just any color on how that business is being sustained at this kind of double-digit level?
Todd Schneider: Sure, Seth. We really like the fire business. We have a very good team that's operating and selling into our customer base. The uniqueness about the fire customers is there really is no program market, right. Everybody is served, they're served in some manner, but we've invested in that business to make sure that we are positioned with the best people, the best technology that we are continuing to invest in there and the best training and one that really – we like our spot there from – the levels of service that we're providing our customers and it's getting noticed. And that's a business that you want to feel good about who's walking in your facility and who's taking care of you. And we think that we're well-positioned. So, good momentum in that business and we're focused on continuing that momentum.
Seth Weber: Okay, guys. Thanks very much. Appreciate it.
Operator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Heather Balsky from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Heather Balsky: Hi. Thank you for taking my question. I want to piggyback on some of the questions regarding just business risk in a tougher macro environment if we do see one. Can you just talk at a high level how your business has changed say over the last decade since last economic recession through non-COVID? In terms of cyclicality, do you think from an end customer perspective in the verticals you operate or from a product perspective where you think you're better positioned today than you may have been a decade ago? Thanks.
Mike Hansen: Sure, Heather. I'll say a couple of things. We've got first of all great momentum in the business and we love the value that we're providing our customers and the outsourcing that is needed in this challenging time is really resonating and working well for us. So that's really important for us in any turn in the economy we like our momentum. That's important. I would say, if you think about the last 10 years, our growth has been in multiples above GDP and why is that? And multiples above employment growth. And why is that? It's because we're able to sell number one to many what we call in the industry no programmers. So those that don't have a current recurring program. And that's important because in any kind of environment, we go to prospects and existing customers and when we sell the value, usually it's for things that they're already spending money on. And so we're not necessarily asking them to spend new money, we're asking them to spend money with us while we take work content away from them. So, for example, we don't want you to do things, we don't want our customers to do it all themselves. That takes time, capacity, labor, etcetera. We want to help them do it. And so as we take that work content away from them, again in any type of environment that's helpful, but certainly in one where businesses are feeling the pressure of an economy that can really resonate and help. So, we like the way that our value is working. And in the past, we've really been able to grow when there hasn't been much economic growth or employment growth. And our expectation is, we'll continue to be able to do that. 60% of our new business comes from those no programmers. The other thing is, look, we've got a different kind of sales force today than we did at 10, 12 years ago and that sales force is really dialed in on finding those no programmers, finding the business and also penetrating more and our penetration has worked very well. But that sales team is also focused on different verticals that we were walking by in the last recession. And those verticals like healthcare can be a little bit less impacted by recessions and that's good for us. So, we like the diversity in our customer base that we've created over the course of the last 10 years. We think moving forward that diversity is going to help us as we move forward. In addition to that, look, we're going to continue to look for M&A opportunities and we're going to look for – continue to look for efficiency opportunities and those will help protect us in the next downturn. We can't predict when it may happen. If it's happening, we can't predict how long, how deep, how broad it's going to be. but we like where we are today with momentum and a value proposition that is resonating better than ever. And as you've seen Heather over the course of the last few years, if we need to pivot, we've shown that we can pivot and pivot appropriately to match the environment.
Heather Balsky: Thank you, appreciate that.
Operator: Thank you. We'll now take our next question from Toni Kaplan from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Toni Kaplan: Thanks so much. Mike, sorry if I missed this, but in the fourth quarter, you usually give the mix between rental sub segments, the shop towels, hygiene, etcetera. Can you give us an updated breakdown there?
Paul Adler: Hey, Tony, it's Paul. I do have that information and this is just that Uniform Rental and Facility Services segments measured on Q4's activity. Uniform Rental, which is the workwear that we [rent, car hard] [ph], the healthcare scrubs are in there, that was 48% of the mix. Dust, which is the mats, the mops, similar cleaning tools 18%, hygiene at 17%, shop towels 4%, linens, which are typically apron's, towels, things that don't run through a flat iron machine that's 9% of the mix and then catalog revenue was about 4%. And those percentages are very similar to last year, which I think speaks to the continued strong demand that we have for all the products and services within that segment.
Toni Kaplan: Terrific. And just sort of on this in similar lines, if you think about upselling within Uniform Rental, what are the real, sort of new products that people are demanding? What are – obviously in terms of cross-sell, we've seen a lot of success from the sanitizers and the COVID test kits and things like that, but when you look really specifically within rental what are, sort of the new upselling opportunities that you're seeing the most success in?
Todd Schneider: Toni, within rental, we're seeing quite strong demand for all of our products and services and we really don't care where it starts as far as what we sell into a customer first because we have such a broad offering that we'll – whatever they're interested in, we'll help provide and then we'll continue to provide additional offerings to them. And – but when you think about it, right, it's a tough environment to hire and retain people, providing a benefit of workwear and laundering of workwear, that's a nice benefit for people and helps to attract and retain people. When you think about – if you're interested in our [restroom items] [ph], when it's hard to – when you're busy and you're trying to run a business, trying to deal with those items is something you'd rather – you'd love to outsource. And as I mentioned earlier, we're able to do it better, faster, cheaper, all that than what they can do for themselves. And in many of those cases, we're not even asking for additional spend. It's just a reallocated spend to us. So, whether that's – we have such a broad customer base. It depends, but I'm speaking more generically of you've got [restaurants] [ph], you've got people, you need products and services to help prepare your facility for either your customers, your guests, your employees, patients maybe. And so all of that is in very nice demand. And certainly, the focus on health, wellness, cleanliness, safety is more so today than it was a few years ago, which we think is that is positive for our business.
Toni Kaplan: Terrific. Thanks.
Todd Schneider: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. We will take our next question from Shlomo Rosenbaum from Stifel. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Shlomo Rosenbaum: Great. Thank you very much for taking my questions. Hey, Todd, I'm going to start with a question for you. Given the breadth of your business with like a million clients, you have kind of unique insight into [Main Street Americas] [ph], what is the sentiment amongst your clients and in terms of they're running their businesses and what you're thinking? What are you hearing from the salespeople? Are they leading back to the same kind of fear that we're seeing in the headlines of the newspapers and what the stock market seems to be indicating or is it really not that way? Is there kind of a disparity between the headlines and what you're actually seeing on the street from your view?
Todd Schneider: Shlomo, great question. You're right. We have such a broad and diverse customer base. We're up and down Main Street, U.S.A. every single day. And we're watching it really closely. And it seems as though demand is quite strong. Their demand within their business, demand for our products and services. As I mentioned earlier, I hope – I think we'd all be better off if nobody read the news or listened to the news because it seems like we're trying to talk ourselves into it, but that being said, we're watching it really, really closely because as Mike mentioned, we'll pivot. We'll pivot appropriately. But to date, it appears as though Main Street, U.S.A. is doing just fine and we're encouraged by that.
Shlomo Rosenbaum: Great. Thank you. And then, hey, Mike, maybe you could just talk a little bit about the dispersion of costs across the business units. The margin expansion was really pronounced in the First Aid and Safety and Other and then kind of the Rental Uniforms saw the margin come down, do they have just much more significant energy and labor aspect to it or maybe you can kind of explain that to us?
Mike Hansen: Sure. Certainly, the rental business is more affected by energy than the other businesses, no question about it. We had really nice quarters in our First Aid business as you point out. And what you're seeing there is that cabinet growth that we talked about earlier in the call being 25% plus and that getting back to mix that we love. And so, we've – our First Aid team has really done a nice job of getting that – working on that mix and getting it back to the, I'll say, pre-pandemic type of mix closer to that kind of mix. So, really good mix shift and momentum in that business. Our fire and Uniform Direct Sale businesses margins are certainly benefiting from the great top line improvement. We're getting great leverage. They're not – that all other is not affected by the energy in the same way that rental is. And we're able to see some superb productivity out of that group too. So, we really like that momentum. On the rental side, we like where the business is and we've been investing in that business for the growth that we've seen in terms of an acceleration throughout the year. And look, operating a business isn't always a linear – perfect linear function. And that means there are times when there's a little bit more investment in some quarters, not as much in others. And look, overall, we love the trajectory of the rental business. We have certainly added some of those growth routes that I mentioned earlier, some capacity in the production facilities, but we like where the momentum is going in all of those businesses, but it's not a perfectly linear type of a thing to operate a business.
Shlomo Rosenbaum: Sure. Just to clarify, in the focus in that the rental side, I guess the obvious answer would be, oh, you're seeing inflationary costs and that's what's kind of hitting that number, but I want to just kind of third out what you're saying over here that is there a heavier [weighting] [ph] of investment in the last quarter or some of the things exactly what you're saying. It may not be linear and it's not really the inflation that might be hitting you guys, but the fact that you're deciding to [continue it] [ph] invested this period?
Todd Schneider: Well, I mean, look, the way that we typically invest is over time and as we need it and it's generally incremental. And in this particular case in the rental business, we've been investing all year. And sometimes, we're running up against a pretty high comp in last year's fourth quarter. And look, it's – I wouldn't say it's an overinvestment or that we underinvested in the past, it's just simply that we are investing in the way that we appropriately need to and some of that is a little bit more labor over the course of this year where we're lapping a year fiscal 2021 that was, you know it's significantly impacted by the pandemic. And as we've gotten into fiscal 2022, as we've accelerated our growth, we need capacity in order to grow. I think Hamzah may have asked a question earlier about are we able to find the labor that we need in order to continue to grow? And Todd answered, yes. And that investment is necessary, but it's important for us, especially in the long-term view that we have and that Todd talked about earlier.
Operator: Thank you. We will now take a question from Scott Schneeberger from Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Scott Schneeberger: Thanks very much. Looks like we're getting near the end here. So, I just have one, but there's a few parts to it, mostly modeling. So Mike, probably for you. Kind of a summary question, on operating margin, the guidance implies after a very good year of expansion in 2022, more expansion at the midpoint in 2023. What are the one or two things that you really worry about that could push you to the low end of the range? And then what are the couple items that could push you above? And then the latter part of this question is, cadence of operating margin into fiscal 2023, how comfortable are you and where are you thinking about for the first half of the year? And then kind of you talked about higher interest expense, what do you think the cadence is of that and maybe some color on the tax rate? Thanks for [indiscernible] all that at once.
Mike Hansen: Sure. I'll do my best. Yes, the guide that we provided provides for operating income growth of 8.6% at the low, 12% at the high, when we're comparing to that adjusted [2022] [ph] operating income. What can take us to the low – I don't, I don't – we don't mean to be overconfident, but I would say that the things that concern us most are certainly the macro and what happens that's outside of our control. Right now, we really like the way the prospects and the customers view our value. Our sales productivity numbers are really high. And I think it's more about the macro for us. And certainly, we're not trying to time or predict a recession and our numbers don't necessarily incorporate a recession, but there's a little bit of economic movement that certainly can happen that may move us towards the low end of that range. If we don't see any economic slowdown, we certainly, given the revenue momentum, we certainly could exceed the high-end. So, I would say, more than anything, it's about the macro and how does that impact us. From an interest perspective, look, the Fed is not finished and we do have some, albeit a fairly small amount, but we do have some variable interest, variable debt and the Fed is not finished. So, we may see a little bit of an impact as we go through the year, but on the other hand, we generate a lot of cash. I talked about our free cash flow a little bit earlier and if we feel like we have available cash, we'll certainly pay down some variable debt. So, I would say the 110 that we gave in the guide is a reasonable number and I wouldn't expect that to move too much unless we did something with the use of our cash potentially in M&A, otherwise, I think that 110 is a fairly solid type of a number. From a tax rate perspective, look, it's hard to predict what's going to happen in the stock market. It's hard to predict based on the stock market movement how much we may see in the way of exercises of our stock options, etcetera, those things can have an impact on our tax rate. And so it's hard to predict where we're going to be, but that 20% that we're in the guide, I think that's a reasonable place for us and what would take to move that down, it would take a more significant amount of stock options being exercised than we're expecting or it certainly could be other discrete events that happen that we're not expecting, but I think the 20% is a fairly good guide again based on what we're seeing today.
Scott Schneeberger: Great, great job answering that. Thanks a lot.
Operator: Thank you. We have no further time. So, I'll hand the call back to the speakers for any additional or closing remarks.
Todd Schneider: Well, thank you for joining us this morning. We will issue our first quarter of fiscal 2023 financial results in September. We look forward to speaking with you again at that time. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. That concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

===== 2022 Q3  (2022-03-23 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, everyone. And welcome to the Cintas Third Quarter and Full Year 2022 Earnings Release Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Paul Adler, Vice President and Treasurer, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
Paul F. Adler: Thank you, Sergei. And thank you for joining us. With me is Todd Schneider, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Mike Hansen, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We will discuss our fiscal 2022 third quarter results. After our commentary, we will open the call to questions from analysts. The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a Safe Harbor from civil litigation for forward-looking statements. This conference call contains forward-looking statements that reflect the company's current views as to future events and financial performance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those we may discuss. I refer you to the discussion on these points contained in our most recent filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. I'll now turn the call over to Todd.
Todd M. Schneider: Thank you Paul. Our third quarter financial results are led by a strong revenue increase of 10.3%. The benefits of our strong top line growth flowed through to our bottom line. Excluding the onetime gain recorded in this year’s third quarter of selling and administrative expenses, operating income margin increased 90 basis points from 18.4% to 19.3% and EPS grew 13.5% from $2.37 to $2.69. Our financial results are indicative of our compelling value proposition. Businesses prioritize all we provide including image, cleanliness, safety, and compliance. And challenge with labor scarcity and rising costs businesses increasingly turn to Cintas to help them get ready for the workday.  I'm especially pleased with our financial results because they were achieved in a period in which U.S. inflation hit a 40 year high. Inflation is high and broad and one need not look any further than the corner gas station to see it. We've been able to navigate this challenging time and delivered increased operating margins and EPS by productively starting new business, penetrating existing customers with more products and services, providing excellent service while driving operational efficiencies, and obtaining incremental price increases from our customer base. As we grow via new business we achieve operating leverage, better negotiating leverage with suppliers, denser routes, and more volume on our plants. As we penetrate existing customers we realize even stronger incremental operating margins. I thank our employees whom we call partners for their continued focus on our customers, our shareholders, and each other.  Turning now to our business units, the uniform rental and facility services operating segment revenue for the third quarter of fiscal 2022 was $1.55 billion compared to $1.42 billion last year. Organic revenue growth was 8.9%. Our news vertical strategies of healthcare, education, and state and local government continue to post leading revenue growth rates. However, there are opportunities for us in all verticals. Businesses in all sectors are struggling to fill open positions. There are about 11 million job openings in the U.S. alone. Businesses remain concerned with their ability to properly sanitized even as COVID infections decreased. Additionally, businesses are shedding non-core competencies to reduce costs and minimize the impacts of inflation. For these reasons and others, businesses are increasingly outsourcing to Cintas.  Our First Aid and Safety Services operating segment revenue for the third quarter was $213.0 million compared to $198.5 million last year. Organic revenue growth was 6.2% which is a nice improvement from last quarter's 3.2%. This improvement reflects the growing momentum of our First Aid cabinet business which grew 22% in the third quarter. We welcome this mixed shift because it is a more consistent revenue stream and has higher profit margins.  Third quarter revenue growth improved despite a difficult comparison. And last year's third quarter in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, sales of personal protective equipment or PPE were very high and the business grew organic revenue of 17.7%. At that time PPE comprised an outsized percentage of First Aid and Safety Services revenue mix. The amount of PPE has declined year-over-year as expected, however, COVID infections are still prevalent. In fact, we sold about $15 million in a new product which is COVID test kits in this year’s third quarter. PPE remains a larger percentage of the revenue mix than it was pre-COVID.  Our Fire Protection Services and Uniform Direct Sale businesses are reported in the All Other segment. All Other revenue was $194.3 million compared to $160.7 million last year. The fire business organic revenue growth rate was 15.3% and Uniform Direct Sale business organic growth rate was 48.7%. Both businesses have bounced back as expected.  I'd like to comment on another one of our strengths namely cash flow. Third quarter operating cash flow increased 18.5% from last year. In this year's third quarter $105 million was used for acquisitions. On March 15th, we paid shareholders $99 million in quarterly dividends. And during the quarter and through March 22, 2022 Cintas purchased $584.2 million of Cintas common stock under our buyback program. We continue to allocate capital in many ways to improve shareholder return. Our strong balance sheet and cash flow enable us to do so consistently.  Finally, I want to share some great news on our technology front. Our ERP provider SAP extended membership in their Strategic Customer Program to Cintas. This is an exclusive program. Only 1% of SAP's customers have membership in it. Inclusion in the program enables us to engage directly with top management of SAP and gain access to its developers and new technologies to realize valuable outcomes for our customers, suppliers, and employees. This program will speed the pace of our transformation into a more data dynamic and process efficient business. I'll now turn the call over to Mike.
J. Michael Hansen: Thanks, Todd. Our fiscal 2022 third quarter revenue was $1.96 billion compared to $1.78 billion last year. The organic revenue growth rate adjusted for acquisitions, divestitures, and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations was 10%. Gross margin for the third quarter of fiscal 2022 was $898.2 million, compared to $809.5 million last year. Gross margin as a percent of revenue was 45.8% for the third quarter of fiscal 2022, compared to 45.6% last year, an increase of 20 basis points. Energy expenses comprised of gasoline, natural gas, and electricity were a headwind, increasing 45 basis points from last year. Gross margin percentage by business was 46.3% for Uniform Rental and Facility Services, 44.2% for First Aid and Safety Services, 46.6% for Fire Protection Services, and 37.7% for Uniform Direct Sale. Operating income of $407.6 million compared to $326.5 million last year. Operating income margin was 20.8% compared to 18.4% reported last year. Fiscal 2022 third quarter operating income included a $30.2 million gain on the acquisition of an entity -- of an equity method investment. The gain was recorded in the Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment's selling and administrative expenses. Excluding this gain, fiscal 2022 third quarter operating income, as a percentage of revenue, was 19.3%, an increase of 90 basis points from last year's third quarter. Our effective tax rate for the third quarter was 18.2% compared to 14.4% last year. The tax rate can move from period to period based on discrete events, including the amount of stock compensation expense. This year's third quarter equity method investment transaction included a significant tax benefit. Excluding the transaction, the effective tax rate for the third quarter of fiscal 2022 was 19.6%. Net income for the third quarter was $315.4 million, compared to $258.4 million last year. Diluted EPS was $2.97 compared to $2.37 last year. Fiscal 2022 third quarter diluted EPS contained $0.28 from the gain on the equity method investment transaction, which included a related $0.07 tax rate benefit. Excluding this gain and the related tax impact, fiscal 2022 third quarter diluted EPS was $2.69 compared to $2.37 and in last year's third quarter, a 13.5% increase. We're increasing our financial guidance. We expect our fourth quarter revenue to be in the range of $1.96 billion to $2.02 billion and diluted EPS to be in the range of $2.54 to $2.74. Our fourth quarter fiscal 2022 effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 23.2% compared to a rate of 19.4% for last year's fourth quarter. The expected higher effective tax rate is anticipated to negatively impact fiscal 2022 fourth quarter diluted EPS guidance by approximately $0.14 and diluted EPS growth by approximately 560 basis points. Our financial guidance includes share buybacks through March 22nd, but does not include the impact of any future share buybacks. Finally, I wanted to provide an update on our debt and liquidity. We have $650 million of senior notes maturing April 1st, 2022, and $300 million of senior notes maturing June 1st, 2022. We expect to refinance these amounts with funds received via the issuance of new senior debt. Also, we closed today on a new credit facility, increasing it to $2 billion and extending it to 2027. We have a strong balance sheet and ample liquidity. I'll turn it over to Paul, now.
Paul F. Adler: That concludes our prepared remarks. Now, we are happy to answer questions from the analysts. Please ask just one question and a single follow-up if needed. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Andrew Steinerman from J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead. 
Alexander Hess: Hi, this is Alex Hess on for Andrew Steinerman today. I wanted to touch briefly on what you guys are seeing at the vertical level, maybe with respect to a rebound and a potential rebound in hospitality or is that -- was that still being dragged in your last quarter from Omicron and then maybe, also, progress maybe, in driving adoption in healthcare, any comments on those two fronts? Thanks guys.
Todd M. Schneider: Sure, Alex. Thanks for the question. Our vertical strategy is working quite well. You mentioned the hospitality sector, it is certainly bouncing back. If you -- what you read in the news, bookings are up in the airlines and the hospitality sector. So yes, so that's bouncing back. And I think the results in our direct sales business, which is in large part tied to -- certainly, to a percentage tied to the hospitality area, the results are outstanding. So -- but in our other verticals, we're having very good success in each of those. And in the healthcare, specifically, we see a -- we're very much in the early innings but we have products and services that are compelling to that customer base. And we're continuing to evolve and create new products and new technologies that we're integrating there. So as a result, we're very bullish on our strategy in that area, with our focus in that area, and I think the results are reflective.
Alexander Hess: Thank you. 
Operator: Hamzah Mazari from Jefferies. Please go ahead. 
Hamzah Mazari: Hey, good morning. You had referenced penetrating more customers as part of strong incrementals, specifically as it relates to that, do you have a sense of how many customers today are buying more than one service from you, has that changed at all due to having SAP? What was that same number pre-pandemic just so we can get a sense of that initiative?
Todd M. Schneider: Yes. Hamzah, certainly being virtually on one system now, it is certainly helping our transparency into cross-selling. What I'll tell you is, again, we're in the early innings of cross-sell. There is a -- our ability to add product, we have a really long runway in that area. Just to get to even a reasonable level of penetration, where we feel excited about it, there is a long, long runway to penetrating our customers with our existing products separate from what we're going to bring into the marketplace in the future, which is we're always working on new products and services. So we feel good about that. So it's certainly improving, but very much in the early innings of that -- on that subject.
Hamzah Mazari: Got it. And just my follow-up question, I'll turn it over, it is just, around M&A, any updated thoughts as to the pipeline there or have valuations come in at all, I know you've talked about historically, that M&A doesn't necessarily mean it has to be route-based, just walk us through that as well, the rationale there? Thank you. 
Todd M. Schneider: Sure, Hamzah. We -- as we noted, M&A was good in the third quarter of our -- the investment we've made in acquiring businesses. We're highly acquisitive. The pipeline looks attractive. It takes different reasons for different companies to transact. You can't always predict that timing, but we are very much a willing buyer and of all shapes and sizes. We're very, very acquisitive and interested in making deals. So we're ready, willing, and able to continue to move forward in that area.
J. Michael Hansen: Yes. Hamzah, we -- as you heard Todd mention, our third quarter included an overall acquisition number of $105 million, which is certainly a step up from where we've been. Now, included in that is the purchase of the remaining shares of the equity method investment, which was about $48 million within that number. But the rest of the M&A of $57 million is still a step-up from where we've been. So there has been some good movement this entire fiscal year, and we like the messaging that we're getting. We like the pipeline and as you can see so far this year, we've acted on many of those.
Hamzah Mazari: Got it, very helpful. Thank you. 
Operator: George Tong, Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. 
George Tong: Hi, thanks, good morning. Can you discuss how the business is being impacted by rising input costs, including wage inflation and higher energy costs? And how effectively pricing trends are offsetting this?
Todd M. Schneider: Good morning George. Thanks for the question. Certainly, expected that inflation and input costs would be something that we would want to be talking about. So we have -- so I have a few examples I'd like to talk about regarding items that we are -- steps that we're taking to mitigate input costs. But inflation is -- yes, it's certainly challenging. It's very much there. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, whether it's fuel or other areas, input costs are real. But we're being very active in taking steps to make sure that we are mitigating that type of exposure. You mentioned pricing, so certainly pricing is a component of our strategy, but it is -- by no means is it the only strategy to combat pricing -- or excuse me, to combat inflation. So we're taking other steps and they almost all involve technology. And these were all initiatives that we have been working on. However, due to the inflation subject, we decided to pull them forward and go faster with them. And individually, they are not massive movers, but collectively they certainly add up. So I'll go through a few of those that I think might help provide a little color.  First off, I mentioned in, I think, our last call, that we have invested in routing technology that is proprietary and really fits our business well. And as long as I've been with the company, it seems like we have tried about every routing software out there, and we finally said we're going to build it ourselves. We're going to do it. It's going to fit with SAP, and it will be -- because we have a unique routing structure, so we did that. And I'm very thankful that over the past couple of years, we've invested in that technology. We've rolled out across the organization, and we're executing on it. Now, we -- very important, right, we recognize that we only generate revenue when the truck stops. When it stops at our customers' place of business, that's when we can generate revenue. So we've got to be more efficient. And I'm really pleased with that investment. Certainly, it takes time. There's -- we are very conscious of any customer disruption, but we're trying to go faster with that subject. And again, we're blessed that we made the investment. And if we didn't have it, then it would put much more pressure on the organization with the inflation subject. So again, very pleased that we have that. We've also, from a technology standpoint, we invested in some in automation. We now have three different processes for how to implement automation into our uniform processing facilities. And this provides us flexibility we didn't have in the past. That flexibility is, meaning we can deploy one of those based upon a number of factors really gets into the footprint of the facility and the number of pieces going through. But we've pivoted on this subject as well to go faster, because of what's going on with labor costs, certainly. So we're able to automate our facilities in a sped-up fashion. And then I've got a couple of others that I'll talk about. We now -- we've invested in technology through SAP that allows us to have a centralized dashboard and look at all of our rental processing facilities and understand how they're operating on a daily basis, a real-time basis from an efficiency and effectiveness standpoint. So in the past, we had to go physically see these facilities to understand if they're operating in the manner that we expect. But now, we have this real-time dashboard and it allows us to know how we're doing. And as a result, there's more accountability, and we're getting better. That allows us to improve the efficiencies within our business. And I've got a few others, but one other I'll give you is we are -- because of the technology we have with SAP now, we're seeing a real nice impact in our ability to share our used inventory of garments across all of our locations. This is due to our stock rooms, which is where we house our used inventory at each of our locations having real-time inventory tracking and all being on that same system of SAP. So what it allows us to do is to gain better use of the inventory that was in the past, dedicated solely to the individual locations customer base. Now, we can spread it out across a much larger customer base. And we -- and it also allows us with, nonstock sizes, to look at where the product is and get it faster to our customers. So I could go on, but hopefully, that gives you a few examples of items that -- proactive steps that we are taking to mitigate the inflation. Because, again, as I mentioned, it's real, it's challenging, but I'm highly confident that the organization will be able to manage through this as we have in the past.
George Tong: That's very helpful. Thank you. And then just as a follow-up, could you provide a brief update on how your customer base is being affected by supply chain disruptions and the flow-through impact on demand for Cintas' services?
Todd M. Schneider: Yes. Certainly, George, our customers aren't being impacted by supply chain that's slowing them a bit. But -- and we care passionately about how our customers are, their business are doing, because it obviously has a dynamic impact on us. But as I mentioned earlier, the challenges that our customers are facing was staffing and labor costs. They're looking for ways to outsource and we're beneficiaries of that. We are certainly excited about supply chain issues abating and our customers being able to go even faster, but to date, that's a bit of a headwind, but we have the tailwind of the outsourcing and the benefits we're seeing there.
George Tong: Very helpful, thank you. 
Operator: Ashish Sabadra, RBC. Please go ahead. 
Ashish Sabadra: Thanks for taking my question and thanks for providing that detailed color on the technology front. I was wondering if you could also talk about how technology is helping you more on the dynamic pricing and more like local pricing, can you just quote on further just on the pricing trend what the normalized pricing has been historically, and how are we thinking about pricing here, particularly in the inflationary environment and the response to your -- by your customer to maybe, potentially, higher price? Thanks.
Todd M. Schneider: Thanks, Ashish for the question. I'll start, if Mike wants to contribute as well. We -- certainly, we -- again, being on one technology platform gives us the ability to use large amounts of data to analyze. And -- but pricing is -- it's a local subject. It's a customer-by-customer subject, industry by industry. But it does give us -- the technology, does give us the ability to look more strategically at our customer base to make sure we're making really good long-term decisions. So we feel good about that. We've had that in place, and we've taken that approach over the past couple of years, and we'll continue that approach and make sure that we're not just making sweeping decisions, but they're more targeted decisions that are more strategic.
J. Michael Hansen: Maybe, I'll simply add, certainly, with all of the inflation in the news, the customers are -- it's a little bit of an easier conversation today than it might be otherwise. And so our customers have generally been receptive to that, and that results in a little bit of a higher pricing impact than in the past. And so we've talked a lot about 0% to 2% in the past, and we're a little bit above that today. And so that certainly is one way for us to fight inflation.
Todd M. Schneider: Great, Mike. Thank you. But just to point out, clearly, the majority of our growth is coming from more volume growth not pricing, and it is due to the value that we're adding to customers and new business that we're selling, ads and penetrating our customer base, that's where the majority of our growth is coming from, clearly.
J. Michael Hansen: I just want to conclude the thought with going back to Ashish to the technology. I think sometimes, it's hard for people to understand the magnitude of the transactions in this business. One of our General Managers of our operations, just one operation, I mean, they can have 5,000 customers. And so the ability to have the technology, as Todd spoke to, and seize upon that to be able to supplement the GM's ability to analyze 5,000 customers to ensure that the pricing is where it needs to be or to see trends in the data to understand if there are customers that are kind of comparing back, reducing services over time, that's a jeopardy account. I, the General manager need to get in front of that particular customer, those are the types of advantages that the technology provides, because it is just such a luminous business and that technology and the additional eyes and that intelligence is certainly a huge competitive advantage.
Ashish Sabadra: That's very helpful color. And maybe, if I can just ask, I'm not sure if you have quantified how big energy is as a percentage of overall expenses but also, my question is more longer-term. How are you thinking about improving the energy efficiency of the business, both on the truck side, but also on the laundry facilities front? Thank you. 
J. Michael Hansen: Sure, Ashish. The third quarter total energy for the business was 2.3% of sales. In our guidance side certainly, the gas price has escalated as we got into February, and we're thinking more in terms of 2.6% to 2.8% in our fourth quarter. So certainly, we're going to see a little bit of our expectation is we'll see a little bit of an increase. Just to give you a little bit of maybe, an impact of what we have already done to be more energy efficient, if you go back to the last time we saw prices at the pump at this kind of level was back in calendar 2014. And if you think about the third quarter of our calendar 2014, we were certainly a smaller company, but our total energy at that time was 3% of revenue. So at the same price in the pump, we've been able to reduce our energy by almost a third and from 3% to 2.3%. So we've made some really good progress and we've talked about some of those things. Some of it is certainly scale and growth, but as Todd has talked about, some of it is also the routing efficiency, the penetration that allows us to park the truck a little bit longer.  So we've made some really nice progress over the last several number of years. And how do we think about it going forward, we certainly are going to continue to work at routing efficiency, penetration, but also, certainly, we've talked a little bit about getting electric vehicles on to the road and that has started. And our expectation is we'll put many, many more of those as we move towards our goal of net zero in 2050. So there's a lot more to come in this type of space and we're in the early, early part of exploring that alternative fuel vehicles, but we certainly think that's a big part of our future.
Todd M. Schneider: Ashish, in addition, I mentioned earlier about the centralized dashboard that allows us to understand how our locations are functioning, at what level of efficiency. That speaks directly to energy usage in our production facilities. So the more efficient we are, the lower the consumption of the energy, certainly, per pound, specifically. And then, I didn't mention, but we have also, over the past couple of years, we've invested in converting all of our locations to LED lighting, which helps in our ESG journey, but it helps with the consumption of energy and helps reduce some cost. So it's also a cost mitigation subject. So -- and we're looking at other items in that area to reduce energy consumption in our production facility.
Ashish Sabadra: That's very helpful color and congrats on the solid results.
Operator: Andy Wittmann, R.W. Baird. Please go ahead. 
Andrew Wittmann: Hey thanks. Let's just keep going on this path, I guess. Mike, just when kind of using your EPS and your revenue guidance, I'm backing into fourth quarter margin guidance, which is at the midpoint about flat year-over-year. I think that's probably right, and you can comment on that, I suppose. But you just mentioned that energy prices on a sequential basis, maybe, like 40 basis points. I was wondering if the third quarter was plus 90 basis points adjusted on the margin improvements, you got 40 in energy, what's the other 50? And can you talk about some of the other puts and takes that drive you to that margin -- implied margin guidance?
J. Michael Hansen: Yes. I would -- let's start with the implied margin guidance. The range that we see is something like 18.5% at the bottom to 20% at the top. So last year's fourth quarter was 19.4%. So you're right, at the midpoint, it's somewhat flattish against, let's call it, a 60 to 80-point energy headwind from a year ago. And at the top of that range, it's margin expansion even in this period of time. So our goal will be to continue to drive towards margin expansion even in a pretty difficult environment. So getting back to, I think, your question of why, maybe, not more margin expansion. First of all, I would say, look, Andy, I don't know how many companies are expanding margins in this kind of environment, but we intend to. But we also are growing quite nicely. And you've seen our growth move from organically, 8.6% in total in the first quarter to 9.3% to 10%. And growth means for us, when we're growing that volumes, we are investing in things like capacity in our wash alleys and other places. We're investing in -- even when we talk about the route efficiency that doesn't mean we're necessarily not adding routes. And so we're going to continue to invest in our routes. We're going to continue to invest in other customer-facing positions. And so we're going to continue to invest even in this kind of environment, because the growth is very, very good and strong. So that comes with a little bit of a cost too. But gosh, Andy, in this kind of environment, we're looking at a 60 to 80-point -- basis point energy headwind to guide towards margin expansion, we feel pretty good about.
Andrew Wittmann: Yes, I wasn't trying to imply otherwise. Could you comment specifically on the labor market, are your positions filled today, are you having enough people to do what you need them to do, and can you talk about the overall pricing trends on that category, specifically?
Todd M. Schneider: Andy, we always have job postings, openings, we're growing. And as I mentioned earlier, we're growing our volume very attractively. So there's more work and we're really pleased about that. So -- and the labor market is challenging, trying to get the levels that we're at. We're running at higher RPMs to get there, not speaking of when I say higher RPMs, our management team is working harder to get there. But we like our staffing levels and we will continue to plan to invest in that area. We like our productivity that we're seeing from our partners in all areas of our business. And I think that speaks in large part to our culture, where our folks are -- they get up earlier, they work harder, they work later. And as a result, we have a strategic competitive advantage in the marketplace as a result of that. But yes, we're conscious of -- we're trying to add roles, and we're doing it quite successfully. It's never good enough, as you know, from a leadership standpoint, that we're focused on.
Andrew Wittmann: Thanks.
Operator: Tim Mulrooney, William Blair. Please go ahead. 
Timothy Mulrooney: Yeah, good morning. I wanted to go back to pricing for a second. If your uniform contracts are typically several years in length, can you talk about the actual mechanics around how you adjust for pricing, are there annual pricing conversations stipulated within the contract or do you just kind of reach out to customers as needed when you hit certain inflationary thresholds? And are there inflation pass-through provisions in these contracts? Thank you. 
Todd M. Schneider: Tim, thanks for the question. We have a million customers or more. So the answer is you name it, we've got it. But generally, what I'll speak to is our agreements allow us to raise price and raise price as appropriate. And when we do so, our approach is we do that once a year. It doesn't mean that they all happen on the same day. They may be spread out throughout the year, but the conversation is once a year with the customer. And we have found that, that is -- our commitment to our customers is to handle it in that manner. They like that. Our partners like that. And in these inflationary times, as Mike mentioned earlier, those conversations are going better than they normally have. And they are, just because inflation is front and center of everything, every newspaper that I look at. But our approach is once a year with the customer, and we've been sticking by that, and we plan to continue to stick by that commitment to them.
Timothy Mulrooney: Okay, that’s great. Thank you. 
Operator: Manav Patnaik, Barclays. Please go ahead. 
Manav Patnaik: Thank you. I just wanted to follow up on the labor environment broadly, it sounds like you're managing your own labor pretty well. But just curious what you can share in terms of the challenges, struggles, openings, turnover, etcetera that your customers are facing and how that's looking today?
Todd M. Schneider: Manav, certainly we are seeing a higher level, we call it a churn, through our customer base. Meaning, we see people that -- one customer and they end up at the other customer and that is at a higher level than it has been in the past. But nevertheless, we like the trend that we're seeing with our customer base and the ad stops trends that we're seeing. That's positive. And just as I mentioned, it seems like it's harder for businesses right now. Everybody is having to work a little bit more at it and productivity has to be a little bit better, but we are certainly seeing more churn of our -- within our customer base than we did, historically.
Manav Patnaik: Got it. And Mike, maybe, just for the fourth quarter, there's some tough comps on the rental side and then the fire side as well, I believe. If you could just help us with maybe the sequential organic growth trends we should be thinking about, what the M&A contribution is maybe?
J. Michael Hansen: Sure. When we think about organic growth for the rental division, we were at 8.9%. Our expectation -- and so first of all, Manav, let me maybe step back. The guidance for us implies 6.8% to 10% growth, slightly over 10% growth. So we love the momentum of the rental business, and we think that's going to continue to perform very, very well in those upper single-digit type ranges. First Aid and Safety is going to rebound quite a bit in the fourth quarter due to great momentum, but also, a little bit of an easier comp. And we expect that to be in the mid-teens. Our fire business, which grew organically 15.3% this quarter, we continue to expect a very good growth in that area. And then, our Uniform Direct Sale business is going to face a tougher comp. And likely, that's going to come back to something more normalized low to mid-single digits. Did I get -- I'm not sure if I heard the second part of your question, if there was one, Manav.
Manav Patnaik: Yes, it was just around given all the M&A. I guess, you picked up on what that quality contribution would look like.
J. Michael Hansen: Got it. Yes, yes. So I think I covered that. Maybe, I'll touch on, we talked about -- I talked about the M&A and a big component of that M&A was this equity investment transaction. That is we have got into a joint venture years ago for primarily, the purposes of product innovation and particularly, within our Facility Services business. But that's a component. That entity, which we decided made sense to wholly own now is going to tuck into our global supply chain. So it's relatively non-revenue producing. And so we won't see much of an impact on that. It tucks in the global supply chain.
Manav Patnaik: Got it, thank you. 
Operator: Heather Balsky, Bank of America. Please go ahead. 
Heather Balsky: Hi, good morning. Thank you for taking my question. I wanted to just touch on and clarify some stuff on the PPE side. Just curious where you guys are relative to 2019 levels at this point, are you still above, or are you -- have you gotten back to kind of a more normalized trend? And then you mentioned sales of COVID tests during the quarter, how you're thinking about that business going forward and is there an inventory investment around that as well? Thank you. 
J. Michael Hansen: Yes. Our personal protective equipment sales have still been above pre-pandemic levels. We like -- we've talked a little bit throughout here about the value that our customers are seeing in it. And we are certainly recognizing that they still value safety, cleanliness and sanitizing. And so those revenue streams are still above pre-pandemic levels. It's hard to predict what those are going to look like into the future, but they're certainly above pre-pandemic. And the value proposition is being -- is resonating certainly, more today than it did pre-pandemic. So we like the movement in that business and so far, the staying power of that. From a test kit perspective, as we've done throughout this pandemic, our goal has been to do our best to take care of our customers. And in this particular quarter with Omicron really rising, our customers were asking us for the test kit opportunities, and we were able to fulfill those. It did not come with an inventory requirement. Our expectation is that's not going to be big mover into the future. We called out about $15 million worth, that's something that we wouldn't typically expect to repeat at anything close to that level.
Heather Balsky: Thank you. And just a follow-up on the PPE side, just because I recall, it's a lower margin business. Is that -- even though it's still elevated, is it declining, do you see it as a tailwind to your margins going as it sort of levels off going into the next quarter and into next year as well?
J. Michael Hansen: The short answer is yes, Heather, and I'll maybe, talk about it this way. The First Aid and Safety business where a lot of that PP&E has been, we've seen some really nice momentum in the First Aid side of the business. And that generally comes with those better margins. And we saw a nice uptick from our second quarter to our third quarter in our First Aid and Safety gross margins. And our expectation is that momentum is going to continue even though we still certainly hope that there is more PPE going forward than pre-pandemic. But you're right, Heather. As the mix tilts back to a greater amount of First Aid business, we expect those gross margins to start to get closer and closer towards those pre-pandemic levels. But the one thing I will say in the First Aid and Safety businesses are, we made a nice jump in our operating margin too. And if you think about the SG&A part of that business, we -- our salespeople are producing at very, very high levels and our SG&A in that business is well below pre-pandemic levels. And so as we continue this mix moving in the right direction, our expectation is that those overall operating margins will certainly get back to pre-pandemic levels and can improve from there. We were at, call it, in the mid-14% range pre-pandemic, and we're on our way back towards those. And our goal, certainly, would be more expansion after that.
Heather Balsky: Okay, thank you for that color. 
Operator: Scott Schneeberger, Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. 
Scott Schneeberger: Thanks very much. Good morning. And guys, I have one more following up on inflation and price. You had stated that the majority of the growth is coming from volume. And I'm just curious, I guess the essence of the question is what percent of the -- you're doing on a customer by customer base, but what percent of your base would you say you have affected with price increases at this juncture and will we see a greater percentage of the growth going forward coming from the pricing side as opposed to the volume side as that kicks in on who you've already priced and who you maybe have yet to a price, just a little bit better feel on the time as how much more contribution we may see from price offsetting cost pressure going forward? Thanks. 
Todd M. Schneider: Thanks for the question, Scott. How we approach it, as I mentioned, it's once a year, but it's a relatively smoothed out throughout the year. And as we've talked about in the past, some of it depends upon the condition of that customer, how their business is, that industry, that geography. And as time goes on, hopefully, that will become a lot more consistent. But no, I think what you're seeing, as far as our volume growth and the pricing wins that we're getting, I think you'll see that be pretty consistent in the future. I don't think you'll see an outsized percentage coming from pricing next year and the coming weeks, months, or something like that, because of how we approach it. And again, we're very, very happy with the level of demand that we're seeing from our customer base. It's very attractive for us. We're investing appropriately for it, and we're very pleased.
Scott Schneeberger: Great, thanks. Appreciate that response. For my follow-up, I'm just curious, going back to this 1% of SAP extended membership in which you're participating. Could you elaborate on how that came to be and you covered some of the benefits about what it offers. But just if you could take us a little bit deeper on, was that something you pursued, was that something that they granted, how it came to be and just where you expect to go with that? Thanks.
Todd M. Schneider: Great. Great. Yes. We're very proud of the relationship we have with SAP, and it goes back a number of years now. And it is something that they bestowed upon us. Our relationship has been flourishing over the past few years because of the degree to which we deploy their technology and the usefulness that we get out of it. So I think they really like seeing how we leverage their technology. And as a result, it gets us, as I mentioned, it's -- we're in a different stratosphere. And you think about SAP's customer base and then you think about that we're being in the top 1%, it's unique air. And so as I mentioned, it does get us relationships at very high levels. There's an SAP board member that is assigned to us as a customer. We have relationships, again, obviously, at really, really high levels. But it gets us access to their developers and to their technologies on the front end instead of it being rolled out. And then we got to figure out, we can have input and instead of just having something roll out and then we got to figure out how to manage through the change. So when you're in that 1%, you have the ear of those folks and allows you to impact where those items go. So as a result, we think that's an advantage for us. And we're very pleased with it and very pleased with our investment with SAP, and we're seeing real dividends from that as we -- I think we've laid out over the past few quarters.
Scott Schneeberger: That sounds great. Thanks, I will turn it over. 
Operator: Shlomo Rosenbaum, Stifel. Please go ahead. 
Shlomo Rosenbaum: Hi, good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. Hey Todd, where are you now in terms of opening up and getting back to normal, like kind of an apples-to-apples basis in terms of volumes with your customers. So pre-COVID versus where you are today, how much more is -- juice is left in that kind of recovery play for things just kind of opening up more and getting back to your historical basis of, let's say, 2019 volume levels?
Todd M. Schneider: Shlomo, great question. Our customers are, for the most part, they're all open. Certainly, there are some that are, unfortunately, that did not survive through the pandemic and the challenges that through at folks. But our customers are all -- I'll say they're open. They're not all at the same levels of consumption that they once were. Some are higher, some are lower. But we think there's still similar opportunity there as the economy opens up and to a larger degree, as people are back more to work to a larger degree. So we think that's positive. And we think there's also some hidden benefits that we can get from the fact that during the -- throughout the pandemic, as we've talked about, the customers see us in a different light. How we handled their accounts, how we handled their invoices, the lack of increase in the flexibility that we provided, but also the access to product that they didn't even know that we provided in the past. So Shlomo, that is an advantage for us. The fact that they look at it and they say, "Wow, we didn't realize Cintas provided these items." They can get them. They're great to work with. They're consistent and they're reasonable. So as a result, that, I think, sets a different level of different pool level. But we still think there's even more opportunities within that customer base where folks -- where they will get back to a spend level where they once were. So we think the future looks quite attractive from that standpoint.
Shlomo Rosenbaum: Okay, thank you. And then just to clarify, maybe, this is for you, Mike. The equity method investment was the supply chain technology business, early stage that you brought in and then you decided that you wanted to own all of it, but it's not the product sale, it's a capability to manage your business internally, is that what we're talking about?
J. Michael Hansen: It's a -- it has been an entity where we've done product innovation that has created products for the rental division, particularly in Facility Services. So it's -- while it isn't a direct producer of revenue, it has created products over the years that have created revenue streams for the rental division.
Shlomo Rosenbaum: Okay, alright. Thank you very much.
Operator: Toni Kaplan, Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. 
Toni Kaplan: Thank you. I wanted to ask one more follow-up on inflation and whether you have inflationary escalators built into the contracts and if you do, what percent of contracts do you have that built in?
Todd M. Schneider: Toni, I appreciate the question. As I mentioned earlier, we have such a broad customer base that you name it, we have it from a contractual standpoint. Generally speaking, we have the ability to raise price and no limits, and do so as we deem appropriate. We fundamentally and practically, how we've handled it is we go in and we talk to the customer once a year and explain what the adjustment -- the price adjustment is and we managed through that. But no, we're not limited. Certainly, do we have certain customers that we have limits on? Absolutely. But generally speaking, no, we're not limited from that standpoint. It's more about making good long-term practical decisions that help us retain those customers for life. And while we're at it, I'll just -- I will say, our customer retention rates are really attractive right now. They have been since -- for the past couple of years and they have certainly not degraded. So we're excited about that. I think in large part, it's our approach, Toni, that we take on this subject about the flexibility, the pricing, the reasonableness and we have good conversations that I think people understand and we can manage through it.
Toni Kaplan: Great. And there are a couple of -- there's a question about different verticals earlier and you mentioned a couple of them in specific, but I wanted to understand if there were certain verticals outside of, I think it was healthcare and hospitality that we mentioned earlier, that have seen higher or lower growth than normal, just if there's any others that would makes sense to call out? And then related, just wanted to hear any color on the new business pipeline. Thanks.
Todd M. Schneider: Sure. So hospitality is obviously, as you're reading in the journal and other periodicals, it's -- bookings are way up for those folks there. So that's bounced back nicely. Healthcare has been some stops and starts, but the demand for our products have been very consistent. And through the pandemic, us being -- having product available was a big deal. And the movement towards getting away from, in many cases, as folks looking at and saying, "hey, we don't want a onetime disposable.” They're hard to access, not great for the environment and going to reusable has been great in health care, which we've kind of detailed out in the past. Education sector, has been, I'd say, a little bit of stops and starts as well in the fact that they literally stopped and started in their schools in many cases. But generally speaking, the education sector is doing quite well. And then lastly, with the government sector, that's obviously been really consistent. And we like our verticals. We like our approach in those areas and they're all growing attractively, and we expect them to continue to grow attractively based upon our strategy there.
Toni Kaplan: Thank you.
Todd M. Schneider: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Alright, it appears there are no further questions in the queue, I would like to hand the call back over to Mr. Paul Adler for any additional or closing remarks. Over to you, sir.
Paul F. Adler: Alright. Thanks, Sergei, and thank you all for joining us this morning. We will issue our fourth quarter fiscal 2022 financial results in July. We look forward to speaking with you again at that time. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2022 Q2  (2021-12-22 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, everyone. And welcome to the Cintas Second Quarter Fiscal Year 2022 Earnings Release Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Paul Adler, Vice President and Treasurer, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
Paul Adler : Thank you, Vanasan. And thank you for joining us. With me is Todd Schneider, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Mike Hansen, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We will discuss our fiscal 2022 second quarter results. After our commentary, we will open the call to questions from analysts. The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a safe harbor from civil litigation for forward-looking statements. This conference call contains forward-looking statements that reflect the company's current views as to future events and financial performance.  These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those we may discuss. I refer you to the discussion on these points contained in our most recent filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. I'll now turn the call over to Todd.
Todd Schneider: Thank you, Paul. Our second quarter financial results were led by a strong revenue increase of 9.4%. Our financial results are indicative of our compelling value proposition, vast total addressable markets, and the outstanding execution of our employee partners. I thank our partners for continuing to navigate these challenging times by focusing on our customers. The benefits of our strong top line growth flowed through to our bottom line. Excluding last year's $18 million pretax gain on the sale of certain operating assets and Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment and the related tax benefits, second quarter operating income margin increased 70 basis points from last year, and EPS grew 16.5%. These results are especially significant given that they were achieved in a period in which U.S. inflation hit a 39-year high. Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segment revenue was $1.54 billion compared to $1.41 billion last year. Organic revenue growth was 8.5%. The labor market is challenging. However, we are benefiting in the current environment. Businesses are struggling with the scarcity of labor, which has left many understaffed. Also, businesses have a heightened awareness of safety and cleanliness and are concerned with their ability to properly sanitize amid persistent COVID infections. Businesses are increasingly outsourcing to Cintas, so they can focus on their core competencies and be Ready for the Workday.  And it is noteworthy that the U.S. still hasn't recovered about 4 million pre-pandemic jobs, and the job openings totaled about 11 million. Return of jobs represents future revenue growth opportunity for Cintas. Our First Aid and Safety Services operating segment revenue for the second quarter was $202.2 million compared to $194.4 million last year. Organic revenue growth was 3.2%. Second quarter revenue was up against a difficult comparison. In last year's second quarter, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, sales of personal protective equipment, or PPE were very high and the business grew organic revenue 14.5%. At that time, PPE comprised an outsized percentage of First Aid and Safety Services revenue mix.  The amount of PPE has declined year-over-year as expected. However, COVID infections are still prevalent and PPE remains a larger percentage of the revenue mix than it was pre-COVID. Over the same period of time, the recurring first aid cabinet service business revenue has increased. In fact, it is up 20% from last year. We welcome this shift in mix because First Aid cabinet service business is a more consistent revenue stream and has higher profit margins than PPE. Our Fire Protection Services and Uniform Direct Sale businesses are reported in the All Other segment. All Other revenue was $184.9 million compared to $152.1 million last year. The Fire business organic revenue growth rate was 16.9%, and the Uniform Direct Sale business organic growth rate was 47.3%. Both businesses benefited in part from an improved economic environment. Regarding our balance sheet and cash flow, our financial position remained strong. Second quarter operating cash flow increased 27% from last year and free cash flow improved 16%. Recently, on December 15, we paid shareholders $98.5 million in quarterly dividends. The amount per share of common stock paid of $0.95 represents a 26.7% increase over the company's previous quarterly dividend. We continue to allocate capital to improve shareholder return. Now before turning the call over to Mike, I want to highlight that we recently issued our 2021 environmental, social, and governance report. Cintas was founded on a sustainable business model. We are committed to protecting the environment, enhancing humanity, and maintaining accountability.  The report, our second consecutive provides expanded information and data, including our reductions in energy usage, water consumption, and Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions. Our ESG report further illustrates that our corporate culture based on doing what is right and challenging ourselves to improve is a competitive advantage. I'll now turn the call over to Mike.
Mike Hansen : Thank you, Todd, and good morning. Our fiscal 2022 second quarter revenue was $1.92 billion compared to $1.76 billion last year. The organic revenue growth rate, adjusted for acquisitions, divestitures, and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations was 9.3%.  Gross margin for the second quarter of fiscal '22 was $885.1 million compared to $819.9 million last year. Gross margin as a percent of revenue was 46% for the second quarter of fiscal '22 compared to 46.7% last year. Gross margin percentage by business was 46.8% for Uniform Rental and Facility Services, 43.5% for First Aid and Safety Services, 44.6% for Fire Protection services, and 39.1% for Uniform Direct Sale. Energy-related expenses were a headwind, increasing 40 basis points from last year. Also, we made investments in labor to support our strong current and anticipated revenue growth. Selling and administrative expenses improved as a percentage of revenue to 26.2% in the second quarter compared to 26.6% last year, operating income of $381.2 million compared to $352.9 million last year. Operating income margin was 19.8% compared to 20.1% reported last year. Excluding last year's second quarter $18 million gain on sale of certain assets, which were recorded in selling and administrative expenses, this year's second quarter operating income grew 13.8% and operating income margin increased 70 basis points. Our effective tax rate for the second quarter was 18% compared to 13.3% last year. The tax rate can move from period to period based on discrete events, including the amount of stock compensation expense. In addition, last year's second quarter tax rate included a 370 basis point benefit from the sale of certain assets. Net income for the second quarter was $294.7 million compared to $284.9 million last year. Diluted EPS was $2.76 compared to $2.62 last year. Excluding last year's second quarter gain and the related tax benefits, which impacted diluted EPS by $0.25, this year's second quarter diluted EPS of $2.76 compares to $2.37, an increase of 16.5%. We are increasing our fiscal '22 financial guidance. We are raising our annual revenue expectations from a range of $7.58 billion to $7.6 billion to a range of $7.63 billion to $7.70 billion, and diluted EPS from a range of $10.60 to $10.90 to a range of $10.70 to $10.95. Please note the following regarding our guidance: Fiscal '22 effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 19% compared to a rate of 13.7% for fiscal '21. The higher effective tax rate negatively impacts fiscal '22 diluted EPS guidance by about $0.72 and diluted EPS growth by about 700 basis points.  Guidance does not include any future share buybacks, and guidance assumes an uneven economic recovery caused by COVID-19. However, guidance does not contemplate significant COVID-19 pandemic-related setbacks such as stay-at-home orders or cost necessary to comply with government COVID-19 mandates. Finally, when modeling our fiscal '22 financial results by quarter, please note that in last fiscal year's third quarter, we were able to help our customers respond to a spike in COVID-19 cases by providing them with various supplies of personal protective equipment, gloves, in particular. We provided more personal protective equipment in that quarter than in any other. Excluding the PPE that we don't expect to repeat, our second half of the year revenue growth guidance is over 9% at the top end of our range.
Paul Adler: That concludes our prepared remarks. Now we are happy to answer questions from the analysts. Please ask just one question and a single follow-up if needed. Thank you.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We'll go ahead and take our first question from Manav Patnaik with Barclays.
Manav Patnaik : Thank you very much. I was just hoping you could just address kind of your -- in the near-term visibility more in terms of reactions from your customers with the spread of Omicron, and if you're seeing any change in behaviors or are people just kind of chugging along here?
Todd Schneider : Manav, this is Todd. Thanks for your question. Good morning. At this point, our -- we haven't seen a change in our customer base as a result of Omicron. It's a little early to tell, certainly. But nevertheless, it's -- I would say it's business as usual at this point with our customers, and we're looking forward to the back half of the year.
Manav Patnaik : Got it. And then maybe just as a follow-up, just tied to the other pressures out there, which is inflation, it sounds like you guys are handling that well. You referred to investments in the labor force. Can you just address what that is and broadly how you feel about managing these inflationary pressures going forward as well?
Todd Schneider : Yeah, great question. Inflation is certainly real, but I think we're managing it quite well. We do have a world-class supply chain organization that is a real competitive advantage in these cases. And fortunately, we've been addressing wages over the past couple of years, as we've spoken about in the past calls.  So, we weren't caught flat-footed as it relates to wages. And our -- certainly, our wage increases are still a little above historical, but we're more investing in the infrastructure to be able to service our customers so that based upon our current growth and our anticipated growth, which is -- we're very excited about.
Todd Schneider : Thank you.
Todd Schneider : Thank you.
Operator: We'll go ahead and take our next question from Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan.
Andrew Steinerman: Hi. It's Andrew. If I try to back into the second half operating margins in the full year guide, I get to 19.1%, which is up modestly year-over-year. And I just wanted to make sure that you do the math the same way as maybe you'd kind of go through some of those kind of puts and takes on the second half operating margins.
Mike Hansen : Good morning, Andrew. Our -- we would say our implied operating margin guidance for the second half of the year is a little bit higher than what you stated at 19.1%. We think of it closer to the 19.5%. And look, we still expect some very nice operating margin growth for the year, even in the back half of the year and even in an environment which is pretty challenging, as I'm sure you're aware in terms of the inflationary pressures.  But as Todd mentioned, we're managing that inflation. We like the margin improvement, and our expectation is we're going to see better than the 19.1% that you referred to.
Andrew Steinerman: And the 19.5% is for the total company, and I assume. And I just wanted to maybe make a comment on increases on the customer side, the B2B increases because you were at a hiatus, now you've [indiscernible] kind of in process of increasing prices to customers and kind of how has that gone? Are they understanding of the inflationary environment?
Todd Schneider : I'll take that one, Mike. Thanks for the question, Andrew. Certainly, on the pricing, one of the things that's important to understand is that we don't simply send out a letter increasing prices to all 1 million customers, all at the same time. We address the issue throughout the year. So you'll continue to see that.  And also, as we said in the past, pricing is -- it's a local subject. Some industries are still struggling, some are doing quite well. Some geographies are still not back to pre-COVID and others are nicely ahead of the curve. Now inflation is -- it seems like it's in every headline and every time you turn on the news. And as a result, I'd say the conversations with our customers are generally going well and our results are a little bit better than historical in that area as well.  But as you know, we take a long-term approach and we focus on the lifetime value of our customers, which, frankly is reflected in our NPS scores being at all-time highs. Now all that being said, in the face of inflation being at a 39-year high, we are growing our operating income and incremental margins at very attractive rates, and we're excited about that.
Andrew Steinerman: Right. And then just confirm 19.5% was total company, right?
Mike Hansen : Yeah. It was a total company against last year of just under 19%. So again, what we think to be a pretty healthy margin improvement. And let's keep in mind, last year's margins were record margins and 310 basis points higher than pre-pandemic levels, so we like where we're headed with this -- with the margins in the back half of the year.
Andrew Steinerman: Well said. Thank you very much.
Operator: Okay. We'll go ahead and take our next question from Hamzah Mazari with Jefferies.
Mario Cortellacci: Hi. This is Mario Cortellacci filling in for Hamzah. Just my first question around labor. Maybe you can just update us just not on the labor inflation portion, but also on the labor availability in your business and kind of how you're managing through that?  And then also, maybe you could tie that through to what your pricing strategy looks like regarding that, especially since you guys really haven't taken any price in the past 2 years, I believe it was?
Todd Schneider : Yes, Mario. This is Todd. As far as labor availability, we're competing quite well out there. We pay a very competitive wage and very attractive benefits. And we think we're an employer of choice. And that's reflecting in our staffing levels, which we like. It's certainly more challenging this year than in the past in general, but we're competing quite well, and we like that. As far as how we look at the pricing? Again, it's a -- you'll see it throughout the year. And it is something that we look at customer by customer. And because, as I mentioned, it's a local subject. And we do look at the long-term value of the customers. But we have -- we're doing better than historical. And the reason being is because it's -- there's a little bit of wind in your sales as far as customers are highly aware of what's going on with inflation in general and wage pressures as well.  But as a result, we think we're in a good spot. I'm very thankful that we have been addressing wage increases over the past few years because it prevented us from being flat footed coming in and being under real pressure.
Mario Cortellacci: Great. And then just for my follow-up. Can you just comment on the Fire business and your strategy for getting into some of the top fire markets that you're not currently in? And do you intend to play in any other adjacencies within the Fire business such as what API Group or other larger players have done in that space?
Todd Schneider : Yes, Mario. As far as the Fire business, we're continuing to build out our footprint. We have found that we very much liked our model that we are providing the service levels to customers. And it's showing up very nicely in new business wins and retention, and you're seeing it in the growth.  As far as adjacencies, we're always evaluating those, but we think there's incredible run rate in that business with the type of strategy we have today without even going into an adjacency, but we're certainly always evaluating this.
Mario Cortellacci: Great. Thank you very much. And I hope you all have a great holiday.
Todd Schneider : Thank you. You too.
Operator: And we'll go ahead and take our next question from George Tong with Goldman Sachs.
George Tong : Hi, thanks. Good morning. Your gross margins contracted 80 bps year-over-year in the Uniform Rental segment. Can you elaborate a bit on margin performance there and what your guidance implies for Uniform segment gross margins?
Todd Schneider : Certainly, George. This is Todd. I'll start and then Mike can chime in. Gross margin in general, is up 40 basis points due to just energy alone, so that's obviously a headwind. I think gas stand-alone is up 60% year-over-year.  But as far as the balance of that, the 70 basis points, we're making investments in the additional employee partners that we need to service the very nice growth that we're seeing along with the growth that we see coming. The revenue now, George, is different -- a little different from last year. It's much closer to our revenue -- our traditional revenue mix. And let me just give you an example because I think it'll maybe help you understand that a little bit better. With PPE last year there was obviously significant demand for that, and we're happy to help our customers with it. But in those cases, in many of the cases with that, they were simply a drop ship to those customers. And when you drop ship, those large quantities, it doesn't take a whole lot of work. It's just a drop ship and then you're able to book the revenue, et cetera. You think of that versus the level of employee partners that is required to service uniforms, facility services, first aid and safety cabinets, it simply takes more work.  However, we welcome this shift as it provides more value to the customers than simply a drop ship. It's stickier business and long-term, they have better margin. So we like it. We like that switch, and we knew that, that was coming, and we've been staffing for it and guiding for it. All that said, as we know inflation is at a 39-year high. As I mentioned, energy is up 40 basis points. Our investment in growth for today and the future. And if you exclude the onetime gain of our operating -- our onetime gain from last year, our operating margins were up 70 basis points and our incremental margins are quite strong.  So we're doing exactly what we had hoped and planned for, I guess, would be the way I would describe it.
George Tong : Got it. That's helpful. Your health care and hygiene businesses have seen a boost in demand with COVID. Can you talk about trends and the broader opportunity you're seeing in health care and hygiene?
Todd Schneider : Certainly. Health care, they're connected, right? But health care is a vertical, hygiene is subject to across all businesses. So as far as the health care vertical, we're continuing to see strong demand. We like what we're providing with scrubs items to help customers clean patient rooms and other rooms in addition to isolation gowns. So all of that is -- we continue to be very bullish about the health care vertical. As far as hygiene, and I'll lump hygiene with sanitization cleanliness, all of that Health and safety. All of that is -- we believe, has been a see change and something that is going to be wind at our sales maybe forever, right, because of you see the focus that people have on sanitizing, hygiene, health, safety. We think we can see that in certainly our Uniform Rental, Facility Services segment, but also our First Aid business. People are very focused on the health safety and wellness of their people and their customers, of their patients and their guests. And as a result, that's good for us.
George Tong : Got it. Very helpful. Thank you. 
Todd Schneider : Thank you. 
Operator: And we'll go ahead and take our next question from Ashish Sabadra with RBC.
Ashish Sabadra : Thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to follow up on the comments that you made on the health care, but just focus on the larger opportunities across the 3 verticals, health care, government and education vertical. I was wondering if you could comment on the pipelines for those larger opportunities. Thanks.
Todd Schneider : Yeah. Ashish, the pipeline looks quite strong for all those verticals. We feel good. Our sales organization is operating at a very high level and we really like our new business wins in that area. Our retention is very attractive.  So you look at all that, you say our new business wins are very strong. Our retention is very strong. And we are excited for our customers to get back to full strength as well. And we think that bodes well for the future for us.
Ashish Sabadra : That's very helpful color. And maybe just talking about technology on the last call, you had talked about the benefits of SAP implementation and more to come. I was wondering if you could talk about what you're doing on the technology front, on the automation front, provide some preview on what we could see over the next few -- next year? And how should that help offset some of the inflationary pressure? Thanks.
Todd Schneider : Yeah. Great question. So obviously, investing in technology is 1 of our top priorities because we see the opportunity to improve efficiencies in our business, operational efficiencies, but also provide items that the customers notice and recognize and make it easier to do business with us. Those are things that we're trying to leverage.  I think a good example of technology that we're leveraging is by leveraging SAP and partnering with a communications company. We have launched what we call Smart Truck technology, which collects and analyzes data to create a much more efficient routing structure. So what this allows us to do is to spend more time with the customers instead of -- and reduce fuel expense instead of driving in between stops.  And as we say, we only make money in this business when the wheels stop. When the wheels are moving, that's just expense. So we see that as an opportunity to leverage technology to improve operational efficiencies. We have -- as another example, we have launched a portal for our customers that allows them to do business with us online, which is a competitive advantage in the marketplace.  What we're seeing is contrary to years ago, people don't always want to do business during normal business hours. What they're interested in is doing business on their time. And what we're seeing is the request that we see from our customers is well over half of their requests are outside of normal business hours. So it's making it easier to do business with us. We allow them to make requests changes to their program. We allow them to pay their bills online. All these are items that the customers see as an advantage in the marketplace being easier to do business with, and we get really excited when customers see a technology advantage and find us easier to do business with.
Ashish Sabadra : That’s very helpful color. Thank you and happy holidays. 
Todd Schneider : Thank you.
Operator: We'll go ahead and take our next question from Andy Wittmann with Baird.
Andy Wittmann : Thanks for taking my question. I guess I just wanted to get a little subjective comments on the new guidance this quarter versus the guidance you gave last quarter. Mike, it kind of looks like the biggest change in the EPS side is just a little bit lower tax rate. On the revenue side, the quarter beat consensus, you don't guide quarterly, but it kind of feels like the fundamental outlook for the revenue and core operating margin for business hasn't materially changed. Is that the right way of looking at it? Or did you see a change in the business fundamentals that you're factoring into the guidance, the updated guidance today?
Mike Hansen : Andy, I think that's a fair assessment from the perspective of not a lot of change from what we had been talking about in the last quarter, and that is growth continuing to be pretty strong in the second half of the year. Ex that big PPE number that we've talked about in the third quarter and a little bit in the fourth quarter, our growth would be in excess of 9%. And roughly the same margins we've been talking about for much of the year and that is we certainly expect margin growth and continue to expect margin growth. If we did hit 19.5% that I talked about earlier, that's roughly a 60 basis point improvement in the back half of the year. That's coming on top of, I'll call it gain adjusted 50 basis point improvement in the first half of the year. And you might remember, we talked at the early part of the year at a kind of a 0 to 70 basis point improvement. And the performance through midway through the year is showing that we're right at the top of that initial guide. And so the movement is a little bit of taxes, maybe a little bit of margin improvement. But generally speaking, your assessment is fair, Andy. Pretty nice growth and a healthy margin improvement on record margins from a year ago.
Andy Wittmann : Yeah. Okay. Thanks for go into that, Mike. I guess my follow-up question then just you talked -- you just talked now and previously in the call, you talked about these margins, and I think they speak for themselves. But -- and you talked about price being a little bit above average. Are there any other things that are driving margin performance besides just price and then the operating leverage from the business?  Are there actions or other investments that you're making that are helping this margin performance? Or is this kind of just the natural progression of price/cost as well as fixed cost leverage?
Todd Schneider : Yeah. Andy, this is Todd. Good question. I think it's the normal operation of the business. We're always investing in various items that help our operational efficiencies. And I mentioned the Smart Truck technology that we think is going to be exciting for us.  But I think it's just the general leverage that we're getting in the face of what is still a very challenging operating environment. And we're, as Mike said, coming off of a record 310 basis point improvement in margin. We're very excited about that, and we're going to continue to take another step forward this year.
Mike Hansen : Andy, I might throw it into a couple of different buckets as well and a little bit of reiterating what Todd and I have already talked about that. Look, our growth is at pretty good levels. And when we grow at those pretty good levels, we get some really nice leverage in the business. And we're seeing that leverage as a benefit, productivity improvements. I mean we've -- from our laundry facilities, to our service and route -- the route improvements that Todd has talked about, to sales rep productivity, productivity is strong and continues to improve as we look at process improvement and innovation and automation. And so productivity is very strong. Efficiencies. Look, we made some pretty difficult cost cuts last year, some changes to our cost structure. And we'd rather not give up many of those. And so while we -- while we'll start to see -- we have started to see a little bit of travel, for example, come in, look, we're still managing the cost structure very tightly.  And maybe then the last bucket I'll throw out there is we've talked quite a bit about resuming pricing and pricing is helping a little bit this year. And so margin improvement, I think we can throw it in those 4 buckets. And it's -- I would say it certainly is leading to some pretty good performance even in the face of 40 basis point increases in energy and other certain inflationary factors.
Andy Wittmann : Yeah. Great. Thanks for the comprehensive answer guys. Happy holidays. 
Mike Hansen : You too, Andy. 
Operator: And we'll go ahead and take our next question from Tim Mulrooney with William Blair.
Unidentified Analyst : This is [indiscernible] filling in for Tim. Thanks for taking questions here. I wanted to hit on margins real quick again. In the Uniform Rental segment, operating margin was down year-over-year, but still very strong relative to historical standards. Is that kind of how we should think about this segment's margin structure from a long-term perspective, maybe down year-over-year because of higher cost inflation, but capable of maintaining '21 margins in a more normalized environment?
Mike Hansen : Well, a couple of points that I might make. First of all, we talked a little bit about the gain on the sale of assets from a year ago. And so if you take that, that was all recorded in SG&A within rental. If you take out the impact of that gain, last year's second quarter was 21.1% compared to our 22% this year. So a 90 basis point improvement. So some pretty healthy year-over-year improvement. Look, we've been in the rental business above 20% for the last 6 quarters. And our expectation is we're going to see a little bit -- because this is such a challenging environment, we're going to see some ups and downs periodically, but generally speaking, look, we like where the business is running in that rental segment. And our expectation is we'll stay above that 20% number.
Unidentified Analyst : Excellent. Maybe switching gears back to the PPE. Earlier in the year, I think you expected a PPE headwind of about 1% in fiscal 2022. It sounds like maybe that expectation could be changing a bit. Can you just update us on what you think the PPE headwind will be for fiscal 2022 here?
Mike Hansen : Well, I think if you take a look at our guidance, for example, for the back half of the year. I believe the -- at the high end, the revenue growth is 7.4% over last year. So if you think about the comment we made of growth being 9% we're talking about 160 basis points in the back half of the year.  So you can think about 80 basis points for the full year. So I would say we're not far from where we talked about early on in the year, but certainly, it's back-end loaded a little bit more.
Unidentified Analyst : Got you. Thanks for the color. Thanks. 
Operator: And we'll go ahead and take our next question from Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley.
Toni Kaplan : Thank you. Wanted to ask an ESG-related question. Given the size of your fleet, a shift to electric vehicles seems like it would be pretty meaningful. And so I know in your ESG report, you indicated that by January, you expect to deploy 12 electric vehicles. And so just curious if this programs been initiated? And if you could talk about how we should think about the potential of rolling out this to the entire fleet?
Todd Schneider : Yeah. Toni, this is Todd. Thank you for the question. So yes, we're excited about electrifying the fleet. We are right on schedule as far as what we plan for testing. We have a diverse fleet because of the various types of trucks we have, the rental trucks, the first aid trucks and the fire trucks as well.  But we're working with some very large manufacturers at very high levels, and we're excited about the future as it relates to that. We think that, that is something that's important to our customers, and it's important to our partners and our employee partners, and we think it will be very important to shareholders as well.  So we believe that getting out ahead of this curve is important to us, and we're committed to doing so and dealing with all the challenges that are associated with that -- with the weight of the vehicles that we operate, the size of our fleet and also getting access to the supply, which is why we're working with a diverse group and at high levels. So that way, we're in a good position as an organization.
Toni Kaplan : That's helpful. And one question I've been getting recently is around the ability for you to do large-scale M&A. And some skepticism around that. Do you think that's valid or because of the fragmented market, there's still potential for you to be able to do a large deal? And I'd also say it maybe seems a little harder for deals to get done right now or at least longer to get approved. So just wanted to hear your thoughts around large-scale M&A.
Todd Schneider : Yes, Toni. So just as a reminder, M&A is our second priority of capital use right behind investing in our business. And we're excited about M&A of all shapes and sizes. We're blessed to have a market that is massive in size, meaning, if you think about how many people are wearing -- garments were in uniforms out in the marketplace, it is a significant market. And that's representative of our new business wins that we have. So about two thirds of our -- the new accounts that we bring in are all people that -- are customers that are what we call no programs. Some people in different industry call the unvended. Nevertheless, when we walk in, they don't have a uniform program and when they walk out, we do. It's a little bit more complicated than that, but that net-net. That being said, that's simply the uniform market.  Our other markets are just a vast addressable market, whether it's facility services and all the headwind -- or excuse me, all the tailwinds that are behind that business from health, safety, sanitation, hygiene. Same way with the First Aid business. And in the Fire business, we see it is obviously a massive market just simply because everybody is required by law to have those products and services.  So yeah, I think we're an incredibly good position in all those because of the market size. That leads us to -- we think we're interested in M&A in all of our businesses and are excited about the potential of M&A of small, medium and large because we think the market is such that it is absolutely appropriate.
Toni Kaplan : Very helpful. Happy holidays. Thank you. 
Todd Schneider : Thank you.
Operator: And we'll go ahead and take our next question from Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer.
Scott Schneeberger : Thanks very much. Good morning. I'm curious -- this is a question of your average customer in First Aid. Pre-pandemic, what would their cabinet look like? How much has it changed of the items or the contents inside to what it looks like now to the level of detail you can speak to that?  And then how has the pricing and margin profile change of that cabinet? I assume better, but anything you can share on that? And then I'll have a quick follow-up. Thanks. 
Todd Schneider : Okay, Scott. This is Todd. As far as our cabinet, we're constantly bringing out new products for our First Aid cabinet and that is an important component of that business. We offer other services in that business, whether it be AEDs, training and compliance as well as eyewash stations, which are required by OSHA to be serviced appropriately. So all of that is -- we're seeing a return back to a focus on that with our customers, which is exciting to us.  As far as the cabinet itself, besides the new products that we have launched, it's pretty well a traditional type of situation. Now what is changing is the focus on health and safety of employees, customers, guest, patients, those types of things. And as a result, we think that's good for the First Aid business.  And as we've spoken about, the First Aid cabinet business is more predictable, provides more value to the customer than a drop ship type of PPE and is more profitable. So I think as you see that trend of the health and safety continuing and as more people are back to work, then that's going to be very positive for that business.
Mike Hansen : I might add a couple of things. Just reminding you, Scott, that I think Todd mentioned that First Aid cabinet business is up 20% year-over-year in our second quarter. So we really do like the momentum of it. But we're not quite back to the mix of pre-pandemic, but we certainly like the movement towards that mix. And when we think about the gross margin in this business, the material cost really has improved. What you're seeing in this particular quarter is that we're spending a little bit of that improvement on some of the labor investments that Todd talked about in terms of building the service capacity, both for the current growth that we've had, but also for anticipated second half of the year growth.  So really nice performance by our First Aid and Safety partners and the performance is improving just like we expected it to and just like we wanted to.
Scott Schneeberger : Great. Thanks. I appreciate all that color. And the follow-up is on the same subject. You guys are running below what were pre-pandemic peak First Aid and Safety margins. Do you think within a matter of a year or 2, you can get back to the higher level? And why or why not? Thank you.
Todd Schneider : Yes, Scott, this is Todd. So we're very focused on that. We think that revenue mix will be very positive for us. And we also look at the -- as I mentioned, the win behind our sales and the focus on health and wellness of folks out in the marketplace is going to be positive.  So as we continue to focus on that area, net revenue mix rebalances, then I think you're going to see a nice trend towards more traditional tech margins in that business.
Scott Schneeberger : Great. Appreciate guys. Happy holidays.
Todd Schneider : Thank you, Scott. You too.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel.
Shlomo Rosenbaum : Hi. Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. Hey, Todd, I wanted to ask you a little bit on the competitive environment. Aramark has been trying to execute a turnaround for the last couple of years. I want to know if does that make a difference to you guys in the market at all. Have you seen a change in terms of competitiveness or in terms that you guys have to be more competitive? Or is the market so fragmented that a change like that wouldn't necessarily filter back to you guys?
Todd Schneider : Shlomo, thanks for the question. It's a good question. The operating environment we're in, it's always competitive. Nothing noteworthy though, I would say, in the change. Our revenue retention rates are very strong. And as I mentioned, our new business wins are very strong as well. And they're coming from those new programmers much more so than the competition. And I just think it speaks to the vast market out there that we're focused on providing that value to the customers.  When we walk in, and I'll just give uniforms an example. When we walk in 1 of the top areas -- type of things we hear back from customers is, wow, I didn't know you could do all that for what you do it for. So they're surprised. One of the other items that we hear is we didn't know that you would be able to service a customer of our size. They might have 10 wearers. And that is something that like an average-sized customer for us, but the perception is, you have to have 100 people, 1,000 people. So we're attacking that market because we see that the customer sees value in what we provide. And there are also -- there's a little certainly wind behind our sales on it's tough to attract talent right now.  So being able to provide a service like this is something that's attractive to people. And you think about how many people are working out in the marketplace and the fact that we can provide that service to tens of millions of more wearers. It's very exciting for the future. And so as a result of how we focus on it, it really -- those competitive pressures, we're more focused on retaining our customers, and we're more focused on growing the market and because it's just so massive.
Shlomo Rosenbaum : Okay. Great. And then maybe this is one for Mike. Just kind of in the other segments, I know there's definitely volatility quarter-over-quarter in terms of the margins just comparing the operating margin this quarter versus the last couple of quarters. And is there something besides -- sequentially, obviously, it's a lower revenue, which make a difference in the margin going back a couple of quarters. Could you just give us some of the puts and takes of what's impacting the operating margin?
Mike Hansen : Shlomo, when you look at Q2 compared to Q1 keep in mind that we referred in the first quarter call to a gain on sale of some assets. So in that -- in the first quarter, there was a $12.1 million gain. So we had a little bit of an anomaly in that particular quarter.  I'd say this. The Fire business has been performing very, very nicely. And we've seen organic growth this quarter of 16.9% and remains healthy. And some of the things that Todd and I have talked about with the first Aid businesses going on in the Fire business in that we are certainly seeing some great growth. And we're investing for both current -- for that current growth but also for anticipated growth. So we're seeing a little bit of the investment there. And then as you know, Shlomo, the Uniform Direct Sale business can be quite bumpy. And so there's going to be more volatility from quarter-to-quarter in this business. But I'd say this as well, 11.7% for the All Other segment is still a pretty good quarter on a 65-day workday quarter relative to pre-pandemic. So again, just like the other businesses, we like the momentum in these businesses and we like the performance.
Shlomo Rosenbaum : You see that extra day versus, say, 4Q '21 is a bigger impact? And just trying to get a little bit more detail completely appreciate the volatility in the Uniform Direct business?
Mike Hansen : The direct -- I would say that the day is more of an impact to the Fire business than it is the Uniform Direct sale. The Uniform Direct sale tends to be bumpy based on -- could be a rollout of a new program. It's just timing of the sales within those current customer programs. That's the biggest volatility item within the Uniform Direct sale. 
Shlomo Rosenbaum : Great. Thank you. 
Operator: All right. It appears there are no more questions at this time. Mr. Adler, I'd like to turn the conference back to you for any additional or closing remarks.
Paul Adler: Okay. Well, thank you for joining us this morning, everyone. We will issue our third quarter fiscal '22 financial results in March. We look forward to speaking with you again at that time. Have a good day.
Operator: This concludes today's call. Thank you all for your participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2022 Q1  (2021-09-29 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Cintas First Quarter FY '21 Earnings Release Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Paul Adler, Vice President and Treasurer, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
Paul Adler: Thanks, Shelly. Thank you for joining us. With me is Todd Schneider, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Mike Hansen, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We will discuss our first quarter results for fiscal 2022. After our commentary, we'll open the call to questions for analysts. The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a safe harbor from civil litigation for forward-looking statements. This conference call contains forward-looking statements that reflect the company's current views as to future events and financial performance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those we may discuss. I refer you to the discussion on these points contained in our most recent filings with the SEC. I'll now turn the call over to Todd.
Todd Schneider: Thank you, Paul. We are pleased with our start to fiscal 2022. First quarter total revenue grew 8.6% and diluted earnings per share or EPS grew 11.9%. Every business, whether goods-producing or services-providing, has a need for image, safety, cleanliness , or compliance. Every business has a need Cintas can fulfill to help get them Ready for the Workday. Our financial results are indicative of our strong value proposition and vast total addressable market. Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segment revenue was $1.51 billion, compared to $1.39 billion last year. Organic revenue growth was 8.2%. We expected solid growth over the year prior period in which the economy was in a weakened state, but we also made solid progress on a sequential basis. And in total, revenue grew stronger than anticipated. We continued to make measured investments to support our growth. The labor market remains challenging. U.S. still hasn't recovered 5.3 million pre-pandemic jobs. This represents an opportunity for us. Most of our customers are open. However, most are not operating at the same capacity and employment levels as pre-COVID. We are seeing inflationary signs, including higher cost of freight, energy, wages, and supplies. We continue to take actions to minimize the impacts. These include reviewing and challenging our processes and procedures, produce efficiencies, and reduce costs and thoughtfully implementing increases to the pricing of certain products and services in response to higher operational costs. Our First Aid and Safety Services operating segment revenue for first quarter was $199.1 million compared to $204.5 million last year. First quarter revenue was up against a very difficult comparison. In last year's first quarter, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, personal protective equipment, or PPE, sales were surging propelling the business to grow organic revenue over 17%. At that time, PPE comprised an outsized percentage of First Aid and Safety Services revenue mix. As discussed on previous earnings calls, the amount of PPE has declined as COVID case counts have fallen from peak levels. However, PPE remains a larger percentage of the revenue mix than it was pre-COVID. Over the same period of time, the recurring First Aid cabinet service business revenue has increased. We welcome this shift in mix because First Aid Cabinet Service business is historically higher profit margin business and more consistent. Our Fire Protection Services and Uniform Direct Sale businesses are reported in the All Other segment. All other revenue was $189.7 million compared to $147.7 million last year. The Fire business organic revenue growth rate was 17.8%, and the Uniform Direct Sale business growth rate was 68%. Both businesses benefited in part from increased activity in a period of reduced COVID case counts. Regarding our balance sheet and cash flow, our financial position remains strong. Recently, on September 15, we paid shareholders $98.8 million in quarterly dividends. The amount per share of common stock paid of $0.95 represents a 26.7% increase of the company's previous quarterly dividend. We continue to allocate capital to improve shareholder return. I'm proud of the execution of our employees, whom we call partners. They continue to navigate an unsettled environment by focusing on our customers. The COVID-19 pandemic continues, of course, fueled recently by the surge of the Delta variant. We remain well positioned headed into the fall and winter months to provide potentially life-saving items such as face masks and gloves, provide hygienically-clean garments such as health care scrubs and isolation gowns and conduct services, including hand sanitizer dispensing and sanitizing spray services. Now before turning the call over to Mike, I want to highlight a recent announcement of our ambition to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. Cintas was founded on a sustainable business model. Our corporate culture is based on doing what's right and challenging ourselves to improve. We view our ambition to achieve this objective as a natural extension. Also, as part of our steadfast commitment to corporate responsibility, we will soon issue a more robust environmental, social, and governance report. We are committed to protecting the environment, enhancing humanity, and maintaining accountability. I will now turn the call over to Mike.
Mike Hansen: Thanks, Todd, and good morning. Our fiscal 2022 first quarter revenue was $1.9 billion compared to $1.75 billion in last year's first quarter. The organic revenue growth rate adjusted for acquisitions, divestitures, and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations was 8.6%. Gross margin for the first quarter of fiscal '22 was $902.8 million compared to $826.2 million in last year's first quarter. Gross margin as a percentage of revenue increased 30 basis points to 47.6% for the first quarter of fiscal '22 compared to 47.3% in the first quarter of fiscal '21. Gross margin percentage by business was 48.3% for Uniform Rental and Facility Services; 44.8% for First Aid and Safety Services; 46.1% for Fire Protection Services; and 41.5% for Uniform Direct Sale. Selling and administrative expenses of $508.7 million increased 6.7% compared to last year's first quarter. This increase reflects investments in our sales teams as well as slight incremental travel and meeting expenses, somewhat offset by the sale of assets within our Uniform Direct Sale business. Operating income of $394.1 million increased 12.7%. Operating margin increased 80 basis points to 20.8% in the first quarter of fiscal '22 compared to 20% in the first quarter of fiscal '21. Our effective tax rate on continuing operations for the first quarter of fiscal '22 was 11% compared to 7.8% last year. The tax rate can move from period to period based on discrete events, including the amount of stock compensation expense. Net income from continuing operations for the first quarter of fiscal '22 was $331.2 million, an increase of 10.4%. Diluted EPS was $3.11, an increase of 11.9% from last year's first quarter. We are increasing our fiscal '22 financial guidance. We are raising our annual revenue expectations from a range of $7.53 billion to $7.63 billion to a range of $7.58 billion to $7.67 billion; and diluted EPS from a range of $10.35 to $10.75 to a range of $10.60 to $10.90. Please note the following regarding our guidance: Fiscal '22 -- our fiscal '22 effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 19.5% compared to a rate of 13.7% for fiscal '21. The higher effective tax rate negatively impacts fiscal '22 diluted EPS guidance by about $0.77 and diluted EPS growth by about 760 basis points. Guidance does not include any future share buybacks or potential tax reform. Guidance assumes an uneven economic recovery caused by the surge in COVID-19 Delta variant. However, guidance does not contemplate significant pandemic-related setbacks such as stay-at-home orders and other restrictions commonly referred to as lockdowns. Finally, when modeling our fiscal '22 financial results by quarter, please note the following regarding last fiscal year's financial results: In last fiscal year second quarter, certain Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating assets were sold. The pretax gain on sale of $18 million was recorded in selling and administrative expenses and impacted second quarter operating margin by 100 basis points. The pretax gain and the related tax benefit impacted EPS by $0.25. And in last fiscal year's third quarter, we were able to help our customers respond to a spike in COVID-19 cases by providing them with large supplies of personal protective equipment. We provided more personal protective equipment in that quarter than in any other.
Paul Adler: That concludes our prepared remarks. Now we are happy to answer questions from the analysts. Please ask just one question and a single follow-up if needed.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. We'll take our first question from Tim Mulrooney with William Blair.
Tim Mulrooney: Can you talk about the primary factors that led you to raise revenue guidance this quarter? Was it primarily related to the better-than-expected result that you generated here in the first quarter? Or is it more related to your outlook for the remaining three quarters of this fiscal year?
Todd Schneider: Hey, Tim. It's Todd. Thanks for the question. Well, certainly, our performance in Q1 exceeded our expectations, but we like the momentum that we see in our business. We like the new business, that’s as a driver of growth for us. And we're providing more products and services to our customers. So, to those who are open and hopefully will -- they'll be back to full strength here very shortly. But in general, yes, we like the momentum that we see in our businesses.
Tim Mulrooney: Okay, thanks, Todd. I was wondering if you could also maybe talk about growth by vertical a little bit more this quarter. I know hospitality was showing a strong recovery last quarter. Did that vertical stall out a little bit as COVID cases ramped up here in August and September? And are there any other end markets that you call out here as being somewhat stronger or weaker than you had expected?
Todd Schneider: Well, great question, Tim. Certainly, the hospitality business is -- well, so far down, hospitality was -- that it's coming back and it's coming back nicely. I wouldn't use the word stalled out by any stretch. Certainly, there is a bit of a tail to that. So, orders aren't received and shipped in real time, meaning that they make those decisions about staffing. There's a process, they place the orders, we ship them, et cetera. So, there's a little bit of a tail there. But we still like what we see in the hospitality business. Certainly, they are anxious about business travel coming back, convention travel specifically, but the -- in general, the hospitality business is doing so much better. And -- but they're a little bit anxious, right, about how things will be impacted because of the variant, but also when will business travel come back. As far as our other areas, healthcare continues to do well for us. We've talked about those offerings that we have, and they really resonate with those folks. So, whether it's helping them clean their facilities, helping with isolation gowns, scrubs, et cetera, all that is very attractive for folks. And I'd just like to take a moment to talk about what we compete with in those markets, in many cases, is disposables. And with the focus on ESG, that value proposition of providing an item that is essentially relaundered and recycled is very attractive, separate from the economics of it. It's very attractive for the healthcare institutions and many institutions to say, "Well, you can provide me a product that doesn't just go to landfill after a use." So again, that value proposition is very much resonating.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Andy Wittmann with R. W. Baird.
Andy Wittmann: Great. I don't usually ask about the Direct Sales segment, but I'm going to this quarter. The segment margins in All Other came out very strong. We haven't seen them this strong in a while, obviously, plus 68%. It's a big number, but we all know that the compare was fairly easy. Todd, could you just talk a little bit about what drove the margin leverage? Was there an unusually large order that came back with somebody kind of redressing folks? Or maybe just a little bit of color what -- as to what drove the great profit margins in the All Other reportable segment?
Todd Schneider: Well, Andy, first off, thanks for your question. Our partners in that area of the business really appreciate you calling it out and citing that their performance is really, really good. You're right. The comps are -- were more than reasonable because of what happened to the hospitality business, in particular, last summer. But our revenue is coming back very nicely there, hence, the revenue growth. But -- and we're getting leverage over the organization staffing levels that we have in place, and Mike cited that we had sale of an asset that occurred in that area. So -- but in total, if you put it all together, we see -- you shouldn't anticipate that level of increase in the future. But nevertheless, we like the leverage we have there and we think we're well positioned. Our organization is -- was as you can imagine right-sized as a result of what occurred last summer, and we think we're in a really good spot and to capture opportunities in the marketplace and gain leverage on our investment.
Mike Hansen : Well, the other half or part of that All Other segment is the Fire business, which also had a great first quarter. And so, we're very pleased with that business and the momentum in that business as well. We saw some nice sequential improvement in the gross margin of the Fire business. And at organic growth of 17.8%, we're thrilled with the performance that we've seen.
Andy Wittmann: Yes. Okay. And then I guess, just for my follow-up question, I wanted to just get a little bit more specific on the labor market, both as it relates to your own business, your ability to hire and compensate people as well as the impact on your customers. I don't know if there's a way for you guys to talk to us about the level of staffing at your -- you're always selling new business, but the historical customers that you've had through this whole time, what does the headcount look like for those customers? Are they still -- can you quantify how far down they are? I mean we talked about the 5 million jobs that are still missing. How many of those were former Cintas wearers?
Todd Schneider: Yes, Andy, first of all, you can't open up a newspaper without hearing about wages and pressure in the market on labor. So, we are certainly not immune from that nor are our customers. And so, we are battling it every single day and staffing at levels that we feel very good about in our business. And as far as our customers, I mean it's really difficult to say -- to put a number on it. It varies so much based upon geographies and industries, because the restaurant business is certainly -- they're nowhere near back to where I think they -- hopefully will be someday and certainly not back to where they were pre-COVID, as an example, warehousing and distribution is back very, very nicely and probably at or above pre-COVID levels. In total, we're certainly down from pre-pandemic levels, and I think we're representative of the 5-point-something million jobs that we have less in the U.S. versus pre-COVID. So, we're anxious for our customers to get back to previous levels. And when we think about labor, and we think about those functions, we always focus more about how it impacts our customers, we'll figure things out and how to manage it.
Paul Adler: On not only 5.3 million jobs lost, right, versus pre-pandemic, but still 10 million, 11 million job openings that haven't been filled, which is great opportunity for us as you know.
Todd Schneider: Yes. The latest number I saw from the Bureau of Labor Statistics that they reported out earlier this month was 10.9 million job openings. So I don't know how many of those would be people that would wear a Cintas uniform and utilize items out of our first aid cabinets, et cetera. But we'd like to see those all be filled.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Manav Patnaik with Barclays Capital.
Manav Patnaik: I just had one question for you guys. And I was just hoping, you talked about wage and labor a bit, but can you just talk about the moving pieces on the cost side? We've heard a lot about driver shortages and fuel costs and supply chain. I was just hoping you guys could just give us a quick state of what's happening with you guys?
Todd Schneider: So Manav, I'll start, and then Mike can assist with this. Certainly, energy costs are increasing. We're seeing that, whether it's at the pump, natural gas to run our facilities. But we've worked really hard on efficiencies in routing and in our production facilities to maximize efficiencies there to mitigate all of that. And we're -- I think we're doing a very good job there. Wages, we talked a little bit about. But we have discussed in previous earnings calls that we've been addressing this wage issue with particular focus on our frontline partners over the past couple of years. So we weren't flat footed when it came into this wage subject. We're continuing to address it. We've got to be very competitive in the marketplace to attract the right partners on our team, and we're doing that. And we're going to be able to continue to navigate that successfully. And then as you can imagine, we've been very diligent about managing discretionary spend. There is some travel that is back, but certainly not near the levels that they were pre-COVID. Mike, anything else?
Mike Hansen : No, I think that hits the cost side, but Manav also keep in mind, we talked a little bit about this in July. But we have begun to increase prices here in the first quarter. It's a strategic local customer-by-customer view but early indications suggest a positive reception from our customer base. And certainly, that's important as we look at things, like energy being up 40 basis points year-over-year. We're not immune to some inflationary pressures, but we are -- as Todd said, we're managing them very, very diligently. We're looking for automation opportunities, efficiency opportunities. And if we need to, we can strategically increase prices and we've started to do that here in this first quarter after taking a few years off.
Manav Patnaik: Got it. And actually, maybe if I can squeeze in one more. Just hoping you could give us an update on the M&A pipeline perhaps in the non-uniform businesses? Like are there opportunities that you guys are actively seeking?
Todd Schneider: Great question, Manav. We're active and acquisitive in every business we're in. We'll say that activity has ramped up here in the back half of the year, probably anticipation of tax changes, et cetera. But nevertheless, some. So we like the activity. We've -- we have -- we are in a great financial position. We love our balance sheet and right after investing in our existing facilities to help grow those organizations, our #2 use of capital is for M&A. And so we're very acquisitive and looking very active, and looking forward to closing on more deals in the near future.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Hamzah Mazari with Jefferies.
Hamzah Mazari: I just wanted to follow up on pricing. You had mentioned you hadn't taken pricing for a while, I think, maybe 2 years or 18 months or whatever. And I think you just referenced you're beginning to take price now. What kind of price is baked into your guidance? And how are the customer conversations? I assume customers see inflation headlines all over the place. So -- and given you have an increased pricing for a while, could you maybe talk about order of magnitude? Are you doing a pricing catch-up? Or how should we think about pricing strategy?
Todd Schneider: Hamzah, I wouldn't think of it as a catch-up. And we had not raised price in 2 years. But these are -- Mike mentioned, these are strategic decisions. Their pricing is a local subject. It really gets down to what type of what industry is that business in, what even geography are they in, and what condition of their -- is their business and to be able to handle it, so that we're able to be fair with our customers as we look out. Meaning, that there are certain organizations that are -- their business is doing a whole lot better than others. And we're conscious of that. But as far as the conversations, again, that would depend upon the particular business. But it does make the conversation easier when inflation is so much in the headlines. So that certainly gives us a little benefit. But these conversations are -- they're never easy, right? Because from our customer standpoint, it's a tough subject. And -- but we're focused on the long-term value of those customer relationships, and we handle them appropriately.
Hamzah Mazari: Got it. And just my follow-up question would just be around -- just the -- I know it's been a while since the SAP implementation was completed but then COVID hit, and we were sort of caught up in that, and it's still kind of going on. But maybe you could just give some examples on how the SAP system is maybe benefiting you now as organic growth comes back? Maybe if you want to talk about it qualitatively or quantitatively, however, either on the cost side or revenue side? Any examples would kind of be helpful.
Todd Schneider: Yes, Hamzah. So a few items on SAP that where we're benefiting from. Certainly, one view of the customer is significant for us. And that helps us with cross-sell. And we know when we do that, when we are able to provide more products and services, the customer sees more value. And when they see more value, it's a better retention tool for us. So that's been significant for us and has been and will continue to be moving forward. We get some other -- certainly advantaged from a data analytics standpoint, the cash cycle, those types of subjects. But some other items that I think you might be able to see out in the marketplace is routing efficiencies are a real opportunity for us. We are focused on that from a dollar efficiency from our ambition on the 2050 net zero emissions. And we see we can advance that subject, advance all much further than we have in the past by bringing technology to that. So that will be exciting. The other item is with SAP, it allows for us to have an online experience for our customers that they haven't had in the past. And what we realized is that our customers want -- they don't all want to communicate with us the way that they did when I started with the company 32 years ago, meaning they don't want to just have to call during working hours. They want to do business when they want to do business, whether that's to pay a bill, whether that's to communicate a request, to order something, those types of items are all -- we want to make it easier to do business with us. And on our online presence, and we call it My Cintas, allows for our customers to do just that. So providing more value to them, more conduits for them to communicate with us, instead of having to do it in the old traditional nine-to-five type model. So those are significant for us. Another operational item would be our ability to speed up the process from when we see an order from a customer -- receive an order from a customer to when we can get it out to them. Having that transparency throughout our supply chain, is an absolute advantage where we can anticipate better. And even once we receive the order, get it out the door faster than what we were historically. And so that efficiency shows up to the customer in speed to market and then able to get them products and faster than we had in the past. So we want to leverage that system. And I think we've done that quite nicely to date, but there will be more coming.
Operator: We'll take our next question from George Tong with Goldman Sachs.
George Tong: Revenue growth in the quarter was stronger than you expected on a sequential basis. Can you elaborate on the sources of upside, specifically? And where you see the most promising trends over the next year?
Todd Schneider: George, I'll start, but I'd say two significant drivers of growth for us have been new business. It's still quite robust. Our value proposition is resonating very much. And many companies are still struggling with staffing as we cited earlier, 10.9 million job openings. And when you're struggling with staffing and you can find a company like Cintas, you can outsource certain functions too, it makes it very attractive. So they look at it and say, wow, you can take care of these items and maybe they were a do-it-yourself in the past, so that resonates with them. So that's been quite nice. Most of -- and moving on to another driver, most of our customers were, I'd say, are open and probably were open going into the first quarter. But we are providing more products and services to them. We are, again, anxious for them to get back to their pre-employment levels and we think that will be even better. But new business and then I'd say, again, adds within our current customers are two significant drivers for us that we think will continue to help us throughout the year.
George Tong: Got it. That's helpful color. And then I wanted to dive into pricing increases, which you touched on earlier. To what extent do you think that pricing combined with efficiencies can fully offset the input cost increases that you're seeing? And could there be a timing lag as to when those pricing increases will take effect and the real-time nature of the input cost increases that you're seeing now?
Mike Hansen : Yes, George, certainly, timing, it is difficult to match up the timing exactly to when costs increase match up the timing exactly to when costs increase and when we see changes in the supply chain, for example. But we're doing our best to manage. And the -- as I mentioned a little bit ago, when we have those conversations today, the message resonates that look, there are increases in cost and these price increases, when we do make them, they are reasonable and they make sense to our customers. That's been our experience so far. The really nice thing about our -- if you think about our cost structure as well, Todd hit on this a little bit, that our labor, we've been working on that for a while. And so we may not be -- while not immune, we may not be as affected as some of our peers and others. And so that's important for us. The other part is that many of our material costs are amortized. So when we see spikes in supply chains in various areas, whether it is labor throughout the world or cotton or other things, we're amortizing costs and it tends to be a bit of a natural hedge for us. And so it does slow down the impact and it requires the impact to be greater for a much longer period of time before it really starts to hit us. And in those cases, we can get ahead of the inflationary pressures a little bit with our pricing strategy. So generally speaking, we feel like we're -- while it's not perfect matching of expense and benefit, we do a pretty good job and we get a little bit of benefit from just the way our business works.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Ashish Sabadra with RBC.
Ashish Sabadra : Mike, I just wanted to drill down further on the cross-sell opportunities that you mentioned. I was wondering if you could provide any color on where you are in penetrating, let's say, hygiene products, safety as well as first aid and fire services within your existing customer base? And how can you accelerate that cross-sell either through organic or through M&A? Any color on those fronts?
Todd Schneider: Ashish, thanks for the comments and the question. We have our sales and service organization well positioned to offer the various products and services. Again, they have tools that allow them to understand where those opportunities exist. They're certainly not perfect, but they are allowing them to get pointed in the right direction to help provide that value to the customers. And as I mentioned, the more value -- excuse me, more products and services we provide the customer, we know the stickier that, that relationship will be just like most relationships, right? If it's just one product, it's probably more at risk than having two and so on and so forth. So it's very much a point of focus. When you think about our relationships, every single customer virtually needs, our fire surface, right, because of the legal requirements around that subject. But we see very nice overlap with those who would -- who are uniform customers who would need some direct sale their uniform rental. And we also see overlap with those who are uniform rental customers who would need first aid and safety products, training, CPR, all the various items that we provide. So it's -- our big issue has been in the past that our customers weren't aware of everything we provided. And that's a nice problem to have, but nevertheless, it's still very much a problem for us. And we're trying to change that position in the marketplace that our customers realize that not just through our sales and service organization but also through our mass media spend, which you may have seen this past weekend where we had a significant position on -- in golf's Ryder Cup, where we're trying to get the message out about all the products and services we provide. And not a complete one-stop shop for a business, but we sure do get them a long ways on that path. Mike, anything else on this?
Mike Hansen : Well, the only thing I would add is the really good news is we're in the early innings of penetration. And so when you think about the rental customers and the opportunity to continue to penetrate with even rental items, such as our restroom products and our things that we've talked about recently in the last year, like isolation gowns and hand sanitizers, we're in the very early innings. And when you couple that with the first day of safety and fire opportunities again, less than 20% penetration. And so we've got a lot of work to do and a so we've got a lot of work to do and a exciting thing is much opportunity remains.
Ashish Sabadra: That's very helpful color. That's great. And maybe just a quick clarifying question. I was just wondering at a very high level, can you provide what are the key categories of spend and the percentage of expenses from labor versus fuel versus amortization of equipment? Any color would be helpful.
Mike Hansen : Sure. Let me start with energy. So energy, and that would include fuel for our trucks and the running of our laundry operations, in the quarter was 2.1%. That is up 40 basis points from a year ago, flat with our fourth quarter. So it's a -- while it is up some, it's still a relatively insignificant part of our overall cost structure. When you think, Ashish, about our cost structure, though, you can -- I'm going to use cost of rentals. You can think about it in 3 buckets, the cost of the materials, the cost of running the laundries and then the cost of the service component. And while they're not exactly the same, you can think about them as 1/3 each. And each of those buckets are a little bit different. I mentioned the materials, many of which we amortize over certain periods of time. So we get a little bit of smoothing of those costs. And then we also have some that are direct sale type like the restroom products that we expensed immediately. The major component of that would be those rental items that we're amortizing. When you think about the laundries, then you're -- then we're into the depreciation of the buildings and certainly, the equipment that's in our wash alleys, but also the labor component within that as well. And then the service component, you've got our drivers, our trucks and the amortization of the trucks and the gas to run those. When you put it all together, certainly, labor is a large part of our cost structure. The materials, the products that we sell are certainly a large part of our structure. And we manage each one of those quite tightly and look for improvement opportunities.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley.
Jeffrey Goldstein: This is actually Jeff on for Toni. I know this question was asked earlier related to revenue guidance, but I wanted to ask it slightly different as it relates to EPS. The EPS guide is up by about 2% for the full year, but it seems like a lot of that is maybe flowing through the buybacks and a better-than-expected tax rate. So is that fair? And is that to say from an operating standpoint, maybe you're a little bit more optimistic on the revenue side, but maybe some cost headwinds keep you a little conservative here? Just some more color on that would be helpful.
Mike Hansen : Sure, Jeff. I don't think that's a fair reflection of our guidance. You think about our guidance of $10.60 to $10.90 that's a 3.5% to 6.4% increase in annual EPS. But you referred to a lower tax rate, our tax rate is going to -- based on our guide today is going to go up 5.8% compared to '21. Now that's quite a significant impact. And if you think about the 760 basis points that I referred to in my opening remarks, that takes EPS growth from about 11% to 14%. Now certainly, the buyback that we had done in the fourth quarter and the first quarter did create some benefit, but that still gets to a pretax earnings growth in the range of double-digits. And so it's a pretty good year. And then if you kind of move further up, we talked in July about our guidance of implying operating improvement of -- at the low end, 0 basis points to 70 at the high end, we're still right around in that neighborhood in terms of the guidance that we provided today. And keep in mind, that's on the heels of a 310 basis point improvement in operating margin in the previous fiscal year. So to kind of margin in the previous fiscal year. So to kind of taxes, I think, is not a great reflection of really what's going on. The guidance on the EPS side is nice, healthy margin improvement, pretax increases of right around double digits and then a higher tax rate that pulls that EPS down. Hopefully, that gives you a little bit more color on that EPS guidance.
Jeffrey Goldstein: No, understood. That was helpful. And then I want to ask about First Aid margins, which were pretty strong in the quarter. Are you able to quantify at all how much PPE is still constraining margins there, just given it's greater than normal mix? And then I guess based on that, how should we think about near-term upside as that rolls off? Like is that really going to kick up in the next few quarters as that roll off? Just kind of overall, if you could talk about the path back to pre-COVID margins in that line of business.
Mike Hansen : Sure. We certainly -- PPE has been a major factor in that business. And Jeff, you're correct in pointing that out. And it was a -- it was really important for our customers over the course of the last year, and we invested quite a bit in inventory to be able to serve the customers, even if it was at a bit of a lower gross margin for us. But we've seen some nice sequential improvement there. Our 44.8% is still lower than our pre-pandemic of, call it, 48-ish percent. And so we're -- we still believe we can get back to those kinds of levels. Now the PPE that we've had over the course of the last year tends to drop off a little bit more quickly than the First Aid comes back because, as Todd and Paul have referenced, we still have a lot of job openings, quite a bit fewer people in the workplace today than pre-pandemic. And so as those people come back and as those job openings get filled, that creates more hands in our first aid cabinets. And that creates some nice momentum. One of the nice things that we really have seen coming out of the last few quarters is our customers and our new customers, so prospects turning into customers, are really seeing the value of keeping their employees safe and healthy, and our First Aid business really allows us to provide that value to them. And so our new business has been really strong in this first aid cabinet space. But it's coming back. And while we like the momentum, we're not there yet. And we do expect to see sequential improvement. And I'll maybe step that back a bit. We expect to see improvement in the year every quarter can be a little bit bumpy here and there. But generally speaking, we continue to look for improved gross margin in that business.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Gary Bisbee with Bank of America Securities.
Gary Bisbee: If I could go back to labor for a minute, I think a lot of your comments have been about cost and working on wages. But are you fully staffed both from a service and a sales perspective? And if you had seen any elevated turnover relative to history or had any increased difficulty hiring to support the rebound in growth you're seeing?
Todd Schneider: Gary, a very good question. I guess the way I'd describe it is, we're having to run at higher RPMs to get the output that we want. So it's harder. There's no doubt about it. Attracting, retaining and developing the talent is core to what we do as a company, and we're working that much harder now to get to the levels that we want to be at. So are we staffed at the levels we want to be at? Yes. Yes, we like our staffing position. Turnover is still very manageable. And I think it speaks to many, many things. Certainly, the total compensation that we provide, the attractive benefits, but it really speaks to the culture and the investment that we put in to people, because for so many partners that have grown up in the company and have and have advanced in the company, and that's part of our culture. So we've always had to be really good at painting a picture for people about this is where you start, but we will invest and develop you. And we're having to work harder at it, but it's still resonating with folks. And so that's where we are now.
Gary Bisbee: Okay. Great. And then on -- you've talked about the PP&E and some of the pandemic-driven sales in first aid and safety. But I think you also had some of that in uniforms handling that stuff through the facilities business. Is -- and I'm not going to ask you when it's going to go away because who knows, but is there a meaningful chunk of revenue there that probably churns off in the future? And what I'm really trying to think through is how that could impact the rate of growth over the next several quarters or whatever in the core uniforms business. Is it elevated? Or is that just not a big deal in the grand scheme of that business?
Todd Schneider: Yes, Gary, what Mike spoke of, it was a significant portion of our First Aid and Safety business. There was certainly some revenue that went through our rental business sold on route, that was for PPE, but nowhere near the amount as a percentage that would go through our First Aid business. So is there some there today? There's a little bit, but it's not significant whatsoever. So -- and as far as when we look out about demand, we're still in a good spot if the demand is there for those types of products and services. We're managing that inventory. And there is still demand. We still hope as a country and as North America, as a world that, that is -- that will be diminishing over the course of the balance of our fiscal year. So our guide takes all that into account. And we're focused on building the core of our business. And -- but if our customers need those types of products and services, we're there for them, and we will help them with this.
Mike Hansen : Gary, I might just add, as you're thinking about -- I believe you referred to the next several quarters, as I said in my opening remarks, we talked last third quarter about $45 million that we did not expect to repeat in our fourth quarter. And so that's going to be -- as you think about the growth of quarter-to-quarter, definitely keep that in mind as a third quarter growth impact.  Now again, as it relates to this PPE, look, the safety and cleanliness themes that we've sold under for years is really resonating. And we certainly believe that those areas will be larger moving forward than pre-COVID and that certainly is exciting for us.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer.
Scott Schneeberger: I want to hone in a little bit on the offsetting efficiencies of the environment in the automation. Just anecdotally, if you could speak to a few things you're doing. I know in Hamzah's question, you talked about SAP and automation of payments and customer facing. Just curious if you could elaborate maybe a little bit on what you're doing in this environment, maybe at facilities or otherwise and some of the longer-term goals of other automation?
Todd Schneider: Good morning, Scott. There’s a couple of obvious ones for us. I mentioned routing. That is obviously a significant one that we think is going to pay dividends for us. Scott Farmer always spoke about, we don't generate any revenue when the wheels are turning on our trucks, right? We generate revenue when the wheels stop. And we see an opportunity to improve that efficiency and that we're investing in technology there to do so, and we're excited about the impact that will have not only on our cost structure, but also on our emissions as we move forward. In the production facilities, we are managing very tightly our wash alley and making sure that we have much better efficiencies there, meaning we're tracking very closely the number of loads that go through our facilities versus the quantity that went through pre-COVID on the same playing field, meaning same amount of volume that's going through. And we put some technology in place to help us with that instead of just doing it through elbow grease. And as a result, we're seeing some real benefits there. And again, that will help us in our cost structure, but also in our emissions. And so we're focused on making sure that we're managing that very tightly and we're seeing some benefits there.
Mike Hansen : Yes, I'm not -- one other one I might talk about, I don't know that Todd mentioned the stock rooms in our laundry facilities and the ability to get those automated, and that creates visibility and it creates the opportunity to share. And when we are more efficient in our stockrooms, so let me be clear, our stockrooms are within our -- within all of our rental facilities, they are garment that have been in service already. And so when we are efficient, that means we are reusing garments that are already amortizing in our cost structure. And so that's -- that creates revenue generation out of garments that are either already in our cost structure or maybe have been amortized fully. And so we get some real nice incremental margins when we can more efficiently use those or put back those garments into service. SAP has allowed us to get visibility and to be able to improve the use of those garments within our stockroom. So that's another example, Scott, of something that's really benefiting us.
Scott Schneeberger: Excellent. Sounds good, guys. I appreciate that. And then just as a follow-up, I wanted to touch on -- it sounds like you're very active in M&A, that came up, I think, particularly before calendar year-end, maybe with some consideration for tax implications. But you've done over $1 billion worth of stock buybacks in the fourth and the first quarter here, back to back, and that's just kind of looking back, that's as big, if any, year going back for a while. So I'm just kind of curious how -- the thought process there, if -- it sounds like you're getting closer on some M&A, but it's not really a lot of allocation of capital is going into repurchase. Is that something we should expect to continue?
Todd Schneider: Scott, we are -- as I mentioned, we're active, and it takes two to dance, and we're seeing more folks at the dance as -- anecdotally, my guess is because of tax reform. And as a result, we think more deals will come through. Now, that being said, we are in a great position on our balance sheet. And we are ready, willing and able to activate that balance sheet as appropriate that is best for the long-term value for our organization. And just as a reminder, the #1 priority for our capital is, has been and will continue to be the investment into our current business to help grow the sales and profits of our organization, whether that's through additional products and services, additional facilities, training, staffing levels, all those is our #1 priority. And then after that, #2 is M&A, and we're steadfast in that commitment, and we'll allocate appropriately. And then thereafter, then we'll return it to the shareholders as available in the form of stock buyback and dividends. And I think we've got a really good track record of managing those priorities appropriately and intelligently for the long-term value.
Operator: That concludes today's question-and-answer session. Speakers, at this time, I will turn the conference back over to you for any additional or closing remarks.
Paul Adler: Thank you for joining us this morning. We will issue our second quarter of fiscal '22 financial results in the latter half of December. We look forward to speaking with you again at that time. Thank you.
Operator: This concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2021 Q4  (2021-07-15 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Cintas’ Fourth Quarter Fiscal Year '21 Earnings Release Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Paul Adler, Vice President and Treasurer, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
Paul Adler: Thank you, Nick. And thank you for joining us. With me today is Scott Farmer, Cintas’ Executive Chairman of the Board of Directors; Todd Schneider, President and Chief Executive Officer and Mike Hansen, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We will discuss our fourth quarter results for fiscal 2021. After our commentary, we will be happy to answer questions. The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a safe harbor from civil litigation for forward-looking statements. This conference call contains forward-looking statements that reflect the Company's current views as to future events and financial performance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those we may discuss. I refer you to the discussion on these points contained in our most recent filings with the SEC. I'll now turn the call over to Mike Hansen.
Mike Hansen: Thanks, Paul. Our fiscal 2021 fourth quarter revenue was $1.84 billion compared to $1.62 billion in last year's fourth quarter, an increase of 13.3%. Earnings per diluted share or EPS were $2.47, an increase of 83% from last year's fourth quarter. The organic revenue growth rate adjusted for acquisitions, divestitures, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and differences in the number of workdays was 11.5% for the fourth quarter of fiscal '21. Organic revenue for the Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segment was 13.7%. Organic revenue for the First Aid and Safety Services operating segment declined 6.8%. Gross margin for the fourth quarter of fiscal '21 was $859.1 million compared to $707.8 million in last year's fourth quarter. Gross margin as a percent of revenue increased 310 basis points to 46.8% for the fourth quarter of fiscal '21 compared to 43.7% in the fourth quarter of fiscal '20. Selling and administrative expenses improved as a percent of revenue to 27.4% in the fourth quarter of fiscal '21 compared to 30.9% last year. Operating income for the fourth quarter of fiscal '21 of $356.4 million increased 71.8%. Operating margin increased 660 basis points to 19.4% in the fourth quarter of fiscal '21 compared to 12.8% in the fourth quarter of fiscal '20. Fiscal '20 fourth quarter operating income was affected by many items caused by COVID-19 including additional reserves on accounts receivable and inventory, severance and asset impairment expenses and lower incentive compensation expense. Excluding these items, the fiscal '20 fourth quarter operating margin was 15.5%, all of these items were recorded in last year's selling and administrative expenses. Our effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of fiscal '21 was 19.4% compared to 20.4% last year. The tax rate can move from period to period based on discrete events, including the impact of stock compensation. Net income for the fourth quarter of fiscal '21 was $267.7 million, an increase of 85.2%. EPS was $2.47, an increase of 83% from last year's fourth quarter. Our balance sheet and cash flow remained strong. Our leverage calculation for our credit facility definition was 1.5 times debt-to-EBITDA at May 31st, 2021. On June 1st, 2021, $250 million of debt bearing an interest rate of 4.3% matured and was repaid with cash on hand. We have an untapped credit facility of $1 billion. During the fourth quarter of fiscal '21 and our first quarter of fiscal '22 to date, we purchased $979 million of Cintas common stock under our buyback program. On June 15th, 2021, Cintas paid shareholders $79.2 million in quarterly dividends. For the fiscal year ended May 31st, 2021, revenue was $7.12 billion compared to $7.09 billion for fiscal '20. EPS for fiscal '21 were $10.24 compared to $8.11 for last fiscal year. Revenue and adjusted EPS have grown 50 of the past 52 years. Fiscal '21 free cash flow, which is defined as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures was $1.22 billion, an increase of 14.7% compared to last year. For our fiscal '22, we expect our revenue to be in the range of $7.53 billion to $7.63 billion and diluted EPS to be in the range of $10.35 to $10.75. Please note the following regarding our guidance. Our fiscal '22 effective tax rate is expected to be in the range of 19.5% to 20.5% compared to a rate of 13.7% in fiscal '21. The higher effective tax rate negatively impacts fiscal '22 EPS guidance by about $0.85 and EPS growth by about 800 basis points. Guidance does not include any future share buybacks or potential tax reform. We remain in a dynamic environment that can continue to change. Our guidance contemplates a steadily improving economy, absent any economic or pandemic related setbacks. For financial modeling purposes, please note that there are no workday differences when comparing fiscal '22 to '21. Both fiscal years contained 66 days in the first quarter, 65 in the second, 64 in the third and 66 in the fourth quarter. I'll now turn the call to Paul for commentary on the performance of each of our businesses.
Paul Adler: Thanks, Mike. The Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segment includes the rental and servicing of uniforms, health care scrubs, mats and towels and the provision of restroom supplies and other facility products and services. The segment also includes the sale of items from our catalogs to our customers on route. Uniform Rental and Facility Services revenue was $1.47 billion compared to $1.27 billion last year. Our Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment gross margin increased 410 basis points to 47.7% for the fourth quarter compared to 43.6% in last year's fourth quarter, driven in large part by lower production and service expense as a percent of revenue. While some inflationary pressures increased certain costs, these were more than offset by increased revenue from businesses re-opening or increasing capacity as COVID-19 case counts fell and restrictions on businesses were reduced. Our First Aid and Safety Services operating segment includes revenue from the sale and servicing of first aid products, safety products, personal protective equipment and training. This segment's revenue for the fourth quarter was $186.9 million compared to $196.3 million last year. First Aid fourth quarter revenue was up against a very difficult comparison. In last year's fourth quarter, in response to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, personal protective equipment sales surged. Also, the first aid Cabinet Service business was not impacted until late in last year's fourth quarter when business restrictions became widespread. As a result, the division posted a 21.9% organic revenue growth rate in last year's fourth quarter. The First Aid segment gross margin was 43.0% in the fourth quarter of this fiscal year compared to 46.1% last year. The difference in gross margins is due to revenue mix. As we guided last quarter, less personal protective equipment was sold in the fourth quarter than in the third quarter. However, as a percentage of total division revenue, personal protective equipment revenue was still a significant percentage, while profitable personal protective equipment revenue has lower gross margins than the first aid cabinet servicing business. We expect gross margins to improve sequentially as the cabinet servicing business continues to grow and gets closer to the pre-COVID percent of total division revenue. Our Fire Protection Services and Uniform Direct Sale businesses are reported in the All Other category. All Other revenue was $181.9 million compared to $152.3 million last year. The Fire business organic revenue increased 22.4%. Gross margin improved 70 basis points. Uniform Direct Sale business organic revenue growth rate was 6.2%, and gross margin increased 280 basis points. I'll now turn the call over to Todd for our final prepared remarks.
Todd Schneider: Thanks, Paul. We are pleased with our fourth quarter financial results that conclude a fiscal year of significant accomplishments, including the following. We help keep our customers' place of business clean, safe and Ready for the Workday by providing essential products and services. We procured hard to find and potentially life saving items such as face masks and gloves, provided hygienically clean health care scrubs and isolation gowns and developed services, including hand sanitizer dispensing, sanitizing spray services and disinfecting wipes. Our Net Promoter Scores reached an all-time high because we consistently delivered for our customers by providing needed products and services and being flexible with service agreement terms during the pandemic. We were again named to the prestigious Fortune 500, climbing 31 spots to rank at number 410 on the 2021 list. It's an honor to be recognized among the most successful and respected companies. We allocated capital to improve shareholder return. We paid down debt, reducing interest expense. We increased the annual dividend 10.2% and changed from an annual dividend to a quarterly dividend to return cash to shareholders more timely. We've increased the dividend 37 consecutive years. Also in fiscal 2021 and up until today, we repurchased 2.7 million shares of Cintas stock for a total of $979 million. As part of our steadfast commitment to corporate responsibility, we issued our inaugural environmental, social and governance, or ESG report. We are committed to protecting the environment, enhancing humanity and supporting the communities where we do business. And in addition to these many accomplishments and despite the unprecedented challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic, we grew our fiscal year revenue and adjusted EPS. I can't thank our employee partners enough, and I'm so proud of their truly impressive achievements. The Cintas story is one of growth. We have grown revenue and adjusted EPS in 50 of the past 52 years. The only exceptions were the Great Recession years. Our successful long-term financial formula is organic revenue growth in the mid to high single digits, double-digit earnings per share growth, significant cash generation, improved deployment of excess cash to further generate strong shareholder returns. Our prospects for continued growth are great and a result in part from a strong value proposition and a vast total addressable market. We have a product or service to help nearly every business get Ready for the Workday. Examples include, scrubber rental to hospitals and dentists, hygiene supplies and services to professional services firms, floor care services, including walk-off mats and mops to retailers, first aid products to hotel and restaurant kitchens for cuts and burns, fire protection services to facilities managers and universities, and personal protective equipment to city maintenance and sanitation departments. The renting of health care scrubs and isolation gowns is indicative of a broad uniform rental opportunity. Plus, we are so much more than a uniform company. More than half of our revenue is from facility services, including hygiene, floor care items such as walk-off mats and dust mops, cleaning tools like microfiber mops and towels, first aid cabinet services, personal protective equipment, and fire protection services, including test and inspection of extinguishers and alarms. Our total addressable market is the 15 to 20 million businesses we don't currently service. Every business, goods producing or services providing has a need for image, safety, cleanliness or compliance. Every business has a need Cintas can fulfill. Additionally, the COVID-19 pandemic ushered in a greater focus on health, readiness and outsourcing of non-core activities. Significant opportunities for new revenues continue to exist because of the need of businesses to instil confidence in their employees, customers, students, patients, et cetera, that they will remain healthy and safe. The new services we launched, including hand sanitizer stand dispenser service and sanitizing spray service, have a long runway. Cintas consistently invest in technology to support growth. Our recent implementation of the SAP enterprise resource planning system provides benefits in three main areas. One is operational efficiencies. Our route drivers utilize personal route computers, which are similar to a cell phone, to access data and process transactions real time. Also, SAP enabled us to have visibility to laundered plant stock room [ph] inventories across our operations, helping improve profitability via the sharing and reuse of revenue producing assets. And the technology helps us improve working capital, be it tighter management of supply chain inventory. A second benefit is data analytics and enhanced business reporting. These result from having the order to cash cycle all in one system. SAP enables us to analyze, process and extract information from extremely large data sets, helping us target penetration, cross selling and pricing opportunities. And the third competitive advantage is improved customer service. Through SAP, our customers can pay bills and communicate with us 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. We expect the ease of doing business will help us improve customer retention. Also, customers can order products and services via SAP, resulting in improved turnaround time and faster realization of product and service revenue. I want to say a few more words regarding ESG. From the start of our company in the Great Depression, the Cintas business model was wholly based on sustainable practices, wash and reuse. We have a great corporate responsibility story to tell. We will continue to expand our ESG reporting and are excited about issuing our next report this year. And finally, I'd like to say thank you on behalf of all Cintas employee partners to Scott Farmer for his 18 years of service as Chief Executive Officer. Under Scott's leadership, the company's revenue grew from $2.69 billion in 2003 to $7.12 billion in fiscal 2021. Scott successfully led Cintas through years filled with challenges, changes and opportunities, including the Great Recession, our largest acquisition, the COVID-19 pandemic and the integration of SAP technology across the organization. We thank Scott for his service to the company as CEO, and we are grateful that he remains as Executive Chairman.
Scott Farmer: Thank you, Todd. And I'd like to take this moment to thank all of my Cintas partners across the company. I'm proud of our many collective accomplishments, including the innovative products and services that we provide our customers, as well as the tremendous dedication of our employee partners without whom we wouldn't be successful. Our company is in a position of financial strength with the strongest and most experienced management team that we've ever had executing a proven strategy that has allowed our continued success even through the recent pandemic. It's been a true honor and privilege for me to have led this company as CEO for the last 18 years. And I'm as excited about our future as I've ever been, and I look forward to watching this leadership team steer us to continued success in the future.
Paul Adler: That concludes our prepared remarks. We are happy to answer your questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Andrew Wittmann with R.W. Baird. Please go ahead.
Andrew Wittmann: Great. And thanks for taking my question. Scott, congratulations on a great run. It's been a pleasure, and we look forward to still having you associated maybe when we come to Cincinnati next time.
Scott Farmer: You bet. Thank you.
Andrew Wittmann: Yeah. So I guess getting on to business here a little bit, and maybe this is for Mike. There is been a lot of focus on inflationary factors. And what I heard here on your prepared remarks and in your release was that it sounds like you are getting good operating leverage. But I was just hoping you could drill in and talk about some of the key factors you've talked about in the past. Certainly, labor is one that's come up a lot broadly across the street. You've talked about some other things like health care, travel. And others are mentioning merchandise costs. I was just wondering if you could talk about some of those key buckets. And talk about the offsets that you have baked into guidance because it looks like your margin guidance is flat to up slightly. And so I was just kind of hoping you could talk about some of the moving pieces inside of that as to why you feel like you can offset some of these headwinds that might be creeping in?
Mike Hansen: Sure. I'll begin, and certainly, Todd can jump in. But as it relates to guidance, you are right, Andrew. The implied margins would be at the low end of the guidance flattish to at the high end up around 70 basis points, so a pretty good range. And you know, you've heard us talk a lot about we've made some really great progress. We made some difficult decisions through this pandemic, and it'd be a shame to go backwards in this. And this guidance is suggesting that we don't intend to. And so how do we think about this inflation? Certainly, labor, as you mentioned, Andrew, is a big component of our cost structure. And the really good news for us is we've been working on the labor rates for some time, so this isn't something that is catching us by surprise. And over the last several years, we've been increasing the labor rates. And so certainly, the labor environment is a difficult one from the standpoint of the supply of people hiring has been a little bit more difficult. But we don't expect that the increasing wages around us is really going to be a significant issue. We've been working on that for years and don't expect that to really be that difficult for us as we move into the future.
Scott Farmer: And I would add that, that includes last fiscal year. We raised the wage rates of all of our hourly people in our distribution centers, offices, production, all of our service, frontline service personnel. So we don't have a big catch up as a result of that. I know there are other businesses out there that froze wages in the pandemic. And because it was a year, they might have a catch up to make, and we don't have that. So you know, I'm happy to say that. But I don't think that so far we've seen issues where the labor rates are going to cause us significant problems. But we're more concerned about what happens to our customers as a result of this. And so we'll be watching that very closely.
Todd Schneider: Andrew, this is Todd. It's a great question. We're in a good staffing position. We like where we are there. We like the fact that we've been addressing this subject over the course of a number of years. And as Scott pointed out appropriately, even in the peak of the pandemic last year, we were committed to staying the course and do the right things and taking care of our hourly partners to - because we knew that we could see things coming, right, and we're committed to it. So that's important to us. Certainly, other input costs are cost of goods. And our supply chain team is working harder than ever, and they are doing a great job in managing through that process to get us the goods that we need to make sure we're servicing our customers, which are doing a great job at, and to manage our cost structure from that standpoint. But we like the spot we're in, and we anticipate getting, hopefully some leverage on the additional revenue that we bring in. We've done such a great job and took such a big jump forward from fiscal '20 to fiscal '21 that as Mike stated, it will be a shame to go backwards, and we're focused on going forward.
Mike Hansen: And Andrew, maybe I'll add a couple of other items. You saw that energy was 30 basis points higher in our fourth quarter than our third quarter, about 40 basis points year-over-year. We've built that kind of increase into our guidance. And certainly, there is room within our guidance for larger increases than that, but something that we'll keep our eye on. We are - we constantly are working on improving efficiencies, productivity levels, routing, and those things will all have positive impacts. From a material cost standpoint, you know, the good news is many of our rental items are amortized. So when we see increases in costs, they generally tend to take a long time to make it to our P&L, and they must - they have to last for a while so that they bleed in over time. And so, you know, obviously, we've got a great global supply chain Todd talked about, and they adapt. And so when we see inflationary pressures, we look for opportunities to adapt to that new environment. And I think, over the course of the last year, we've talked a lot about our supply chain. They've done a great job, and we anticipate that they will continue to do a very good job. Now having said that, you know, there are a lot of challenges in the supply chain and in hiring that we've talked about. And we're not immune to inflationary pressures. They are all built into our guidance. But the other thing is, we haven't increased our pricing for 2 years, right? And - but we certainly believe that, that is an opportunity for us. As we move into this new fiscal year, we have selectively started to do that in some areas. Pricing is local for us. It's customer by customer decision, and where we believe it makes sense, we will do that. And so that is certainly something that is available to us when we believe that the cost pressure is warranted. Again, all of that is built into our guidance, which assumes not just keeping the great leap forward that we made in fiscal '21, but even continuing to improve upon.
Andrew Wittmann: That's really helpful. Thank you. I just - my one follow-up, is just trying to get a sense of the re-opening benefits that you are getting or expecting at a sequential basis. How much is left after the May quarter and into June? Is there still businesses that are closed for you or substantially closed where the revenues are so de minimis that they might as well be considered closed? Or on a sequential basis, are you starting to feel like things are fairly normal here, June, July time period? Thank you.
Todd Schneider: So Andrew, Mike talked about pricing being a local subject, re-opening is a local subject as well. But for the most part, most businesses are back. Certainly, Canada has been a little slower to come back because of vaccination rates and government impacts there. But nevertheless, in general, most businesses are back. Now are they back at the levels that we think they will be in the future? No, and we're committed to helping them with our valuable products and services to help them be prepared as their employees come back and their customers come back, so that they can be - they can compete in the marketplace. So hopefully, that helps.
Scott Farmer: Yeah. I would add, this is Scott. I would add that we think that Canada will be in the position that the US is sometime the end of the summer with re-openings, but they're on a steady pace heading in that direction. The biggest issue that we have is that businesses are open, but there are, what, about 7 million fewer people employed right now than they were pre-pandemic. And so there's a lot of room there. And I think as federal unemployment benefits subside in, what September, we hope to see that our customers that are open will be able to get themselves back to full staffing, and that will obviously benefit our business.
Operator: Thank you. Moving on to our next question, we'll go to Manav Patnaik with Barclays Capital. Please go ahead.
Manav Patnaik: Thank you. Good morning, guys. So I was just hoping you could help us with the kind of cadence of organic growth by segment. There is still obviously a lot of uncertainty potentially out there, so thank you for giving full year guidance. But I was just hoping if there is anything to call out in terms of modeling you know, the growth rates of the segments?
Todd Schneider: Yeah, Manav. this is Todd. So I think you've seen through our guidance, we expect a range of 5.8 to 7.2 from a growth rate. When you think about - obviously, the rental division is our, by far, our largest division, so that will be in that range. But we expect that all of our businesses, meaning the other businesses, Fire, First Aid and our Direct Sale business, will all be high single digit growth businesses in this fiscal year. So we feel very positive about all of them, and I look forward to growth in each of those businesses.
Mike Hansen: Yeah. I think we might see a little bit of bumpiness in the First Aid business. You saw that their revenue was a little bit lower. Growth wise they had a decline in the fourth quarter. They had such a strong year last year, particularly in the fourth quarter and the first quarter. We may see a little bit of bumpiness through the year, but it's a great business. It's improving. We are seeing the recurring business and the mix start to turn back to where we like it. And so that's just throughout the year, maybe a little bit of a different performance than we're used to seeing from a steadiness perspective.
Manav Patnaik: Okay. That makes sense. And then if I can just ask you know, around capital allocation, I mean the buyback was a pretty big number, the $900 plus million that you talked about. Can you just help us understand that in the context of the M&A pipeline and what we should expect going forward?
Todd Schneider: Yeah. So our commitment is still number one priority is to invest back into our business, to grow the number of customers we have and grow those customers and invest in our infrastructure. Our second one is to invest in M&A. And we are very focused on M&A, active in that area and it's a big push for us. And then third, if there is - consistent with what our approach has been in the past, if there is capital that is in excess of that, then we'll return it back to the shareholders in the form of increasing dividend and repurchase of the stock as appropriate.
Paul Adler: Yeah, Manav, this is Paul. And I was just wanted to add that, we're so fortunate to have such a strong balance sheet, the cash flow is so strong. We did that buyback, and our leverage is 1.5 times, as we mentioned in the script. So fortunate to be in a position where you know, what we do with the dividend and the buyback doesn't preclude us from M&A or any other activities because of the strength of the balance sheet.
Manav Patnaik: All right. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan Securities. Please go ahead.
Andrew Steinerman: Hi. When you frame fiscal '22 revenue growth, could you just talk about some verticals here, which verticals do you think will be above the average growth of the guide? And which verticals might take longer to rebound or maybe they are just kind of slower growth verticals?
Todd Schneider: So Andrew, this is Todd. As we look at the business, certainly, the hospitality business is - you read about it in the papers, right? You see - you hear about bookings, whether it's airlines or hotels, et cetera. That is a vertical that we think will be quite positive this year. The health care vertical is going to continue to be strong for us. Hospitals are catching up on voluntary type of procedures, which is helping that. And we have a very attractive value proposition in both of those areas as well. Education, government are both - we expect to be quite strong for us. There was a the mix of business, I think, you will see will be different in those areas, less PPE and more focused on more of a traditional type of approach that we've had in the past. But those key verticals are all positioned well. And if you think of them all, they are all positioned quite well, hospitality probably the best.
Andrew Steinerman: Are there any slower growth verticals or really it's a rising tide here?
Todd Schneider: Yeah. I would say I don't - none come to mind where I would say, yes, a slower type of growth. It's just - we're kind of a rising tide is the best way to put it.
Andrew Steinerman: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Hamzah Mazari with Jefferies. Please go ahead.
Ryan Gunning: Hey, good morning. It's actually Ryan Gunning filling in for Hamzah. My first question, just around the Fire Protection business. And if you could just talk about the competitive dynamics there and any opportunity for larger scale M&A in that business kind of similar to what you did with ZEE Medical and the First Aid side?
Todd Schneider: Yeah, Ryan. This is Todd. We like our position in the Fire business and really like the Fire business. There, we understand the - how to go to market and how to make attractive margins in that business. And we're investing, we're investing in M&A, we're investing in infrastructure to make sure that we're able to service all of our customers. And we have a national offering in that business, some via sub-contracting. But nevertheless, a very attractive national approach, and we're positioned well. How we - our culture, our infrastructure, how we execute puts us in a good spot. And there's good momentum in that business. There was - you think about it, right? It's all - legally, you have to have that - those products and those services. But nevertheless, there was some pent up demand in it from repairs, right. So if you think about someone comes through and looks at your fire equipment, and there are some items that need to be repaired. During the pandemic, people are more so anxious to spend money on those types of subjects and - but as we're coming out of it, we're busy, we're busy in that area for many reasons, one of which is some pent up demand on repair, which is great business for us.
Ryan Gunning: Got it. Thanks. That's helpful. And then switching over, could you provide any kind of visibility on like how much of your sales you consider today as pandemic, like non-recurring versus recurring and how you kind of define that?
Todd Schneider: Yeah, great question. So when you think about, let's call it, PPE items that were really pandemic related, they are still at levels elevated from pre-pandemic, but we do not expect them to repeat at the levels that they were in fiscal '21. So if you think about our guidance, we think we would be - with the PPE that doesn't repeat, if it has - if it does repeat, then we would be in the, you know, on the high end, above 8% from an internal growth rate. So think about it that way about how much is - will not be repeating, that we don't expect to repeat, which kind of demonstrates the mix of business is going to be back closer - much closer to traditional. And there is some real good momentum there to get to the growth rates that we've guided towards.
Ryan Gunning: Got it. Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from George Tong with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
George Tong: Hi, thanks. Good morning. In the Uniform Rental segment, can you talk a bit about sales rep productivity trends and how the pipeline is performing, especially moving through the quarter and entering fiscal 2022?
Todd Schneider: George, I'm glad you asked about that. I have been so impressed by our sales organization, the creativity, the flexibility, the urgency, the intensity about which way they go about their jobs and how they have adapted to a crazy environment. And we try to work very hard to position them with great products and services so that people very much want to take their calls. And so we like where that's heading. The mix of business is obviously changing, but it's getting back to much more traditional, George. But there is a strong audience for the - our sales partners and in whom they are calling on, partly because there were some items that you - when people were going through the pandemic, they said, hey, I can't make a decision on uniforms right now, but I need some critical products to help my business run. We provided those critical products and services and its positioned us, now that it's closer to businesses getting back to normal, where we say, okay, now I'm ready to talk about those types of items. So all that is positive for us. You know, as we went through it, folks didn't realize that we had all the products and services that we do. So that opens some doors, and we're continuing to operate in those doors to help improve our business.
George Tong: That's very helpful. And then switching gears to health care and hygiene. Those are very strong categories over the past year. Can you describe what kind of performance you're expecting structurally from those health care and hygiene categories, not just in fiscal 2022, but really looking forward? And then diving into PPE, you talked a little bit about normalization there in First Aid mix going back to pre-COVID levels over time, which has higher margins. Just talk a little bit about that evolving mix as well and the implications for growth and profitability?
Todd Schneider: Yes, George, I'll start and Mike, Scott, Paul, if they want to jump in. We've spoken in the past about hygiene, cleanliness, all those subjects that the pandemic has done for those subjects what 9/11 did to security 20 years ago. And so what we're seeing is there's a greater focus on the health of employees, health of patients, health of guests, students, and hygiene is a big part of that. So we see that as something that will be elevated into the future, and we think that's good for society, that's good for our business and good certainly for all those individuals. So we think that's going to be something that's elevated, hopefully, in perpetuity. As far as PPE normalization, there is - there was a breakneck pace to get PPE last year because folks couldn't keep their doors open in certain cases couldn't work. So there was some real peaks last year. That is certainly less. We expect this year the variants, the delta variant, I think, brings a bit of a wildcard into that, which we're not going to try to predict. But nevertheless, as you see, as we go throughout the year, you will see much more normalization. You'll see more people using our traditional cabinets, First Aid products, hands and cabinets as we say, and PPE will be more moderate. Now just keep in mind, we've always been in the PPE business. We've always provided these products and services, it's just they were elevated. We will continue to offer them. But as more people get back to work in offices and machine shops, in government and education, there will be more people that will be consuming, from a first aid standpoint, our traditional types of bandages and tablets, et cetera. So hopefully, that gives you a little color.
Paul Adler: And George, this is Paul. I just want to tell, you mentioned First Aid specifically too, so I just want to make sure we provided enough clarity there. That business, as Mike said, alluded to, it's in a transition period where, to Todd's point, so much PPE was provided. We seized the opportunity to come through for our customers and provide thermometers and masks and visors, et cetera. So it's an outsized percent of the revenue. That will transition, as we've been talking about the last couple of quarters. What I want to make sure everybody understands is that First Aid business is getting back to that more re-occurring revenue stream with that Cabinet Service business, which we are very excited about. And to think about a 9% or high single digit type of a growth rate for First Aid in fiscal '22, that's coming off a huge growth rate with a lot of PPE. So still a strong performance. And what I want to make sure people don't miss is that, in order to drive a high single digit growth rate in '22, with PPE declining, that Cabinet Service business is growing very strongly. And what that will do then is improve the margins going forward for the First Aid business in fiscal '22. And we probably won't get back all the way to pre-COVID levels in terms of margins in First Aid because, just like many of our businesses, it's a lot of small transactions. There's some momentum that has to build. But definitely, the margins will continue to improve through the year as we get back to servicing those cabinets.
George Tong: Very helpful. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Toni Kaplan: Thank you. I know you talked about the margin guidance earlier in the call and addressed the inflation impacts. But I wanted to see if you could provide maybe some additional detail around which business lines you're expecting to see the most strength from a margin perspective?
Mike Hansen: Well, Toni, I would say, you know, all of our - we expect all of our businesses to perform very, very well. And in order for us to be able to guide in the way that we did from about flattish to up 70 basis points, we're going to need good performance out of all of our businesses. And that translates into very good incremental margins, especially in our Rental business. It's certainly, as Paul just described, it means that we're going to see some nice improvement in our First Aid margins as we see a bit of a mix shift. We expect continued good performance in our Fire business, as I think we mentioned 22% organic growth in the fourth quarter. We've got some great momentum, and we'll get some nice leverage as we move into the year. And then certainly, our Direct Sale business, those margins I would expect, from a percentage standpoint to really increase nicely, as we see those - see the revenue start to come back, that will allow us to get a little bit more efficient and certainly be able to leverage our infrastructure in that business. So we're looking for margin, good margin performance in all of our businesses all contributing to that guidance range, margin improvement and all contributing to a real healthy 20% to 30% incremental margins.
Todd Schneider: Toni, the - obviously, we're guiding towards all of our businesses growing, incremental margins 20% to 30%. But when you think about it, obviously, the mix is going to change in all those businesses. And each of them sold, with the exception of Fire, there was some PPE. And so there's - we'll get back to more traditional type of mix. And that and the leverage on the additional revenue is going to help us.
Toni Kaplan: That's great. And in your prepared remarks, you mentioned the 15 million to 20 million businesses that you don't currently service. Could you just talk about the recent industry outsourcing trends? Has that - have you seen that accelerate or flatten? And how do you go about reaching out to those businesses? Is that an initiative, a big opportunity for you any more so than historically? Just how should we think about the opportunity?
Todd Schneider: Yes. Toni, the outsourcing trends continue, that has been positive. In addition, the focus on bringing manufacturing back to the United States and Canada, we think will be a positive, just that's obviously in the early innings. But both of those, we think, will be positives for our business. As far as reaching out, we have a significant investment in our infrastructure. And part of that infrastructure is in our route base, and part of that is in our sales organization. So that is a - that's a significant investment. You've probably also seen, I hope you've seen some of our investment in mass media that we're leveraging. Because we think it can pay dividends for that infrastructure. And there are one more thing we hear from customers and prospects, frankly, is, hey, I didn't know you did that. That is a product or a service that they didn't realize that we provided. So we're trying to leverage that and get the message out and to give a little air cover to our infrastructure.
Toni Kaplan: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Tim Mulrooney with William Blair. Please go ahead.
Tim Mulrooney: Good morning, guys. I wanted to check in on the health care opportunity, which I know has gotten a lot of attention on recent calls. We haven't talked about it a lot yet today. You previously stated that I think that the vertical could expand from kind of 7% of sales today towards potentially 10% of sales over the next several years. But I know things are changing rapidly these days. So with another three months under your belt, I'm curious if those expectations have changed at all in either direction?
Todd Schneider: Tim, this is Todd. I'll start. We don't see momentum slowing down in that area. Again, hospitals are getting a little bit back to more normal operations of how they run their business, and our value proposition resonates with them. We've talked often about the various products and services that we provide, scrubs being a big one, isolation gowns, but also cleaning products to help them provide a healthy environment. So there is a whole lot more focus on health and welfare now. Obviously, in the health care business, because of what they do for a living, there's always been a major focus on providing an environment that allowed for high patient satisfaction, that was not only in health, but also in image. So its - when you think about what they need, it's a great vertical for us and the products and services we provide. And there is a long runway there. We're providing products and services to help institutions that - I'd like to think you'd be impressed by the name of - the list of people we do business with. So who's who in that business. But nevertheless, we're not nearly as penetrated as where we can be, should be and will be. So we're very much in the early innings on that vertical still.
Tim Mulrooney: Okay. Great. Thanks, Todd. And just switching gears, I apologize if you already addressed this. But how did energy costs impact the results this quarter? I don't know, maybe year-over-year sequentially or however you want to present it. But can you also talk about your expectation for energy cost that's built into your guidance, maybe for your fleet, but then also for your production plans? Thank you.
Mike Hansen: Tim, our total energy costs for the quarter were 2.1% of revenue. That's up 30 basis points from the third quarter and that's up 40 basis points from a year ago. So we did certainly see some increase within the quarter. Our expectation is that those will remain elevated during fiscal '22, up at those levels, maybe even a little bit higher. So that's what we've got incorporated. Most of that increase being price at the pump, so our gas and our service, our routes. So that's what we've got in the guidance.
Tim Mulrooney: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Gary Bisbee with Bank of America Securities. Please go ahead.
Gary Bisbee: Hi, guys. Good morning. I guess on revenue, first, I have one clarification and one question. I just wanted to clarify. So high single digit for First Aid, I heard that, and then I heard some discussion of the tough comps and I think the term bumpiness. Is high single digit the right number for the year, but maybe declines in the near term as you get through the toughest period of comps is not out of the question? Is that a fair statement on that business? And the question then on revenue, on the Rentals business, right, the long-term growth rate has been sort of in line with this guidance. You've got easy comps, you've had sequential improvement throughout last year. The fourth quarter had quite strong growth. I guess I wonder why you wouldn't be positioned to grow faster than the historical long-term trend given those factors in this year. Did the hygiene business within rentals have an outsized benefit from PPE that rolls off, and is that a drag? Or are there other factors beyond just your normal conservatism that might be weighing on that business? Thank you.
Todd Schneider: So Gary, as far as the First Aid, yeah, think about it as high single digits for the year. As Mike stated, Q4 last year, Q1 - excuse me, Q4 of '20 was a huge growth rate for the First Aid business, as was Q1, so the comp from right now were really big. So as the year goes on, the PPE will - the comp will lessen. And as a result, our growth rates will be better in that business. So the bumpiness that Mike spoke about is simply the PPE comps in the early portions of this fiscal year versus last. As far as the Rental, yeah, as we mentioned in the past, there's PPE in that - in our results from last year in Rental as well. And again, just going back to our total guidance if the PPE would repeat, that we do not believe it will, this year, then you'd be into the - the number would start with an eight as far as internal growth. So how far into the eight? I really don't know. But nevertheless, we'd be picking up a heck of a lot of basis points in growth if that PPE repeated. So it's a headwind. We're proud that we provided the product to our customers. Our customers really valued it. It opened doors. Excuse the pun, but it kept their doors opened in many cases. And our Net Promoter Scores reflect it. So they were very appreciative that we were able to provide those products and services. If they need them again, we'll provide them. We just don't think that they'll be at the levels that they were in the past.
Gary Bisbee: Thank you. And then a quick follow up. In the past, Mike, I think you've provided the breakdown of the Rentals business revenue in the fourth quarter by the various sub-segments. I wonder if you'd be willing to do that again this year?
Paul Adler: Yeah, Gary, it's Paul. And we do - yeah, Gary, we have that information for you, excuse me. And I would preface it by saying, first of all, what we provided typically is a Q4 sample, Q4 fiscal '21 versus fiscal '20. Obviously, there's a lot of noise in these figures, excuse me, in that you know, it's an unprecedented time. Fiscal '20 fourth quarter was the onset of the pandemic. So a lot of job losses, a lot of pandemic-driven demand, as Todd just said, for certain items of PPE. So I want to throw that out there first. But last year's fourth quarter, so fiscal '20 Q4, Uniform Rental was 50% of the segment mix. Dust, which is the walk-off mats, mops, that was 18% of the mix. Hygiene products, those are the soaps, the air fresheners, sanitizing dispensers, et cetera, that's 14% last year. Shop towels were 4%, linens 10 and the catalog business, which is more like the direct - small direct sales component of the Rental business products off of the route from the drivers, that was 4%. So, then this year's mix: uniform rental 48%; dust, 17%; hygiene at 17%; shop towels 4%; linens 9%; and catalog 5%. So again, obviously, COVID impacted results, not necessarily reflective of future performance. But with this breakout, you can obviously see how strongly hygiene performed. Typically, like in the Q4 of fiscal '20, that was mostly restroom type items, soaps and air fresheners, the paper. But in this Q4 '21, that hygiene percentage grew greater, driven by the sanitizer dispensers, the stands, the sanitizing sprays, et cetera. And then that catalog nudged up a little bit from 4% to 5%. And that's where a lot of the PPE in the Uniform Rental and Facility Services business that we've talked about is recorded, the masks, gloves, those types of items.
Gary Bisbee: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.
Scott Schneeberger: Thanks very much. For my first one, I just wanted to follow up on the M&A comments earlier. It sounded like you have a very active pipeline that you're pursuing. I'm just curious if you could elaborate a little bit on what areas you may be pursuing and size of targets and how ripe things are. And then maybe what you're seeing with regard to multiples, good or bad, in the environment? Thanks.
Todd Schneider: Scott, I'll say each of our businesses were acquisitive, but tuck-ins, certainly, some geographic expansion as well. So we're highly active. And there is folks that are at least answering phones and they are taking calls, and we'll see where that goes. Certainly, you wonder about changes to tax, potential changes to taxes, will that free things up? That will be interesting to see what happens with that. As far as the size and multiples, those types of things, you know, there's - everything's come from the very small to medium sized types, I won't comment on else, but it's - they're all active. And part of it is because multiples, if you look at it historically in the marketplace, they're pretty high. But we're quite active in that area because we look at it from a very long-term approach. And we know when we make those types of acquisitions that it positions us to grow those as well. Because of our broad offering of products and services that we bring to the table that in many cases, the folks that we're speaking to don't have that broadness, it allows for us to take a long-term approach and grow those businesses, whether it's just in that area of the business or cross selling it across each of our enterprise.
Scott Schneeberger: Great, thanks. Appreciate that. And then my follow-up is a bit of a two parter, but it ties together pretty well. In Todd's section in the press release, there was mention of investment in - continued investment in technology, a competitive advantage. Just hoping you could elaborate on that. And then the back part of the question is, CapEx was down a lot in the past fiscal year, almost half of what it was in fiscal year '19 and down a good bit from fiscal '20. Just curious where that goes this year and maybe tie it together with the tech question? Thanks.
Todd Schneider: Great. I'll start with the tech question, and then Mike can handle the CapEx, if he prefers. Scott, we're investing heavily there because we see a need to - from a - whether it's productivity or from a competitive advantage. All areas of our business, we talked about leveraging SAP, leveraging the platforms that come along with that, they have customer benefits and operational benefits for us, and then obviously, the data that goes along with that. But that being said, we see some opportunities in automation that we've been investing in over the years. And we see opportunities to get efficiencies out of our fleet that we're investing in that we think can pay big dividends in that area. And so we're focused on doing such and making it easier to do business with Cintas. So - and we think, as you do that, that provides leverage for us. So leverage in the marketplace. So Mike, I'll let you handle the CapEx question.
Mike Hansen: Sure. From a CapEx perspective, clearly, the amounts were down in this past year because capacity needs just weren't the same as they had been in the previous years. We certainly kept up the CapEx for maintenance activities. But as we - there's a bit of a lag between when we need new capacity and when this revenue starts to - has started to come back. And we've seen some momentum, but there will be a little bit of a lag in the CapEx. Having said that, I expect we'll get back to historical levels by the end of the fiscal year. And that puts us probably in the $200 million to $250 million range for fiscal '22. But certainly, when we invest, we will certainly - when we need to invest, whether it's capacity, technology or otherwise, we will certainly do that.
Paul Adler: Yeah. The great news is, regarding our investment in the ERP system, SAP, that we've talked about a lot. I mean, a lot of that investment spending in that - some of the major expense is behind us, and it took us a while to roll it out and get the entire network into SAP. We had the G&K acquisition that added more locations and kind of slowed down the time to complete it. Then we had the pandemic. And so the exciting thing is the additional investment will continue to be made throughout the business, of course, still in technology. But a lot of it's already paid for. And now it's perfecting the system, taking the toy, so to speak, out of the box and not just using it for the Xs and Os of running the business, but using it to meet that competitive advantage to give us the data analytics and the other advantages that we haven't had previously.
Scott Schneeberger: Okay. Thanks so much.
Operator: Thank you. And our final question today comes from Kevin McVeigh with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
Unidentified Analyst: Hey, guys. This is actually Bryan on for Kevin. Thanks for squeezing us here. Thanks for the commentary kind of around the color sort of on the re-opening and you don't expect - not all customers are quite back yet. So just drilling in that a little bit, how should we think about you know, sort of what percentage of clients are still inactive versus maybe kind of how that compares to out of businesses or attrition that we would see just to kind of frame that in. And any sort of commentary around how that shakes out geographically, either geographically or by vertical here in the US?
Todd Schneider: So Bryan, I don't have a specific number for you, but just generally speaking, I'd say most businesses are back to some degree, not certainly back to full bore. We mentioned Canada specifically as an outlier, which we expect, let's just say, by August, September to be back much closer to normal. But one of the big issues is there are 7 million people less working today than there were a year ago or so. And of those 7 million people, I don't know what - how many of them are Cintas wearers or will be, but there's a percentage of. And we want those to - certainly see those folks get back to work. And whether they're wearing uniforms or utilizing our First Aid products and services, all that impacts us. So the - for the most part, businesses are back. They're certainly not anywhere near where we think they will be over time.
Unidentified Analyst: Got it. Okay. And then last one here for us. You guys talked about continuing to expand on ESG reporting. And you know, certainly, what we've noticed is the ESG scores tend to focus on the internal operations. But we'd be curious if you could just touch on maybe how you guys help your customers achieve their ESG goals? Thanks.
Todd Schneider: Yeah. Bryan, great question. Again, our heritage, what we do - and frankly, as I'm speaking of the Rental business, what our industry does, the impact that it has on saving customers water, energy, what we do to treat water instead of it going down into the sewer. Because those products, whether they're garments or towels or what have you, all that, they're going to be either purchased and thrown in the garbage or purchased and cleaned at home. And in both cases, we are helping substantially those folks helping the environment and helping to save landfill space, helping to fill or excuse me, save water, energy and the cleanliness of water as well. And I don't think we've told the story well enough in the past, because at our heritage, we are a wash and reuse business. And again, without our industry, there would be millions of more gallons and units of energy and et cetera that will be utilized because they're going to be either thrown to the landfill or laundered somehow. And we know that we are infinitely more efficient at laundering those products than they would be at home or in another type of setting.
Mike Hansen: You know, I might add also that when you think about our First Aid and Safety and Fire businesses, the purpose of those businesses are to keep our customers, employees safe and healthy. And so it's a little bit of a different ESG angle than what Todd was talking about. But from an employee perspective, our goals are to help our customers really achieve the safety and the health of their employees. So we're looking out for them from that S perspective of the ESG as well.
Operator: All right. Thank you. And this concludes today's question-and-answer session. Mr. Adler, at this time, I'll turn the conference back to you for any additional or closing remarks.
Paul Adler: All right. Thanks, Nick. And thank you all for joining us this morning. We will issue our first quarter of fiscal '22 financial results in September. And we look forward to speaking with you again at that time. Have a good day.
Operator: And this concludes today's call. Thank you all for your participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2021 Q3  (2021-03-17 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Cintas’[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:08:00 2021 ] Quarterly Earnings Results Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Paul Adler, Vice President, Treasurer,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:08:00 2021 ] and Investor Relations. Sir, please go ahead.
Paul Adler: Good morning and thank you for joining us. With me today is Scott Farmer, Cintas’ Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer; Todd Schneider, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer; and Mike Hansen, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We will discuss our third quarter results for fiscal 2021. After our commentary, we will be happy to answer questions. The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a Safe Harbor from civil litigation for forward-looking statements. This conference call contains forward-looking statements that reflect the company's current views as to future events and financial performance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those we may discuss. I refer you to the discussion on these points contained in our most recent filings with the SEC. I'll now turn the call over to Scott Farmer.
Scott Farmer: Thank you, Paul. Good morning, everyone. The COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic continues,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:13:00 2021 ] and it remains a significant disruption to the economy. Our fiscal third quarter,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:14:00 2021 ] which included the months of December, January,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:14:00 2021 ] and February was particularly challenging. COVID-19 case counts surged from about 180,000 on December 1 to a peak of little over 300,000 on January 8. Not surprisingly, economic indicators reflected an economic recovery that slowed considerably. In December, the U.S. economy posted job losses again after seven straight months of job gains. The operating environment was also challenged by severe winter weather. The snow and ice storm in February caused extensive energy blackouts in the U.S., especially in the state of Texas. Despite a very difficult operating environment in late December and into January, our sales rep productivity remained strong and our employee partners persevered enabling us to offset the headwinds and get to flat on a sequential basis. On top of that, we were able to help our customers with large supplies of personal protective equipment before the end of the quarter. We provided more personal protective equipment than ever, enabling us to exceed our financial expectations. Also, on an organic basis, our quarterly revenue was flat year-over-year, a strong accomplishment considering the comparison to the prior year quarter that was not impacted by COVID-19. Looking ahead to our fourth quarter, we expect lower COVID-19 case counts to be the foundation for improved operating environment. We do not anticipate that personal protective equipment sales will be as strong, so fourth quarter revenue in this product line will decline sequentially. However, we believe that our recurring revenue service -- service revenue will increase solidly on a sequential basis after being flat in the third quarter. Mike will provide more information regarding our fourth quarter guidance soon. Regardless of the operating environment, our employee partners worked with urgency to get businesses ready for the workday[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:30:00 2021  ]Ready for the Workday[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:30:00 2021 ]. Companies want to open their doors every day with confidence that they’re ready for their employees and their customers. We helped businesses achieve that objective by providing a wide range of products and services that enhance our customers' image and help keep their facilities and employees clean, safe, and looking their best. For over 90 years, Cintas has accomplished getting businesses ready [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:30:00 2021  ]for the workday[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:30:00 2021  ]Ready for the Workday[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:30:00 2021 ] in numerous ways, including providing hygienically clean uniforms to auto manufacturers, for example, so that the workers can safely build their cars; restroom supplies and services to professional services firms so bathrooms are ready for use by employees and clients.

Our partners are honored to be deemed essential. They are ready to listen, ready to offer solutions, ready to solve problems, and ready to be counted on to deliver, and they do. Now, I’ll turn the call back over to Mike for commentary on our financial results. Mike?
Mike Hansen: Thank you, Scott. Our fiscal 2021 third quarter revenue was $1.78 billion compared to $1.81 billion in last year's third quarter. Earnings per diluted share or EPS were $2.37, an increase of 9.7% from last year's third quarter. The organic revenue growth rate adjusted for acquisitions, divestitures, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, and differences in the number of workdays was flat for the third quarter of fiscal '21. Organic revenue for the Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segment was also flat. Organic revenue for the First Aid and Safety Services operating segment increased 17.7%. Gross margin for the third quarter of fiscal '21 was $809.5 million compared to $824.4 million in last year's third quarter. Gross margin as a percentage of revenue increased 10 basis points to 45.6% for the third quarter of fiscal '21 compared to 45.5% in the third quarter of fiscal '20. This increase was despite one less workday in this year's third quarter compared to last year. Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue were 27.2% in the third quarter of fiscal '21 and 28.2% last year. Fiscal '21 third quarter results benefited from increased sales rep productivity and lower discretionary spending. Operating income for the third quarter of fiscal '21 of $326.5 million increased 3.8%. Operating margin increased 100 basis points to 18.4% in the third quarter of fiscal '21 compared to 17.4% in the third quarter of fiscal '20. Our effective tax rate on continuing operations for the third quarter of fiscal '21 was 14.4% compared to 18.9% last year. The tax rate can move from period-[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:34:00 2021  ] [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:34:00 2021 ]to-[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:34:00 2021  ] [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:34:00 2021 ]period based on discrete events,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:34:00 2021 ] including the amount of stock compensation expense. Net income from continuing operations for the third quarter of fiscal '21 was $258.4 million, an increase of 10.2%. And again, EPS was $2.37, an increase of 9.7% from last year's third quarter. Our balance sheet and cash flow remained strong. Our leverage calculation for our credit facility definition was 1.6x debt to EBITDA. We have an untapped credit facility of $1 billion. During the third quarter of fiscal '21, we purchased $82 million of Cintas' common stock under our buyback programs. Earlier this week,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:35:00 2021  ] on March 15, Cintas paid shareholders $79.5 million in quarterly dividends. For financial modeling purposes, please note that there is one more workday in our fiscal '21 than in our fiscal '20. One more workday will benefit fiscal '21 full revenue growth by 40 basis points. One more workday also benefits operating margin and EPS. Fiscal '21 operating margin will be about 12.5 basis points better in comparison to fiscal '20 due to one more day of revenue. In fiscal '20, the fourth quarter contained 65 workdays. This fiscal year's fourth quarter contains 66. Please keep these differences in mind when modeling results on a[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:36:00 2021 ] [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:36:00 2021 ]year-over-year and sequential basis. For our fourth quarter, we expect our revenue to be in the range of $1.8 billion to $1.83 billion,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:36:00 2021 ] and diluted EPS to be in the range of $2.20 to $2.40. Our fourth quarter effective tax rate is expected to be in the range of 21% to 22.5%. Please note that our guidance does not include any future share buybacks or additional government restrictions on businesses in the event of increasing COVID-19 cases. We are encouraged by vaccinations, stimulus,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:37:00 2021 ] and business reopenings,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:37:00 2021 ] and we expect an improved operating environment in our fourth quarter. We expect recurring revenue to increase solidly on a day adjusted sequential basis in the range of about 1% to 2.5%, after being flat in the third quarter. However, we do not anticipate that personal protective equipment sales will remain at record levels, so fourth quarter revenue in this product line will decline sequentially. Please keep in mind these points when comparing our fourth quarter guidance to third quarter results. Our fiscal fourth quarter marks the lapping of the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Our prior year fourth quarter coincided with a period of greatest GDP decline and job losses resulting from unprecedented restrictions on businesses to help combat the surge of COVID-19 cases. While the pandemic continues, our fourth quarter financial results, including revenue growth will benefit in part from an easier comparison. Our last year's fourth quarter operating income was also significantly affected by many items caused by the COVID-19 coronavirus. These included additional reserves on accounts receivable and inventory, severance and asset impairment expenses,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:39:00 2021 ] and lower incentive compensation expense. Excluding these items, last year's fourth quarter operating margin was 15.5%. All these items were recorded in selling and administrative expense. The additional inventory reserves account for slow moving inventory mostly in the Uniform Direct S[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:39:00 2021 ]s[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:39:00 2021  ]ale business, where customers and some of the most severely impacted industries such as airlines and hotels exist. Please keep these points in mind when comparing our fiscal fourth quarter financial guidance to the prior year quarter. I’ll now turn the call over to Todd Schneider to discuss the performance of each of our businesses.
Todd Schneider: Thanks, Mike. The Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segment includes the rental and servicing of uniforms, health [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:40:00 2021  ]care scrubs, mats,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:40:00 2021 ] and towels and the provision of restroom supplies and other facility products and services. The segment also includes the sale of items from our catalogs to our customers on route. Uniform Rental and Facility Services revenue was $1.42 billion compared to $1.45 billion last year. Our Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment gross margin increased 50 basis points to 46.3% for the third quarter compared to 45.8% in last year's third quarter, driven in large part to lower production and service expense as a percent of revenue. Our First Aid and Safety Services operating segment includes revenue from the sale and servicing of first aid products, safety products, personal protective equipment,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:41:00 2021 ] and training. This segment's revenue for the third quarter was $198.5 million compared to $170.5 million last year. The First Aid segment gross margin was 43.5% in the third quarter compared to 48.0% in last year's third quarter. The difference in gross margin is due to revenue mix. In the pandemic, the needs of businesses for personal protective equipment, including masks and gloves has skyrocketed. Even though personal protective equipment is a less predictable revenue stream with lower gross margins than the relatively consistent first aid cabinet service, personal protective equipment is a profitable product line,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:43:00 2021 ] and we continue to work with urgency to fulfill the needs of businesses. Also note that on a sequential basis, First Aid segment gross margins and operating margins have improved through the pandemic. Our Fire Protection Services and Uniform Direct Sale businesses are reported in the All Other category. All Other revenue was $160.7 million compared to $192.1 million last year. The Fire business,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:43:00 2021  ] organic revenue increased 3.5%, the Uniform Direct Sale business organic revenue growth rate was minus 39.7%. Revenue from our airline, cruise line, hospitality,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:44:00 2021 ] and gaming customers are largely realized within this business line. These industries continue to be among the hardest hit by the pandemic. That concludes our prepared remarks. We are happy to answer your questions.
Operator: Thank you sir. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Tim Mulrooney with William Blair.
Tim Mulrooney: Good morning, Scott, Todd, Mike, and Paul. My question, I just have one for you this morning on the Uniform Rental segment. Operating margins in this business have ticked up nicely in 2021, and I think some of that was from structural cost savings,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:45:00 2021  ] and may [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:45:00 2021 ]be some from temporary cost savings. Moving forward, would you expect uniform operating margins to kind of normalize towards that pre-pandemic run rate over time or would you expect t[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:45:00 2021 ]h[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:45:00 2021 ]e [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:45:00 2021 ]operating margins to kind of settle at a [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:45:00 2021 ]somewhat higher level than the pre-pandemic run rate? Thank you.
Scott Farmer: Well, Tim, this is Scott. I’[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:46:00 2021 ]d[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:46:00 2021 ] will [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:46:00 2021  ]start by saying that there have been a lot of expenses this year that we have been able to control tightly, discretionary spending, travel, things like that, that impact the P&L. How much of that returns, I'm not sure. I mean, we wanted an awful lot, we don't necessarily have to have the large group meetings where everybody is travel[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:46:00 2021  ]ling into one town to accomplish that. Some of that will happen, but [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:46:00 2021 ]. But [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:47:00 2021  ]a lot of that probably won't. But I'd say that in our sequential -- in our recurring revenue businesses, as the economy continues to, I think, improve, you're going to see us need to add some expense back on to the P&L. That might be growth routes in the rental division as an example. Jobs that would help us with growth, additional salespeople, sales training, additional headcount in t[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:47:00 2021 ]he [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:48:00 2021 ]production operations to be able to process things. So, I wouldn't expect a linear improvement, but I would tell you that we do think that we will continue to see 20% to 30% incremental margins,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:48:00 2021  ] as we add the sales line back on to the P&L, and over time I think that we can maintain margins that will be at least at or above, probably above where we work [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:48:00 2021  ]were [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:48:00 2021 ]pre-pandemic, so that's how I would answer that. Does that help you?
Tim Mulrooney: That's really helpful, honest[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:49:00 2021 ]. Honest[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:49:00 2021  ], thoughtful answer. I appreciate that. Scott, thanks for taking my question.
Scott Farmer: Okay. Thanks, Tim.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Andrew Steinerman with J.P. Morgan.
Andrew Steinerman: Hi, there. A question for Todd. When you think of rentals being flat in the just reported quarter, could you just give us a sense of, you know,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:50:00 2021 ] how much ancillary services is contributing versus are you seeing improvement in Uniform Rentals as well? And a quick comment on how dependent are you in some of the areas like restaurants that are still kind of opening up ahead?
Todd Schneider: Andrew, great question. We had -- as was mentioned in the prepared remarks, demand for various items around PP&E and et cetera, other items regarding the pandemic was very strong in Q3. That was a result of what was going on with case counts, and you all saw that. So, that was significant for us to the tune of about $45 million more than in Q2. We don't see that as repeating -- that level repeating in Q4, but But [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:51:00 2021  ]we are very encouraged by what we're seeing in business coming back. So, you can see in our sequential improvement, what we see coming in Q4 over Q3, even without that level, that elevated level of those types of products and services. As far as restaurants, et [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:51:00 2021 ]cetera, that's certainly a component of our business. We are encouraged by what we're seeing there with folks’[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:52:00 2021  ] activity increasing, consumer spending increasing. We think people having money in their pockets via stimulus will help that, and we sure hope that small business folks who have been incredible about weathering the storm, that their demand starts to pick up even more. So, we're encouraged by what we see.
Andrew Steinerman: Okay. Thank you.
Scott Farmer: Andrew, if I could just add a point of clarification of the $45 million that Todd referred to, that is in the rental segment as well as the First Aid segment. You saw our First Aid segment had another very good quarter at 17.7%. And so,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:53:00 2021 ] we're seeing demand in all of these different kinds of things in -- from all of our customers, and we're doing our best to meet those demands. So,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:53:00 2021 ] it's -- that $45 million is not all within the rental segment, it's in all of our businesses.
Andrew Steinerman: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from George Tong with Goldman Sachs.
George Tong: Hi, thanks. Good morning. If you exclude the $45 million in PPE lift in the Uniform Rentals business, could you perhaps talk about how revenue trends progressed moving through fiscal 3Q?
Scott Farmer: Yes. George, but to Mike's point that $45 million was spread out across the -- [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:54:00 2021  ]all of our divisions, it wasn't just a rental lift, but relative to what happened in Q3, I think it's important that we all keep in mind that our third quarter often is a little less predictable than the rest of our year, and this [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:55:00 2021 ]. This [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:55:00 2021  ]year was as well. It has two holidays in it with Christmas and New Year and our customers sometimes take multiple days off depending on what days[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:55:00 2021 ] those holidays fall on. There's always a potential of weather issues with the [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:55:00 2021  ]snow and ice storms and things like that, and both of those things happened this year, and if you combine that with increasing COVID cases, it made it a little bit more complicated than it normally does. I would say as we went into the third quarter, we were very concerned about what we were seeing. COVID cases were on the rise. I’ve said earlier in my remarks that the economy shed jobs for the first time in s[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:56:00 2021 ]even [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:56:00 2021 ]7 months in December. So, December and into January, really even into February, we saw a very difficult economic environment, but as we got into February, we started to see our recurring revenues[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:56:00 2021  ] start to pick back up. Cases were dropping dramatically from -- I want to say, maybe the second week in January, the expected restrictions, the [[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:57:00 2021 ]indi[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:57:00 2021 ]s[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:57:00 2021 ]c[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:58:00 2021 ]ernible[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:57:00 2021 ]][Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:57:00 2021 ] [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:57:00 2021 ]govern[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:57:00 2021  ]an[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:57:00 2021  ]ce [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:57:00 2021  ]that we thought were going to put on businesses didn't fully materialize. And so, the -- [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:58:00 2021  ]we built some momentum in February that we continued[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:58:00 2021 ] to see as we moved into March, and I think that is reflected in the guidance that we've given for the fourth quarter.
George Tong: Got it. That's helpful. And just as a follow-up to that, if you look at new business trends and plans for sales force hiring, can you talk a little bit about how the pipeline is building?
Scott Farmer: We're very pleased with our pipeline. Our sales rep productivity continues to be at very, very high levels. We believe that the -- our value proposition is resonating today in the economy more than ever. So we're excited about our opportunities as we look out into the future. Our[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:59:00 2021  ] [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:59:00 2021  ]--[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:59:00 2021  ] [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:59:00 2021  ]T[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:59:00 2021 ]t[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:59:00 2021  ]here are 16 million or roughly 16 million businesses in the United States and Canada, and we do business with a million of them. And we really like our opportunity as we approach hopefully the end of this pandemic, and a more normalized economy of our ability to do [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:00:00 2021  ]attract new customers. So,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:00:00 2021 ] we're -- the pipeline is relatively full,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:00:00 2021 ] and the reps are performing at high levels, even considering the fact that many times they're making sales calls over a virtual Teams [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:00:00 2021 ]teams [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:00:00 2021  ]call or Zoom call and being successful in doing it. So,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:00:00 2021 ] we're excited about getting past this pandemic and getting into a normal economy. We think we'll be -- we are well-[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:01:00 2021  ] [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:01:00 2021 ]positioned to take advantage of that.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Hamzah Mazari with Jefferies.
Hamzah Mazari: Hey, good morning. My question is a little bit more big picture. Pre-COVID, I guess your long-term growth rate was sort of 6% to 8% depending on the year. In a post-COVID world, and you touched on a little bit of this with some of the ancillary services that may be benefited from the pandemic,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:01:00 2021 ] which may normalize. But at the same time, you have these newer verticals you've penetrated, there's some structural outsourcing, maybe in health [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:01:00 2021  ]care that could be a tailwind. I don't know if that sort of plateaued out or it continues, so [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:02:00 2021 ]. So [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:02:00 2021  ]when you put all the puts and takes together in a post-COVID world, do you expect your growth rate to be better than what it was prior to the pandemic on a normalized basis,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:02:00 2021  ] as you look out over the next couple of years?
Scott Farmer: Hamzah, that’s tough for us to predict. I'm not sure that I'm going to go out and say that we're going to be doing better than we were from a percentage growth standpoint, post-pandemic and [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:02:00 2021  ]than [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:02:00 2021 ]we were pre-pandemic. But as I’ve said, we really like where we're positioned. We've made a lot of investments in the business that we think are beginning to pay off, that allow us to move quicker to be a better supplier to customers. Our customer satisfaction rates that we measure with Net Promoter S[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:03:00 2021 ]s[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:03:00 2021  ]cores are at all-time highs, and [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:03:00 2021 ]. And [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:03:00 2021  ]we have opened up new segments of opportunity for us. We have new products and services that we can offer to more and more businesses. So,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:03:00 2021 ] I'll just answer that by saying, we think we're very well-[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:04:00 2021  ] [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:04:00 2021 ]positioned, and [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:04:00 2021 ]. And [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:04:00 2021  ]we're excited about the future.
Hamzah Mazari: Got it.
Todd Schneider: Hamzah, if I could -- this is Todd. Just to [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:04:00 2021 ]expand upon what Scott’[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:04:00 2021 ]s[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:04:00 2021 ] is [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:04:00 2021  ]saying, the real unknown is what is going to happen with the demand for some of these additional services that we've been able to provide, here's what we know is that demand is going to be higher in the future than it was pre-pandemic. And what's exciting is, many of our customers didn't even realize that we offered[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:50:00 2021 ] those types of products and services in the past. Let me be clear, there's nothing positive that came out of the [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:51:00 2021 ]pandemic, right, but if there is any silver linings, it[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:51:00 2021 ] is the fact that our customers understand more the value that we can provide them, an[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:52:00 2021 ]d[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:52:00 2021 ] as [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:52:00 2021 ]. And [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:52:00 2021  ]Scott mentioned that our NPS scores are reflecting that. And we think that is a -- the more the products and services our customers procure from us, and [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:52:00 2021  ]the more value we're bringing to them, and we think that is very positive. The other item that I think is important to understand is that we're going on 2 years now without having had a price adjustment to our customers. We have felt very passionate that it was not the appropriate time to adjust pricing when people are going through so much difficulties fighting through [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:53:00 2021 ]for [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:53:00 2021  ]the pandemic. And as a result of that,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:53:00 2021 ] -- [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:53:00 2021  ]again,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:53:00 2021  ] our customers had [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:53:00 2021 ]did[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:53:00 2021  ] [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:53:00 2021  ]really appreciated that and truly positioned us well for the future. We look at the lifetime value of a customer and we think it is worth more than a short-term approach, so [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:53:00 2021 ]. So [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:53:00 2021  ]hopefully all that cover [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:53:00 2021  ]co[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:53:00 2021 ]lor [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:53:00 2021 ]helps.
Hamzah Mazari: Yes, that's very helpful. And just my follow-up question and I'll turn it over. Just on the Fire business, I know it's a smaller business for you, but it's a good business. Could you maybe talk about how you're thinking about scaling that business up? And the reason I ask is, we look at the First Aid business and you did ZEE Medical in 2015,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:54:00 2021 ] and that business scaled up. Does Fire have the same potential in your mind,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:54:00 2021 ] and maybe if you could just talk about the competitive dynamic in that business.[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:54:00 2021 ]?[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:54:00 2021  ]
Scott Farmer: Yes. The -- we do think the Fire business has an opportunity to scale up. There are lots and lots and lots of small independent players, there [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:55:00 2021 ]. There [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:55:00 2021  ]are regional players, there are some PE groups that are doing some regional roll-ups[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:55:00 2021 ]rollouts[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:55:00 2021  ]. So,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:55:00 2021 ] there are opportunities for us to make some acquisitions in that business that would help us ramp up scale and geographic coverage. It is a very good business. One of the things that is important to understand is that different states have different licensing requirements for the level of different reps that we have, service technicians that we've had out there performing different levels of service be it [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:55:00 2021 ]via [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:55:00 2021  ]fire extinguisher repair and replacement versus sprinkler systems and alarm systems. They [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:56:00 2021 ],[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:56:00 2021  ] they [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:56:00 2021  ]have different certification levels that they have to have. So,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:56:00 2021 ] it's different than just hiring somebody off of the street,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:56:00 2021 ] and us being able to train them to be a First Aid service rep. These people need to get state certifications and licensing and things like that. But that said, we like our ability to grow in the geographies that we're in. There's a lot of geography that we would like to expand into, and there are lots of opportunities for tuck-in acquisitions in the markets that we're in right now. So,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:56:00 2021 ] we really like that business. And I think over time, we can scale that up to be of size [[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:57:00 2021 ]ph[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:57:00 2021 ]][Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:57:00 2021 ]. I always tell the division presidents, including Fire and First Aid, that their job is to figure out how to get their division to be at least a $1 billion in revenue, and [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:57:00 2021 ]. And [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:57:00 2021  ]that's what they should be thinking about. And that helps us put goals in place and decide what type of resources we want to invest in the different businesses and so forth, bu[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:57:00 2021 ]t [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:57:00 2021 ]. But [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:57:00 2021  ]we clearly think that both First Aid and Fire divisions can be over a $1 billion in revenue for us.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Andrew Wittmann with RW. Baird.
Andrew Wittmann: Great, and thanks for taking my questions. I had one question and then a follow-up. I guess, on the -- the first question here maybe, Mike, over the years Cintas' growth has been fairly consistent in the characteristics that comprises between things like price and stocks and new accounts, even retention from –[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:58:00 2021 ] to [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:58:00 2021 ]some extent. I mean, in normal times, we have a pretty good sense about how that contributes to your year-over-year growth rate. Now that the next few quarters are going to be driven more by a reopening-[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:59:00 2021 ] [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:59:00 2021  ]type growth rate, I was wondering if you talk about which of those factors you think will contribute more than their historical percentage to the growth and maybe less, just [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:59:00 2021 ]. Just [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:59:00 2021  ]to understand how you're thinking about how this matters and it [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:59:00 2021 ]will unfold in the next few months or quarters.
Scott Farmer: Yes, Andrew, it's been a -- it certainly has been a different environment operating in the last four quarters, and one that's been pretty unpredictable. I think what we'll see, what we've guided to in the fourth quarter and likely will get us off to a start in the first quarter of '22,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 09:00:00 2021  ] is the continued reopening of businesses and getting those businesses back to somewhat normalized operations. We were on a nice trajectory of that towards the end of our first quarter of [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 09:00:00 2021 ]this year and into our second quarter that certainly took a pause, but [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 09:00:00 2021 ]. But [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 09:00:00 2021  ]we've got a lot of customers that still are either not opened or at limited capacity. And so, I think as we look at the next couple o[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 09:00:00 2021 ]f [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 09:00:00 2021 ]quarters, maybe even the most of fiscal '22, it's going to be about fully reopening the economy and getting those -- getting our customers and other businesses back to healthy operating environments. That means we'll take businesses off of held [[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 09:01:00 2021 ]ph[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 09:01:00 2021 ]][Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 09:01:00 2021 ]a health [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 09:01:00 2021  ]status in the rental division. We'll start this [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 09:01:00 2021  ]to service First Aid cabinets again at a greater pace. We'll start to understand the needs,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 09:01:00 2021  ] when they open and come off of hold, how can we help them in this new type of environment with all of the things that we've talked about that have been important. So,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 09:02:00 2021 ] I think it's going to be more of that. The reopening of the economy and getting back to some normal type of process than anything else.
Andrew Wittmann: That's helpful. Then just for [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 09:55:00 2021 ]from a [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 09:55:00 2021  ]follow-up, I wanted to just talk about inflation a little bit. There's been obviously a lot talked about and it seems like there's a lot of merit given the amount of stimulus that's going to be hitting the system here. [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 09:55:00 2021 ]It[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 09:56:00 2021 ]’[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 09:56:00 2021 ]s[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 09:56:00 2021 ] -- its [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 09:56:00 2021  ]already hitting the system. So,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 09:56:00 2021 ] I was hoping, Mike, you could talk a little bit about where inflation could hit you, where you might be seeing it today or expect to see it tomorrow. Obvious, areas that [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 09:56:00 2021  ]come to mind like energy and be curious as to your thoughts and [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 09:56:00 2021  ]on [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 09:56:00 2021 ]how that impacts the outlook here for the calendar '21?[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 09:56:00 2021 ].[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 09:56:00 2021  ] But also, maybe even in some of the products that you're selling in the ancillary business and in First Aid, labor, obviously, if you could just address inflation, how you affect [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 09:57:00 2021  ]-- how you expect it [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 09:57:00 2021 ]to affect you and your ability to recover it in pricing against a [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 09:57:00 2021  ]recovering, but still not full bore macro. Thanks.
Mike Hansen: Yes. So,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 09:57:00 2021 ] from a -- I'll say a short-term, we could certainly see changes in gas prices at the pump. We saw sequentially an increase in our energy percentage of about 10 basis points, and that certainly could contribute over the course of the next year. I think labor is certainly in the news and the conversations about wage rates is likely to have some impact on us as well as our customers. We could see, as you mentioned, certainly in some of the PPE, we have seen quite dramatic changes in prices, in costs to us in terms of gloves and masks and sanitizer over the course of the last year, and [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 09:58:00 2021 ]. And [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 09:58:00 2021  ]there's probably a little bit of that continued unpredictability in that kind of product. But, Andrew, the [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 09:58:00 2021  ]really good news and [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 09:58:00 2021  ]in [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 09:58:00 2021 ]all of that is we've got great efficiency in our business. And so, many times we're able to offset that with current initiatives that we have within the business. But if we can't, we certainly can look to pricing changes into the future. Todd mentioned, we have not liked that idea. In the last year, we did not think it's the right thing to do. But[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 09:59:00 2021  ], and it's been 2 years really since we've done it. But if we see inflation peak, that's an opportunity that we will certainly have to consider. And usually in the past, that's allowed us to pass on a good portion of those kind of costs,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:20:00 2021  ] if we can't offset them within our operations.
Todd Schneider: Andrew, it's Todd. Just to build upon that, everything Mike said is right on target. We're in a good position to withstand those adjustments based upon our model, our efficiencies that we can bring to market. But with all these, whether it's inflation in general,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:20:00 2021  ] or wage inflation specifically, our biggest concern is always the impact to our customers. We will manage our business, we will do it so appropriately. But if it affects our customer base, then that's a much greater concern. And we're hoping that the health of those smaller businesses has been tested, and [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:21:00 2021 ]. And [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:21:00 2021  ]we're in hopes that they can continue to expand and thrive in the new environment.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley.
Toni Kaplan: Thank you. Just wanted to ask about the SAP benefits that you are seeing just now that the integration within Rental has been completed. I know we're sort of in an[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:22:00 2021 ] unique period, but just wanted to see if any of those are coming through now or for [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:22:00 2021  ]we should be expecting it going forward,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:22:00 2021  ] just anecdotally any benefits from the SAP program. Thanks.
Todd Schneider: Yes. Toni, this is Todd. We are seeing very nice efficiencies from having beyond for the most part one platform for the entire organization benefiting our customers in one view of Cintas. It's benefiting our locations in [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:22:00 2021  ]and[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:22:00 2021 ] [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:22:00 2021 ]the ability to share inventory, our distribution centers in order to be able to anticipate needs. It's been quite impactful and a lot of positive things that have come out of having that one platform and the efficiencies that come along with it both for the customer, but also internally have been very encouraging.
Toni Kaplan: Great. I wanted to also ask about capital allocation. If we hit a period now where demand accelerates, do [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:23:00 2021 ]you expect to be investing more back into the business for organic growth opportunities or M&A, and [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:23:00 2021 ]. And [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:23:00 2021  ]I saw you’re buying back some stock in the quarter. So,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:23:00 2021 ] does that get back to historical levels, just [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:23:00 2021 ]? Just [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:23:00 2021  ]what are you thinking about allocating capital?
Scott Farmer: Well, if we start with CapEx, we're still sort of managing through the unpredictability of the economy. So,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:24:00 2021 ] we're probably a little more conservative right now and will be in the fourth quarter. But over time, I think our CapEx spend as the economy turns around and [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:24:00 2021  ]will [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:24:00 2021 ]get back to a more normalized historical type,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:24:00 2021 ] and that's typically roughly 60% based on growth and 40% on maintenance. So,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:24:00 2021 ] I think we'll continue to see that type of spend. We do generate a lot of cash. We've got a very strong balance sheet. And so,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:24:00 2021 ] we would be interested in acquisitions in all of our businesses. And then,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:25:00 2021  ] obviously, the dividend is important to our shareholders. We have continued to be in a position where we could increase the dividend to our shareholders every year since we went public, and obviously that is a streak that we'd like to see continue. And then, yes, finally, we do have roughly a [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:26:00 2021  ]$1 billion left on our authorization, and [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:26:00 2021 ]. And [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:26:00 2021  ]that is more sort of opportunistic from time-to-time as we see opportunities to acquire our own stock. And so, should we be in a position where we're building cash and we think the opportunity is right, I think that the Board would agree that we would be in a [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:26:00 2021 ]position to buy back some of our stock. You [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:26:00 2021  ]W[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:26:00 2021 ]e [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:26:00 2021 ]saw a little bit of that in the third quarter,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:26:00 2021  ] when the stock price went down. And so, it -- I think that I wouldn't be surprised to see that sort of thing in the future.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Gary Bisbee with Bank of America.
Gary Bisbee: Hey, guys, good morning. It's impressive to get back to flat year-over-year same day sales, I guess, a quarter really before lapping the step down from the pandemic. I wanted to ask about mix within that sale. So, can you give us a sense of how meaningful PP&E sanitizers and other pandemic driven sales are to the current revenue levels? And so,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:27:00 2021 ] how much the more normal historical mix would still be down, right in Q3 without that? That's the first question.
Scott Farmer: Well, let me start by saying that things like the hand sanitizer and some of the sanitation products and wipes that we have fit into a recurring revenue stream,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:28:00 2021  ] once we put this like the restroom supplies, once we put the stand out there,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:28:00 2021 ] we come in [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:28:00 2021  ]an[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:28:00 2021 ]d[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:28:00 2021 ] [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:28:00 2021 ]service and [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:28:00 2021  ]it [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:28:00 2021 ]on a regular basis, make sure they have enough product in there to make it through till their next delivery and so forth. So that is -- that becomes part of the recurring revenue stream. The other products, things like disposable gloves, disposable face masks,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:29:00 2021 ] and things like that are the one-time PPE sale, I[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:29:00 2021 ] refer to it as one time, but it's more of a direct sale that it can fluctuate up and down depending on customer needs. But we have -- a lot of it depends on geography, it depends on the industry that the customer is in, some distribution-[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:29:00 2021 ] [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:29:00 2021  ]type businesses they've increased headcount, increased number of wares, we -- other businesses have reduced the number of wares. So,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:29:00 2021 ] it's a little bit all over the board trying to put some parameter on that relative to historical average.[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:30:00 2021 ],[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:30:00 2021  ] I'd say recurring revenue with the understanding that some of that is now the result of hand sanitizer and that's where it is flat through the quarter. And we think that that revenue is going to pick up as the economy turns around, as our customers get back to being able to open their businesses more fully,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:30:00 2021 ] bring back some of their headcount, and [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:30:00 2021 ]. And [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:30:00 2021  ]I believe that an awful lot of the recurring business,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:31:00 2021 ] like hand sanitizer is here to stay. I have said in the past,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:31:00 2021 ] and I continue to believe that it's going to be a long time before a typical American walks into a business, walks into a restaurant, a lobby, a movie theate[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:31:00 2021 ]re[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:31:00 2021  ], any place and he isn't looking for a hand sanitizer station after they grabbed the doorknob going in and out of a public building. We're seeing that in stadiums, we're seeing that at -- in hotels that are open, at elevator stations, and that sort of thing[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:32:00 2021 ].[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:32:00 2021 ]that's where[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:32:00 2021  ] I think that's going to be here to stay. So,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:32:00 2021 ] if I'm right about that, as they bring back and open up their operations more fully, that will be revenue,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:32:00 2021  ] as they add people back on revenue on top of where they are right now.
Todd Schneider: Gary, this is Todd. I think it's important to understand also the vast majority of the products and services we're speaking of, whether it's face shields, gloves, hand sanitizer, cleaning chemicals, all those, we have been offering those for decades. It's not new, right, it's just -- it's elevated. And we think it will be -- it will maybe not be at the current levels[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:33:00 2021  ], but [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:33:00 2021 ]. But [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:33:00 2021  ]it will remain elevated into the near and maybe distant future,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:33:00 2021  ] or in the near future certainly,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:33:00 2021  ] and maybe even [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:33:00 2021 ]much further out than that. So that's exciting for us. We see that -- again, our customers now see that much more of a value in it, in large part because people are much more focused on hygiene and cleanliness than they were in the past. And many of our customers, they cleaned for image, and [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:34:00 2021 ]. And [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:34:00 2021  ]now they are cleaning for help[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:34:00 2021  ]health[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:34:00 2021 ]. And that's very much a positive we think for society, but also makes our value proposition that much stronger to our customers. So,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:34:00 2021 ] some very positives coming out[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:34:00 2021  ]up[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:34:00 2021 ].
Gary Bisbee: And if I could just clarify one thing in that response. Scott, you said recurring revenues were flat. Did you mean sequentially versus Q2 or did you mean year-over-year? And if the latter, flat year-over-year, does that imply then that the one-time-ish PP&E sales increase year-over-year was similar to the Uniform Direct sales decrease, which would allow that to be flat? I just want to make sure I understood[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:37:00 2021 ]understand[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:37:00 2021  ] exactly what you're saying.
Scott Farmer: I meant sequentially from the second quarter.
Gary Bisbee: Got it? Okay. All right. I mean, what I'm trying to solve for is, how much the traditional businesses are down. I appreciate everything you're saying about this demand persists in the big uptick [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:38:00 2021 ]uptake and [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:38:00 2021  ]in sustainable recurring sanitizer sales, but [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:38:00 2021 ]. But [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:38:00 2021  ]in the traditional pre-pandemic business mix, I mean, is that still down 5% and it's offset by PP&E up 5% or directionally, can you help us understand it? What I'm really trying to solve[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:39:00 2021 ] [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:39:00 2021 ][[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:38:00 2021 ]ph[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:38:00 2021 ]][Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:38:00 2021 ]solve [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:38:00 2021  ]for is what's at risk of going away over 12 months, 18 months, as the traditional business mix obviously comes roaring back.
Scott Farmer: Well, Gary, I think the -- probably the best way to describe it is, as we mentioned, in total for the company, it was up $45 million sequentially. We don't think that will repeat, but [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:39:00 2021 ]. But [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:39:00 2021  ]we do believe that these elevated levels, relatively elevated levels are here to stay.
Mike Hansen: Yes, and Gary,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:39:00 2021 ] the -- to answer what's at risk, we're -- it's really premature. Scott talked a little bit about the enhanced value proposition of all of these things. And while we may see,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:40:00 2021 ] we have seen some ups and downs in terms of that product mix in the last three quarters. We don't expect that to go away overnight. This is not going to be a flip of the switch and the pandemic is over. And so,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:40:00 2021 ] we -- it's hard to say how much of this will continue in the future. Will the frequency of sanitizer spray services stay the same frequency as today? Will this [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:41:00 2021  ]the frequency of our ultra clean services stay the same as today? It's hard to tell. But what we fully expect is that this cleanliness idea and value is going to stick around for a while. And so, so [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:41:00 2021  ]trying to dissect the results by product category and other things, we're not going to get into that,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:42:00 2021  ] because it's too early to tell exactly what that future run rate is going to look like.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Kevin McVeigh with Credit Suisse.
Kevin McVeigh: Great, thanks. I know you talked to kind of [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:42:00 2021 ]the severe weather holiday impact. Is there any way to think about how much the weather under [[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:42:00 2021 ]ph[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:42:00 2021 ]] [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:42:00 2021 ]the holiday and then the spike in COVID impacted the quarter? And I know it kind of varies across business lines, but [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:42:00 2021 ]. But [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:42:00 2021  ]just any thoughts as to how that impacted the quarter?
Scott Farmer: Well, I guess, the easiest way to look at it would be that there was a dip from early December into January, and then revenue started to rebound as we got into February. February was better than January. And obviously, if you look at all that,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:58:00 2021 ] the quarter winds up being flat sequentially to the second quarter. So,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:58:00 2021 ] you can run that down and then dip back up. I would tell you that we do have some momentum as we go into the fourth quarter. And so,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:59:00 2021 ] we’re -- we have a better expectation of economic conditions and [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:59:00 2021  ]in our business as we get into and through the fourth quarter.
Kevin McVeigh: Got it. And then just is there any way to think about kind of across your client base, what percentage maybe you [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:59:00 2021  ]are engaged right now, or [[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:59:00 2021 ]indiscernible[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:59:00 2021 ]][Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:59:00 2021 ] [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:59:00 2021 ]not using [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:59:00 2021  ]product or [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:00:00 2021  ]service versus where it was last quarter and where that's been historically. I know there's probably seasonality there, but I guess just trying to get a sense of how many clients maybe aren't fully active right now, but you expect to start coming back as the economy starts to reopen.
Scott Farmer: So, Kevin, I think your question was what percent of our customers are on hold? So,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:00:00 2021 ] we have, we had a -- as Mike mentioned, I believe,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:01:00 2021  ] a strong run up in the summer and into the fall, [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:01:00 2021 ]some never came back, some of them went on hold. So,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:01:00 2021 ] it's a little difficult to give me [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:01:00 2021  ]you [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:01:00 2021 ]an exact number on that. But I can tell you th[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:01:00 2021  ]at[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:01:00 2021  ] [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:01:00 2021  ]t[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:01:00 2021 ]his, [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:01:00 2021 ]we're anxious for those folks to get back. We think that there is an incredible amount of pent up demand that is in the marketplace, you had that with stimulus checks, and [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:02:00 2021 ]. And [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:02:00 2021  ]we think consumer spending could spike quite strongly in the Q3, Q4 calendar years -- of the calendar year. And we think that'll be really positive. If you put that together with the strong value proposition that we have increasingly, the strong value proposition that we have with our customers, meaning that when they come back, they still have to provide confidence to their employees and their customers, their clients, that they're coming back to a safe environment. And so,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:03:00 2021 ] we think all that combined is going to make for a [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:03:00 2021  ]quite a good situation.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer.
Scott Schneeberger: Thanks very much. Good morning. Somewhat following up on that last question from Kevin. On [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:03:00 2021 ],[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:03:00 2021  ] [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:03:00 2021  ]specifically in [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:03:00 2021  ]your airline cruise line hospitality, the travel segment, can you put any quantification on how much those are down,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:03:00 2021 ] and more importantly,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:03:00 2021  ] maybe just a feel for if you've seen any improvement on those metrics since the trough or [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:04:00 2021 ]? Or [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:04:00 2021  ]if we're still there? And then I will take away from the answer that [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:04:00 2021  ]to [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:04:00 2021 ]last question that, that[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:04:00 2021 ] is one of the categories that you think in the back half of this calendar year could significantly open up.
Scott Farmer: To begin with, most of those -- [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:04:00 2021 ]the revenue from those customers is in our direct sale business,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:04:00 2021 ] [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:04:00 2021 ]a[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:04:00 2021 ]nd [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:04:00 2021 ]. And [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:04:00 2021  ]that business is down about 40% over prior year, and [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:04:00 2021 ]. [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:04:00 2021  ]An[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:04:00 2021  ]d [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:04:00 2021  ]as you analyze that, it's a little different depending on which segment you're talking about. For example, a lot of cruise ships are still at port, so the cruise line business has really been affected. There is some travel happening now,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:05:00 2021 ] particularly sort of vacation travel. So,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:05:00 2021 ] the hotels are doing a little bit better, the airlines are starting to pick up. When I say that, I mean they are [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:05:00 2021 ]their [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:05:00 2021  ]revenue streams to -- within their own business. We had seen a little bit of improvement from our revenue to those customers. And -- but still down 40% is a [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:06:00 2021 ]pretty significant number, and [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:06:00 2021 ]. And [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:06:00 2021  ]I think that the [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:06:00 2021  ]those businesses will have some form of recovery as the vaccines continue to roll out and people begin to feel safer travell[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:06:00 2021  ]ing. I haven't been to the vacation spots in Florida, but I understand that the spring break crowd is maybe not as big as normal, but they're down there right now. So,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:06:00 2021 ] I think there was a -- as Todd said, a pent up demand for people to be able to go and do things again, vacation again, go get on an [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:07:00 2021 ]airplane and go visit family in a different state across the country, that sort of thing. And I think that the big, the big[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:07:00 2021 ] trigger for all that and when that all happens is how soon a good portion of the U.S population has a vaccine. How long would [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:07:00 2021  ]will [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:07:00 2021 ]it take to get back to pre-COVID? That I don't know, it[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:07:00 2021 ] might take a couple of years, but [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:07:00 2021 ]. But [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:07:00 2021  ]I definitely could see that there would be some improvement in the second half of the year if the pace of vaccines continues at the rate that it is right now.
Scott Schneeberger: Thanks for that, Scott. My follow-[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:08:00 2021  ] [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:08:00 2021 ]up is, you mentioned earlier it's been 2 [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:08:00 2021  ]two [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:08:00 2021 ]years since any change in pricing as a customer appreciation type strategy. I'm curious, as we move into the next fiscal year, what is -- might we see that start to happen? Would it be only in specific areas that are seemingly overdue and necessary to cover inflation or [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:08:00 2021 ]? Or [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:08:00 2021  ]is that a strategy you'll continue to maintain? What would it take, I guess, is a question for you to start to get a little bit assertive with pricing. Thanks.
Scott Farmer: Scott, thanks for that question. First of all, it's important that you understand that it's not so much that we do it as a [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:09:00 2021  ]sort of a favor to the customer, but [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:09:00 2021 ]. But [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:09:00 2021  ]from our perspective, we want our customers to survive this pandemic,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:09:00 2021 ] and we were doing all kinds of things to help them out in that regard. They needed to add things,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:10:00 2021  ] depending on the customer-by-customer basis. But a small business might need to add hand sanitizers and masks and gloves and things from us, but they can't afford all of that. So,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:10:00 2021 ] we help them with adjustments on their invoices. Maybe their entrance mats[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:10:00 2021 ]match[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:10:00 2021  ] [ph[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:10:00 2021  ]] went from a weekly service to a biweekly or monthly service at a lower rate to help them afford what was happening. And it's [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:10:00 2021  ]to us, it's the relationship that we have with the[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:10:00 2021 ]a[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:10:00 2021  ] customer. We believe, we enhanced[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:11:00 2021 ] their image of us and their opinion of what type of a provider we are during these types[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:11:00 2021 ] of unfortunate situations. It was similar in the great recession. We had the experience of doing things then as well,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:11:00 2021 ] and the lifetime value of customers[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:11:00 2021 ]'s[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:11:00 2021  ] we come out of this is significant. They like us, they're willing to -- if they trust us, they're more willing to hear what we have to offer them when we develop new products and services. They're more willing to try those new products and services because of the relationship that we have with them and so forth,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:12:00 2021  ] and are less likely we think to listen to a competitor's offer, and [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:12:00 2021 ]. And [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:12:00 2021  ]that all goes into what we would use to [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:12:00 2021  ]and [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:12:00 2021 ]make our general calculations about the lifetime value of that customer. So, from a price standpoint, yes, we're coming [[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:12:00 2021 ]ind[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:12:00 2021 ]iscernibl[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:12:00 2021 ]e[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:12:00 2021 ]][Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:12:00 2021 ]up on[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:12:00 2021  ] 2 years since we last increased, generally speaking last increased our prices on our recurring revenue,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:13:00 2021 ] and that's particularly in the Rental division where that's probably a stronger statement and more relative to the Rental division than others. But we have seen competitors’[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:13:00 2021 ] typical environment, pricing environment in our business,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:13:00 2021 ] and is that when they're trying to take our business, they offer ridiculously low prices to try to get our customers’[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:14:00 2021 ] attention. But the way they treat their customers is that they're willing to raise prices to help protect their -- our competitors bottom line as opposed to help protect the customer. We've seen that in various places in the competitive environment in the last couple of years. We will look at it in the future on a customer-by-customer basis, what type of products and services they need. We -- if we are seeing price increases across the board, we'll have to -- in our own supply chain, we'll have to figure out the right way to pass some of those costs on to our customers. But the fact that we haven't done it in the last couple of years puts us in a pretty darn good position when we sit down to talk to him [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:15:00 2021  ]them[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:15:00 2021 ] [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:15:00 2021 ]about the fact that it's time for us to have some price adjustments. And generally speaking, I think that those conversations are going to go well. Will that happen in the near future? That I can't tell you. I won't -- I can't tell you yet. A lot of it depends on how economic conditions continue to recover. At[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:15:00 2021 ] at [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:15:00 2021  ]the pace that we're on right now,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:15:00 2021 ].[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:15:00 2021  ] I would assume that between that the potential for energy prices to increase, the potential for inflation to increase, we're eventually going to have to adjust our prices and that will [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:16:00 2021 ]that'll [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:16:00 2021  ]happen. When? I'm not ready to predict.
Operator: Thank you. This concludes today's Q&A. I would now like to turn the call back over to Paul Adler for closing remarks.
Paul Adler: Thank you, Katie, and thank you everyone for joining us this morning. We will issue our fourth quarter of fiscal '21 financial results in July. We look forward to speaking with you again at that time. Good day.
Operator: Thank you. This concludes today's teleconference. You may now disconnect.

===== 2021 Q2  (2020-12-22 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, everyone and welcome to the Cintas Quarterly Earnings Results Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Paul Adler, Vice President, Treasurer and Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
Paul Adler: Thank you, and thank you everyone for joining us. With me today is Scott Farmer, Cintas Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer; Todd Schneider, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer; and Mike Hansen, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We will discuss our second quarter results for fiscal 2021. After our commentary, we will be happy to answer questions. The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a Safe Harbor from civil litigation for forward-looking statements. This conference call contains forward-looking statements that reflect the company's current views as to future events and financial performance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those we may discuss. I refer you to the discussion on these points contained in our most recent filings with the SEC. I'll now turn the call over to Scott Farmer.
Scott Farmer: Thank you, Paul and good morning, everyone. The COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic remains a significant disruption to the economy. In the final month of our fiscal second quarter, November, the COVID-19 virus counts surged from about 100,000 per day at the beginning of the month to about 250,000 per day now. Not surprisingly economic indicators such as jobs growth, unemployment, and retail spending reflect an economic recovery that slowed considerably as the fall months progressed and the virus counts increased. Despite the macroeconomic headwinds, I’m pleased with our second quarter financial performance, which exceeded expectations. Our employees, whom we call partners have not wavered in their passion for getting businesses ready for the workday. They're providing essential products and services to help keep our customers and their places of business clean and safe. These include hand sanitizer services, professionally laundered healthcare scrubs and isolation gowns, first aid products, sanitizing wipes, face masks, gloves, and fire protection services as well as many others. The conversion of no programmers, the do-it-yourselfers, if you will, remains robust. Our supply chain and service network enable us to increase service to existing customers and add new customers by procuring and providing items in short supply. And our Net Promoter Score, which we use to measure customer satisfaction has risen dramatically to an all-time high. We find ourselves today, however, at a time of increasing uncertainty. A number of states and municipalities have reinstituted temporary economic restrictions in response to rising COVID-19 cases. Others are considering them. On the other hand, vaccines are being distributed and the U.S. government continues to discuss additional economic stimulus. The uncertainty of the resolutions of these impactful events makes providing near-term guidance very difficult. Therefore, we're not providing financial guidance at this time. However, if we're able to gain clarity before the end of the quarter, we'll provide an update in advance of our third quarter earnings release. That said, there is much that does remain certain. Our employee partners reflect the steadfast Cintas culture. They're always striving to exceed the expectations of our customers to maximize the long-term value of Cintas for its shareholders, employee partners, and other stakeholders. The result is consistently strong financial performance with Cintas growing revenue and EPS 49 of the past 51 years. I remain certain of our value proposition of getting businesses ready for the workday by providing essential unparalleled image, safety, cleanliness, and compliance. It is never resonated more than it does today. I remain certain of our addressable market, namely the millions upon millions of businesses that are not currently Cintas customers, many of whom are not in a program with recurring service but could benefit from at least one Cintas product or service, and I'm certain that Cintas is well positioned for years to come. Now I'll turn it over to Mike for commentary on the financial results of the quarter. Mike?
Mike Hansen: Thank you, Scott, and good morning. Our fiscal 2021 second quarter revenue was $1.76 billion compared to $1.84 billion in last year’s second quarter. Earnings per diluted share from continuing operations or EPS were $2.62, an increase of 15.4% from last year’s second quarter. Organic revenue adjusted for acquisitions, divestitures, and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations declined 4.4% for the second quarter of fiscal '21. Organic revenue for the Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segment declined 3.6%. Organic revenue for the First Aid and Safety Services operating segment increased 14.5%. Gross margin for the second quarter of fiscal '21 was $819.9 million compared to $852.4 million in last year’s second quarter. Gross margin as a percentage of revenue increased 50 basis points to 46.7% for the second quarter of fiscal '21 compared to 46.2% in the second quarter of fiscal '20. Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue were 26.6% in the second quarter of fiscal '21 and 28.1% last year. Fiscal '21 second quarter results benefited from lower discretionary spending and increased sales rep productivity. Operating income for the second quarter of fiscal '21 of $352.9 million increased 5.5%. Operating margin was 20.1% in the second quarter of fiscal '21 compared to 18.1% in the second quarter of fiscal '20. Our effective tax rate on continuing operations for the second quarter of fiscal '21 was 13.3% compared to 20.1% last year. Tax rate can move from period to period based on discrete events, including the amount of stock compensation expense. Net income from continuing operations for the second quarter of fiscal '21 was $284.9 million, an increase of 15.7%. EPS was $2.62, an increase of 15.4% from last year’s second quarter. In the second quarter of fiscal '21, certain Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating assets were sold. The pre-tax gain on sale of $18 million was recorded in the selling and administrative expenses and impacted operating margin by 100 basis points. The pre-tax gain and related tax benefit impacted EPS by $0.25. Our balance sheet and cash flow remained strong. Our leverage calculation for our credit facility definition was 1.6x debt to EBITDA. We have an untapped credit facility of $1 billion. For financial modeling purposes, please note that there is one more workday in our fiscal '21 than in our fiscal 20. One more day will benefit fiscal '21 total revenue growth by 40 basis points. One more workday also benefits operating margin and EPS. Fiscal '21 operating margin will be about 12.5 basis points better in comparison to fiscal '20 due to one more day of revenue. In fiscal '20, each quarter contains 65 workdays. In fiscal '21, workdays by quarter are 66 in Q1, 65 in Q2, 64 in Q3, and 66 in Q4. Please keep these differences in mind when modeling on a year-over-year and sequential basis. I'll now turn the call over to Todd Schneider to discuss the performance of each of our businesses.
Todd Schneider: Thank you, Mike. As Scott stated, COVID-19 remains a significant disruption to the economy. Every business in the U.S and Canada has been impacted. Many of our customers that have remained open are not yet operating at the same level of business as before the pandemic started because of the virus has negative impact on health and the economy. Our employee partners continue to work with urgency to offset these headwinds. Over the past couple of quarters, we've provided some examples of their interactions with both new and existing customers to give a better understanding. Many of those examples highlighted customers in the industries of healthcare, education, and state and local government and products and services including scrubs, hand sanitizer service and masks. For the second quarter of the fiscal year, the amount of Uniform Rental and Facility Services new business sold to healthcare, education, and government customers is double the amount in the prior-year period. And the amount of First Aid, Fire, and Other new business sold to customers in healthcare, education, and government is 6x the amount sold in the same period last year. Some of this new business is reoccurring and some may not repeat. Nevertheless, the results are really impressive. Also, the number of scrub dispensing machines installed in our first two quarters doubled last year's number, and since the virus appeared, our employee partners that provided businesses with over 350,000 hand sanitizer dispensers and over 125 million masks. I’m truly in awe of the accomplishments of our team in this challenging time. And I'm excited about the opportunities for Cintas post pandemic which seems to be finally appearing on the horizon. With that, I'll turn now to the second quarter financial performance of our businesses. Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segment includes the rental and servicing of uniforms, health care spreads, mats, and towels in the provision of restroom supplies and other facility products and services. The segment also includes the sale of items from our catalogs to our customers on route. Uniform Rental and Facility Services revenue was $1.41 billion compared to $1.47 billion last year. Our Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment gross margin was 47.5% for the second quarter, compared to 46.6% in last year's second quarter. Higher inventory amortization expense of 80 basis points was more than offset by the benefits of lower production and service expense as a percent of revenue. Our First Aid and Safety Services operating segment includes revenue from the sale and servicing of first aid products, safety products, personal protective equipment and training. This segment's revenue for the second quarter was $194.4 million compared to $169.7 million last year. The First Aid segment gross margin was 43.0% in the second quarter, compared to 48.4% in last year's second quarter. Lower production and service expenses as a percent of revenue compared to last year's second quarter were more than offset by higher cost of goods sold from the increased proportion of revenue from personal protective equipment, such as masks, and gloves. Our Fire Protection Services and Uniform Direct Sales businesses are reported in the all other category. Our Fire business historically grows each year at a strong pace. The Uniform Direct Sale business growth rates are generally low single digits, and are subject to volatility such as when we install a multimillion dollar account. Uniform Direct sale, however, is a key business for us and its customers are often significant opportunities to cross sell and provide products and services from our other business units. All other revenue was $152.1 million compared to $204.1 million last year. The Fire business organic revenue declined 3.3% due to the inability to access some businesses because of closures. The Uniform Direct Sale business organic revenue declined 51.2%. Revenue from our airline, cruise line, hospitality and gaming customers largely falls within this segment. These industries continue to be among the hardest hit by the pandemic. That concludes our prepared remarks. We're happy to answer your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Andrew Steinerman with J.P. Morgan.
Andrew Steinerman: Good morning, everyone. Could you give us a sense about the month of November in terms of organic revenue trends for rental, and if you can make a comment into the month of December that would be great.
Scott Farmer: Hi, Andrew, this is Scott. Yes, we can give you a little bit more color on that. Through the quarter, we continue to see an improving revenue trend for the month of November, and the Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment, the rental organic growth was minus 1%. First Aid and Safety for the month of November organic growth was 14%, and Fire continued to improve through the quarter, and it ended November with the month of November down 1%. And it's important to note that about mid November, we did see the impact of some of the state's restrictions on businesses. It -- I would say it affected the trend, but it hadn't turned it worse than it had been at that point. So, it's a little unpredictable on where it goes. But as you can see through the month of November, we continued on a positive trend. I think second quarter revenue sequentially grew about 2.7% over first quarter.
Andrew Steinerman: Could you make a comment about December?
Scott Farmer: I would say through the first couple of weeks, we were running around where we were in November.
Andrew Steinerman: Great. Okay. Thanks, Scott.
Scott Farmer: Yes.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Seth Weber with RBC Capital Markets.
Seth Weber: Hey guys, good morning. I had a couple of questions on the margins. I think, I'm just trying to handicap where we're at with expenses coming back online. I think, Mike, I think last quarter you talked about there's about 100 bps, 100 basis points of lower discretionary. Has any of the -- have any of those costs started to come back here in the second quarter, and how should we think about that, kind of through the rest of the year? Thanks.
Mike Hansen: Yes, we continue to manage those costs pretty tightly given the environment that we're in. The difference between last year's travel and meetings, which I call out is a 100 basis points in Q1 was about 40 basis points in Q2. Now Q1, we normally travel more as we start our fiscal year, but it was still about a 40-basis-point benefit. And we'll continue to monitor the situation. Certainly, I know that our operational people are itching to get out and see our locations and our customers but given the levels of cases -- COVID cases and the environment, we're going to remain pretty tight on those.
Seth Weber: Okay. Can you just talk about -- have you seen any relief on the cost side on the First Aid and Safety category? I know there have been some cost pressures there. Have that -- has that kind of loosened up here a little bit with more as weather supplies has gotten a little looser or just easier to get? Just any comments on the First Aid and Safety expense cost side?
Todd Schneider: Seth, this is Todd. Regarding the First Aid business, certainly there are some PPE type items that are still very challenging to get. We are -- we've been blessed to be in a good inventory position to help our customers out with those items, but PPE is in short supply. It had some impact on cost to us in those cases. But again, we've looked at it with a long lens, and we've invested appropriately, and our customers really appreciate the fact that we've been able to provide products and services, such as PPE and other items to help them get through this challenging time.
Mike Hansen: We do like, Seth, the sequential improvement of gross margin of just about 40% in Q1 to 43% in Q2, and so we're -- we did see some nice performance in our First Aid cabinets in the quarter. And as we talked about at the -- in September, that mix of PPE obviously came down a bit with the growth moving from -- in that segment from over 20% in Q4 to 17% to 14.5% here in Q2. So, we're starting to see some of those PPEs turn into the maintenance mode that we've talked about in the last couple quarters, and that mix change as well as the improving First Aid cabinet has helped that gross margin, and we will -- when we get to a more normalized environment, we certainly believe that those First Aid gross margins are going to trend back towards where we had been pre-COVID. There's nothing structural or no change in the business that would lead us to believe otherwise.
Operator: We will take our next question from George Tong with Goldman Sachs.
George Tong: Hi, thanks. Good morning. You mentioned that in the first several weeks of December, Uniform Rental trends are running around where you were back in November. Can you discuss changes you've seen, if any, around new business and retention trends over the past several weeks?
Scott Farmer: Yes. Our new business numbers continue to perform very well. They -- we still believe that the value proposition that we have is important in this current environment, and so we're continuing to attract new customers. We have seen -- we haven't seen a change in lost business rates at this point. We have seen because of government restrictions, some customers going back on a fold, meaning they're temporarily closing the business until the restrictions are lifted. And that would be the change that we've seen since about mid-November in the economy. Those restrictions are various states and cities, it's California, it's Illinois, it's New York, other states, Washington, Oregon, and even up in Toronto. So, these are the places that we see those type of restrictions that are impacting our customers, but from a lost business standpoint, we haven't seen a real change in lost business rates.
George Tong: Got it. That’s helpful. And then, can you talk a little bit about how much growth you're seeing from the non-programmer market versus your existing customers, and how much health care as a vertical is contributing to growth directly?
Scott Farmer: Sure. The no programmer market for us -- we've tracked it for many years, it's between 60% and 65% of our new business customers. It remains in that range today. And as I said, in my opening remarks, there are millions of businesses out there that do not have a program that we can offer them. And so we like our position and our ability to convert them. Even within the health care space, there are -- if you define a no programmer as somebody who doesn't have a rental program, most of the scrubs that you see in hospitals are direct sale type scrubs, some of them bought by individual health care workers, some by the hospital for departments and things like that. But converting them to a rental program, we would call a conversion of a no programmer. The other area that we're seeing in health care that's doing really well are isolation gowns. Those are traditionally direct sale disposable gowns. And we have a rentable alternative that actually saves the hospitals and health care providers money to convert from a direct sale program to a rental program. So we're seeing a lot of success in that as well. And that would be what we would consider a no programmer conversion within health care.
Todd Schneider: George, it's Todd. Just to build off a couple of items that Scott mentioned. Our no programmer as a business as a percent of our total, is -- it remains quite consistent. What is changing is, it is allowing us to get audiences to folks customers, prospects that we haven't had in the past in many cases, because of the access we have to critical products and services that they need to provide to their business and within their business to either their customers or to their employees, both so that they can have confidence to come to work and for people to come into their business. Scott spoke about some of the -- in the medical area have been very successful, the isolation gowns, hand sanitizer, sanitizer wipes, disinfectant wipes, scrubs are all -- are -- it's in great demand. Scott mentioned that the isolation gowns were -- that was virtually almost the entire market was a direct purchase, market purchase disposable market, probably the best way to describe it. And what we've done with isolation gowns has been very attractive to our prospects and our customers. It's a green service, right? We're not just throwing in the trash, we're reusing it. It save them significant money. The availability of them, instead of folks struggling to get isolation gowns and being panicked over trying to take care of their patients. What we -- the garments that we’re providing are more comfortable than what they've been wearing in the past. And then lastly, we brought some technology to that business so that we can track exactly how many times those garments have been processed. So we can meet the specifications that are detailed out for such a product. So that's been a big win and a lot of health care customers are very, very interested in that. And we mentioned in our previous earnings release that the demand for scrubs has been up very nicely. People are uncomfortable in many cases wearing those home, washing those at home, and whom they come in contact with on the way home makes people little uncomfortable. So all that has been quite good demand. In those cases we consider those no programmers we might be doing some business with those, those health care organizations, but we're expanding that relationship dramatically.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Hamzah Mazari with Jefferies.
Mario Cortellacci: Hi. This is Mario Cortellacci filling in for Hamzah. Appreciate the time. Just -- on touching on the flowing in November and the continuation into December, could you maybe just give us a level deeper in terms of what you're seeing on your end market? I'd imagine it's probably similar to what we saw earlier in the year, excuse me, with the high risk industries being hit a little harder. But is that more or less what you're seeing? Or could you give us some of the puts and takes on some of your end market exposure?
Scott Farmer: Yes. Sure. It boils down to certain industry segments, or geographies. And the segments that you can imagine, the travel, hotels, cruise lines, even in certain areas, restaurants, movie theatres, that type of thing are being hit the hardest, because of these restrictions and people's [technical difficulty] natural fear to go and congregate in a place like a movie theatre. The geographies depend on what type of or if there are any restrictions in place. And what we’ve seen so far is, as we got through the end of November, it's an increase in the number of states and municipalities that have put restrictions in place. We don't know whether that trend is going to continue through the holidays. And just as an example, Governor Newsom in California, put the restrictions in place, they're pretty tight, but he says that they will extend to January the 4th. The question that we have there is, will he extend that further? Which has been his tendency, or will it actually be January the 4th when he starts to loosen those restrictions. So those states are the -- and municipalities are the areas where we've seen the change since about mid-November. And my perspective is that we are in a temporary low, we don't think it's going to be anywhere near what it was in our fourth quarter last year. Quite honestly, at that point, nobody, including governors and people running businesses, at any idea how bad it was going to be, how deep it was going to go and so forth. But now that we've got 8 or 9 months worth of experience in dealing with it, and the fact that we have vaccines beginning to roll out right now, there's light at the end of the tunnel, this is a temporary period of time that we're going to go through. And so, that I hope provides a little color to you. I'm happy to get more specific in any area, if you have any question.
Mario Cortellacci: No, that was helpful. And then going back to health care for a second, just I guess, could you give us a sense of what the competitive landscape looked like there? So I think reasonably one of your competitors came out with a new scrub line. You had mentioned the isolation gowns as being one of your differentiated products, which is, I’m assuming, helping you win business. Just wondering how those conversations are going with customers regarding competition? And then also could you touch on how you're positioning your scrub dispensing system to your advantage?
Scott Farmer: Yes. Todd, you want to take this one, and I'll chime in.
Todd Schneider: Sure. Okay, great. Mario, I would say in the health care market, it depends upon what area within the health care area, acute, non acute, even frankly into what department you're speaking of. But generally speaking, ISO gowns, scrubs, et cetera, those are direct purchase market, in the case of ISO gown disposable, the most common way people procure those products. Lending companies certainly are in that space, those who provide services to those types of customers. But if I generally describe, it would be -- it's a direct purchase or disposable market with any re-usables would be traditionally with a [indiscernible] companies would be the most common experience. As far as the scrub dispensing, it is -- it's been going extremely well for our business and our customers. The demand is there because it's a -- well, I think most people can kind of see the experience where you go into a grocery store and you see people wearing scrubs, right, and those belong to the hospital normally. And what happens is because both struggled to get access to scrub, they tend to hoard them. And as they hoard them, they have to buy more scrubs and when they do that are in that tough situation, they tend to buy the cheapest scrub they can, because they end up disappearing. And we completely change the value proposition there and we provide a scrub that people want to wear, not just have to wear. Its comfortable, attractive and we're continuing to invest in that area and come out with more better technology around the fabrics, et cetera. And it makes it completely accessible, meaning there's a complete accountability. So when you want a scrub, you can get it, you have complete access, and then it's laundered for you. So they don't have to take it home. So it has been really attractive for our health care customers. And as I mentioned in the opening remarks, we've installed twice the amount of scrubs that we did last year at the same time, so far through Q2. So a great momentum and we're very encouraged.
Scott Farmer: Let me add just -- this is Scott. Let me add one thing relative to the competition. And Todd mentioned that it is traditionally a direct sale items, scrubs and isolation gowns and that sort of thing. And so I think the thing that is helpful to you all to understand is that it is really difficult, and I don't know that it's even a concept that a traditional direct sale competitor would even consider, would be to try and develop a laundry service to do that. So we're providing a unique opportunity for a customer to convert to a rental program where the traditional competition can't, they don't have the ability to do that. And that is a big significant competitive advantage for us versus the traditional supplier that and we believe that because of the technology we brought, the scrub machines, the dispensing units that keep inventory tracking and our ability to control how often a isolation gown is processed before we pull it out of service. These are the kind of things that for traditional competition they can't do. Relative to other rental companies that would be linen companies and uniform rental companies, we've been in this for a long time. We have trained sales people and service providers that specialize in the health care market. And we think we have a multiyear head start on what you would probably consider to be our traditional rental competitor. And we like that position a lot. And I think that's why you're seeing the amount of success for us as we've gone through this process and through the pandemic that we're seeing. So I just thought I'd offer that as some color relative to health care as well.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Manav Patnaik with Barclays.
Manav Patnaik: Thank you. Good morning. Scott, if I could just ask you just again from a competitive standpoint, just some broader commentary, I guess outside of health care, like have you seen any changing dynamics that people are getting tight, aggressive, or is it some more consolidation going on? Just curious, any color there?
Scott Farmer: Yes. Let's -- we'll talk competitive, maybe competitive behavior and pricing. We have seen some aggressive pricing in the marketplace. I think that as competition sees their business, existing customer base, have issues and decline in revenue, they typically get aggressive with pricing. I don't think this is anything that we haven't seen in the past relative to low ball prices and competition trying to take business from us. And that's a market by market type of a environment and it could be in any particular market. The small players or one of the big national players in that market that decide they need to do something to try to win some accounts. Relative to overall pricing, though, while we have had to adjust prices on fluctuating items like gloves and face masks and hand sanitizer and the PPE kind of things, as our costs increased trying to get those products we had had to adjust prices upward on those items. For our recurring revenue across all of our businesses really, we have not increased prices during the pandemic and in fact for as a general statement, particularly in the rental division, we haven't increased our price through our customers in about a year and a half. And that's a strategic decision on our part. We don't think that during a global pandemic is the right time to be raising prices. And I think that's one element of why we've seen our Net Promoter Scores, how we measure customer satisfaction be impacted to the positive. And so that's our position on pricing at this point.
Todd Schneider: Scott, if I may -- Manav, just a couple items on that regarding our approach with our customers. Scott mentioned pricing hasn't, recurring revenue pricing hasn't gone up in 18 months or plus. And our approach to our customers was to be, we call it caring, consistent and flexible. Meaning we know it's a very challenging time for our customer base and our prospect base, so we wanted to take the appropriate approach. Scott mentioned that it's showing up in our customer satisfaction scores, which we track via Net Promoter Scores. And we look at it as what's the lifetime value of those customers. And we want to have those customers for a lifetime, and not take a short-term approach. And I think, again, that's showing up in our Net Promoter Scores, and I think it's going to show for a long-term in how customers look at us.
Manav Patnaik: Got it. That's helpful. And also I think you've given examples on how basically your scale plays totally to your advantage in these time shares those kind of heightened demand. Have you seen, maybe some of your smaller competitors just going to be financially constrained? And is that present even more opportunities now?
Scott Farmer: Well, yes, we -- I always like to say we're an equal opportunity competitor. And if any of our competition in a particular market is having a hard time with either getting supplies, getting the product that they need, having trouble with servicing their customers, we're more than happy to step in and provide those products and services through those customers. From time-to-time, we do see an issue with the competitor, and we will react accordingly in -- on a customer-by-customer, prospect-by-prospect basis, if you will, relative to that. I don't know that it's because of the -- it's still a little uncertain in where this is all going to go and how quickly it's going to end, different opinions on that. But I do think that it could provide a future opportunity for acquisition. I think that there would probably be a desire on the part of a potential seller to try to get their revenue back to where it was pre-COVID to have something larger to sell. But with that we'll deal with those kind of situations as they come up, but that is obviously an opportunity for us as well.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Andrew Wittmann with Baird.
Andrew Wittmann: Great. Thanks for taking my questions, guys. I think this one's probably for Mike. And just kind of looking back here on calendar 2020, it's obviously been a remarkable year, challenging year for so many people. I mean the thing that most investors will look back and think about Cintas and how you manage through this and seeing your margin percentage go up despite the revenue is declining. And so, Mike, I guess the question is, we look ahead to really just high levels I'm looking for here, as we're almost about to analyze the COVID comps, if you will, how should we be thinking about the margins? I mean, you guys have articulated the travel [indiscernible] discretionary, 100 basis points last quarter, 40 this quarter of benefit. But other buckets out there that could be margin headwinds as you hit the year and analyze the COVID things, I don’t know things like incentive compensation, fuel prices, other things that might have to come back in, on the production side of things, what else should we be thinking about from a high level as investors that could come back and as we hit the year mark on COVID.
Mike Hansen: Yes, it's been a challenging year. And the -- it is required a lot of different managing of the different costs, cost structures. And it certainly has been a challenge. But as we move forward, look, we -- there are certainly some things that we have learned about some of our costs like travel, and can we do some things more efficiently. And I think there will be permanent savings on some of those things. There will be some of that that comes back. But I don't think we're going to see 100 basis points of movement in something like that. And so as look forward, Andrew, I would say this, we're -- we want to grow over the course of the long-term. We will continue to staff revenue producing positions, to prepare ourselves to grow, and that may mean a little bit more bench in our service departments and in our sales departments. And that will probably create a little bit of additional spending. But having said that, Scott manage the business very, very well in this period of time, and I would expect that that is going to continue. We will continue to be very, very cognizant of our margins and our costs and recognizing that our goal is to continue to see very healthy incremental margins. So, Andrew, I don't there's not really anything that I would point to other than a little bit of that travel coming back, and a little bit more of the staffing of revenue producing positions that are needed for growth.
Andrew Wittmann: Okay, great. That's my only question for today. Have a good holiday season, guys.
Scott Farmer: Thank you.
Mike Hansen: Thank you.
Scott Farmer: You too.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Tim Mulrooney with William Blair.
Tim Mulrooney: Yes, good morning. Just one for me as well on employee retention, which I know is a key initiative for the firm and something y'all track pretty closely. I'm curious how that's trended through the pandemic. You get with furloughs and disruptions to your routes, from temporary shutdowns. If employee turnover has been something that's been harder to manage over the last several quarters, or it's actually been easier because the labor market isn't as tight as it's been relative to the last several years. Thank you.
Todd Schneider: Tim, this is Todd. Thanks for the question. Employee, what we call partner retention is never easy. But I will say that our performance, since the start of the pandemic, it's has been impressive, results are continuing to improve. We have -- our partner base is an impressive group of folks who are relentless, creative, and very proud of what they're doing on a daily basis to help businesses function in this environment and function successfully. So there's an [indiscernible] in the organization, that they're very proud of what they do. And we've got a great group of leaders and frontline partners all throughout that we're very happy with. And so yes, it's going quite well. And we're really encouraged about that, as we move through. When you go through really hard things, right, and this going through this pandemic has been extremely challenging, not just for ourselves, but for, I'd say, well, you can say the world, right, that it's been very challenging, but it makes you better makes you stronger and we have found out a lot about our partners, and how resilient they are and it's been a real pleasure.
Tim Mulrooney: That's great. Great color Todd. Thank you.
Scott Farmer: Thank you, Tim.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Gary Bisbee with BFA Securities.
Gary Bisbee: Hey, good morning. First of all, I just wanted to clarify one thing. Todd you said health care, education, government customers, I believe you said new businesses doubled year-over-year but then you said something else up [indiscernible]. What were those numbers? Yes, that right. We are happy to clarify. So both I was thinking of both sectors, excuse me. Two different sectors. One for rental, our rental and facility services business. those sectors, the health care, education and government, new businesses have doubled in that area. And in the case of First Aid, Fire and other, our new business, again, for health care, education, government is up six packs. Now, as I mentioned in the opening remarks, not all that will be repeating, Some will not, but nevertheless, we're really, really encouraged by how well we're doing in those areas of our business.
Gary Bisbee: Can you give us some color on the rest of the end markets you serve? I mean, obviously, those you've been calling out, and it makes sense that you're doing really well. But is the rest of the book down on a new business, or how do we think about sort of total Cintas at this point, including the good and the bad?
Mike Hansen: Yes. So in total, our new business is very good. We're very encouraged by that. The trend lines are great. The productivity is at an all-time high. It's replacing a lot of revenue of customers that are closed. And for those, it's also replacing a lot of revenue for customers who are maybe open, but certainly not at the same levels as what we'd expected in a new more normalized type economy.
Gary Bisbee: Okay. And then just if I could one financial question on cash flow, it's obviously been quite strong. How do you think about two factors. One, CapEx coming back to more normal levels? Is that just a matter of revenue getting back and you’re bringing the spend back or anything else we should think timing. And then the other one on inventory, inventory days is up a lot, I guess, in part sales down, but also building inventory for all these newer items, PP&E and whatnot, how do you think about inventory levels in a more normalized revenue environment at some point in the future? Are they likely to be higher than they've been? And is that something that will continue to build and have an impact on capital. Thank you.
Todd Schneider: Well, let's start with CapEx. I think that we're going to probably see CapEx remain below historical levels until we get through the COVID crisis and the economy recovers. But I'd still say that even today, we're probably spending CapEx at a 60% growth 40% maintenance level. So -- but I just think it's going to be lower until we get through this, everybody is a little more cautious and that sort of thing. Relative to inventory, it's important that I think we make the statement that, that we are doing the best job that we can to manage the supply chain and the supply of these hard to get items with the demand that we're seeing from our customer base. And that's the primary reason you're seeing an increase in this inventory, I don't believe that we're going to see a sudden drop off in the need for these products. I think it'll be a slow, steady decline. And we'll have some view on that as the economy recovers. And as COVID vaccines continue to roll out, many of these are going to be around at a higher level than pre-COVID for a long, long time. And so, we're -- we haven't seen any issues with slow moving inventory at that point, or anything like that. But I will tell you that the fact that we have been able to bring these products into inventory, the way that we have has been a huge competitive advantage for us in the marketplace, where because we might have masks or gloves or hand sanitizer, prospects who ordinarily have not been doing business with us listen to and react to our ability to provide them with these COVID related products. And then also listen to what else we can do for them. And so it might be a call where a company is interested in hand sanitizer, and we wind up after sales rep is out talking to them, where they're putting 10 people in uniform and restroom supplies in the restroom and entrance mats and mops and cleaning chemicals and so forth, in addition to the hand sanitizer. So it's been a big competitive advantage for us as we've gone through this process. And I think one of the reasons why our NPS customer satisfaction scores are up, as well as we're seeing very robust new business results. So I think the balance sheet that we have is allowed us to be able to make that investment. Our supply chain has done a great job in sourcing it. And I think that it's reflected in our ability to sell new accounts and satisfy our customers.
Operator: Let's take our next question from Kevin McVeigh with Credit Suisse.
Kevin McVeigh: Great. Thanks so much. Hey, I wonder if you could give us a sense of across the client base, how many are in percentage numbers? Maybe how many are inactive today? And is there a way to think about where the average customer is in terms of percentage of prior peak, just to get a sense of just the potential to scale as things start to reaccelerate from a COVID perspective, we are covering that.
Scott Farmer: That's difficult for us to say, because in many ways, it's a moving target. We have had customers that were open, and then because of a regulation or restriction had to shut down temporarily open back up some of the customers that are open or open only at 50% capacity or at a lower level than they were. But we haven't gotten into those figures because it moves around so much that if I tell you something today, it could be different next week. And so we -- depending on who might apply new restrictions, and so forth. So we haven't gotten into that level of detail. And I hesitate to do that only because I think it might be a little misleading, only because it moves around so much.
Kevin McVeigh: Okay. Thank you. And then just in the kind of post-COVID world, you think about how much of the demand is structural. Is there a way to think about that, again, to the core business, and to me, it seems like, obviously, health care is going to be a more significant contributor to the business, but just any incremental step up and how much of that is kind of structural versus maybe starts to kind of normalize.
Scott Farmer: We've learned a lot as we've gone through this process. And I think that one of the really positive aspects of this whole thing is that we have done a much better job of communicating to existing customers, and even prospects, all of the things that we can do for them. And therefore are selling more to existing customers and a new prospect that might come on board, they may only start with a particular service, but because they're aware of the other things that we have to offer, when they see that need, they know who to call, that has been a structural change for us. And I believe that the things that we have to offer, these customers are things that they're going to be using in the long-term within their businesses to help keep their businesses, their employees, and their customers safe. Have a clean environment for them to work in, be compliant with the regulations and in the Fire business, Insurance company requirements and so forth. So we're excited about the position that we -- that we're in right now. And as I look to the future, I'm really excited about where all this can go.
Todd Schneider: Kevin, it's Todd. As an example …
Kevin McVeigh: Hey, Todd.
Todd Schneider: … that we mentioned that in a previous call that there's a large national bank chain that we were doing zero business with and now we're providing hand sanitizer to every single branch that they have. And we're -- in addition to that, we're talking to them about other facilities products that they are in need of. We're also talking to them about our Fire service, which, as you can imagine they need all that. It's just a matter of where they're getting it from and centralizing spend, in many cases, saving money. So it's just one example of what is occurring hundreds of times every single day out there with our sales and service organization. As Scott mentioned, really positions us well because there's people in the past who really wouldn't take our calls. And now they will because of our inventory position and our infrastructure, and that helps. That helps position us for the long-term in a really healthy manner.
Kevin McVeigh: Makes a ton of sense. I've noticed a lot of dispensers being kind of installed and things like that that just historically weren't there. And that bodes well for the future. So thank you.
Todd Schneider: Thank you.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer.
Scott Schneeberger: Thanks very much. Good morning. In the Other segment, I'm just curious, how is your visibility there? You're obviously experiencing some new win and seeing some struggles. But if you could break it down on between Fire and Direct Sales, there's a sense of the visibility you have. And this is the essence of the question is, you've done a nice job managing margin there is the -- how does the visibility correspond with your ability to manage your OpEx? Thanks.
Scott Farmer: Well, the Fire service business is recovering similar to the Rental and Facility services segment there. I mentioned earlier, that their November organic growth rate was off 1% from pre COVID levels. But so we have a pretty good view of what's happening in that business. And I think that will -- similar to what happens with the rest of the economy and what we’re -- what happens with the rental division, we'll see that recover in a similar fashion. Relative to the Direct Sale business, a good portion of that business goes into hospitality and travel related areas. That's a little murkier, and I think that -- those are hotels, airlines, cruise ships, casinos and food service and that sort of segment. So those are going to be, I think, the longer tail from a recovery standpoint. But I think that there will be a day coming, where they're going to get a pretty good bump. I think there is a my personal opinion, a huge amount of pent-up demand for people to be able to go back on vacation, to stay in a hotel to feel safe when they get on an airplane and that sort of thing. And there's a point at which when the vaccines have been rolled out to perhaps reach herd immunity. You can see airlines throw in some special rates at travelers to welcome them back, hotels and resorts doing the same kind of thing. I think you can see Las Vegas doing everything that they can to get their customers to come back and who knows that maybe that's early next summer, depending on the rate of vaccinations and things like that. But if it's going to work in those businesses, it's also going to work in other businesses. People are going to be able to go back out to their restaurants and their movie theatres locally, and maybe go to the concert venue and do the social things that bars and do the social things that they're missing right now. And I think that is coming. When it happens, we need a little bit more time to understand the rate of rollout for the vaccines. And that's why I continue to say that we're in a temporary role in this. And as we get a little further out and get a little more clarity, we're going to see, I think, some economic activity pick up and we are maybe a couple of quarters away from that maybe on an improving quarter-by-quarter basis as those vaccines rollout.
Scott Schneeberger: Thanks, Scott. I appreciate that color. And just as a follow-up. I’m curious on your appetite for M&A and what you're seeing out there is you’re clearly in a position of power as you’ve kind of discussed over the course of the call. And then maybe $0.02 on the move to the quarterly dividend and just [indiscernible] on the whole return of capital strategy of the [indiscernible]? Thanks. 
Scott Farmer: Yes. So relative to the dividend, that -- we were the sort of the last person standing relative to and giving out annual dividends. We thought and have talked about it at a Board level for a long time and made a decision to make the change. I think it's -- we have shareholders that we've heard from in the past about cash flow and that sort of thing. So we -- we've reacted to that. We think it was a good change for us. We think it's a good change for the shareholders as well. And remind me the first part of the question was …
Mike Hansen: M&A, Scott.
Scott Farmer: Oh, M&A. Okay. Thank you, Mike. I'm sorry. You probably dropped off, but M&A, yes. We are cautious right now because of where we are in the recovery. But we are in a position where we could do M&A acquisitions in any of our businesses. We'd evaluate them pretty heavily right now, just to make sure we understand, how well that particular business is doing. But we would be acquisitive, if we could find the right deal the right business at the right price, I think that, as I said earlier, I think there's a -- there is an element of concern on the sellers part, if their revenue is below where it was pre-COVID, that they're going to get out of the business, what they need to get out of the business, should they sell it. And so there may be a little bit of a lull there. But I think as the economy continues to pick up, we'll probably see, M&A activity pick up. And, if that's the case, we sure would like to be a player there.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley.
Toni Kaplan: Thank you. I was hoping you could provide some clarification on the operating assets that were sold during the quarter. Trying to understand what those were and was that a cost saving measure, given the uncertainty? And does this reduce future capacity at all? And just how does it impact the run rate margin structure, if at all? Thanks.
Scott Farmer: Yes, yes, sure. It was really just a couple of key focuses, we had some operations in some pretty remote geographies that those particular geographies didn't lend themselves to have an opportunity for a lot of growth. And so we had a lot of resources dedicated to running those operations. And they just -- they just weren't important geographies. For us we also had some services that we had been experimenting with, if you will, that we came to the conclusion that we had better opportunities to grow other segments of the business. So these are the areas that we sold. It wasn't really material. Total revenue run rate was about $50 million annually. So I don't think that it's going to have a -- any short-term, mid-term, long-term impact on our run rate.
Toni Kaplan: That's helpful. And this was asked in a different way already, but just want to make sure I understand the comments that you've made today sound like things are doing fine, improving in many cases, but there have been some new lockdowns and potential for more. So that's your reservation for not providing the 3Q guidance. Just Is that fair and what do you see directionally, I guess, as the range of revenue growth scenarios, is it better than 4Q on the downside, but better than this quarter on the upside, like just trying to understand how you're viewing the range. And obviously, there's a lot of uncertainty. So not trying to nail you down on it, just what's the upside and downside? Thanks.
Scott Farmer: Yes, let me try to explain it this way. We're in a -- I think that it's the timing of our quarter, and therefore this call that are causing part of the problem. There's so much uncertainty right now, as we look out over the next several weeks, a couple of months, few months, maybe. And it's everything from the rising counts of the virus, we have government's putting more restrictions in place. And as of today, I don't know whether more government -- governors and mayors are going to do that, whether they're not going to do that, how long those restrictions are going to stay in place based on the ones that have put these things in place so far. We have a typical period between Christmas and New Year's where traditionally we have a group of customers close down their facilities for the holidays anyway. We don't know this year, whether that means they're going to extend that or not. And so that causes a little bit of cloudiness. We've got an election in Georgia coming up in a few weeks, that will determine what happens in the Senate. And so there's a lot of uncertainty. When we sat down and talked about it, we said, well, let's put a range together. But when we started to put a range together, we started saying, What if this happens? And what if that happens? And those would be things like, what if? What if a governor or a group of governors decided? Well, the vaccine is 3 months away, let's leave these restrictions in place for the next 3 months. What does that do to our ability to predict what our low end of the range might be? What if that doesn't happen? What if Governor Newsom actually does open California's economy backup January 4th. So it became such a wide range that we decided it didn't make sense for you. Our impression of -- and I don't want to, I hope you take this the right way. But our impression is that what one of the things that you like about our company is that we're pretty predictable. And when we give guidance, you can pretty much determine, in your models, what that means relative to what you think is going to happen. In this particular case, we don't think that what we would provide for you would allow you to do that, that you might wind up with some big swings with depending on your positive or negative approach, depending on what you think is going to happen in the economy. And therefore, we decided it didn't make sense for us in this period of time to do that. I do not believe this is my personal opinion, that it will be anything near like what happened in the fourth quarter for us, that was brand new. And I think there were 38 states that put shelter-in-place, orders in place in a short period of time. We haven't seen that. I don't think, I don't expect that that's going to happen at this point. It moving forward, might it maybe my personal opinion is that won't happen. Therefore, I don't see that as the eventual downside of what's going to happen. The upside could be that the number of cases begin to subside, that the mayors and governors begin to open. Their economies back up in anticipation of vaccinated progress, and so forth. But I do know this, with the vaccines rolling out that I can't predict the rate yet, I need a better understanding of what that is going to be. But with those vaccines rolling out, fewer and fewer governments are going to put restrictive orders in place. And eventually those economies and those states and municipalities are going to begin to recover at a pretty good rate. Is that in our fourth quarter? I'd love to see that. Is it next summer, highly likely that by next summer, some point next summer, we're going to be at that position. But that that's my -- that's my view of it, and so I'll end with that.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel.
Scott Farmer: Shlomo, you may be on mute.
Shlomo Rosenbaum: Sorry, I’m on mute. Thank you. Thank you for calling that out. I just have a few. It's been great, yes, great color over here. Thank you. And I had a few housekeeping items that I thought we could just kind of run through maybe will be helpful. Just on some of the -- can you give more detail on kind of the one-time sales moving to subscription sales, or is there some way you can just get into a little bit more about how that impact might have happened in the quarter? And kind of the success that you're having over there? Is this something that, it's kind of a little bit more of a permanent lift that's over there. And then a couple more after that.
Todd Schneider: Shlomo, this is Todd. We mentioned in our most recent quarterly release that, customers when they buy large orders of PPE, whether it's a government school system, could be health care could be -- up and down the street business, but they tend to make a large pie. And then they go into maintenance mode from there. And some of these large fines were in our Q1.
Mike Hansen: There were some in Q2, some or some of those that bought in Q1 are now in maintenance mode and weren't Q2. So it's a real mix and trying to predict for those folks, how long they're going to need those products and services, the access to them is it's a dynamic marketplace. So, again, that's why we're very good, why we, we've invested for our customers in these inventory levels to help them with that. So hopefully that gives you a little bit more color.
Shlomo Rosenbaum: Okay. And then, Hey, Mike, this is for you, I knew you were really good with numbers, but I'm still trying to figure out how you got an 18 million get dollar gain pre-tax on 108 million shares to be $0.025 of VPS that trigger some other kind of, tax benefit or something with that gain of sale.
Todd Schneider: It's a great question, Shlomo. It did, yes, the assets had a high tax basis and created while a book gain, a tax loss and so you can kind of think of it as the $18 million pre-tax gain was about a $0.12 benefit. And the tax benefit was about a $0.013 benefit. And maybe said a little bit differently, the 13.3% tax rate was benefited by about 270 basis points. I'm sorry -- 370 basis points from this -- these transactions. And the remainder of that tax rate, call it 17%. Without that benefit, did have some benefit from equity compensation, as we've talked about in the past. As you think about that tax rate moving forward, I would suggest in the third quarter, think about a range of 20% to 21%.
Operator: Thank you. That concludes today's question-and-answer session. Mr. Adler, at this time, I will turn the conference back to you for any additional or closing remarks.
Paul Adler: Well, thank you, everyone for joining us. We will issue our third quarter of fiscal '21 financial results in late March. We look forward to speaking with you again at that time. Good day.
Operator: This concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2021 Q1  (2020-09-23 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Cintas Quarterly Earnings Results Conference. Today's call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Paul Adler, Cintas Vice President, Treasurer and Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Paul Adler: Thanks, April, and good morning and thank you for joining us. With me today is Scott Farmer, Cintas Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer; Todd Schneider, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer; and Mike Hansen, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We will discuss our first quarter results for fiscal 2021. After our commentary, we will be happy to answer questions. The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a safe harbor from civil litigation for forward-looking statements. This conference call contains forward-looking statements that reflect the company's current views as to future events and financial performance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those we may discuss. I refer you to the discussion on these points contained in our most recent filings with the SEC. I'll now turn the call over to Scott Farmer.
Scott Farmer: Thank you, Paul. This continues to be a challenging time for our employees, who we call partners, are doing all they can do to keep our customers’ places of business clean, safe and ready for the workday. Our employee partners have remained diligent in their care of our customers providing essential products and services. And they remain diligent in their care of each other, and we can't thank them enough for their truly impressive achievements. Before we get into the financial results, I'd like to provide you with some examples of our interactions with our customers in the first quarter of our fiscal year, so you will have a better understanding of our business. A hospital system in Michigan provided isolation gowns to their staff and laundered them in the hospital. These garments are fluid resistant protective clothing worn by doctors and nurses. The hospital had difficulty staffing the laundry and suffered quality issues. The hospital system, a no programmer as we call it, decided to outsource the procurement and laundering to Cintas so they could concentrate on patient care. Another no programmer, a dental alliance with 55 locations in three states, signed with us for scrubs in a rental program for 550 wearers. Due to their satisfaction with the service, they're in discussions with us to add facility services products and first aid supplies. In California, one university system with many campuses signed a multi-year agreement for hand sanitizer service. In addition, our first aid business is providing them with $0.5 million of hard to find gloves. To another university system in California, our first aid division is providing over a million facemasks. A restaurant chain that has been a customer since 2007 had been struggling in the first few months of the pandemic. In talking with the customer, we listened and were empathetic and adjusted service frequencies and inventories in partnership with them. They were so pleased with the way that we treated them that they renewed our service agreement and added hand sanitizer stand service to every one of the restaurants. A casino customer in Ohio recently reopened after being dormant due to COVID-19 restrictions. In order to conduct business in the new environment, casino added rental mask services and additional items to increase cleaning protocols including dusk mats and microfiber mops, and towels. And a city government in Texas was a no programmer until they came to us for a hand sanitizer program for all of their government buildings. They were so happy with the execution that we gained their trust to provide some of their Personal Protective Equipment needs as well. They were impressed with our ability to deliver hundreds of thousands of masks within days. These examples are just a handful of the many and were offered to highlight the following; our opportunity to convert no programmers, the do-it yourselfers remains robust; scrubs and isolation gowns are indicative of a broad uniform rental opportunity. Our approach is being flexible with customers in the short term reach, long-term benefits. Our Net Promoter Scores, which we use to measure customer satisfaction has never been higher. Earning the trust of the customer enables us to penetrate -- enables further penetration and cross selling, and our supply chain and service network, our competitive advantages, enabling us to increase service to existing customers and add new customers by procuring and providing items in short supply. Our value proposition of getting businesses ready for the workday by providing essential unparalleled image, safety, cleanliness, and compliance has never resonated more than it does today. A new trend of greater focus on health, readiness, and outsourcing of non-core activities is under way. We are well positioned for this new normal. I'll turn the call over to Mike now for commentary on the financial results. Mike?
Mike Hansen: Thanks, Scott and good morning. Our fiscal 2021 first quarter revenue was $1.75 billion, a decrease of 3.6% from last year's first quarter. Earnings per diluted share or EPS were $2.78, an increase of 19.8% from last year's first quarter. Free cash flow, which is defined as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures for this year's first quarter, was $281.4 million, an increase of 32.6%. Organic revenue adjusted for acquisitions, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, and differences in the number of workdays, declined 5% for the first quarter of fiscal 2021. Organic revenue for the uniform rental and facility services operating segment declined 5.4%. Organic revenue for the first aid and safety services’ operating segment increased 17.1%. Gross margin for the first quarter of fiscal '21 of $826.2 million decreased 2.7%. Gross margin as a percentage of revenue 47.3% for the first quarter of fiscal '21 compared to 46.9% in the first quarter of fiscal '20. Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue were 27.3% in the first quarter and 30% in the first quarter of fiscal '20. Fiscal ‘21 first quarter results benefited from lower expenses as a percentage of revenue in many areas, including discretionary spending. Operating income for the first quarter of fiscal '21 of $349.7 million increased 14.2%. Operating margin was 20% in the first quarter of fiscal '21 compared to 16.9% in the first quarter of fiscal '20. Our fiscal first quarter contained one more workday than the prior year first quarter. One more workday in a quarter has an impact of approximately 50 basis points on operating margin due to many large expenses, including rental material cost, depreciation expense, and amortization expense being determined on a monthly basis instead of on a workday basis. Our effective tax rate on continuing operations for the first quarter of fiscal '21 was 7.8% compared to 10.1% last year. The tax rate can move from period to period based on discrete events, including the amount of stock compensation expense. Net income for the first quarter of fiscal '21 was $300 million, an increase of 19.6%. Earnings per diluted share were $2.78, an increase of 19.8% from last year's first quarter. In addition to the solid financial performance, we continue to generate strong cash flow. First quarter free cash flow was $281.4 million, an increase of 32.6% compared to last year. Our leverage calculation for our credit facility definition was 1.6 times debt to EBITDA. Our balance sheet is strong. We have an untapped credit facility of $1 billion. For financial modeling purposes, please note that there will be one more workday in our fiscal '21 than in our fiscal '20. One more day will benefit fiscal '21 total revenue growth by 40 basis points. One more workday also benefits operating margin and EPS. Fiscal '21 operating income margin will be about 12.5 basis points better in comparison to fiscal '20 due to one more day of revenue. In fiscal '20 each quarter contained 65 workdays. In fiscal '21, workdays by quarter are 66 in Q1, 65 in Q2, 64 in Q3, and 66 in Q4. Please keep these differences in mind when modeling results on a year-over-year and sequential basis. Before turning the call over to Todd Schneider to discuss the performance of each of our businesses, I want to comment on fiscal '21 financial guidance. Due to the continuing COVID-19 pandemic, uncertainty remains about the pace of economic recovery. Therefore, we are not providing annual guidance at this time. However, we would like to provide our second quarter financial expectations. We expect revenue to be in the range of $1.725 billion to $1.75 billion and EPS to be in the range of $2 to $2.20. Please note the following regarding second quarter financial expectations. Our second quarter contains the same number of workdays as last year's second quarter, but one less than our first quarter. We expect operating margin as a percent of revenue to be in the range of 17.5% to 19%. And we expect our second quarter effective tax rate to be about 22% compared to 20.1% in last year's second quarter. I'll now turn it over to Todd.
Todd Schneider: Thank you, Mike. Mike. Before I review the business results, I'd like to build off with Scott's comments. While the environment remains challenging and uncertain, we did experienced a continued improvement in results through the quarter. The majority of our existing customers have reopening and our employee partners work diligently in partnership with these businesses to get them ready for the work day. Despite reopening, many existing customers are not yet operating at the same level of business before the COVID-19 pandemic started, because of the virus’s impact on health and the economy. In keeping with the Cintas culture, our employee partners are working with urgency to offset these headwinds. Significant opportunities for new revenues exists because of the need of businesses to instill confidence in their employees, customers, students, patients, et cetera, that they will remain healthy and safe. Additionally, businesses are outsourcing tasks that are not their core competency, so they can successfully navigate these challenging times. The value we provide businesses has never been more evident. In fact, we've been given a seat at the table in discussions with state and local officials, hospital administrations, COVID-19 procurement task forces and hospitality cleanliness counsels. There is greater demand for services and products we already provide such as health [Technical difficulty] in other areas, demand is so attractive that we are providing new services and products made possible by our supply chain, distribution network, sales force and cash flow. These include rental healthcare isolation gowns, hand sanitizer stand dispenser service and sanitizing spray service. With that, I'll turn now to the first quarter financial performance of our business. Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segment includes the rental and servicing of uniforms, healthcare scrubs, masks and towels and the provision of restroom supplies and other facility products and services. This segment also includes the sale of items from our catalogs for our customers on route. Uniform Rental and Facility Services revenue was $1.39 billion, a decrease of 4.1%. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, foreign currency exchange rate changes and the difference in the number of workdays, the organic revenue declined 5.4%. Our Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment gross margin was 48.7% for the first quarter compared to 47.2% in last year's first quarter. Prior inventory amortization expense of 80 basis points was more than offset by the benefit of lower production and service expense as a percent of revenue, the additional workday and lower energy expenses. Our First Aid and Safety Services operating segment includes revenue from the sale and servicing of first aid products, safety products, personal protective equipment and training. This segment's revenue for the first quarter was $204.5 million. The organic growth rate for the segment was 17.1%. The first aid segment gross margin was 40.2% in the first quarter compared to 49% in last year's first quarter. Lower production and service expenses as a percent of revenue compared to last year first quarter were more than offset by higher cost of goods sold from the increased proportion of revenue from personal protective equipment, such as masks and gloves. Our Fire Protection Services and uniform direct sale businesses are reported in the all other categories. Our fire business historically grows each year at a strong pace. Uniform direct sale business growth rates are generally low-single-digits and are subject to volatility, such as when we install a multimillion dollar account. Uniform direct sale, however, is a key business for us and as customers are offered significant opportunities to cross sell and provide products and services from our other business units. All other revenue was $147.7 million, a decrease of 20%. Organic revenue declined 22.2%. The fire business organic revenue declined 5.3% due to the inability to access some businesses because of closures. The uniform direct sale business organic revenue declined 47.3%. Revenue from our airline, cruise line, hospitality and gaming customers largely falls within this segment. These industries continue to be among the hardest hit by the pandemic. That concludes our prepared remarks. We are happy to answer your questions.
Operator: Thank you [Operator Instructions]. And we'll first hear from Seth Weber of RBC Capital Markets.
Seth Weber: I had a couple questions on the first aid safety business. I guess, maybe Mike, can you just talk to how -- do you feel like you're still seeing large one-time sales in that category or do you feel like that this is, that the growth rate there has been a reset to a higher level kind of on a sustainable basis? And then on a follow up question, can you just talk, give us a little bit more color on what you're seeing on the supply chain on the cost side? I think Todd called out some higher COGS for some PPE. Is that -- do you think just a temporary issue or will that -- is that sort of the new normal just on the cost side? Thank you.
Scott Farmer: Seth, this is Scott. I'll take the first part of that. I’ll let Todd take the second part of that. On first aid and safety, I think the way that is probably the best way for you all to look at it is that a lot of the initial upfront large sales of PPE through the first aid business are similar to what happens in the direct sales business. When we sell a big new customer, there's a large upfront sale of these goods and then it will -- that customer's revenue will drop to a maintenance level. And so, we are seeing that in the first quarter we did have a lot of large upfront sales to customers in the first aid and safety business that are now moving into that maintenance level. That doesn't mean that there aren’t other customers out there that we can find and identify, but I think that there was a big rush of that in our first quarter as pandemic hit, and so I would say we're probably closer in the second quarter to move it more into the maintenance mode on those type of things. I would say that probably means that we may not drill in the high-teens in the first aid and safety, but we will continue to see very good growth in first aid and safety.
Todd Schneider: We kind of end up in a large first order and then there is some maintenance mode there, but we're really focused on taking care of our customers. They are -- and there’s great demand for some of these products out there, gloves, masks, hand sanitizers et cetera. So, we're blessed to be in a good position in the inventory and be able to take care of them, but we are encouraged still that we're selling a lot of first aid cabinets that's going well, and we think things will moderate in growth, probably we're also anxious to see the COGS to moderate back to closer to where it was before.
Seth Weber: And have you seen any pickup in the cabinet business Todd? I know last quarter you talked about is sort of [Technical Difficulty]… 
Todd Schneider: Seth, you sound a bit muffled. Can you start that question over please?
Seth Weber: I was just wondering if you’ve seen a pickup in the cabinet business. I know last quarter you talked about that you're having challenges getting into facilities and things like that. Has that -- has the cabinet side of the business picked up as well?
Todd Schneider: Yeah, our new cabinet sales are going quite well, but we have a heck of a lot of customers that are still on the sidelines. They're close. So that's certainly affecting what is being procured through our cabinets, and we're anxious for those businesses to get back up and running. But long-term, while we pivoted helping our customers and long-term we're quite bullish on the direction of the organization.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Next we'll hear from George Tong of Goldman Sachs.
George Tong: Hi, thanks. Good morning. You talked about healthy growth for scrubs and isolation gowns in the healthcare vertical, both among existing customers and in the no programmer market. At this point, what percentage of revenue is being generated by healthcare customers and how quickly is this vertical growing?
Scott Farmer: Hi, George. This is Scott. When we talk about revenue in the healthcare segment, keep in mind that we're talking about all the products and services that we would provide to the healthcare segment that is both fire service, first aid service, some direct sales business, and obviously some rental -- uniform rental and FS business. It represents about 7% of our total revenue now. We're excited about what we see in that segment. Healthcare represents about 17% of GDP. And so we think we continue to have a big opportunity in healthcare. The scrub rental business and these isolation gowns -- from your perspective if you just simply refer to those as the scrub business, I think you'd be safe. These isolation gowns are things typically worn over the top of the scrub, dealing with particular patients to protect the nurse or doctor from bodily fluids and things like that that. No need to get into a whole separate category on that. But we're excited on what we see there. The COVID has brought a realization to healthcare providers that taking -- wearing scrubs to work and then wearing them home may not be the right approach, and they're looking for ways to outsource managing those programs for them and we really like the position that we're in. I would say that healthcare has a great opportunity to be the first segment that we service to grow to over 10% of our total revenue. And so, we remain very optimistic about this segment.
George Tong: And as revenues begin to recover over the near to intermediate term, can you provide some perspective on what you expect for incremental margin flow through, particularly as operating leverage begins to kick in and you start to see utilization and capacity rates recover?
Mike Hansen: Yeah. I think, George, from an incremental margin perspective, we talked a lot about in the past, we like incremental operating margins to be in the 20% to 30% range. Clearly, we've exceeded that in this first quarter. But that's the -- longer term, that still is the range that we like to see, because it really keeps us in a cadence where we are growing in the way that we want to grow and we are managing the number of sales people that we need and the number of routes that we need, the amount of capacity that we need, and when we are growing the way we want to grow, we actually like that 20% to 30% range and expect that that will continue as we get out of this really disruptive and bumpy period.
Operator: Hamzah Mazari of Jefferies.
Hamzah Mazari: My first question is maybe for Scott. I know you've touched on some examples of net new business sort of in your prepared remarks. But maybe if you could just talk about how the sales cycle today compares to pre-COVID in converting some of these customers? I assume healthcare has accelerated given to some of your comments, maybe even food service. But maybe if you could just talk about how that cycle defers today versus pre-COVID. It seems like it's accelerated. I think you touched on outsourcing potentially accelerating coming out of this period?
Scott Farmer: Yeah, happy to provide a little color there and Todd may want to chime in as we go through this. But the pre-COVID we had decision makers that had time to review things, try to get multiple competitive looks and things like that when we're out in the marketplace. I think that the urgency of trying to find certain products and services certainly shortened that sales cycle, decisions were made more quickly. It's not to say that they weren't trying to find competitive bids. But in many cases, it was hard for competitors to come up with the products and services they needed to fulfill a customer's order. I'm proud to say that we did a really good job of making sure that we were in front of that and had inventory. And so we've been reasonably successful in being able to help these companies out. As we look at sales productivity amongst our sales force we have been through the entire COVID period, selling at very impressive productivity rates, very high historically. We'd like to see that happen. We think it's a good sign for the foreseeable future for the company. And so you combine that sales productivity with decision makers that are in the market, trying to make reasonably quick decisions and we think we can do very well in that regard. Todd, I don’t know you have anything to add?
Todd Schneider: Yeah. It's good question. It really varies dramatically based upon whom you're calling on, the products you're selling. Our sales organization is highly urgent anyway and highly adaptable. And I've been really impressed by how they’ve been able to overcome any obstacles that were -- it seems like came in their way. But we have products and services that people really need to -- I'll say instill confidence in their employees, in their guests, in their customers, how you want to describe their students, their patients. When you have those available, it does shorten the sales cycle, because there is some times where we walk in and they say, my goodness, you have that, let's go. And so, again, there's so many different sales processes going on at any one time. It’s tough to say, make a sweeping statement. But just generally speaking, yeah, it set it up because of the urgency of making sure people are taken care of. And we are again blessed to be in a good spot with it products and services, and that creates confidence in our people, in our customers and showing in the productivity.
Hamzah Mazari: Great. And then just my follow-up question is just on the hygiene business. Could you maybe talk about the outlook there but particularly, what is your value proposition in hygiene versus some larger competitors that maybe moved into that market first? I know your product looks nicer than Ecolab from the outside -- but hand sanitizers and such. But maybe just give us a sense of the value prop you have in that business, because it seems like a newer business for you even pre-COVID obviously is accelerated today.
Todd Schneider: Hamzah, I'll start then Scott can feel free to jump in. And we appreciate your comment on our products. We invest a heck of a lot into our R&D to make sure that we have really attractive functional products, a lot of investment in it. And we have been in the hygiene business for I'll call it decades, right? It’s just we spoke in our last call about how 9/11, September 11, 2001 had a dynamic impact on security and we believe that this pandemic is going to have a similar effect on hygiene in our world, and that has been something that's been positive for our business. So our customers love the fact that we have availability. We have attractive products. We have a great inventory distribution system. Very fair approach to how we handle things. And we have a great suite of products and services that are right there on the truck. They can deal with one organization that can handle all their needs we’re able to -- because the vast majority of our routes service our customers weekly and allow for us to be able to inspect what they have, where they are from an inventory standpoint and help provide some consultative services instead of just tell us when you need some more product. So that route infrastructure and obviously, distribution center system is a real strategic advantage for us moving forward.
Scott Farmer: And I'd say it this way just to echo what Todd said. What we do that most of our competitors who have been in this space for some period of time don't do is that we're there every week so we make sure that they always have inventory and they never run out. Most of the time, a customer who's buying it from a supply house or a traditional competitor has to take it upon themselves to realize that they're running low on inventory, sometimes that happens when they're out of inventory then they have to go and place the order, they have to wait for the order to come to them. They're out of supply for maybe a few days and that sort of thing. And they don't have to worry about that when we're taking care of it for them. And restrooms are something that every single business has to deal with. And when we take care of that for them, it's one less detail that they have to worry about in the course of their business day and allows them to focus their time and attention on taking care of their customers. So I think that's the value proposition that we're offering in the hygiene business.
Operator: Manav Patnaik of Barclays.
Manav Patnaik: My first question is, clearly you guys are winning a lot of new mandates there. And in the past, you talked about how non-programmers, really kind of two thirds of the new sales. Is that tilt, is that still [persisting] more now, because as it's the COVID driven demand? And is it -- I assume competition get the same kind of list as well, or is there an element that you guys just winning some of that new share as well, if that’s [high] at the table?
Mike Hansen: So Manav, I think you're asking is there -- we talked about new business, about 60% of our new business coming from new programmers, and is that the case as we sit here in this disruptive period and are we seeing any differences in the way that our competitors are coming to market and competing. And I'll start, as Todd mentioned earlier, our new business continues to be very, very robust. And we're selling not just the same mix of product from six months ago but a little bit of a different mix as it relates to this hygiene messaging, which is resonating so well. And so that certainly can lead to new types of prospects that we may not have talked to in the past. And when we get our foot in the door good things can happen. When they start to see our service, we can continue to talk about other needs that they may have. And so we've seen some nice success in that during this -- even during the fourth quarter but more so in this first quarter.
Todd Schneider: Frankly, that was part of the question of the sales cycle. The sales cycle is certainly a big setup just because we all saw more no programmers. There is no hurdle it hit over to sale something they can buy immediately and that can be a positive for us. As Mike mentioned, if we're selling into different -- a variety of different prospects and we're also, because of the urgency and the intensity of what we're -- what is important to these businesses, we're going to get at levels of decision makers that we weren't in the past quicker. So that again speak things up. When decision makers hear our value proposition it resonates. And so there is certainly don't -- pandemic has been absolutely horrible for the country, the world, it’s been major for our customers. But if there is some shining light it's bringing more focus to the products and services that we have and the value that we provide and getting us an audience at high levels and quicker.
Manav Patnaik: Okay, that makes sense. And in terms of at least the examples we’ve provided, it sounds like there’s lot of large institutions that are coming to you guys for the offerings, but maybe just on the flip side. Can you just talk about your kind of small business customers and adding just kind of in survival mode? Do you anticipate risk further down the road of getting on the lockdown that they can even survive? Just any color there would be appreciated.
Scott Farmer: Obviously, that depends on geography, industry segment and that sort of thing. It's different in each one, because of various local governments or state governments that have put restrictions in place. I’d say generally speaking the small customers that are open right now are weathering this -- as a general statement, pretty darn well. I think it says a lot about the American entrepreneurial spirit to see them, able to do the things that they're doing with the new rules in place, be they face masks and outdoor dining and such. But some of them -- many of them are not at full capacity yet because of various restrictions that have been put on them, or customers that may not be ready to come back out to frequent their businesses. So clearly, I think for the American economy, for the global economy, a vaccine is going to be very well received so that the rules can change and businesses can get back to operating under a sort of a new normal but a normal that allows them to operate in a more traditional fashion.
Operator: Andy Wittmann with Baird.
Andy Wittmann: I have a question and then a follow-up question. I mean clearly here in the quarter you saw quarter-over-quarter acceleration in the organic trends and talking about the rental segment, I guess, in particular. And I'm just curious if you could give a little bit more detail on your customers and look at the guidance for next quarter kind of suggest that revenues will be down 5% or 6% year-over-year and that's not too dissimilar from what you saw here in the quarter. So how has the month over month trends progressed in comparison to what the implied revenue outlook is? And just any color that you have in terms of your visibility in this and how you chose to select this range with all the uncertainties, conservative or other factors that are baked into the revenue guidance?
Todd Schneider: Certainly, this has been an unusual environment right? There was 22 million jobs that were lost, it seemed like overnight almost and then jobs returned pretty quickly in the early, very early portion of the summer. And then as you've seen that the summer we're on things moderated a bit and jobs returning and so 11 million people that are -- 11 million jobs that have not been recovered. So that has certainly impacted our business. So we need more businesses to come back. We are still guiding towards sequential growth from Q1 to Q2. We do have one less workday in Q2 versus Q1. And we're encouraged by our new business efforts, the products and services that we're selling, the engagement of our customers of what we're providing. But it takes a while for all those new business efforts to recover over all the businesses that are still closed and all the jobs that are still on the sidelines. But we're very much looking forward to Q2, Q3, Q4 and we like the trend line to work that we're seeing.
Mike Hansen: And maybe I'll offer a couple points. One is Scott talk a little earlier about the first aid and safety, large personal protective equipment sales there that kind of turned into maintenance a little bit. So keep that in mind. Another point I'll make is if you think about the first quarter revenue on the same workdays as Q2, you're talking about 1.720 billion. And so we do see some -- that guidance range especially at the top of it does look too nice sequential improvement. And keep in mind -- the last point I'll make is last year's second quarter was a pretty good quarter for us as well. And so when you put it all together echoing what Todd said, we remain excited about the performance and the momentum that we have, particularly in a bit of a challenging environment and one that still contains a fair amount of I'll say lack of clarity, let’s say. And so we think this guidance range really points to continued nice momentum improvement.
Andy Wittmann: Thanks, Mike for that, that's good perspective. I want to also kind of ask on the cost side here. Anytime you've got basically EBITDA up against declining revenue that's again, a very surprising and very good outcome for the company. We're already starting to see some questions from some of our customers asking if there was anything one-time, either positively or negatively. In other words, costs that maybe were furloughed or otherwise, things like that that were recognized in the quarter that need to creep back in here as the year progresses or other things, if you continue to do some level of restructuring, certainly that was a big factor in your fourth quarter. It sounded like you had it mostly contained in the fourth quarter, but maybe there was some carry over in the first quarter. But, Mike, I was hoping you could just talk a little bit about some of the puts and takes inside the margins and the implications about incremental margins over a hundred percents here on a go forward basis and what's unusual about the quarter, if anything.
Mike Hansen: Sure. I'll start that. I wouldn't call out any specific one-time items. But as you think about this period of time that we're in, we entered the quarter with a fair amount of disruption and lack of clarity. And we entered it with a hiring freeze, a wage rate freeze and pretty tight control on discretionary spending. And as the quarter went on, revenue obviously came a bit higher than our guidance range and we've been pleased with that. And so we started to bring -- we started hire back revenue producing positions and that certainly will have an impact as we move forward. But in the first quarter in this period of just extreme disruption, we entered it with a lot of uncertainty and we exited with still some uncertainty, but better momentum than we certainly expected. I'll point to a couple of things though within the quarter. Energy was 30 basis points better than a year ago. So we certainly got a little bit of a help there. We talked a little bit about discretionary spending. If you think about travel that was down about 100 basis points. We are itching to get out to visit customers and our locations, and we'll start to do that slowly but some of that will get leveraged with better revenue momentum as well. And then the third thing I'll say is last year you might recall we had a pretty high medical expense in the first quarter. We kind of settled back into our normal range and that was a benefit of about 90 basis points. All-in-all though, Andy, it points to our ability to really control the costs and manage the business pretty well in a highly disruptive period of time. And it also shows that as we move out of this, we have some -- we will continue to invest in revenue producing positions and the growth routes, et cetera.
Operator: Andrew Steinerman.
Andrew Steinerman: Hi. It’s Anderw. I just wanted to get a little more clarification about monthly trends. I definitely understand we're in uncertain times, and there's so many jobs to return to the workplace yet. I just wasn't sure if when you were talking about year-over-year organic revenue declines in rental. If you saw September, meaning what we've already experienced continue to narrow from August, so are declines now in September year-over-year versus August, or have we already seen kind of September declines sort of hover with August? So it's really -- is the uncertainty in like October, November, or have you already seen some hovering in September?
Mike Hansen: Andrew, we saw some really nice momentum. And certainly, Todd, talked about the highly disruptive period at the beginning of the quarter. And so the job recovery, the economic recovery was pretty extreme in the early part of the summer and the business reopenings moderated as certainly as the summer went on. But our revenue performance improvement continued through the quarter, and we still believe that -- we're still looking to see sequential improvement. And so September, while moderated from let's say June and early July, is still moving in the right direction and trending in the way that we would want it.
Operator: Next we'll here from Gary Bisbee at Bank of America.
Gary Bisbee: I guess I'd love to go back to the margins a bit more. So you've obviously done a great job cutting costs and deferring some investments. And I heard you earlier, answer to the earlier question about what helped in this quarter? But can you give us any sense of how to think about the cadence of costs coming back? Do you envision ability to manage that pretty tightly with sequential improvement in revenue? Or are there some costs at some point that it could come back more quickly? And I guess as part of that, have you identified anything within your cost reduction efforts to date that you think could turn into more permanent or sustainable cost reductions for the business?
Scott Farmer: Gary, this is Scott. First of all, as we look out into the second quarter and beyond, we are confident in our ability to control our costs. And we are still really managing labor at the very top of the organization so that people who are adding or want to add positions have to make sure that they're going through the proper channels to get approval to do that. Things that we need to do to invest in the business are going to come back on line, that may be trucks that have been and/or service reps that have been idled because of this disruption, because of the growth that we've seen through the first quarter, some of that is coming back online as a result of that that's driving some production. Labor to produce the goods. We're bringing some sales people back online that were temporarily on the sidelines. In the second quarter, we're back to advertising both national radio advertising and some TV advertising that you may have seen this past weekend. So these are the kind of costs that we think are necessary to continue to grow the business and to get our brand out there kind of customers and prospects. But we're very confident in our ability to manage these costs. Are there things that we look at to say maybe we don't need those, or as much of that or that might have a long-term impact? We're always looking for those kind of things and that is part of the culture that we have as a company. And when we find them, we pretty much jump on them and make sure that we can drive those cost out of the organization. I think that they’re nothing major at this point that we saw in the first quarter but there will be some things that will change the way we operate and do the business moving forward. We're much more efficient right now out of necessity than we have been. And I think that that's always good for any organization to put themselves in a position where they look around and you realize what else can we do to get efficient. So I think we've done a really good job. And my expectation is that we'll continue to do so. That said, there are going to be some things that are coming back online in the second quarter that I think for the long-term -- intermediate and long-term benefit of the business and our ability to grow our necessary expenses, all of which are within the guidance.
Todd Schneider: Gary, this is Todd. As Scott talked about growing is expensive, right? It’s an investment. And I think we've shown the ability to manage those expenses on the way down, meaning as the economy kind of went off a clip. And we will manage them on the way up as well and hopefully, that continues. And I got to tell you it’s a whole lot more fun to manage on the way up than there’s on way down and our people feel that way. And when you go through these types of cataclysmic events, as Scott mentioned, it makes you look through different lens. You evaluate the organization different. And one of the interesting items is how we engage with our customers, do they want us there -- should we be there in person as much, whether it’s a Teams call, or a Zoom call, or a FaceTime, whatever it is, business moves fast. And we're evaluating that, our customers are valuing that. But it does allow things to speed up. And will that have a long-term impact? It could. We shall see, I think, certainly, in the short and intermediate future that’s what we see.
Gary Bisbee: Great. Thanks. And then just to follow up, you talk a lot about sanitizer sales and the big opportunity there. Is it right that that all flows through the hygiene facilities business within rental? And if that is right, can you give us any sense sort of how well that's doing and maybe what the underlying rental revenue trend is today or how it's been trending, excluding that hygiene business. Just trying to get a sense if that's doing a lot worse and hygiene is just absolutely killing it today. Any color on that would be great. Thank you.
Todd Schneider: So the sanitizer sales predominantly flows through rentals, certainly our first aid customers as well. We sell sanitizer whether it's in various forms. So you'll see it in both but predominantly in the rental organization just because of the scope of their organization and our customer base, et cetera. And sanitizer sell is going quite well. But you know what, it is leading to other sales as well. It gets us in the door and allows us to, as we mentioned earlier, it's getting us in front of prospects we've never been in front of before. It's getting in front of decision makers we weren't able to get to in the past. I think on our last call, we spoke about a really large banks that we had hardly done business with before and now they have sanitizer service at all their branches, which is significant. But it also -- now they’re talking to us about first aid and they're talking to us about fire and other rental products. So those types of urgent needs allow for our people to get in and help explain to people what we do, how we do it, the value we provide and it opened some eyes and we're able to sell more. So it’s really encouraging.
Operator: Next question from Tim Mulrooney of William Blair.
Tim Mulrooney: Two quick ones on the balance sheet here guys. First of all, you got a lot of cash piling up on the balance sheet here. Is this just a prudent to have extra liquidity given the macro uncertainty? And can you share what your capital allocation priorities are for this year?
Scott Farmer: Yeah, first of all, there's a lot of uncertainty still out there. We like having some cash on the balance sheet in case anything comes up that is unforeseen and our balance sheet is strong anyway. But it certainly helps us have a more optimistic view of the future when we have that on the balance sheet. I think that normally in a normal environment with our ability to generate cash, we're looking for acquisitions, we're looking for what we can do relative to investing back into business, dividends, share buybacks and such to help improve our shareholders’ overall return. And I would say that as things become a little more clear, as we get out into the future, we'll get back to our normal process. And then we've got a pretty good track record of how we manage those things for our shareholders and I would expect that we'll be back to that hopefully soon. Hopefully, we'll get a vaccine that will work at some point and get back to more normal environment.
Tim Mulrooney: Does that include CapEx getting back to normal run rate? It was like $30 million in the quarter, that’s I think less than half of what you did last year. Would you expect that to get back just as I’m thinking about my models?
Scott Farmer: Yeah, I'd say this. I don't know that you're going to see a lot of increase in CapEx in the second quarter. Most of the time CapEx is -- about 60% of that is for growth and 40% is for maintenance. We do have some capacity in markets with ability to put some more trucks on the road and within our production facilities. So I don't know that the growth CapEx is going to be necessary in the second quarter. We get out much beyond that. It's still a little cloudy out there for us to predict. But I can see that hopefully by the end of the year, we're back to a more than normal CapEx spend and that means that hopefully we'll be seeing a more normalized growth environment for us.
Operator: Scott Schneeberger of Oppenheimer.
Scott Schneeberger: Just curious about kind of the pain point in markets that you have been doing as well. I think airlines, crude maybe oil and gas. Could you give us an idea just percent of revenue is being impacted that would not be in the fiscal second quarter guidance as anticipated to see improvement? And then I know there are different things in those end markets, so it’s not that easy to do. But just to give us a feel of how much of the revenues are impacted that you don't see coming back in near-term? Thanks.
Scott Farmer: Scott, most of those highly impacted segments are in our direct sale business, that would be the travel and hospitality related customer base, that would be hotels and airlines and crude ships and even gaming is in there. Those revenues are off significantly in the direct sale business. We think it’s going to continue that way for the foreseeable future. I think that those are probably a longer lead time to see those to see if those come back as their customer base gets more and more comfortable with getting on an airplane, going to an airport or flying to a city, taking a taxi to a hotel and so forth. So I think that we're going to see those areas struggle for a while. That is all in our guidance and it’s also in our results for the first quarter. I would say that the second quarter probably for those related industry segments will perform similarly to the way they did it the first quarter. There may be a few in there that do a little better than others. But I'd say it's probably, at this point, through the second quarter more of the same in those segments.
Scott Schneeberger: And maybe just as a follow up broadly, I don’t think you guys touched upon the ERP and what you're seeing now that that’s mostly implemented. So just a quick update on that please. Thanks.
Todd Schneider: Well, our ERP is, we roll it out across our first aid and our rental division over the past few years. And we're seeing some real nice advantages there, whether it affects our ability to get product to customer faster has been a nice impact. Our transparency into the data, the ability to look at the customer across business units has been advantageous, especially as we go-to-market in some of the key segments has been significant. So we're very happy to be done with the integration, right, that was -- these are never funding process. But we're also seeing some real nice advantages there. And I'd say one of the bigger ones is the ability to get speed of product to customers, because of various items internally that allows us to get the product to that. So that customers really value that, especially in an environment like this where you can deliver when you say you will or faster in an environment where a lot of companies are struggling to do that and that's a big advantage for us.
Operator: Toni Kaplan of Morgan Stanley has our next question.
Toni Kaplan: Just regarding the upcoming election, what are your thoughts on potential impacts on your business depending on the outcome? I was thinking of it as maybe under a Trump win? Seems like bringing back some manufacturing jobs into the U.S. could be good, but maybe higher tariffs could be a potential offset. Is that the right way to think about it? And how are you thinking about the puts and takes of a Biden win?
Scott Farmer: Well, yeah. I mean, there's a big difference between the two candidates and their intentions. I would say that the U.S. economy, not just us but the U.S. economy, will be affected depending on which candidate wins and assuming they both implement the things that they say, the positions that they have taken at this point. Biden administration more business regulation could slowdown business' ability to continue to grow. Higher taxes would obviously hit profits and earnings per share and then obviously, the impact of the overall stock market. And as you said, President Trump wants to continue to try to bring manufacturing jobs back and maintain or improve the current tax situation. But anyway, we will be impacted as much because of how our customers are impacted by whoever wins as anything else. So I think that as a general statement, because our customer and prospect base is such a broad spectrum of American industry that as American industry goes, we will go with it. I will say this, I am confident because we have managed through different versions of what different administrations have brought to into the U.S. economy that we can manage through this that we will manage through it as we have in the past, we got a really good track record of improvement that we can do that. And so we're optimistic either way about the long-term future of the company, I think that there may be some short-term differences that could come to bear depending on who wins.
Toni Kaplan: And just as a follow up. Just looking at the balance sheet kind of decent size inventory build the last two quarters. Just wanted to understand what's causing the increase, is that preparation for an eventual recovery and do you expect that to continue? How should we be thinking about that going forward?
Todd Schneider: Toni, this is Todd. We see our balance sheet as an advantage. We see our ability to distribute as an advantage. And our customers need us to invest in those products in the short term so that we can help them with those. So in many cases, it has been a real competitive advantage us investing in that inventory where we have products that our competition does not. And our customers really appreciate the investment on their behalf and we're leveraging that.
Scott Farmer: This is Scott. Much of that buildup is in some of the items that are in high demand right now. The hand sanitizer and there you got to look at that in a lot of different ways. It’s the actual fluid itself, the container that comes in, the dispensing units that we need, the stands and so forth. And so there is a build up of that inventory. But these are things that we are doing to take advantage of the opportunities that are in the marketplace right now. And we're very confident that because we've been able to do this and do it in such short order that we are winning business daily, because we have inventory. We talked about -- one of the examples I gave earlier on was that we got a very large account, because we were able to deliver masks in a matter of days that other companies were telling that prospect it would take months to get those. We had another example of a large customer, multilocation customer that decided to give a third of their hand sanitizer stand business to us, a third one of our competitors and a third competitor. We implemented that program with thousands of stands in a week. One of the competitors came back and said we can't deliver it within your timeframe. So they gave us that third. We did that the next week thousands of stands. And the third competitor can only do about half of what they said they could do so they're giving us half of that third of the business. And it's because we have the inventory available today to service those accounts. And so we look at that and what we've been able to do with our global supply chain, and our ability to get those products out into the marketplace quickly as a significant competitive advantage and we're taking advantage of it right now.
Operator: Shlomo Rosenbaum of Stifel Nicholas.
Shlomo Rosenbaum: Hi. Thank you very much for taking my questions. Hey, usually in labor intensive businesses, hiring is really indicative of what companies think is coming down the pike in demand. And I know you guys had a hiring freeze not that long ago looking at your open positions now between 1,600 and 1,700 open positions. Could you just discuss -- is that a normal amount of positions you'd have open? If there were not a pandemic, is it a higher amount because there’s a catch up? Is there a lower amount? How should I think of this in terms of indicating what you guys are thinking about?
Todd Schneider: Shlomo, this is Todd. So I can't answer your specific -- I don't track requisitions by what we have out there by month. But I can tell you that it's certainly an increase from what it was 90 days ago. And we're on -- we try to match up our demand for our services, the supply of our products or services, our infrastructure, our people and we're matching it up appropriately. So we look forward to Q2, Q3 and Q4 and we see demand continue to increase. We're certainly conscious of all the external factors, whether they'd be what's going on with the pandemic, what's going on with the election, all those items but we're investing for the future. And we're bringing back to those folks many, many of which are revenue generating partners that will help us continue our positive trend.
Shlomo Rosenbaum: And then maybe you could give a little bit more color on how you're thinking of the business units. I believe last quarter you guys gave little bit more detail on that in terms of the next quarter. I don’t know if you want to talk at that granular level this quarter as well?
Mike Hansen: So, Shlomo you were a little hard to hear, I think your question was regarding how each of our businesses is performing as we enter the second quarter and how do we feel about that performance. And Shlomo, I would say that the first of all as guidance encompasses all of what I'm going to mention. But Todd talked a little bit about the momentum of the rental business and we continue to see a nice trend line, even though it's moderated a bit from that heavy disruptive period early in this first quarter. But we still continue to add really good new business and we're continuing to sell these hygiene products that Todd talked a bit about. In our first aid and safety, we've had two quarters of high-teens growth, and Scott talk a little bit about -- these are big sales of personal protective equipment are hard to predict. And so they happen but then they generally will go into maintenance mode. And so our expectation is we'll see a little bit more maintenance mode in the first aid and safety business in Q2. But still very, very good results. We are very excited about that business. The fire business, which was down organically about 12% in the fourth quarter, was down organically just over 5% in this first quarter. And now that business continues to perform well and continue to move on and improving trend line. And then lastly Scott talked a little bit about our direct sales business, which was down 47% in the first quarter, and probably see that as another quarter of pretty difficult time given that customer base. So that's the way we view the second quarter, keeping in mind that it is at the mid point and higher end of that guidance, it calls for sequential improvement and nice sequential improvement of that. So again, we like the momentum of the business and the execution of it as well. Did that answer your question, Shlomo?
Shlomo Rosenbaum: Yeah, thank you very much.
Operator: And it appears there are no further questions at this time. I'll turn the call back over to our presenters for any additional or closing comments.
Paul Adler: All right. Well, thank you for joining us this morning and for your interest in Cintas. We will issue our second quarter of fiscal '21 financial results in December, and look forward to speaking with you again at that time. Have a good day.
Operator: That does conclude today's conference. Thank you all for your participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2020 Q4  (2020-07-23 00:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Cintas quarterly earnings results conference call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Mike Hansen, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead. 
J. Hansen: Good morning, and thank you for joining us. With me today is Scott Farmer, Cintas' Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer; and Todd Schneider, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer. We will discuss our fourth quarter results for fiscal 2020. After our commentary, we will be happy to answer your questions.
 The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a safe harbor from civil litigation for forward-looking statements. This conference call contains forward-looking statements that reflect the company's current views as to future events and financial performance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which would cause actual results to differ materially from those we may discuss. I refer you to the discussion on these points contained in our most recent filings with the SEC.
 I'll now turn the call over to Scott Farmer. 
Scott Farmer: Thank you, Mike, and good morning, everyone. As you know, this continues to be a challenging time for all of us, and we can't thank enough our employees, who we call partners, for doing all that they can to keep our customers' places of business clean, safe and ready for the workday.
 On May 13, we provided an update on how Cintas' business has been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and how we were managing the business. COVID-19 continues to be a significant disruption to our economy and to business. Our priorities are unchanged. They include keeping our employees healthy and safe and remaining committed to serving our customers in any way possible. I believe we're succeeding at both.
 Our employee partners have been consistent and diligent in their care of our customers, providing essential products and services to health care facilities, pharmaceutical companies, grocery store chains, food processing plants and many others. We've provided health care customers with clean scrubs and microfiber towels and mats. We've provided tens of thousands of customers with disinfectant and sanitizer spray services. And we've provided tremendous amounts of personal protective equipment, including face masks, face shields and other items to our customers to keep their employees safe.
 Our supply chain has worked feverishly to satisfy this demand. The demand for items like hand sanitizers and N95 respirators has increased tenfold in this pandemic. Our existing suppliers around the world have been key to us meeting this demand, and we thank them for their support. In addition, our scale enabled us to establish additional relationships with dozens of vendors to secure these scarce products. We continue to work to aid existing customers with the products and services that they desperately need, and our ability to access these products that others can't has enabled us to win new customers. We continue to communicate with our customers who remain idled who are -- and are considered on hold, and our focus is on being there to help them when they reopen.
 Before turning the call back to Mike, I want to conclude by stating that I'm thankful for the tremendous dedication of our employee partners. I'm proud of their ability to adapt and persevere in the midst of unprecedented adversity. In addition, I'm as excited as ever about our principal objective of exceeding our customers' expectations to maximize the long-term value of Cintas for our shareholders and working partners. Our value proposition of getting businesses Ready for the Workday by providing essential, unparalleled image, safety, cleanliness and compliance arguably has never resonated more than it does today. This pandemic will not soon be forgotten, and its impact on society is likely transformative.
 We believe a new trend of greater focus on health, readiness and outsourcing of noncore activities is underway. More health care scrubs are being professionally laundered and managed, so fewer are worn in public. Businesses, including universities and retail establishments, are requiring huge quantities of sanitizer and related services. Most businesses are providing larger budgets to align with proper cleaning protocols and supply chains of these key items are moving to the U.S. to reduce dependence on other nations. We believe Cintas is well positioned to benefit from this new normal.
 Now I'll turn the call back over to Mike. 
J. Hansen: Thanks, Scott. Our fiscal '20 fourth quarter revenue was $1.62 billion, a decrease of 9.7% compared to last year's fourth quarter. Earnings per diluted share or EPS from continuing operations were $1.38, a decrease of 34.8% compared to last year's fourth quarter. Free cash flow for this year's fourth quarter was the highest it had been all year at $316 million.
 Organic revenue adjusted for acquisitions, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and differences in the number of workdays, declined 8.4% for the fourth quarter of fiscal '20. Organic revenue for the Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segment declined 9.6%. Organic revenue for First Aid and Safety Services operating segment increased 21.9%.
 Gross margin for the fourth quarter of fiscal '20 of $708 million decreased 14.1%. Gross margin as a percentage of revenue was 43.7% for the fourth quarter of fiscal '20 compared to 45.9% in the fourth quarter of fiscal '19. Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue were 30.9% in the fourth quarter of fiscal '20 and 28.3% in the fourth quarter of fiscal '19. Operating income for the fourth quarter of fiscal '20 of $207 million decreased 34%. Operating margin was 12.8% in the fourth quarter of fiscal '20 compared to 17.5% in fiscal '19.
 Our fiscal fourth quarter contained one less workday than the prior year fourth quarter. One less workday in a quarter has an impact of approximately 50 basis points on operating margin due to many large expenses, including rental material cost, depreciation expense and amortization expense being determined on a monthly basis instead of a workday basis.
 Fourth quarter of fiscal '20 operating income was affected by many items caused by COVID-19, including additional reserves on accounts receivable and inventory, severance and asset impairment expenses and lower incentive compensation expense. Excluding these items, the operating margin was 15.5%. All of these items were recorded in selling and administrative expense. The additional inventory reserves account for slow-moving inventory, mostly in our Uniform Direct Sales business, where customers in some of the most severely-impacted industries such as airlines and hotels exist.
 Our effective tax rate on continuing operations for the fourth quarter of fiscal '20 was 20.4% compared to 21.7% last year. The tax rate can move from period-to-period based on discrete events, including the amount of stock compensation expense. Net income from continuing operations for the fourth quarter of fiscal '20 was $145 million, and reported earnings per diluted share were $1.35.
 At the onset of the pandemic, we drew on our credit facility in the amount of $200 million. This was for defensive purposes. We have a great cash flow business. And as the quarter progressed, cash generation exceeded our expectations. Cash generated was used not only to repay the $200 million borrowed against the revolver but also to pay off a $200 million term loan. We ended the quarter carrying no variable debt. Our leverage calculation for our credit facility definition was 1.6x debt to EBITDA. Our balance sheet is strong. We have an untapped credit facility of $1 billion and no material debt maturities in the next 12 months.
 Free cash flow for the year exceeded $1 billion and increased 34.1% over the prior fiscal year. We remain steadfast in our commitment to effectively deploying cash to increase shareholder value. We purchased $393 million of Cintas stock in fiscal '20 under our buyback authorizations, including $200 million in early March before the COVID-19 pandemic. The amount remaining under our buyback authorization is $1.1 billion.
 Looking ahead to fiscal '21, please note that there will be one more workday than in fiscal '20. One more workday will benefit fiscal '21 total revenue growth by 40 basis points. One more workday also benefits operating margin and EPS. Fiscal '21 operating margin will be about 12.5 basis points better in comparison to fiscal '20 due to one more day of revenue. By quarter, in comparison to fiscal '20, the fiscal '21 first quarter will contain one more workday. The second quarter will contain the same number of workdays. The third quarter will contain one less work day, and the fourth quarter will contain one more workday. Please keep the quarterly day differences in mind when modeling our fiscal '21 results.
 Before turning the call over to Todd Schneider to discuss the performance of each of our businesses, I want to comment on fiscal '21 financial guidance. Due to the recent increases in the number of people contracting COVID-19 and the actions governments are taking again in response, uncertainty remains about the pace of the economic recovery. Therefore, we are not providing annual guidance at this time. However, since we are more than halfway through our quarter, we are willing to provide our first quarter financial expectations, and they are as follows: revenue in the range of $1.675 billion to $1.7 billion; Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment organic revenue decline of 8% to 9%; First Aid and Safety Services segment organic revenue increase approaching 10%; earnings per diluted share of $2 to $2.20; and that implies a total operating margin in the range of 16.5% to 18% at the revenue midpoint.
 As Scott was quoted in today's earnings release, despite the uncertainty, we are confident in our ability to manage the short-term and maintain focus on our long-term objectives. Todd will now make some comments about the performance of each of our businesses. Todd? 
Todd Schneider: Thank you, Mike. The recent operating environment has certainly been challenging. As Scott mentioned, our focus has been on the safety of our partners and fulfilling the needs of our customers. At the onset of the pandemic, our leadership team attacked the crisis like a major acquisition or investment. Leaders from all areas of the company met daily to gather information, strategize and execute. Daunting challenges were overcome, and many were viewed as opportunities, facilitated by our strong corporate culture, which is rooted in positivity, competitive urgency and concern for employees, customers and other key stakeholders. The results have included a safe and healthy workforce and a rise in Net Promoter Scores from our customers.
 Our approach was to be highly flexible and take a long-term view of our relationship with our customers. Fortunately, we were deemed an essential service in all markets we operate in. However, many of our customers were closed. And even for those who were open, the impact on the financials of their business was substantial. For those customers who are open or ready to reopen, we were able to provide products and services that were critical to providing confidence to their employees and customers that they were in a safe environment. Products like soap, hand sanitizer, masks and disinfectant spray services.
 I'll now turn to the fourth quarter financial performance of our businesses. The Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segment includes the rental and servicing of uniforms, health care scrubs, mats and towels and the provision of restroom supplies, hand sanitizers and other facility products and services. The segment also includes the sale of items from our catalogs to our customers on route. Uniform Rental and Facility Services revenue was $1.27 billion, a decrease of 11%. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, foreign currency exchange rate changes and the difference in the number of workdays, organic revenue declined 9.6%.
 Our Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment gross margin was 43.6% for the fourth quarter, compared to 46.0% in last year's fourth quarter. We had one less workday in our fourth quarter, which had a negative impact of about 40 basis points in the current quarter. Lower production and service expenses as a percent of revenue compared to last year's fourth quarter were more than offset by amortization expense on uniforms, dust mats, towels and other items rented to customers. Amortization expense was 300 basis points higher this fourth quarter compared to last. This noncash expense is a significant headwind in the short term but will improve in ensuing quarters because purchases of new items were reduced and more existing items will become fully amortized.
 As Mike stated, selling and administrative expenses were negatively affected by many items caused by the COVID-19 coronavirus. Excluding the impact of the applicable aforementioned items, Uniform Rental and Facility Services' operating margin was 16.1% compared to 18.5% in the prior year period, a decremental margin of 37%.
 Our First Aid and Safety Services operating segment includes revenue from the sale and servicing of first aid products, personal protective equipment and training. This segment's revenue for the fourth quarter was $196.3 million. Organic revenue for the segment increased 21.9%. Revenue from servicing the first aid cabinets decreased due to the business closures from staying-in-place orders. However, our business of providing personal protective equipment surged, overcoming the revenue declines of cabinet servicing. Sales, service, supply chain, finance and others work quickly to provide current customers with masks, respirators, sanitizer and other critical items needed. In addition, the division secured new business through our ability to source scarce resources quickly. The result was a 40.8% organic revenue growth rate in May. Businesses are echoing our mantra of, "There is nothing more important than the health and safety of our employees and customers."
 The first aid segment gross margin was 46.1% in the fourth quarter compared to 47.7% in last year's fourth quarter. Lower production and service expenses as a percent of revenue compared to last year's fourth quarter were more than offset by cost of goods sold. Cost of goods sold was 840 basis points higher this fourth quarter compared to last and is attributable to the increased proportion of revenue from personal protective equipment. Excluding the impact of the applicable previously mentioned items triggered by the COVID-19 coronavirus, the First Aid and Safety Services operating margin was 18.2% compared to 15.4% in the prior year period, an incremental margin of 32%.
 Our Fire Protection Services and Uniform Direct Sales businesses are reported in the All Other category. Fire Protection Services include the performance of testing, inspection and maintenance of fire protection equipment, including extinguishers, alarms, sprinklers and emergency lights. Uniform Direct Sales business includes the provision of custom-tailored apparel. All Other revenue was $152 million, a decrease of 24.5%. Organic revenue declined 24.5%.
 The fire business organic revenue declined 12.4% due to the inability to access many businesses because of closures from stay-at-home orders. The Uniform Direct Sales business organic revenue declined 39.5%. Revenue from our airline, cruise line, hospitality and gaming customers largely falls within this segment. These industries have been amongst the hardest hit by the pandemic.
 That concludes our prepared remarks. We are happy to answer your questions. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And we will take our first question today, and that is from Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan Securities. 
Andrew Steinerman: I was hoping you could give a comment about just small and medium-sized businesses in total. Obviously, it's an important part of your client base. Do you feel like the small businesses that haven't opened yet still aren't in a position to open? And if not, do you feel like when would we know more? 
Scott Farmer: Well, Andrew, this is Scott. It's -- I'd say we have ongoing conversations with our customers that are on hold, and I would say that the majority of them intend to reopen. A lot of it depends on how long this lasts and that sort of thing, but we feel pretty good about it so far. And the indications that we get from them are that they do intend to reopen, so -- but it's going to be -- it's so cloudy right now looking out into the future. I don't know that any of them could -- on a state-by-state basis, maybe they could give us some sort of an indication of their timing. But in total, it's very difficult for us to be able to do that for you. 
Andrew Steinerman: Okay. And so far, they felt like the federal support for small businesses during this juncture has been sufficient? 
Scott Farmer: There's -- I'm sure there are lots of opinions on that. But yes, I think so. I think that we'll find out if more support is coming based on what we understand is going on in Washington right now, both for businesses as well as for individuals. And I think that supporting the individual would, in effect, also be supporting the businesses because they'd have the money to spend to do so. But we'll find out more here in the coming weeks as that gets resolved in D.C. 
Operator: And we'll move on to our next question or comment, and that is from Seth Weber with RBC Capital Markets. 
Seth Weber: I hope you're doing well. Scott, in your prepared remarks, I heard several times you talked about the health care vertical and the opportunity there. Can you just talk about whether you are actually seeing real-time conversions here from hospitals that are switching to more outsourced scrub rental? And just sort of the conversations that you're having there in that vertical, in particular, and I know you've sort of targeted a more specific sales effort there and just traction on how that's going. 
Scott Farmer: Sure. Yes. We have, for the last few years, had health care as a vertical that we've spent a lot of time and effort trying to cultivate. I think that you've all probably seen news reports of health care workers after work, going to grocery stores or some other place and being harassed by other customers because the customers were afraid that their clothing was contaminated. And hospitals realize that, health care workers realize that, traditionally, particularly in the nursing end of health care, the nurses have bought their own scrubs and taking them home and wash them themselves. There has been a conversion to professional laundering of those scrubs so that health care workers don't take them home, don't wear them out of the hospital and so forth. And that would be something that we could handle for them.
 We have seen customers who have used our services relative to scrub rental in portions of the hospital expand that into other areas of the hospital. And I think that, that is the beginning of a movement we will see more and more of as I look to the future. 
Todd Schneider: Seth, this is Todd. Just to expand upon that. As Scott mentioned, you see the videos, the folks in grocery stores where people are upset because of what is on their garments. And what we're seeing is employers are worried about what people come in contact with from the point they leave their home to the point they arrive at the hospital, and employees are worried about what they're taking home as well, whom they might come in contact with on the way home and what goes into their home laundry. So this professional cleaning, hygienically, clean laundry is really important. And we've had a number of customers, many of which are names you would recognize, that are very interested in broadening these programs to help their employees and their businesses. 
Scott Farmer: And I would just add one more thing. That is not just the big hospital chains. It's also doctors' offices, dentists, health care workers in general. And so we'll -- it's early stage, but we like the momentum that we're seeing there and think that it has an opportunity as we look out in the future for an area of really good growth. 
Seth Weber: Okay. That's super helpful. And Mike, if I could just get a follow up in. Just the delta for the quarter, it came in a little bit better than I think your kind of mid-quarter or late quarter update. Is there anything that you would call out that drove just the relatively better end of the quarter, onetime -- big onetime sales or anything? Or is it just sort of trends just got a little bit better than you expected towards the end of May? 
J. Hansen: Yes. As Todd talked a little bit about it in his remarks, that first aid really finished with a strong May of 40% growth. And as much as anything, it was that kind of performance that led us beyond the guidance that we gave in mid-May. 
Operator: And we'll move on to our next question, and that is from George Tong with Goldman Sachs. 
Keen Fai Tong: Can you provide an update on your uniform rentals' capacity plans, especially with the evolving pace of business reopenings? And what your capacity plans might have in terms of an impact on decremental margins over the next several quarters? 
Scott Farmer: Sure, George. The question is what is our capacity plan? Is that -- just make sure I'm answering it the right way. 
Keen Fai Tong: Yes. Historically or recently, you've indicated that you may -- you intend to maintain the majority of your capacity in anticipation of businesses reopening. And now with the pace of business reopenings, obviously in flux with COVID infections spiking in certain places, what are your latest thoughts on maintaining that capacity? Or will you plan to trim capacity given what we're seeing? 
Scott Farmer: Well, let me sort of give this a broader view of how we've managed this up to this point. Todd mentioned in his remarks that early on, we had daily meetings with our leadership team, and that's HR and IT and my direct reports, the presidents of the divisions, global supply chain. And we covered a number of different things in that -- in those meetings. It started with the safety of our people and how do we get them the right personal protective gear and how do we make sure that people who are arriving at work aren't infected? And how do we take temperature? Where do we get the thermometer? All that sort of thing. And then from there, moving into the customers.
 But part of it also included a review of business and capacity. And generally speaking, we're happy with where we are from a capacity standpoint, although we continue to review it. There is a -- there is -- we announced that we're shutting down an operation in Minnesota. And that was one that we had been looking at for some time. It was an acquired operation. It was an older facility with older equipment and inefficient layout. And in that market, we have capacity to move the volume into other facilities that are more efficient, more modern. And so we announced that we're going to do that. We consistently review the operations and our capacity on a market-to-market basis, and we'll continue to do that looking forward. Todd, you got anything you want to add? 
Todd Schneider: Yes, George. Great question. We're looking at this in the long term. We're excited about the -- where our position -- our business is positioned. We think that the demands for our products and services moving forward are going to be healthy. When we look at it, we think of image, safety, cleanliness, or all things that businesses are very, very interested in. So we're -- we constantly are evaluating our capacity model.
 As you know, capacity is really a local subject. It rolls up to a corporate subject. But we look at it locally, and we're constantly evaluating it, but we're thinking long term. And we like our position and we like where the demand, we believe, is going to be coming for our products and services. 
Keen Fai Tong: Got it. Very helpful. And then as a follow-up, can you provide some additional detail on how revenue trends evolved moving through the quarter? And if your fiscal 1Q outlook assumes stable July run rates in August or if it assumes an improvement off of July levels. 
Scott Farmer: So George, we've seen -- obviously, since the May call, we've seen some nice improvement in the revenue run rates in which we were in the May time frame down in the mid- to high teens. We've seen that reduce to the mid- to high single digits. And we're expecting still a slight improvement but [Audio Gap] and a lot of improvement as we move forward. So we're seeing a little bit of improvement, but not much from this point. 
Operator: We'll move on to our next question, and that is from Hamzah Mazari with Jefferies. 
Hamzah Mazari: My question is on how do you -- the sustainability of first aid organic growth and also, hygiene. If you could touch on what you saw there in terms of growth? And whether you think that's sustainable for the balance of the year? Obviously, demand is still there, but do you think the market's well supplied, whereby that organic run rate drops off? Just any thoughts as to how you're thinking about those 2 specific areas. 
Todd Schneider: Great. Thank you for the question. This is Todd. As Mike and Scott mentioned, trying to forecast out past Q1 is very challenging. And the reason being is the spike in cases recently have changed it. So it seems like every couple 2, 3 weeks is more like 2 or 3 months in the past. So -- but we do see, as cases rise, there's demand for PPE is still strong. As people -- as we believe that drops off with hopefully remedies, vaccine, eventually, people will be back to work, and they'll be consuming more product out of our first aid cabinets. So it's tough to forecast out past Q1. But nevertheless, we think we're in a really good spot. 
Scott Farmer: Hamzah, this is Scott. I would add that I think as a general statement, one of the reasons we saw the big spike of these sales in May is because there was really a rush by just about every business out there to find personal protective gear, hand sanitizer, the things that they need to keep their workplace open and clean. And if they could find somebody who had it, they were buying months' worth of supply because they were afraid that if they came back out into the market again to buy it, it may not be there. So it was almost, to me, like what we would see when we would sell a large direct sale customer. We get a big first upfront order as everybody gets their close, and then it drops off to a more typical run rate after that.
 I think that we're going to continue to see the demand for the masks and the hand sanitizers and that sort of thing, but there was a big upfront purchase, a race to make sure that you had enough of it. And it will settle back into an ongoing demand, certainly not at that 40% run rate.
 Now relative to the hygiene services, my read on that is that, that's a long-term change in the marketplace. I said in the May call that I think that what this pandemic has done to workplace cleanliness and sanitation is similar to what 9/11 did to public building security. We have customers right now that have come to us and said, "Look, I have 7,000 branches. I need hand sanitizer stations at all of them. I need somebody to come by on a regular basis and make sure that they're full. That's for my employees and my customers." We've seen large universities, big 10, Pac-10 universities come to us and have thousands of these hand sanitizer stations put up in their buildings across their campuses.
 They want us to do this because not only do we have the sanitizer and the station available but the service to come by on a regular basis and make sure that they have the supply that they need as opposed to worrying about buying a whole bunch of sort of retail pump bottles, trying to put them in places and having those disappear because people grab them and walk away with them.
 So I think that our service and our service model in these areas is playing a big role in the marketplace today with our existing customers and our ability to sign new customers. And once they start talking to us about things like hand sanitizers and surface sanitizers, spray services and things like that, we start talking about their restroom services. And if they have people that need uniforms, we start talking about uniforms and entrance mats and the rest of the things that go along with that. So from a hygiene standpoint, I'm confident that this trend is going to continue. 
Todd Schneider: One last item on that subject is we -- what Scott mentioned. There's such a need for these products because they need to restore for these folks, whether it's a bank branch or a hotel, whatever, university, they need to restore confidence in their employees, their customers, their students, their guests, whatever it is, and these products are critical to restore their confidence.
 Or -- and then what it's also doing for us is it is allowing -- because it's such an important subject to these folks, it's allowing for us to get an audience at very high levels within organizations. Higher than, in many cases, has ever been before in organizations, and then we're able to speak to the comprehensiveness of what we can provide. And it resonates [Audio Gap] 
Hamzah Mazari: That's very helpful color. Just a follow-up question. I'll turn it over. Just on the SAP system. Could you maybe talk about what kind of data that gives you now relative to what you didn't have before? I realize it's COVID-19 and demand environment is different, so you may see benefits of cross-selling come in later from the SAP. But just for investors, just to get a sense of what do you have today that gives you sort of a full view of the customer that you didn't have before that can maybe help you longer term once you come out of COVID or during COVID even? 
Todd Schneider: Hamzah, thanks again for the questions. This is Todd. SAP is doing a lot of things for us. We are -- we now have one view of our customer. Not completely, right, because we have it in our first aid business and our rental business, but a significant portion of our business. It's helping the speed at which we're able to retrieve data, which is helping us to make decisions in more real-time basis than in the past.
 And it's also helping with some other items that we're doing from a technology standpoint, give the customer a view of their spend with us, helps them be able to manage their business with us. And obviously, there's some other benefits that we're seeing from an ability to reuse products, get a good view of our stock rooms, of our supply chain, et cetera. So it's been very beneficial. 
Operator: And we'll move on to our next question, and that is from Manav Patnaik with Barclays. 
Manav Patnaik: My first question is just around the supply chain that you guys have. You talked earlier in the call about your scale aligned to get additional relationship with vendors and so forth. Just broadly, like has there been any other disruptions? Or would you say net-net, it's been pretty smooth? 
Scott Farmer: Manav, this is Scott. I would say that -- and this -- first of all, I think this goes back to the morning meetings that we were having. We were getting real-time feedback on what was going on in the field, what our customers were looking for, what they needed and that sort of thing. And we got to jump on it early by having the entire group together to say, we need to get out and source face masks, hand sanitizers, all of the hygiene products because there's a huge demand coming. And our supply chain folks did a fantastic job going out and reacting to that.
 And I said on the last call that I think our supply chain has become a competitive advantage for us. We are in good and getting better stock position on most of these items, and we have competitors that are still struggling to source it at all. And so I think that our supply chain has done a great job. So I would say disruption, no, I don't think there's been any disruption. There were some a little bit at the beginning when we first started trying to find some of these things, but they've done a great job in meeting the demand. 
Manav Patnaik: Got it. And just a broader question around managing the cost base. I know there's obviously a lot of uncertainty. You talked about the administrative facility that you were looking at a while back. I think there's another one in the Milwaukee area you closed. But just wondering how you're thinking about what further cost actions you need to take now? Or is it just a wait and see all these things get worse, do you cut more or rationalize more? 
Todd Schneider: Manav, this is Todd. So from a cost standpoint, we know -- we believe we've been through the worst of it. We believe we've shown a great ability to manage through that process. And we're continuing to adjust our cost structure in all facets as we move through this pandemic. We believe it's short term. We believe the long term of our business is -- looks very, very positive. But we've successfully managed through what we believe is the worst of it, and we're going to manage through this process as we move forward, no matter what is thrown at us. 
Operator: And we will move on to our next question, and that is from Andrew Wittmann with RW Baird. 
Andrew J. Wittmann: I guess I wanted to check in a little bit on the competitive environment. Every recession is different. But historically, if volumes wane, sometimes there can be increased price competition. So I was just wondering, Scott or Todd, if you could comment on what you're seeing from the competition, if it's too soon to say or if there have been any changes in the marketplace? What those changes are, if any, and how you're reacting to them? 
Scott Farmer: Andrew, this is Scott. I'll make some comments, and then if Todd has anything he wants to add, I'll turn it over to him. But overall, I think that it's difficult to say so far what's happening from a pricing standpoint as a result of COVID-19. We'll get anecdotal evidence on a market-by-market basis that things are competitive, if somebody is doing some crazy things. But we always seem to get that. I would tell you that one of the things that we have seen and seen evidence of is that we do have some competitors out there who are struggling to service their customers.
 I don't know whether that is supply chain issues that they can't get the product, whether it is that they have service issues or something's happened in their service force or what it is. But we have seen some signs of that. I wouldn't call that a major trend. But I think it is one of the things that is unique about this pandemic is that for one reason or another, some of these businesses are just having a hard time operating as they ordinarily would. Any other feedback? 
Todd Schneider: Yes. I think the other item is, Scott mentioned that our supply chain organization has done an incredible job in helping position us to service our customers properly, and I completely agree with that. But one of the decisions we made very early on in one of the meetings that Scott has -- we've referenced earlier is that even if we're in a position where we are so unique because we have product that others don't, we're going to take a very long-term approach on how we handle that with the customers. We are going to be extremely fair on pricing and approach it as though it's not a onetime sale. It's going to be a long-term customer.
 And so that's how we approached it. Generally speaking, the environment -- the competitive market is, I would say, Andrew, I haven't seen any real change to the landscape besides some one-off items of lack of supply, those types of things where we've garnered an opportunity to -- that we've levered. 
Andrew J. Wittmann: That makes sense. I guess the corollary to that question is, is the stress that's out there in the marketplace, do you think, potentially going to shake loose opportunities for acquisitions in this environment as well? 
Scott Farmer: Well, it's tough to say where and when somebody might decide to sell their business. But you can see a scenario around this in just about any industry where it could cause people to make decisions to sell their business. We obviously are in a position where we could afford to make acquisitions, and that would be something that we would be looking forward to do if the opportunities present themselves. 
Operator: And we'll move on to our next question, and that is from Gary Bisbee with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. 
Gary Bisbee: So I wanted to ask a question about the costs. The first quarter outlook implies sequentially improved revenue but sequentially lower costs. So can you just give us a sense sort of how much costs you've taken out or how we should think about how that will annualize through the P&L when you'll actually see all of that?
 And the last piece of that, should we think that some of the cost takeout you've done is structural? Or is it more really temporary that we should think most of it comes back at some point in the future when revenue begins to trend back to the historical levels? 
Scott Farmer: Well, it's a little bit of all of the above there. We have eliminated all discretionary spending. Business travel is down. As a matter of fact, we're not allowing people to travel right now. So those kind of costs are down. Some training meetings where people ordinarily would be flying and traveling to go to training and staying in hotels isn't happening. Those are happening in Zoom meetings and team meetings and things like that.
 We have made some changes to rightsize the organization from a labor standpoint. Those can and will go up as volume comes back and that sort of thing. We have -- we've eliminated -- we announced that we're going to close one of our operations. That's more of a permanent or at least a longer-term type of thing.
 But we do all of the above, and we'll continue to look at the changing nature of this and we can head in either direction. We can manage the cost as we grow into it. Or if it -- I think in May, there were 44 states that had stay-in-place orders, general business restrictions that shut down businesses in those states. If it goes back to that, well, we know what that world looks like. We've been there. We're off mid- to high teens in revenue, and we know what we need to do to rightsize, to go back to that point. I don't think that direction is going to happen, but we're ready to go in either direction to manage the costs the way they need to be managed in order to continue to help the P&L statement and make a good margin. 
Gary Bisbee: And I know you're not giving guidance beyond this quarter, but would a reasonable way to think about that moving forward be that you think you could manage the cost structure relatively in line with change in revenue?
 So in other words, if Q1 margin actually looks quite strong year-over-year given the revenue headwinds, that you could keep that kind of pacing? Or are there some step function costs that could come back in at some point when you do see revenue much stronger? 
J. Hansen: Yes, Gary, what we saw in the fourth quarter was such a precipitous drop in revenue that's it's hard to react, but we did. And you're seeing some of those benefits of the reaction in the first quarter. Now as we move, Scott talked a little bit about the -- we will adapt to the revenue and the environment as we move forward. But there are going to be some things like discretionary spending and travel that certainly will come back. We still have a hiring freeze on today. And as we get more clarity on the future, we will start to then think quite a bit more about adding to the capacity for growth like we normally would in a kind of normal environment. And we'll get back to that kind of thing.
 But certainly, we're seeing some benefits in the first quarter of the moves and the decisions we made. And we're going to adapt as we move forward into the second quarter and the rest of the year, but it's a little bit unclear still what that environment looks like. And so we'll make -- we'll continue to make decisions rapidly so that we can do our best to adjust to the levels of revenue and the levels of capacity that are necessary. 
Gary Bisbee: If I could sneak one more in. Historically, in Q4, you've given the rentals mix by products. Is that something you have at your fingertips and be willing to share this year? 
J. Hansen: Sure. We -- our uniform rental business was 50% of the rental segment; dust was 18%; hygiene was 14%; shop towels, 4%; linen products, 10%; catalog, 4%. Not a lot of change from the last year in any of those categories. 
Operator: And we'll move on to our next question, and that is from Tim Mulrooney with William Blair. 
Timothy Mulrooney: Scott, you mentioned at the beginning of this call about their -- about being there for your customers when they reopen. What percentage of your customer base would you say has reopened at this point? And also, can you help us understand what those conversations look like? When the customer reopens, is it a slower ramp? Is there any sort of contract renegotiation? Or do you just kind of -- do you just pick up where you left off? 
Scott Farmer: Well, first of all, we're dealing with a business owner or manager who did not make the decision themselves necessarily to shut their business down. And so the conversation is around what are your plans? When do you hope to reopen? Help us understand what you think will happen in your business and how we can help you. Have you furloughed or let go any of your people? We have large customers who have turned to us to help them develop cleaning protocol for their business. We can share some of that with you. Prior to the pandemic, you were just using these services. We have some other services that might help you to make sure that your workplace is clean and sanitized with various products and services that we can provide. Would you like us to help you get set up with those type of things?
 But really, it's to help them get to a point where they reopen. We look at it and say the lifetime value of these customers is really important to us. And we're not here today to talk about the contract and that sort of thing. We're here today to help you get reopened. As your business starts to come back, we can get into all the rest of the details of that sort of thing. And I would tell you, Tim, that we use the Net Promoter Score system to evaluate our customer satisfaction, if you will, with our services. And we have seen a dramatic increase in Net Promoter Scores as we have moved through this pandemic because of the way that we've helped them, because of the advice and the tools and the services that we can have. I would tell you that we're getting letters from presidents and CEOs of pretty big companies because of what we've done to help them, but it has improved our relationship with -- as a general statement, across the board with our customers as we help them through this. And I'm proud of the way that our frontline people have been handling this, and we look forward to helping more and more of these customers come back online. 
Todd Schneider: Tim, this is Todd. We have such a diverse customer base, both by industry and geographically. So that conversation with the customer really depends upon what's going on in their business, where they are geographically. Some of them, they're opening back up and they had no revenue before they opened back up. Some had virtually all their revenue. And that conversation, as you can imagine, varies dramatically depending upon what they were experiencing in their business.
 But generally speaking, most are being -- were impacted, even those who remained open. And we work with them. We work with the customers, and we said, they said, "Hey, we can only afford so much." We said, "Well, let's take the -- let's adjust your spend with us down in this area, but we can help you with these areas that are so critical to restoring confidence in your employees and your customers that they're operating in a safe environment." And that helped them and helped us to -- is helping us to bring more value to our customers. 
Timothy Mulrooney: That's all great color. A strong increase in Net Promoter Scores is an encouraging sign. And good luck next quarter. 
Operator: And we'll move on to our next question, and that is from Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley. 
Toni Kaplan: In the past, you've talked about how about 60% of your growth comes from converting no programmers. And I'm just curious, in this environment, are you seeing a change in that mix? Are you seeing higher growth from existing customers? Or are you seeing maybe new customer signing up for the hygiene products? Just trying to think about how that growth dynamic has been changing in this COVID period. 
Scott Farmer: Toni, this is Scott. It's -- we're a couple of few months into this, so it might be difficult for us to give you any hard data on that. But clearly, for certain products, both existing customers who haven't used it from us in the past and prospects need it. And so we're working very hard on both sides of that to provide that to businesses. I think that there are businesses that may not have typically been users of our services that are looking to us now and saying there's an opportunity. There's a company out there that can provide this stuff to us and provide it on a regular basis, where we don't have to worry about it anymore. We should call them and talk to them.
 So I think there's some opportunity in the no programmer market for us to broaden our opportunity to continue to grow. 
J. Hansen: And Todd, maybe talk a little bit about sales rep productivity that we're seeing right now. 
Todd Schneider: Yes. Thank you, Mike. Toni, what -- our sales and productivity, I am so impressed by their creativity and by their tenacity. They are -- productivity is doing really, really well and it's in part because of our culture, because of our partners. And because we have products and services that people want and need to, again, help restore confidence in their employees and their customers, clients, et cetera.
 So as you can imagine, our sales partners aren't exactly out physically in front of folks nearly as much as they were, but they're busy. They're busy at all-time levels and doing it via calls, Teams calls, Zoom, phone calls, you name it. And we're very encouraged by that. 
Toni Kaplan: That's great. And I was hoping you could give an update on the final amount that you've spent on SAP this year and what you expect to spend next year? And just an update on any benefits that you're seeing so far from the implementation. 
J. Hansen: The spend this year, Toni, has generally been in that recurring -- the implementation costs and the training and consulting costs. And we've talked over the last few years about $12 million annually of that for the last several years. And that amount will drop off as we've completed that rental rollout.
 From the perspective of the benefits, Todd talked a little bit about the information that's available, and sometimes, that's hard to quantify, especially in the short term. But we're seeing the sales rep productivity be good. We're seeing some good information on the one view of the customer, the online portal information. And so those are going to drive some benefits, but it's going to take a little bit of time to see that, and it's pretty difficult at this point to quantify what that might be. 
Toni Kaplan: That's great. And the $12 million goes to $0 next year? 
J. Hansen: Yes. I mean it does drop off. In the -- Toni, in the midst of this changing environment, dealing with the pandemic, it's going to be a little bit hard to say that's going to be x basis points for the year, but that $12 million does drop off as that implementation has been completed. 
Operator: We'll take our next question and that is from Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel Nicholas. 
Shlomo Rosenbaum: Mike, is there any way you could help investors quantify the opportunity for the scrubs rentals in Cintas? Like what's opportunity just in general into health care with that? And how much of your sales are any way into health care? And is there like a way to think about the pull through? Other words, we're hearing a lot of it. This is a great opportunity. And conceptually, we can understand that. We're trying to figure out like when you put pen to paper, what could this mean for you guys? 
J. Hansen: Well, Shlomo, Scott talked about the health care opportunity a little bit earlier, and we love the opportunity. We even -- we loved it before the pandemic. But as we sit here today, we like it even more. It's about 7% of our total revenue, and we think that's got a real opportunity to grow. It's hard to put pen to paper and give you a specific number, especially when we are in the midst of this pandemic environment.
 But we love the opportunity. And when we get things like scrub rental products into hospitals, we are there almost every day, and that invites more and more opportunities, whether it's in microfiber or first aid or other types of Cintas opportunities. We love being there with our customer and talking to them about the challenges that they face. And so it generally can lead to more enterprise-type sales at those big hospitals. 
 And as we move forward, Scott talked a little bit about we're seeing this cleanliness idea move to the smaller health care facilities as well, and that creates opportunity in the scrubs, in the microfiber and other places. So we really do like the opportunity as we move forward, but it's pretty difficult to put a specific number on it right now. 
Shlomo Rosenbaum: All right. I appreciate that. And then maybe just one for Scott. I know you talked enthusiastically about the opportunity you had with your supply chain and that it's a real differentiator and your ability to access very high levels of the organizations now.
 You've had a very long, successful career in this industry. How would you rank this opportunity now versus what you've seen in different points in time of your career in terms of being able to have access and then potentially be able to capitalize on that in terms of driving your business forward in terms of additional sales because of that access at a higher level of the organization? 
Scott Farmer: Well, Shlomo, you're right. I've been around for a while, sometimes longer than I can believe. I've been at this -- I started in 1981 right out of college. So it's -- I've seen a lot happen in this business and in this industry. I have always looked at this business with the thought that we have great opportunities ahead of us. And so it's tough for me to say that this is better than others. But there are people that, when I first started going to the trade association meetings, didn't think the entire industry of the rental industry could do the kind of revenue that our company alone is doing now. And so we've been able to grow through all of this.
 I look out into the future and I say I'm very excited about the opportunities that lie ahead for us relative to our current position, the things that we have to offer businesses across so many different segments that they really, really need right now. I think we're in a very good position. And we -- obviously, all of us need to resolve this pandemic. And I read some great news this morning that one of the reports I saw, I think it was in the Wall Street Journal, said Pfizer thinks that they might have approval sometime in October for a rollout of a vaccine in January. And whether it's January or February or whenever it is, if you think about it, this is July, end of July. And so we're closing in on this race for a vaccine. And hopefully, when that happens, we'll get back to a new normal where all the businesses can open back up. And I think when that happens, we can really maximize our opportunities. 
Operator: We'll take our next question, and that is from Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer. 
Scott Schneeberger: I happen to focus on the travel and hospitality end markets, airlines, cruise, hotel, gaming, which look like they may have a bit of a tail of some trouble. Just curious, your conversations, I know you're not providing guidance beyond the current quarter.
 How should we think, based on conversations you've had with those customers, is the good and the bad of consideration looking out over the coming fiscal year? Just anecdotally, what you think are some puts and takes we should keep in mind? 
Todd Schneider: Scott, this is Todd. Certainly, those folks, those customers in the hospitality business, the travel industry, let's say, have been -- they're facing some serious headwinds. But our conversations with them is that they're looking at it long term. They're certainly worried about business travel coming back. Leisure travel, they think, will bounce back faster. But we're working with them at very high levels. And in the case of a few, specifically, we work on teams to help them with their cleaning protocols to help them establish how to provide a safe environment for their guests. And it really all gets back to confidence that the guests have to feel confident that they can travel and be safe. And we are an important portion of that.
 Now certainly, they're not buying certain products such as garments from us at the rates that we would like, and frankly, that they would like. But we do have other products and services that they need to help restore confidence. And that is an important investment that they have to make prior to even their revenues coming back at large -- to a large degree. So they see that much value in it that they're investing in it in the near term and hoping that the guest traffic comes back. And as you know, that is really a subject that depends upon where they are geographically, what type of properties, et cetera. But we're all in hopes that, as Scott mentioned, that we get to remedies and certainly a vaccine very quickly. That way, the ultimate confidence can be restored. 
Scott Farmer: That is all primarily direct sales business for us as well so -- at least on the uniform side. So the vast majority of that is reflected in our direct sale results. And they obviously have been hit probably the hardest of all of the segments out there. And maybe that means that it's going to take them longer to recover. But at some point, looking out into the future, I think we all agree that we're going to travel somewhere. We're going to stay some place when we get there.
 And as Todd says, their ability to show us as customers of theirs that we're safe, that we are on a clean airplane and staying in a clean hotel and eating at a clean restaurant, the sooner all that happens and they can gain our confidence, the more likely it is that we're all going to begin to take advantage of what they have to offer. But those industries are going to be around. They're not going to go away. This may change it in some ways, but they will be out there, and they will recover. 
Scott Schneeberger: Great. And then just a quick follow-up on -- well, given subject, Scott, you had touched on earlier on the cash availability and consideration of M&A in this environment. Just want a bigger picture of your thoughts on capital allocation for the company because you do have flexibility. Are you going to sit for a while and watch and wait and see what happens and be conservative? Or might we see the -- becoming offensive with M&A, you've addressed, but also other uses of cash, maybe return of capital and thoughts there? 
Scott Farmer: Well, yes, I think that our priorities have been, and I think looking forward, will continue to be that we would like to make acquisitions. We'd like to make investments that would help us continue to grow the business. Mergers and acquisitions would be a great way for us to do that. We also have a long track record of increasing our dividend. And those decisions will be made at a future point about what next year's or what our next dividend would be, but that is an important priority for us.
 And obviously, as you have seen in the past, even into the spring, stock buybacks have played a role when opportunities present themselves. I would say that sort of attitude approach is likely to continue as we look out in the future. When and how much and things like that depend on what opportunities present themselves, but our priorities really haven't changed. If we had an opportunity to make an acquisition now, we would certainly want to look at that and take advantage of that opportunity. 
Operator: At this time, there are no further questions. So I'll turn the conference back over to Mike Hansen for any closing remarks. 
J. Hansen: Well, thank you for joining us this morning, and we look forward to talking with you again after our first quarter, and that will likely be in mid- to late September. So thank you, and have a great rest of your day. 
Operator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference. All participants may now disconnect.

===== 2020 Q3  (2020-03-19 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Cintas Quarterly Earnings Results Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. And at this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Mike Hansen, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Sir, please begin.
Mike Hansen: Thank you and good evening and thanks for joining us tonight. With me is Paul Adler, Cintas' Vice President and Treasurer. We will discuss our third quarter results for fiscal 2020. The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a Safe Harbor from civil litigation for forward-looking statements. This conference call contains forward-looking statements that reflect the Company's current views as to future events and financial performance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those we may discuss. I refer you to the discussion on these points contained in our most recent filings with the SEC. Before discussing the financials I want to say that our thoughts go out to all of those impacted by the COVID-19 Coronavirus. This is a challenging time for all of us and we can't enough our partners -- our employees who we call partners for doing all that they can to keep our customers' places of business clean, safe, and ready for the workday. We currently find ourselves at the peak of uncertainty as it relates to the pandemic's impact on the economy. The response of our country and each state involves daily. A week ago, we hadn’t seen much impact to our business, and we were expecting today to increase revenue and EPS guidance based on our year-to-date results and fourth-quarter outlook. However, much has changed in a matter of days and more changes are likely to come. Due to this uncertainty, including the severity and duration of the pandemic, we're not providing guidance for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 at this time. We certainly remain focused though on the safety and well-being of our employee partners and the care of our customers. So let’s move to providing our third quarter results and then we will open it up for questions. Our fiscal 2020 third quarter revenue was $1.81 billion, an increase of 7.6% over last year's third quarter. Earnings per diluted share or EPS from continuing operations were $2.16, an increase of 17.4% over last year's third quarter adjusted for G&K integration expenses. Free cash flow for this year's third quarter was $300 million, an increase of 17.2%. The organic growth rate which adjusts for the impact of acquisitions, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, and differences in the number of workdays was 5.7% for the third quarter of fiscal '20. The organic growth rate for the uniform rental and facility services operating segment was 4.8%, and the organic growth rate for the first aid and safety services operating segment was 12.5%. Gross margin for the third quarter of fiscal '20 of $824.4 million increased 9.2%. Gross margin as a percentage of revenue was 45.5% for the third quarter of fiscal '20 compared to 44.9% in the third quarter of fiscal '19. Operating income for the third quarter of fiscal '20 of $314.7 million increased 13.1%. Operating margin was 17.4% in the third quarter of fiscal '20 compared to 16.5% in fiscal '19. Net income from continuing operations for the third quarter of fiscal '20 was $234.5 million and reported earnings per diluted share were $2.16. Excluding the G&K acquisition integration expenses in fiscal '19, EPS increased 17.4%. In addition to the solid financial performance, we continue to generate strong cash flow and commit to effectively deploying cash to increase shareholder value. Third quarter free cash flow was $300 million, an increase of 17.2% compared to last year. In the third quarter of fiscal '20, we paid an annual dividend totaling $268 million. The dividend of $2.55 per share was an increase of 24.4% over last year's annual dividend. In addition to the annual dividend, we purchased $393.1 million as Cintas' stock in fiscal '20 to date including $200 million in March. The amount remaining under our buyback authorization is $1.1 billion. We ended our third quarter with fiscal year to date revenue growth of 7.2% and an organic growth rate of 7.1%. Operating income, excluding last year's G&K integration expenses increased 14.7%. EPS adjusted for last year's special items increased 22.2%. And finally free cash flow for the third quarter year-to-date increased 61%. Our employee partners have really done a great job this year. With that, I will turn the call over to Paul for additional details for our third quarter results.
Paul Adler: Thanks Mike. We have two reportable operating segments; uniform rental and facility services and first aid and safety service. The remainder of our business is included in all other. All other consists of fire protection services, and our uniform direct sale business. First aid and safety services and all other are combined and presented as other services on the income statement. The uniform rental and facility services' operating segment includes the rental and servicing of uniforms, mats and towels, and the provision of restroom supplies and other facility products and services. This segment also includes the sale of items from our catalogs to our customers on route. Uniform rental and facility services revenue was $1.45 billion, an increase of 6.6%. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, foreign currency exchange rate changes, and the difference in the number of workdays, the organic growth rate was 4.8%. Our uniform rental and facility services' segment gross margin was 45.8% for the third quarter compared to 44.9% in last year's third quarter, an improvement of 90 basis points. Gross margins have strengthened for many reasons, including strong revenue growth and realization of cost synergies from the acquisition of G&K. Our first aid and safety services' operating segment includes revenue from the sale and servicing of first aid products, safety products, and training. This segment's revenue for the third quarter was $170.5 million. The organic growth rate for this segment was 12.5%. The first aid segment gross margin was 48.0% in the third quarter compared to 48.2% in last year's third quarter. The difference in gross margin was due to revenue mix in the quarter, which consists of service, product sales, and training. The strong organic revenue growth benefited from more safety and personal protective equipment product sales, which generally have lower margins than the other revenue categories. Our fire protection services and uniform direct sales businesses are reported in the all other category. Our fire business continues to grow each year at a strong pace. The uniform direct sale business growth rates are generally low single digits and are subject to volatility such as when we install a multi-million-dollar account. Uniform direct sale, however, is a key business for us and its customers are often significant opportunities to cross sell and provide products and services from our other business units. All other revenue was $192.1 million an increase of 9.9%. The organic growth rate was 7.1%. The fire business organic growth rate was 4.1%. Fire revenue was way down by the loss of a struggling national account in the retail sector that recently disclosed the closing of over 100 stores by mild winter weather that resulted in less sprinkler repair service revenue from freezing and bursting water pipes and by a decline in sales rep productivity through the Christmas and New Year's holidays. Uniform direct sale business organic growth rate was 11.1% and benefited from additional sales from a rollout last quarter of Carhartt branded garments to a Fortune 100 customer. All other gross margin was 41.3% for the third quarter of this fiscal year compared to 42.3% last year. Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue were 28.2% in the third quarter of fiscal '20 and 28.3% in the third quarter of fiscal '19. G&A labor expense as a percent of revenue improved year-over-year. Our effective tax rate on continuing operations for the third quarter of fiscal '20 was 18.9% compared to 20.1% last year. The tax rate can move from period to period based on discrete events, including the amount of stock compensation expense. Our cash and equivalents balance as of February 29 was $234.4 million. Of that amount $144.7 million was in the United States and unrestricted. Capital expenditures in the third quarter were $63.2 million. Our CapEx by operating segment was as follows $50.2 million in uniform rental and facility services, $10.1 million in first aid and safety and $2.9 million in all other. Year-to-date free cash flow was $745.2 million, an increase of 61% compared to the prior year period. Free cash flow increased because of strong earnings growth and improvements in working capital, particularly accounts receivable, inventories, uniforms and other rental items in service and accounts payable. As of February 29 our balance sheet remains strong. Our leverage was 1.7 times debt to EBITDA. We've an untapped credit facility of $1 billion, no debt maturities in the next 12 months and no material debt maturities in the next two years. That concludes our prepared remarks. We are happy to answer your questions.
Operator: [Operator instructions] And first we have Manav Patnaik with Barclays Capital.
Manav Patnaik: Good evening, gentlemen. Just, may be in light of all the stuff going on, perhaps you could help us with a little bit more detail in terms of where your exposures lie; whether that's restaurants, lodging, and so forth, just we at least know magnitude of what percentage of revenues are really at risk versus those that could go like 50-50 or whatever it is. I was hoping you could help us with a little bit more color there.
Mike Hansen: Sure Manav. We're -- as I mentioned a bit earlier, we’re really at the peak of uncertainty. We're -- as of a week ago, we didn't really see much impact to our revenue, and so we're going about trying to get a better understanding of that as we go through this weekend and into the future, but let me remind you, we have a very diverse customer base about 30% of our revenues from industrial, 70% from service providing -- the service providing businesses that include healthcare, retail, distribution centers, food service, hospitality, and all of these are being affected in different ways. If you think about healthcare for example, they really need us now. They need our scrubs, they need our microfiber wipes, they need our cleaning chemicals, they need our fire protection. If think about restaurants, some are closed, some are open to only carry out, and we're learning as we visit them this week what are their needs. They may still need some chef works, some hygiene products, first aid, and safety, but it's going to take a little bit of time to understand what those needs are. Office environments, they're looking to stay clean more than ever; and so we're seeing some nice movement there in terms of our first aid and safety, our personal protective equipment like gloves, and then you think about hotels, casinos, arenas they are doing very much business right now, and so we are in the midst of better understanding the collective impact to the business Manav, and gosh we're so early in that process, but it's really hard to break it down because in addition to the details that I just provided and keeping in mind if you think about three digit NAICS [ph] codes, we don't have revenue of greater than 10% in any of those three digit NAICS codes. But also keep in mind, as I talked about revenue per vertical, it's quite different from geography to geography today. So, if you think about some of those different businesses that are on the coasts, they may be impacted more severely than those same kind of businesses in the same verticals in the middle of the country, and so this is -- it's going to take a little bit of time for us to really get clarity on the collective impact to the business, and we're just not there yet.
Operator: Thank you. Next, we have a question from Andrew Wittmann with RW Baird.
Andrew Wittmann: Great. Thanks. A question that we've gotten a lot this week is how customer closures work and how they affect you and what the contract says when such things happen. I know there's probably different ways to treat different categories of customers; small customers, large customers, maybe even by end market, but for those customers that are shutting down, we know are shutting down, how does that get treated by Cintas and what is the impact to your financials?
Mike Hansen: That a -- it's a great question Andy, and as I said, we're still working on gaining clarity there, but it's going to be all over the board, right. This is not a normal environment; and in a normal environment, we may have a business shut down for a week and we still may be charging the rental of garments and other products. That means holiday manufacturing shutdowns are a good example of that, semester breaks at school is a good example of that. What we're talking about right now is quite different, and so we have to understand from our customers how long do they think they will be closed and many of them right now don't know. But how long do you think they're going to be closed, and what are the needs of the business today versus maybe where they were a couple weeks ago, and so it's going to be all over the board Andy from small businesses to large businesses and different kinds of verticals in different geographies, and as I said we're working through that to gain clarity.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan Securities.
Andrew Steinerman: Hi Mike. Let me give it a try. So, my sense, I’ve been on this for over a decade looking at Cintas and the group, and my sense is that the uniform rental business really is kind of cyclical on a delay, like when you look at your fiscal 2008, it was actually up. It wasn't until 2009 and 2010 fiscals, you did have kind of moderate declines about 5% organic per year for those two years. So, my question really is, do you think that the impact that you’ve experienced now will be more immediate or do you think it's good to be a delay like I described last recession.
Mike Hansen: Yeah Andrew, this is not, this is not a normal recession or even like the great recession, and so I think there's going to be -- there is going to be a more immediate impact simply because we have -- we have so many businesses that have been ordered to close, right. We've got -- 40 states have closed their schools. I think another over 20 states have closed their restaurants. That's unprecedented, and it's not like our customers are going out of business over time or even had the chance to reduce their workforce. They are kind of closing, many of them on orders of municipalities. And so, there's going to be a little -- there going to be certainly a more immediate impact. What is that impact? Look, one of the reasons that we did not provide guidance is it's really hard to tell. We've never been through a pandemic, and in this pandemic we're seeing things that we really haven't seen in the 90 years of Cintas of running the business, and so we're -- we need a little bit of time for clarity. As I said, we haven't seen much of an impact as of a week ago, but there is going to be an impact coming, and that's why -- that's why we did not provide guidance because it's just too hard to tell right now.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Seth Weber with RBC Capital Markets.
Seth Weber: I guess just following up on that line of questioning, I think in 2010 your decrement margins were sort of mid-30%. I guess Mike just trying to read what you're saying it seems like the impact could be rather shock. So from a detrimental margin framework, should we think about levels above kind of where you were in the last time that organic growth was down that kind of what you're messaging, thanks.
Mike Hansen: Sure. So if think about the fixed versus variable and how can we -- how will we manage the business right through this disruption and right now there is a fair amount of uncertainty as I've mentioned a number of times and we need a little bit more clarity and the clarity and as it relates to this is really around what's the -- what's the depth of this what's the breath of this, how long will this last, what's the severity and duration? If we start to believe that for example the severity is pretty high but we don't expect the duration to last very long, then we may not be as aggressive because we don't want to harm the long-term opportunities and the performance of the business as we move into the next fiscal year. As we go into this, if we feel like the duration is going to be longer then we may take different steps to pull down some of those variable expenses and so we're going to need a little bit of time to understand what our best expectations are for severity and duration and we'll manage accordingly to that. I can tell you as we sit here today we are generally and we have been for a long time in a mode of growing the business and adding routes and adding laundry capacity and as we sit here today, I would we have not or at least we've slowed CapEx for example to only those things that are essential. And so in other words we're not looking to add routes right now that will reduce CapEx. We're not looking to expand capacity and our wash alleys, add extra -- open new processing facilities, that's going to reduce CapEx. Along those lines that means we likely won't be hiring people to staff those new routes, to staff the adding capacity and so those are -- there are certainly things that we can do today to say we expect to get into a period where the growth isn’t going to be what it was in the first three quarters and so we can pull back on that a little bit and that certainly is going to help the cash flow, but as it relates to then being more aggressive, we are -- we're here for the long term and if we feel like this is a short duration disruption we'll likely treat that a little bit differently than a longer-term duration.
Operator: Thank you, Sir. Our next question will come from George Tong with Goldman Sachs.
George Tong: Oil prices have contracted sharply in recent weeks, what are your expectations for your industrial and manufacturing verticals and what factors could potentially cause Cintas to perform differently during this energy downturn compared to the prior 2014 to 2016 downturn?
Mike Hansen: Well I think George if we were looking at this only in the lands of the oil and gas vertical then I'd say a couple things. One, it's a smaller piece of our business than it was at the beginning of that last downturn and so that will not have as big of an impact on us as it did last time and the lower gas prices will certainly help us today. And so if we're just looking at the lens of that particular or maybe a few verticals, I think we fair really well during that and we did several years ago as well, but this is broader, this is certainly broader than just that one lens and so it's going to be really hard to tell exactly how do we think we performed in that one vertical compared to what's going on in the rest of the United States.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Gary Bisbee with Bank of America, Merrill Lynch.
Gary Bisbee: Hey. Good afternoon. In the earlier question about cost actions you referenced variable versus fixed but actually didn’t give us the mix of the two. Can you take a shot at that and may be just at a high level if you do decide that this could be longer duration what are the kind of actions you would take? Is it just headcount or are there other actions you would take to reduce cost, thank you.
Mike Hansen: Well so Gary if you think about our business there are many variable costs in the business. The question is are they variable to the point where we can turn them off immediately and do we want to turn them off immediately, that's the biggest question there we're dealing with and it's really I think you're responsible as me to give you a percentage of just total variable costs because we have to manage the business and we're managing it for the long-term and so I'm not -- I don't want to throw out some variable number that where you think we will cut to the bone our business. So let me give you some examples though. When you think about the material cost of the business, we've got a lot of cost of disposable products like paper soaps. We have direct sale like our catalog business those are highly variable and if we're not selling them, we don't have those costs. We also have the gas, water and energy, the gas for our trucks, the water energy for running the facilities. There certainly is a variable component of that, but there's also a bit of a fixed and it just depends on how much of that capacity we may decide or not to pull back on. Then if you think about the laundry capacity there are a lot of different pieces that go into that including labor and then when you think about our route capacity we got the cost of our drivers and so there are a lot of variable costs. Our goal is to make sure that our business remains strong for the long term and so if we start to see a longer duration then there are certainly some things that we will do like pullback even a little harder on capital expenditures and other growth pieces of what we do. We may do some things through attrition and we'll have to make sure we understand the capacity utilization and knowing that we want to manage through that. If you go back to '09 and '10, we did close facilities but that was a little bit -- that was a little bit different than that. It was a longer period of a recession. This is potentially deep, but we just don't know the duration and we do not want to impact the business for the long term until we really have to.
Operator: Thank you, Sir. Our next question comes from Hamzah Mazari with Jefferies.
Hamzah Mazari: Mike, if you could just provide just a little more detail on your contract structure and what I mean by that is if a customer goes bankrupt clearly you see that right away, if it's a closure but how quickly do your contracts adjust to permanent headcount changes. Just any sense as to how defensive your portfolio is but specifically what's the lead lag to headcount changes that may be permanent. I realize absences don't impact your business.
Mike Hansen: Our contracts are generally five-year contracts and they provide for a steady stream of revenue and generally there is some minimum level of revenue that we require but Hamzah we're in a little bit of a different time today and so there's going to be a customer by customer conversation about what makes sense and that's going to take a little bit of time to get through. This is again this is not a normal kind of ramping down a trending down of the business. This is kind of an abrupt closure of a lot of different customers but let's remember something else about our business. As I mentioned a little bit earlier, there are a number of -- there are many businesses that really need our products and services and I don't want that to be lost. There been a couple municipalities in areas within the country particularly on the coasts and we have been identified as an essential provider and so even though other businesses may be shutting down, we are operating because our customers need us and we're going to over the course of the next few weeks, we're going to understand the collective impact but let's keep in mind that while some of our customers are going to be impacted negatively, there are others that really need us, we're seeing an increase in what they need and we're going to do everything we can to take care of them. So it's a mix and we're going -- it's going to take a little bit of time to understand that and give some clarity.
Operator: Thank you, Sir. Our next question comes from Tim Mulrooney with William Blair.
Tim Mulrooney: I understand the forearm is very different Mike, but if you go back to the last recession and I can't remember if you broke this out or not, but how did customer retention look through that period. I'm trying to figure out how much of that mid-single digit organic decline in '09 and '10 was due to a deterioration in retention rates versus new customer sales that we're pricing for example?
Mike Hansen: The retention was not negatively impacted that much. It was more about customers reducing their headcount. We certainly did have more customers than normal periods do lot of business and so that contributed to a little bit of a higher loss business number, but generally speaking our retention was really good. And I think our attention outside of possible businesses that actually have to go out of business, I think our retention is going to be very good here. It's going to just -- there's going to be some period of disruption that we have to work ourselves through. I think we have to be careful about comparing this to a prior recession. This is a pandemic that's quite different and the destruction is going to be a little bit more abrupt and immediate. The question is how long will it last and boy if we can get through this as a country in the next 60-90 days, we look forward to getting back to normal operations, but we have to see what that looks like first.
Operator: Next we have a question from Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel Nicolaus Investments.
Shlomo Rosenbaum: Can you talk about how many of your contacts let's say percentage wise like first safety are those primarily consumption-based contracts or are they contracts that are kind of a recurring revenue, you charges for about per month. Can you go into that a little bit more because first aid and safety has been a very good growth portion of the business, just wondering how those contracts work?
Mike Hansen: Generally those are based on -- there are some recurring revenue streams. I would tell you the bulk of that is consumption-based and the business is performing very, very well right now as you can imagine with the need for sanitizing personal protective equipment. That's a business that is performing very well it has for the whole year and we're getting a lot of customer requests for more ways to help. When you think about the needs of many businesses today, the cleanliness and the safety aspects have really risen and we've got a lot of products and services that can help in those areas and those have been asked for quite a bit over the course of the last couple weeks and I expect that those things will perform well.
Operator: Our next question comes from Kevin McVeigh with Credit Suisse.
Kevin McVeigh: Can you give us a sense of not only the client mix but what was the revenue trends the last week or so just to get a sense of how much the business came off and then just is there any way to think about it geographically because it sounds like California, New York, Washington maybe that's been a little bit weaker than the interior, but just any thoughts on trends the last week or so and is there any way to kind just bring that out, within a little more context geographically?
Mike Hansen: Unfortunately Kevin through the last week we didn't see much disruption to the revenue. In our direct sale -- uniform direct sale business we did start to see the incoming orders start to come down and so that was -- that was probably the early signs, but through last week not a lot of impact. There have been certainly some impact on the coasts and so for example all of our customers in New Rochelle they're hard to get to as you can imagine with the National Guard patrolling the streets there. That's been difficult. There are others that have been difficult on the West Coast as well, but collectively it wasn't that big of an impact. I expect that we will start to see some impact as we go through the rest of this week and certainly then in next week and that's when we're going to start to be able to get a little clarity on what's the initial response of our customers and what might there need to be as we move as we move through. And like I said there are going to be some customers where there needs have really increased. There are going to be others who have closed and we're going to be talking about a different -- there's a different conversation there. We need to get through all those conversations though.
Operator: Our next question comes from Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer & Co.
Scott Schneeberger: I guess you’ve alluded to CapEx a few times, just looking at it year to date, you're trending I think your guidance at the midpoint this year was the same as what you did last year but your trending about $17 million below for my numbers. So I just care it would be delve into CapEx a little bit more and I think you had said you had already taking some action with regard to what you’ve been seeing over the last weeks or months. So just kind of delve in a little bit more on what you would be thinking about on a go forward basis as well thanks.
Mike Hansen: Sure when I mentioned that we've made some decisions to reduce CapEx that's a very, very recent type of conversation. We are going to look, we are when we think about CapEx, we love to grow the business and we are -- we have been expanding the routes as necessary and expanding capacity, but we've also keep in mind we've gotten some capacity through the G&K deal and we've gotten some efficiency through projects within the facilities and our routes -- the revenue per route has been growing and so we've become a little bit more efficient and so we've been pretty efficient and I would say prudent in CapEx throughout the year. But having said that going forward we've been at let's call it a $50 million $65 million quarterly clip and certainly that's going come down probably by half. Now I don't have a very -- I don't have a scientific measurement but it's going to come down quite a bit as we think about the fourth quarter. Beyond the fourth quarter it's going to get back to our expectation for the severity and duration of this.
Operator: Our last question in the queue comes from Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley.
Toni Kaplan: Thank you to save the best for the last. I am going to take the road less travel then ask a question about the quarter. Can you talk about the organic growth deceleration within the uniform rental space? It sounds like it wasn't related to coronavirus since you hadn't really seen an impact from that yet. So I guess just what were that main drivers of the deceleration within rental? Thank you.
Mike Hansen: We've talked a little bit over the last two quarters about the choppiness that we've seen in industrials and we certainly saw that pick up a little bit in our third quarter. Now whether that has to do with China in the early parts of the quarter, not sure or the uncertainty around this, that's really hard to put our finger on, but we certainly did see some choppiness in that side of the business and contributed to a little bit of a deceleration there. Pricing was a bit more aggressive in the quarter. We talked a little bit about that in our second quarter and that remained here in the third quarter and the holidays I mentioned this in the second quarter call back in December, the holidays are tough what you've got two holidays on a Wednesday, generally speaking our sales people have a really hard time of setting appointments and so you if you think about a two-week period of time where you've got many customers because it's on a Wednesday taking the whole week off or in and out, it's really hard to set appointments. And so we did see some impact to our sales rep productivity. Paul mentioned in fire and also in rental and that was a bit of a contributor as well. So collectively those things we're what we saw in the third quarter. Let's set aside the pandemic, the business has been operating at a very healthy pace and we really like the execution of it and while the disruption is coming, we think we're poised pretty well to manage through that and get back on to our business once we get through this.
Operator: Thank you, Sir. That concludes the question-and-answer session for today's call and I would like to turn the call back to Mr. Hansen for closing remarks.
Mike Hansen: Thank you and before ending the call, we would like to leave you with a couple final comments. For someone to say again that our thoughts remain with those impacted by the COVID-19 coronavirus as our country works to get through this difficult situation as quickly as possible. But secondly, our business has performed very well over the course of the last 10 years with strong revenue, income and EPS growth. In fact we've grown our sales and profit in 48 of the last 50 years and although we're entering a period of disruption, we and all Cintas partners remain excited about the future opportunities of our business and look forward to getting back to business as usual. In the meantime we are well-positioned to enter this period of disruption with a strong cash flow, a very solid balance sheet and an uncapped $1 billion credit facility. So we feel good about our ability to manage through this and come out the other side with a very strong business. So thank you again for joining us tonight. We'll issue our fourth quarter financial results in July and we look forward to speaking with you again at that time.
Operator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's teleconference and you may now disconnect. Please enjoy the rest of your day.

===== 2020 Q2  (2019-12-17 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day. And welcome to the Cintas Quarterly Earnings Results Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. And at this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Mike Hansen, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead, sir.
Mike Hansen: Good evening. And thank you for joining us tonight. With me is Paul Adler, Cintas' Vice President and Treasurer. We will discuss our second quarter results for fiscal 2020. After our commentary, we will be happy to answer questions. The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a Safe Harbor from civil litigation for forward-looking statements. This conference call contains forward-looking statements that reflect the Company's current views as to future events and financial performance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those we may discuss. I refer you to the discussion on these points contained in our most recent filings with the SEC. Revenue for the second quarter of fiscal 2020 was a record $1.84 billion, an increase of 7.3% over last year's second quarter. The organic growth rate, which adjusts for the impacts of acquisitions and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, was also 7.3%. In the second quarter of fiscal '20, the organic growth rate for the Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segment was 5.8%, and the organic growth rate for the First Aid and Safety Services operating segment was 10.6%. Gross margin for the second quarter of fiscal '20 of $852.4 million increased 10%. Gross margin as a percent of revenue was 46.2% for the second quarter of fiscal '20 compared to 45.1% in the second quarter of fiscal '19. Uniform Rental and Facility Services' operating segment gross margin as a percentage of revenue improved 130 basis points from last year's second quarter to 46.6%, and the First Aid and Safety Services operating segment gross margin improved 40 basis points to 48.4%. Operating income for the second quarter of fiscal '20 of $334.5 million increased 21.3%. Operating margin was 18.1% in the second quarter of fiscal '20 compared to 16% in fiscal '19. Operating income in the second quarter of fiscal '19 was impacted by integration expenses related to the G&K acquisition of $7.8 million or 50 basis points. Net income from continuing operations for the second quarter of fiscal '20 was $246.4 million and reported earnings per diluted share were $2.27. Excluding the one-time gain on the sale of a cost method investment and the G&K acquisition integration expenses, both in fiscal '19, EPS increased 29%. As our Chairman and CEO, Scott Farmer who's quoted in today's earnings press release, we are pleased with our second quarter and year-to-date performance. We thank our employee partners for continuing to execute well and take great care of our customers. In addition to the strong financial performance, we continue to generate strong cash flow and commit to effectively deploying cash to increase shareholder value. On December 6th, we paid an annual dividend of $2.55 per share, an increase of 24.4% over last year's annual dividends. We've increased the dividend for 36 consecutive years. In the past 10 years, the annual dividend per share increased at a compound annual growth rate of 18.2%. Before turning the call over to Paul for more details, I'll provide an update of our fiscal '20 expectations. We have increased our expectations of financial performance. We expect revenue to be in the range of $7.29 billion to $7.33 billion. We expect EPS to be in the range of $8.65 to $8.75. Note the following regarding the guidance. The growth rate at the revenue guidance range is 5.8% for 6.4%. However, our fiscal '20 contains one less workday than our fiscal '19. Adjusting for this one day difference, on a constant workday basis, the revenue growth rate range at guidance is 6.2% to 6.8%. One less workday also has a negative impact on EPS, reducing it about $0.06, which is 90 basis points drag on the EPS growth rate. Adjusting for this, the EPS growth rate range is 14.7% to 16%. Guidance assumes an effective tax rate for fiscal '20 of 19.2% compared to a rate of 19.7% for fiscal '19. Keep in mind that the tax rate can move up or down from period-to-period based on discrete events, including the amount of stock compensation expense. It assumes a share counts for computing EPS of 109 million shares. This consists of diluted weighted average shares outstanding plus participating securities in the form of restricted stock. The guidance does not assume any future share buybacks or any additional G&K integration expenses. I'll now turn the call over Paul.
Paul Adler: Thank you, Mike. Please note that our fiscal '20 contains one less workday than in fiscal '19. One less day will negatively impact fiscal '20 total revenue growth by 40 basis points. To illustrate the magnitude of the headwinds, using fiscal '19's annual revenue, one less workday equates to about $27 million. One less workday also has a negative impact on operating margin and EPS. Fiscal '20 operating income margin will be reduced by about 12.5 basis points in comparison to fiscal '19 due to one less day of revenue. The negative impact on the margin occurs because certain expenses, like amortization of uniforms and entrance mats, are expensed on a monthly basis as opposed to on a daily basis. And we will have one less day of revenue to cover the expenses. As Mike stated, one less workday is a headwind of about 90 basis points on EPS growth, and about a $0.06 drag on total EPS in comparison to fiscal '19. Each quarter of fiscal '20 contains 65 workdays. In comparison to fiscal '19, our upcoming Q3 of fiscal '20 will have one additional day, and our Q4 will have one less day. Please keep the quarterly day differences in mind when modeling our fiscal '20 results. We have two reportable operating segments, Uniform Rental and Facility Services and First Aid and Safety Services. The remainder of our business is included in All-Other. All-Other consists of Fire Protection Services and our Uniform Direct Sale business. First Aid and Safety Services and All-Other are combined and presented as Other Services on the income statement. The Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segment includes the rental and servicing of uniforms, mats and towels and the provision of restroom supplies and other facility products and services. The segment also includes the sale of items from our catalogs to our customers on ramp. Uniform Rental and Facility Services revenue was $1.47 billion, an increase for 5.7%. Excluding the impact of acquisitions and foreign currency exchange rate changes, the organic growth rate was 5.8%. Our Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment gross margin was 46.6% for the second quarter compared to 45.3% in last year's second quarter, an improvement of 130 basis points. Operating Income margin was a record 19.5% for the second quarter and it was 19% year-to-date. Profit margins have strengthened for many reasons including strong revenue growth and realization of profit synergies from the acquisition of G&K. Our First Aid and Safety Services operating segments includes revenue from the sale and servicing of first aid products, safety products and training. The segment's revenue for the second quarter was $169.7 million. The organic growth rate for the segment was 10.6%. The First Aid segment gross margin was 14.4% in the second quarter compared to 14% in masters second quarter, an increase of 40 basis points. First Aid segment gross margins continued to increase with strong revenue growth. Our Fire Protection Services and Uniform Direct Sale businesses are reported in all other categories. Our fire business continues to grow each year at a strong pace. Uniform Direct Sale business growth rates are generally low single digits and are subject to volatility, such as when we install a multimillion dollar account. Uniform Direct Sale, however, is a key business for us and its customers are often significant opportunities to cross sell and provide products and service from our other business units. All Other revenue was $204.1 million, an increase of 17.2%. The organic growth rate was 16.5%. The Fire business organic growth rate was 9.6%. Uniform Direct Sales business saw an exceptionally strong quarter, posting an organic growth rate of 25%. Growth was driven in large part due to the rollout of Carhartt branded garments to a Fortune 100 customer. All Other gross margin was 41.8% for the second quarter of this fiscal year compared to 41.2% last year. Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue were 28.1% in the second quarter of fiscal '20 and 28.6% in the second quarter of fiscal '19. Improvement was realized in many areas, including lower G&A labor expense as a percentage of revenue. Last quarter, we mentioned that medical expense as a percent of revenue spiked. It came back in line in the second quarter as we expected. Our effective tax rate on continuing operations for the second quarter of fiscal '20 was 20.1%. Stock based compensation positively impacted the tax rate. As Mike stated earlier, the tax rate can move from period-to-period based on discrete events, including the amount of stock compensation expense. Our cash and equivalents balance as of November 30th was $226.5 million. Year-to-date, operating cash flow increased about 66% from last year, because of strong earnings growth and improvements in working capital, particularly accounts receivable, inventories, uniforms and other rental items in service and accounts payable. Capital expenditures in the second quarter were $61.4 million. Our CapEx by operating segments was as follows; $48.6 million in Uniform Rental and Facility Services, $10.8 million in First Aid and Safety, and $2 million in All Other. We expect fiscal '20 CapEx to be in a range of $265 million to $290 million. As of November 30th, total debt was $2,738.4 million. $2,538.6 million was fixed interest rate debt and $199.8 million was variable rate debt in the form of a term loan. At November 30th, our leverage was 1.8 times debt-to-EBITDA. That concludes our prepared remarks. We are happy to answer your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from Toni Kaplan at Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Toni Kaplan: You had a pretty solid beat in the quarter, but only a modest 2% raise for the full year. Could you just talk about your expectations around maybe the broader macro and anything else that might be one-time in the quarter, or might reverse as we go through the year? Just wondering why not a bigger raise? Thanks.
Mike Hansen: And Toni, you are speaking of revenue right now. Correct?
Toni Kaplan: Yes.
Mike Hansen: And so, from a -- let's talk about the quarter. We had a very good quarter. The -- all of our businesses grew, and in particular our direct sale business had a really nice quarter. Toni, you'd asked a little bit about the macro first. And I would say not a lot of change during the quarter. We did say at the beginning of the quarter that energy, we were starting to see a little bit of softness in the energy area. We did see a little bit of that during the quarter. In fact, we had one fairly good sized customer in the space go bankrupt. But I would say, the other thing is, industrials are a bit choppy, generally speaking. Having said that, not a lot of change during the quarter. We are encouraged, as we kind of forward, we are encouraged that we've -- it looks like we've made some progress in the USMCA and China trade and we're encouraged by the movement there and we look forward to getting those results. It seems like we seen a little bit of a steady direction out of the Fed on interest rates. And so, as we leave the second quarter, I would say there are some encouraging signs, but there's still we're entering the election year, there still is a lot going on in terms of the noise in the marketplace, and whether or not small business and other businesses will continue to invest. And so we still look a little bit with caution as we think about the second half of the year. As it relates to the guidance, look, we had a very good first half of the year. Our partners did a great job, and the year is playing out generally as we expected. We had growth of roughly 7%. Organic growth of over 7% for the first half of the year, but we also have some things that went our way. I talked a little bit about this in the first quarter where rental probably got a little bit of year-over-year benefit in the first quarter and that certainly helped as we kind of were finding the bottom last year in our rental business as we've lapped the G&K acquisition. So again, a little bit of benefit in the first half there. We talked about pricing being incrementally positive in the fourth quarter and the first quarter, maybe not quite as incrementally positive in the second quarter but certainly, some benefit in the first half of the year. I would expect that that we'll fall back into kind of the pricing range we've been in the last few years. When you think about the Direct Sale business, we talked about that, we referred of that a few times, had a great year in the first half. In the second half, our expectation is, as this business can be lumpy that we'll be flat to down in that. And so just that alone is about 75 basis points of growth impact when you compare the first half to the second half. I talked a little bit about the outlook on the macro. And so as we think about the second half, we're thinking about the macro. We're thinking about -- there are some things that really went well in the first half, may not get all of that benefit in the second half. Having said all of that, look, it's -- our same work day growth is 6.2 to 6.8, and the year is shaping up pretty much the way we expected it to. And if we can hit those kind of numbers, that's a really nice year for us.
Toni Kaplan: And just wanted to ask about buybacks, you really pulled back pretty dramatically this quarter. Just wanted to get some color around, how we should be thinking about any sort of change to capital deployment philosophy, or just why it's very minimal buybacks this quarter?
Mike Hansen: Yes, we do have -- we've got the authorization of about 1.2 billion. And we look at that, as we talked about, we look at that opportunistically. One thing to keep in mind is we, in the first week of December, we made $268 million payment related to our dividend, and we also have some debt interest payments. So we're back into CP in the month of December, but we will look at the buyback opportunistically as we move through the rest of the year. And specifically to your question, we have not made any changes to the way we think about capital allocation.
Operator: We will now take the next question from Hamzah Mazari at Jefferies. Please go ahead.
Hamzah Mazari: My first question is just on the SAP rollout sort of just any update there. Specifically, where do you see benefits once that's rolled out in April or May next year? Is that going to be an organic growth through cross-selling, or do we see sort of SG&A come off? Any color as to benefits of that rollout?
Mike Hansen: Hamza, we're about 85% of the way through our SAP journey at this point in time, so we've made some good progress in the quarter. And we're still on track to complete the project by the end of the fiscal year. As far as benefits are concerned, I think the benefits from SAP are going to be kind of throughout the P&L. We've talked about some of them already that that can be achieved by locations individually, better technology in the hands of the people providing the services, better information at their disposal, the ability for our accounting and finance people and operations people to look at data from the very back of the house all the way to invoicing and pricing with the customer. But then there are other benefits to that that we believe will be benefiting the top-line later on and more perhaps impactfully when the entire network is in the system. But certainly, we believe that putting the Uniform Rental business and our First Aid business in the same operating system will foster more collaboration, more cross-selling, which will help the top-line. And just better, as I mentioned earlier, use the data, looking at our big, large national accounts, from city-to-city-to city to do analyses and make sure that we're getting all the entitled revenue that we should for the agreements, make sure the pricing is appropriate for the contract. So lots of opportunities, but not able to quantify anything at this point in time. As I said, we'll complete that rollout this fiscal year and have more color next fiscal year for you.
Hamzah Mazari: And just a follow-up question and I'll turn it over. When you think about M&A outside of core Uniform Rental and the businesses you're in. What are some of the metrics you're looking at? I know you want to touch more businesses. I assume it's our base. Does it have to be accretive to growth, accretive to margin? I know you guys just did shred it a long time ago and that business got sold. We did G&K that was part of the core. Just any color as to metrics you can share, how you think of our larger M&A outside the core? Thank you.
Mike Hansen: First of all, we work for B2B. We love the recurring revenue nature of our kinds of businesses. Route based is preferred but it's not absolutely necessary. The key is what kind of service, can we add to provide some level of value to the customer. So that's the real key. We would want it to be an opportunity that can add value to many of our customers, not just a small subset, and we would want it to have margin potential. So you asked, does it need to be growth accretive and margin accretive. We certainly would love it to be, but there really aren't that many out there, we're looking hard for them. But those are the kind of things that we will look for. Recurring revenue streams, can it benefit our current customers, is it a large opportunity for us, or is it very narrow, what's the service component.
Operator: We'll now take our next question from Manav Patnaik at Barclays. Please go ahead.
Manav Patnaik: My first question is just can you just walk us through why the lower CapEx assumption and then maybe just some context when you look at the -- over the next two to three years, I guess where are your greatest investment means?
Mike Hansen: We -- generally, we are making our CapEx in terms of our growth opportunities, like new routes and then -- and adding capacity. I would say we continue to add the routes. So in other words, buying trucks and that is certainly important for us. But as it relates to laundry capacity, for example, we've got some really interesting projects that are going on that that we think can help us out in certain cases. And so, we're seeing a little bit of a benefit because of that. I've talked a little bit about G&K auto source that that's kind of a quasi auto source that helps us in certain facilities. And we're moving on rolling out some of those kind of things. We're looking at things like efficiency in the wash alley. And then we certainly still have a little bit of the capacity that we have gotten from the G&K acquisition. So, the combination of all of those things has created efficiency opportunities for us, particularly in the production environment, and you're seeing a little bit of that benefit in our gross margin.
Manav Patnaik: And then just in terms of G&K and maybe tied to the SAP implementation. Are there systems I guess on SAP as well? And is it still too hard for you guys to quantify any revenue synergies that you might be getting from that deal?
Mike Hansen: Well, keep in mind we converted all G&K locations to either the Cintas SAP system or the legacy Cintas system, so that we could fully get off of that system. And that was completed, gosh, probably over a year ago. And so we still have some of those that need to get from the Cintas legacy system to SAP. And so we inserted those locations as it made sense into the SAP rollout. And so we're almost there. Paul said we're 85% of the way there in total in terms of the conversion and we made good progress. So we have a pretty good handle on in terms of viewing the G&K legacy locations in much the same way that we're viewing the Cintas location. And so we see some benefits, so I would call them anecdotal. We need to get all the way on SAP before we really start taking advantage of the power of that information.
Operator: We'll now take our next question from Andrew Steinerman at JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Andrew Steinerman: Mike, you mentioned that you just treat G&K legacy locations like Cintas locations. Want to know about the inventory? I mean, how much of the uniforms today are still the G&K uniforms? And when you convert over and introduce Cintas uniforms, which are presumably better uniforms. G&K legacy customers, how they responded and has there been a price adjustment since they are getting better uniforms?
Mike Hansen: From an inventory conversion standpoint, we are in the midst of that. And those happened at different such times, Andrew. So for example, if we have a customer that's got 10 wears, for example, in legacy G&K inventory, we maybe in a style where as they turn, in other words, as they have turnover and they replace their open positions with new hires and we put them into legacy G&K current garments, there's going to be a point in time at which we run out of those garments, whether it's the style or the size. And that happens at very different intervals depending on the kind of garment that they have. And so it is a customer-by-customer approach. When they start to run out of -- when we start to run out of G&K legacy garments, we will start to put them into Cintas garments and generally, that can be all at once, because we don't want them to have different looks. But as I said, that is a customer-by-customer decision point based on the style. So, it's really hard to give you a full percentage, because it's happening all over the country. We are not finished with that. We are still working our way through G&K legacy inventory. When they get on to Cintas inventory, as you know, pricing becomes a customer-by-customer conversation as well. And there may be some where we -- there is no change at all and we put them in something that's, let's say, at a work wear type of a garment. There may be others where we give them an opportunity to upgrade into a Carhartt garment, for example. And in that case, there may be times where we will increase the pricing, or adjust the pricing as its necessary. So it is a customer-by-customer decision on when to convert and then it's also a customer-by-customer decision on what does that pricing and what does that contract look like.
Andrew Steinerman: And do you think the customer recognizes that the Cintas uniform on average is a better uniform than the legacy uniforms they had?
Mike Hansen: I can give you anecdotally, the answer is yes. We need to be doing a pretty good job of showing why they're moving into a Cintas garment, and what are the features and functions of that new garment. It may be that it's softer, it may be that it little bit better, it maybe that is -- that the fabric breath is a little bit better. And generally when we explain those kinds of features to the customer, they get it and they understand. And it doesn't take very long for them to be in those garments to recognize that there's a quality difference.
Operator: We'll now take the next question from Gary Bisbee at Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Gary Bisbee: I guess the first question from me, just the Uniform Rental revenue slowed somewhat, obviously, at a much tougher comp, but anything other than that. I guess you mentioned a little weaker energy, anything other than that you would call out as sequential deceleration in the organic constant currency revenue growth?
Mike Hansen: Yes, I don't think it's anything of real significance. But I would point to the three things I mentioned earlier; a little bit of the absence of that lapping; a little bit of the choppiness in the energy and maybe industrials, generally; and pricing maybe wasn't quite as incrementally positive as we've seen in previous two quarters. I think those things kind of capture what we saw in the quarter. Still a good quarter for us, but I think those things capture.
Gary Bisbee: And then you have been asked for a few years about cross-sell potential, both with G&K and just more broadly against your different businesses. And I realized you don't have the data and haven't provided real granular color. But, can you give us any sense like as your salespeople for the main business go out, how often are they targeting people that are customers through your other businesses? How important is cross-sell in terms of how you are trying to compensate the different types of sales people? Is it really something you focused a lot on to-date or should we think that the data that SAP will provide is really going to be the key to unlocking that more broadly?
Mike Hansen: We do spend a lot of time with that today, Gary. You know our SSRs are looking for opportunities. We have our, we call them market development reps, who are looking at that some of our more complex customers and looking for upsell and penetration opportunities there. And we've become a bit better at cross-sell between Rental and First Aid and Fire. I think we still have some ways to go there to take advantage of all of that opportunity. But we are starting to spend more time than in the past. So it has been important to us. And I think we've been doing a pretty good job at that over the last two years, including in the last probably 18 months with G&K legacy customers. But having said that, SAP will unlock some additional potential that is going to be something that should prove to be a nice opportunity for us.
Gary Bisbee: And then just one more, the initiative have been next quarter or anything like that, but as we think out of the next few years in sort of a normalized economy. How are you thinking about incremental operating margins these days? What's the potential? They have been obviously terrific the last two years, particularly as the G&K savings have flown through. But what's like a long-term target or opportunity there?
Mike Hansen: We still like -- we talk a lot about incrementals of 20% to 30%. We're getting pretty darn close to the bottom of that with our rental division. But as we continue to get success with penetration opportunities, to get success in some of the verticals that can be even bigger types of customers with a service opportunity that's more efficient, we think there are still opportunities. And that incremental, as we move forward, we think that incremental certainly is in the 20% to 30%. And if we can capitalize on some of those different things that we've talked about, the penetration, the sales into these customers with maybe more efficient service aspects, the capacity efficiencies, we think we can get that incremental into that mid-20 type of a neighborhood. So it's a nice opportunity that looks -- that we look forward to.
Operator: We'll now take our next question from Andrew Wittmann at RW Baird. Please go ahead.
Andrew Wittmann: Yes, I was looking at the two year growth rate stack in your Rental segment. It looks like the comps prove out at 12.4 over the last two years, both for the first quarter and the second quarter. But kind of brings me to the question you've talked about in the past, which is your sales force productivity. You mentioned the kind of the headwind for the deceleration in the growth rate. But I was just wondering how the sales force is performing for you? I think it was not that many quarters ago, you said even the G&K people that you kept on were producing at record levels. Can you just give us an update, Mike, about what you're seeing out of them in terms of the ability to add for those new customers?
Mike Hansen: Yes, when we think about total, look, we have one sales team. And so that sales team continues to perform well. And they're doing a nice job of adding customers and selling into existing customers. Their productivity levels are still, this quarter was a little bit higher than last year in this quarter. So, we're still making some really nice improvements. So we are still very pleased with the sales rep productivity.
Andrew Wittmann: And then I guess I wanted to maybe, Paul, if you can just help us a little bit on some of the elements of cost structure. I think typically you've given energy as a percentage of your rental segment revenue. How much of a benefit was that? And just any other details that you can call in the cost structure? I think, labor has been something that people have flagged, maybe that would be something you've addressed. You mentioned health care that is back to normal. But just anything else you can help us understand the moving pieces inside the margins, I think could be helpful?
Paul Adler: Yes, Andy. Energy was a 20 basis points benefits year-over-year, flat sequentially. So, I think that's -- if oil continues the price per barrel in the second half where it is in the first half, it will be little bit of a tailwind for us and the cost structure in the second half. Labor, I would say overall in checks, we talked about, gosh, it was probably a year ago now about certain areas of our workforce, particularly in the production area, we were having some labor inflation and we've made some changes. So we believe that that is behind us, and we won't have to make any further adjustments there. But otherwise, inflation is normal, I would say. It's something that we've been able to deal with. It's certainly tight, but it hasn't prevented us from running the business and serving our customers.
Mike Hansen: Yes. And Andy, when you think about our gross margins, for example, we've seen some really nice year-over-year improvement in this first half of the year. And certainly, the growth levels have been good and that helps. So, we're getting really nice leverage. Our sales people are productive and they're selling good profitable business, and that's been good. And we are -- we've done a nice job of capturing the G&K synergies. But what we're also seeing a little bit of is, as we've talked about over the last few years, there is a lot of inefficiency in running the facilities when you're going through a lot of conversion of incorporating G&K volumes into Cintas legacy plants and closing those plants and rebarcoding inventory. And there's a lot of work that goes on there. And really what we've seen in the first half of the year is we've captured those G&K synergies just as we wanted them to. And we've seen some real nice efficiency gains, because there are quite as many of those projects going on, those are a little bit more in the past. And so our -- we've -- the timing for us has been kind of fortunate and good from the standpoint of when we were seeing a little bit of pressure in our production labor, for example, we were also making some synergies and capturing some synergies there too. And we've been able to get more efficient in this first half of the year, and I think that's a little bit of what you're seeing.
Operator: And we'll now take next question from Scott Schneeberger at Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.
Daniel Hultberg: It's Daniel on for Scott. You discussed efficiencies earlier. Could you provide a little bit more perspective on some type of efficiencies to pursue want to go-forward basis besides the route optimization and a little bit color on automation of processes and use the advanced technology and how that is applied and where you could go there with? Thank you.
Mike Hansen: Sure. We are always looking for them. And so when we think about efficiencies going forward, I've talked a little bit about capacity. How can we continue to get more efficient in terms of using our Wash Alley, some of that is automation, I'm sorry, technology and some of that is a Six Sigma like process improvement there are opportunities there. We still have a lot of route optimization to go, that is both a little bit of technology, but just its customer touching and so we're being cautious in that regard. We've talked about getting through the SAP conversion and as we are able to then pull off of the legacy Cintas system a bit. That's going to create some efficiency just that because we won't have duplicate systems, but also then using that technology for things like sales rep productivity gains and cross-selling and penetration opportunities, so that we do have a number of those different efficiency opportunities as well as then just typically the Six Sigma processes that we're always working on and how can we get better and as the business changes can we get more efficient in the way we move product and through our plants and provide services. We're looking at all of those different things, but we think we've got some nice opportunities ahead.
Daniel Hultberg: Switching gears a little bit, cotton price has been down in the first half of this fiscal year on a year-over-year basis. Could you please discuss half of that is impacting earnings. I mean I know historically you've smooth that out through amortization, but how is that really impacting your earnings presently? Thank you.
Mike Hansen: Not really any impact in the first half of this year. We are, as you mentioned, it takes a while for that cotton price to ripple through into our P&L, if we have to sell the garments, we have to bring the garments into our distribution center. We then ship them from our distribution centers out to our rental locations, and at that point they start an 18 months amortization process, so it takes a while. And then even when it does get through, we're generally smoothing that out as you said, because we've got, if we see a spike for a few months, you might have 118 fourth of that in one month, you may could have two or 318th fourth of that. It's got to be sustained movement in that before it really starts to hit us and keep in mind cotton isn't a -- it's not one of the more significant pieces of our cost structure. So if you think about our cost structure, our cost of rentals is you can think of it in three buckets, one is material cost, one is production, part of this running of our laundry facilities and the third is our service costs, so the routing. The cotton piece is then part of that material cost, but that material cost includes also the labor content to serve garments, the freight on the garments, the trim on the garments, etc. And so it really takes some sustained large movement in cotton before it really starts to impact us.
Operator: We'll take the next question from George Tong at Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
George Tong: Your revenue outlook has certainly improved from where it was a quarter ago, you discussed the macro factors that are impacting this, but can you elaborate on some internal initiatives where you're seeing traction that improves your revenue expectations for the full year?
Mike Hansen: Well, there they are -- things generally George that, that we've been working on for a while and that is we are looking to continuously focus on some of the verticals that have been really powerful for us. So for example, the healthcare vertical, the education government hospitality, those places where the sales are a little bit more complex, the purchasing decisions might be a little bit more complex and we've made some really good progress in those areas and we still are in the early innings and think there are great opportunities as we move ahead. And so those are areas that are really important to us. The penetration, I mentioned that we have been working more on the penetration opportunities. I think we can get better and more opportunities ahead for that area as well and that penetration is both better coordination between our businesses, but also taking advantage of our newer products and making sure we're getting things like check works in front of all of the right decision makers. And so it's really continuing to move forward with what we believe to be our unique products that create opportunity in the marketplace. We are doing the same kinds of things in our First Aid and Safety business where we are looking for those penetration opportunities, product adjacencies are great and continue to look for larger national type customers as well, in both First Aid and our Fire businesses. So we're doing all of those things. We've made some really nice progress. And we think we've got a really nice year ahead of us as we move into the second half.
George Tong: Your gross margins expanded about 110 basis points year-over-year in the quarter, can you discuss how much pricing contributed to this margin expansion and how sustainable pricing increases are at the current pace?
Mike Hansen: Pricing, certainly has an impact, I mentioned that it wasn't quite incrementally positive in this quarter as it had been in the previous two quarters. And so I would say the pricing is somewhat in line with what we've seen over the last couple of years, absent the last couple of quarters. Generally, we've been able to when we can show value and when we can have the right conversations with our customers. Generally, we've been able to get some pricing and I don't see that necessarily changing. But I would -- as it relates to then the margin opportunity and the margin improvement. It's really more about the growth creates leverage, it creates efficiencies in our plants, when we grow in our rental business in particular where we don't use capacity like our restroom and hygiene products, we effectively get some really nice leverage and get more efficient with the capacity. And in addition to that we've pulled out a little bit of inefficiency in the business, so more of the gross margin improvement relates to the revenue of the business, the leveraging and the efficiencies that we're able to gain.
Operator: And we'll take the next question from Kevin McVeigh at Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
Kevin McVeigh: Just to follow-up on the guidance a little bit, I know last year there was some severe weather in the third quarter that was kind of unexpected. Do you have any kind of just thoughts on or any allowance for that in the Q3 guide obviously with -- obviously which would be incorporated into the full year or how are you thinking about just the weather impact as we work our way through the back half of the year?
Mike Hansen: Last year in the third quarter, we talked a little bit about the weather and the holidays. It's hard to predict the weather. And so we are -- I would say, we're not trying to build in any particular weather pattern. As it relates to the holidays, one of the things we talked about last year was Christmas and New Year's falling on a Tuesday, which was the first time in a number of years and that has an impact. This year, the holidays both fall on a Wednesday, and the last time they fell on a Wednesday, I think it was like our fiscal '14 year. So it's been a bit of a time period since we've had a Wednesday. And so if you think about our weekly flow of volume you can think of it as a bit of a bell curve Monday -- Mondays and Friday's I would call are our, maybe our lower days and our as you go from Monday to Tuesday that when the volume starts to build because customers are just more, they're more easy to see etc. Wednesday tends to be one of our heavier days, and then you start to come back down as you go through the rest of the week. With -- by the holidays, both being on a Wednesday, this year we are considering that we will have any year-over-year benefit because of the comments we made last year during the holidays. We're kind of thinking that look, we're going to still have that holiday disruption a little bit. I don't think it necessarily will be a drag on growth, but it's certainly, it isn't going to help us with an easier comp.
Kevin McVeigh: And then just the margins again really nice and if I have it right, it looks like kind of the other category at least outpaced our estimates that can be kind of uniform sales which are lower margin. Is there anything else in there that's helping boost the gross margins overall despite the mix?
Mike Hansen: We are continuing to make improvements in the fire business. We really like that business and it has performed very well in the second quarter and in the first half. And as we get bigger and we gain scale and that revenue growth allows us to leverage our infrastructure a bit better. It creates more dense routes and that creates some margin opportunity. We've got a long way to go. But certainly have seen some nice performance in the fire business and certainly the heavy volume in our direct sale business was a bit of a help too.
Operator: We will take our next question from Seth Weber at RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Seth Weber: Most of the questions asked and answered, but I wanted to see if we could dig into your -- you've made the pricing comments a few times now, just a little bit less robust than maybe what we saw in the first quarter, is there anything you'd call out, is it a mix issue or the comps just getting harder or is there something going on from a competitive front that you would highlight? Thanks.
Mike Hansen: I think it's a bunch of different things, Seth. I think there is a little bit of mix going on. We've had some good performance in a few quarters in a row now, and if that's kind of outperformance isn't sustainable in the long term, and I don't think it's anything that we are concerned about. But just something a little bit of maybe a notch below where we had seen in the last couple of quarters, made up of a number of different things.
Seth Weber: And then just on working capital has been frankly better than what we would have thought given the growth trajectory. I mean do you think that working capital can continue to be just a little bit better than normal. Normally, I think you expect to see a little bit more usage here. Has there something you'd call out that's really helping that or can we expect that to continue? Thanks.
Mike Hansen: Well, look from a working capital standpoint, we certainly have been in a period of disruption over the last couple of years, as it relates to our accounts receivable converting two systems as it relates to our inventory and shutting down DCs, opening new DCs, converting a lot of volume. And we're starting to get some of those inefficiencies and disruptions behind us. And so for example in accounts receivable, we've seen a nice improvement year-over-year and that's part because we've gotten a little bit of that disruption behind us. There still is some system conversion to go, but we think we're getting a little bit better and better and more efficient at it. If you think about the sort of cash flow for a second, when you think about our operating cash flow, it was pretty strong this quarter and really for the first six months of the year and our conversion of net income to operating cash flow has been over 100%. I would expect that that's going to continue for the second half of the year. Free cash flow was really strong and I think that's going to be strong for the rest of the year. And so I think more than anything Seth, it's getting a little bit of this disruption of two system conversions, a new business conversion, a little bit of that stuff behind us. But as we've talked in the past, when we are growing we're generally going to use some working capital, in other words, we're going to see AR continue to increase. We're going to see, generally speaking, inventory and in service inventories grow over time, inventory is a little bit different from a standpoint of we do have opportunities there, where some of those opportunities will create more inventory. For example, if we believe we can have enough volume to bring new products into our distribution center that may create new inventory. However, as we get more efficient and you get the G&K conversion behind us, that's going to create some forecasting and supply chain opportunities. So there's going to be some ups and downs in that inventory line item, but generally the performance has been good. We've gotten a little bit of that disruption behind us, but we're generally going to be a user of the working capital.
Operator: It appears there are no further questions. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference back to the speakers. Please go ahead.
Mike Hansen: Well, thanks very much joining us tonight. We will issue our third quarter financial results in March, and we look forward to speaking with you again at that time. And we wish you all happy holidays.

===== 2020 Q1  (2019-09-25 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Cintas Quarterly Earnings Results Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Mike Hansen, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Sir, please go ahead.
Mike Hansen: Thank you, and good evening. Thanks for joining us. With me is Paul Adler, Cintas' Vice President and Treasurer. We will discuss our first quarter results for fiscal 2020. After our commentary, we will be happy to answer questions. The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a Safe Harbor from civil litigation for forward-looking statements. This conference call contains forward-looking statements that reflect the Company's current views as to future events and financial performance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those we may discuss. I refer you to the discussion on these points contained in our most recent filings with the SEC. Revenue for the first quarter of fiscal '20 was a record $1.81 billion, an increase of 6.7% over last year's first quarter. The organic growth rate, which adjusts for the impacts of acquisitions, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and differences in the number of workdays, was 8.3%. In the first quarter of fiscal '20, the organic growth rate for the Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segment was 7.5%, and the organic growth rate for the First Aid and Safety Services operating segment was 13.8%. Gross margin for the first quarter of fiscal '20 of $849.1 million, increased 9.6%. Gross margin as a percentage of revenue was 46.9% for the first quarter of fiscal '20, compared to 45.6% in the first quarter of fiscal '19. Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segment gross margin as a percent of revenue improved 150 basis points from last year's first quarter to 47.2%. And the First Aid and Safety Services operating segment gross margin percentage improved 110 basis points to 49%. Reported operating income for the first quarter of fiscal '20 of $306.1 million increased 15.4%. Operating margin was 16.9% in the first quarter of fiscal '20, compared to 15.6% in fiscal '19. Operating income in the first quarter of fiscal '19 was negatively impacted by integration expenses related to the G&K acquisition by $4.9 million, or 30 basis points. Reported net income for the first quarter of fiscal '20 was $250.8 million, and reported earnings per diluted share for the first quarter of fiscal '20 were $2.32. Excluding the G&K acquisition integration expenses in fiscal '19, EPS increased 20.2%. As our Chairman and CEO, Scott Farmer was quoted in today's press release, we are pleased with our start to our fiscal year. We thank our employee-partners for continuing to execute well on our important initiatives. Before turning the call over to Paul for more details, I'll provide an update of our fiscal '20 expectations. We expect revenue to be in the range of $7.28 billion to $7.32 billion. We expect EPS to be in the range of $8.47 to $8.57. Note the following regarding the guidance. The growth rate at the revenue guidance range is 5.6% to 6.2%. However, our fiscal '20 contains one less workday than our fiscal '19. Adjusting for this one day difference, on a constant workday basis, the revenue growth rate at guidance is 6% to 6.6%. One less workday also has a negative impact on EPS reducing it about $0.06, which is a 90 basis point drag on the EPS growth rate for the year. The guidance assumes an effective tax rate for fiscal '20 of 20.3% compared to a rate of 19.7% for fiscal '19. The higher effective tax rate in fiscal '20 negatively impacts EPS growth about 80 basis points and total EPS by about $0.06. Keep in mind that the tax rate can move up or down from period to period, based on discrete events including the amount of stock compensation expense. The guidance assumes a share count for computing EPS of 109 million shares. This consists of diluted weighted average shares outstanding, plus participating securities in the form of restricted stock. And it does not assume any future share buybacks, any potential deterioration in the U.S. economy or any additional G&K integration expenses. I'll now turn the call over to Paul.
Paul Adler: Thank you, Mike. Please note that our fiscal '20 contains one less workday than in fiscal '19. One less day will negatively impact fiscal '20 total revenue growth by 40 basis points. To illustrate the magnitude of the headwind using fiscal '19's annual revenue, one less workday equates to about $27 million. One less workday also has a negative impact on operating margin and EPS. Fiscal '20 operating income margin will be reduced by about 12.5 basis points, in comparison to fiscal '19 due to one less day of revenue. The negative impact on the margin occurs because certain expenses like amortization of uniforms and entrance mats are expensed on a monthly basis as opposed to on a daily basis. And we will have one less day of revenue to cover the expenses. As Mike stated, one less workday is a headwind of about 90 basis points on EPS growth, and about a $0.06 drag on total EPS in comparison to fiscal '19. Each quarter of fiscal '20 will contain 65 workdays. In comparison to fiscal '19, our upcoming Q2 of fiscal '20 will have the same number of days. Q3 will have one additional day, and Q4 will have one less day. Please keep the quarterly day differences in mind when modeling our fiscal '20 results. We have two reportable operating segments Uniform Rental and Facility Services and First Aid and Safety Services. The remainder of our business is included in All Other. All Other consist of Fire Protection Services and our Uniform Direct Sale business. First Aid and Safety Services and All Other are combined and presented as Other Services on the income statement. Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segment includes the rental and servicing of uniforms, mats and towels, and the provision of restroom supplies and other facility products and services. The segment also includes the sale of items from our catalogs to our customers on route. Uniform Rental and Facility Services revenue was $1.45 billion, an increase of 5.8%. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, foreign currency exchange rate changes and differences in the number of workdays, the organic growth rate was 7.5%. Our Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment gross margin was 47.2% for the first quarter compared to 45.7% than last year's first quarter, an improvement of 150 basis points. Energy expense as a percentage of revenue was 2.20% compared to 2.45% in the prior year quarter. The gross margin expansion was driven in large part by the strong revenue increase covering certain fixed production and service department costs. Our First Aid and Safety Services operating segment includes revenue from the sale and servicing of first aid products, safety products and training. This segment's revenue for the first quarter was $172.1 million. The organic growth rate for this segment was 13.8%. The First Aid segment gross margin was 49.0% in the first quarter compared to 47.9% in last year's first quarter, an increase of 110 basis points. First Aid segment gross margins continue to increase with stop - with a strong top line growth. Our Fire Protection Services and Uniform Direct Sale businesses are reported in the All Other category. Our Fire business continues to grow each year at a strong pace. The Uniform Direct Sale business growth rates are generally low single digits, and are subject to volatility, such as when we install a multi-million dollar account. Uniform Direct Sale, however is a key business for us, and its customers are often significant opportunities to cross-sell and provide products and services from our other business units. All Other revenue was $184.5 million, an increase of 8.8%. The organic growth rate was 9.7%. The Fire business organic growth rate came in at 12.5%. Uniform Direct Sale business had a good quarter too, posting an organic growth rate of 5.8%. All Other gross margin was 42.8% for the first quarter of this fiscal year, compared to 42.9% for last year's first quarter. Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue were 30.0% in the first quarter of fiscal '20, and 29.7% in the first quarter of '19. Lower labor expense as a percent of revenue was offset by increases in other expenses, particularly an 80 basis point increase in medical expense. We are self-insured and therefore subject to some volatility in medical expense from quarter-to-quarter. Our effective tax rate on continuing operations for the first quarter of fiscal '20 was 10.1%. Stock based compensation positively impacted the tax rate. As Mike stated earlier, the tax rate can move from period to period, based on discrete events including the amount of stock compensation expense. Please note three new line items on our balance sheet, resulting in an increase in assets and liabilities by about $165 million. These relate to our adoption in the quarter of the Accounting Standards Update 2016-02, entitled Leases. The adoption does not have a material impact on net income or cash flow. Our cash and equivalents balance as of August 31 was $102.1 million. Operating cash flow in the first quarter of fiscal '20 increased about 70% from the amount of operating cash flow in the first quarter of fiscal '19, and benefited from strong earnings growth, and improvements in working capital. Capital expenditures in the first quarter were $64.7 million. Our CapEx by operating segment was as follows; $53.0 million in Uniform Rental and Facility Services, $8.1 million in the First Aid and Safety, and $3.6 million in All Other. We expect fiscal '20 CapEx to be in the range of $280 million to $310 million. As of August 31, total debt was $2,876.9 billion. $2,538.1 billion was fixed interest rate debt, and $338.8 million was variable rate debt in the form of a term loan and commercial paper. At August 31, our leverage of 1.9x debt-to-EBITDA was slightly lower than our target of 2x. That concludes our prepared remarks. We are happy to answer your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley.
Toni Kaplan: The Uniform gross rental margins were really strong this quarter expanding by about 144 basis points. Was there anything one-time in there, or I guess how much could be attributable to synergies? And how should we think about the pacing of synergies this year?
Mike Hansen: Nothing really one-time. We did as Paul mentioned, we got a little bit of a benefit 25 basis points from energy. So we got a little bit of benefit there. The synergies - our expectation is that they will be generally consistent from quarter-to-quarter. So call it roughly $35 million. That would - if that happens, that will get us right through that $140 million for the year, which we - as we talked about a few months ago. We're going to be right around that range, $135 million to $140 million. And so we feel pretty good about our ability to capture those synergies. I would say the rest of it is nice execution, getting through a little bit more of the integration activities and seeing some efficiencies at play. The environment for pricing was similar to the fourth quarter where we sat a bit incrementally better than we had seen. So got a little bit of revenue help from that standpoint as well but not really any one-time items.
Toni Kaplan: And now that you've reached your target leverage, can you talk a little bit more about what you would look for in an acquisition? Would you prefer sort of domestic or international for uniform versus ancillary services? And lastly would you expect any regulatory issues just given your size at this point?
Mike Hansen: So from an M&A perspective, we love M&A and our - in the businesses that we're currently in, certainly. Anything from a tuck-in in our Fire, First Aid and Uniform Rental businesses to something larger. We certainly - if there were any M&A opportunities in our space, we certainly want to be involved and would have a great interest in - in pursuing that at the right value. And we certainly like from a geographic standpoint, it's easier to capture synergies for example, with acquisitions in the U.S. and Canada because we have a presence here, and it allows us to get density in markets to combine capacity if those opportunities present themselves. So we would prefer acquisitions where we can capture better synergies. Your last question of, do we expect any regulatory issues? That certainly depends on what type of acquisition and the size of that acquisition, but, let's assume a large acquisition in the workwear space for example. If one came available, we love to take a look at it. And when - I would say something that you may not be considering, others may not be considering is, we have so many people that look at our business from a served market perspective. And we view the market is so much bigger than that. So for example, we compete in the workwear space, there is a lot of competition in the workwear space. Some of our competitors in workwear are from a retail standpoint. So in other words, they simply sell workwear. Walmart and Amazon each sell over $5 billion annually of workwear. So they are large competitors in the space. And we have other competitors that provide workwear and design and shipping capabilities. They manage programs to a certain extent. So there are those kind of competitors. And we happened to provide workwear through manage programs. We source, we deliver, we maintain, we launder for our customers. And so there is a lot of competition in the space. We've kind of told you for many years, over 60% of our new business comes from no programmers. And who are those no programmers? They are retail space, they are direct sellers. They are people who do it themselves. But we've shown year after year, that we, that is part of our market space. Now we can also lose business to those kinds of - let's call it non-traditional competitors. My point in telling you all of this is, the opportunity is really large and much larger than our served market. And so, look, if there is an opportunity that's large in our space, we certainly would have interest, we want to understand it, it would have to be at the right value, and we'd have to - we'd have to articulate that competitive set, which we think is quite large.
Operator: Our next question comes from Manav Patnaik with Barclays Capital.
Manav Patnaik: My first question is obviously, the first quarter growth was pretty impressive and well above your full year guidance ranges I guess. Could you just help us maybe walk through, if there is any quarterly cadences that we should be looking at?
Mike Hansen: Well. Sure. So maybe we'll start with the first quarter. We did have a really nice first quarter. Our non-rental businesses performed really well. Paul, maybe - Paul gave a little bit of comment on those, but maybe you can give a little bit more color on those business.
Paul Adler: Yes, sure, Manav. So let's start like with First Aid. We mentioned the organic growth at 13.8%. That's a business that has executed very well. We typically expect organic growth to be in high single digits, maybe 10% is what we've talked about for that business. So they came in a little bit stronger. Of course, there is a lot of blocking and tackling a lot of variables that go into the performance in the quarter. But of note, we did have a new item that we rolled out in the quarter. A new item in the cabinet and it's kind of like a - kind of like a rollout of a direct sale program, for example in Uniform Direct Sale business where you're putting that into the cabinets, you get a lot of revenue, and then you're counting on some smaller trail of that revenue going on in the lapping quarter. So a little bit of a boost because of that new product rollouts, and so outlook for First Aid is going to be continuing to have a great year, but probably the latter quarters more in the high single digits where we historically have been. Fire. That business, impressive organic growth rate of 12.5%. Again a lot of pieces to that with execution of the sales force and great quality service. But they did have a little bit of an easier comp, Manav. I think their growth rates a year ago was about 8%, so little bit higher than 8%. So I think some of the 12.5% was a little bit of that easier comp. And in that business, the Fire business, there is really two types of revenue streams. There is a more reoccurring revenue stream that we call test and inspection, testing and inspecting fire extinguishers and sprinkler systems, et cetera. It tends to repeat more often. But we also have another revenue stream when things break, when alarms don't work, you have to perform repair and maintenance. And we had some national account repair and maintenance type revenue in the first quarter that was a little bit larger than we expected, and we don't expect that to repeat. So I think the 12.5% was a little bit higher than we typically expect. And then finally kind of rounding out the other business units. You'll note - well you can't - I mean we might have mentioned in the prepared remarks that the Direct Sale business had a good growth rate of 5.8%. A year ago, the growth rate was rather weak, in fact it actually had some shrinkage of about 1.8%. So that's a business that I think benefited from that easier comp in the first quarter. And as we've talked about previously in our prepared remarks that Direct Sale business is typically more of a 3% grower, long-term.
Mike Hansen: Yes. So, Manav when you look at the performance, I would say the non-rental businesses had great quarter, maybe outperformed our expectations a little bit, and probably don't expect that going forward. From a rental perspective, again had a really nice quarter. We had some really good execution by our rental partners. I mentioned a little bit of - the pricing was similar to the fourth quarter, which was incrementally good. So, got a little bit of benefit there. Probably got a little bit of a year-over-year benefit. Keep in mind, last year in the first quarter, that was our lowest organic growth. So we were - our volumes were still kind of finding the bottom. So probably got a little bit of benefit in that regard too. So as we look out over the next three quarters, we don't look at - we don't - there shouldn't be a lot of inconsistency in terms of the growth, but you know things can happen from quarter-to-quarter, but don't see a lot of movement from one quarter to the next for the rest of the year.
Manav Patnaik: And then if I could just ask in terms of the G&K revenue synergies. I know, I don't think you are looking to quantify anything. But any anecdotal color on, if you're starting to see that - the needle mover in terms of your results?
Mike Hansen: Well, we started talking about this a little bit. We saw signs of benefit in the first quarter of last year, and saw some nice execution throughout last fiscal year. And so we did see some benefits throughout last year and saw a little bit of that in the first quarter. As we move forward from a lapping perspective, I don't know that I would expect anything that is significant, but we're - it's something that we're constantly, every week that we visit those customers, we're talking with them, we're educating them on what we do, and sometimes these take time. And we're going to continue to cultivate those relationships as we go. I wouldn't expect any significant amounts in any one particular quarter. But it's certainly is a nice benefit for us.
Operator: Our next question will come from Kevin McVeigh with Credit Suisse.
Kevin McVeigh: At this point, given the gross margins, is it fair to say and I know we’re not just interviewing G&K. But is G&K up to the corporate average at this point, or would you expect that to continue to kind of narrow relative to where Cintas is relative to G&K?
Mike Hansen: Well, as you referred to, it's really hard to say. So for example, a lot of that G&K volume resides in legacy Cintas locations. So when you think about that volume, it certainly has helped us in those kinds of locations, create more capacity utilization, create little bit more density and so there certainly is a benefit. From stand alone locations, many of them have inherited some legacy Cintas volumes, but they're not quite to where we would see the rest of the Cintas legacy locations, but they're making nice progress. So we hope to continue to see improvements as we move forward.
Kevin McVeigh: And then just with the benefit from energy, was that - was there any organic growth headwind, i.e., would there have been maybe a benefit last year from surcharges and you don't have those surcharges, or it would have all been on the expense side?
Mike Hansen: We started to see a little bit of softening towards the end of the first quarter in the energy space. Keep in mind, it's not a big part of our revenue base, but we started to see a little bit of softness, I would say no headwind in the quarter from a revenue perspective. We're keeping our eyes on it though, as we move into the second quarter and beyond.
Kevin McVeigh: I guess, I'm sorry, I was thinking more in terms of fuel. You don't get the fuel surcharges. I know it sounded like you saw some relief from energy costs. I just wondered if that was a headwind on the revenue line.
Mike Hansen: Yes, I'm sorry, we don't have a fuel surcharge. So the energy, the gas prices, we don't flex our pricing or surcharges based on the price of the pump. I'm sorry, what I was referring to was our customers, in the oil, gas, mining areas that generally, when you see the prices of the gas at the pump come down in the past, when we've seen those prices really come down, it kind of hurts that business here in the U.S. And so the - we saw some benefit in that price of the pump as we said 25 basis points in rental. But we also saw a little bit of softening in the business side of it from a customer perspective. And so that's what we're keeping our eyes on. But we don't have a fuel surcharge. So no impact relative to that.
Operator: Our next question comes from Gary Bisbee with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Gary Bisbee: I guess you sort of alluded to this earlier in the commentary about some of the places where you saw strength this quarter, but clearly in the Rentals business you had a much easier comp on both organic revenue and margins in the year ago. And so I guess I just wanted to ask, is it right to think that that is a portion of the rentals business improvement and may be more significant than any sort of sequential improvement in momentum relative to what you were seeing this past spring? Is that fair?
Mike Hansen: So in other words, yes. Gary, I think your comment on, did we get some year-over-year benefit? Yeah, I think there was probably some of that, as you - as you alluded and I mentioned a minute ago. Our organic growth was still finding the bottom in terms of our volumes in rental and so there certainly is a little bit of year-over-year benefit there. And so I think that's - I think your commentary is reasonable.
Gary Bisbee: And then just thinking sequentially as we've moved over the last few months. Are you hearing anything different from your clients in the U.S. and Canada around the macro backdrop? Some of the forecasts for GDP growth in the U.S. are moderating, some of the industrial activities moderated a bit, though employment continues to be good. But any change in dialog or is it really steady as she goes?
Mike Hansen: Yes. We haven't heard much of a change from our customers and our first quarter results would kind of show that. When we think about the economic picture though as we move in - the last two quarters of our fiscal year are going into mid calendar '20. We do think about the noises around interest rates, the noises - the continued noises around trade and tariffs. We're going to be entering an election year where there is going to be a lot of noise, and I would say, we look today with a little bit more cautiousness than maybe earlier in the summer. And while we haven't seen much change from our customers yet, we're keeping our eyes on it because there's just so much noise in the environment today.
Gary Bisbee: And then just lastly, can you give us a sense, how much of the All Other segment is Fire versus Uniform sales? And really the reason I ask is, I think a lot of people have always just plugged in low single-digit growth because uniforms was always bigger, but it sounds like Fire keeps growing. Is that, understanding this volatility quarter-to-quarter, is it possible, that's really more should be a mid-single digit type grower, all in given that Fire is growing quickly and Uniform fairly moderately? Is that a fair assumption? And if you could give us the mix that would be great? Thank you.
Paul Adler: Gary, it's Paul. I think that even in our 10-K, we actually have to break - I think the revenue recognition adoption of that FASB caused us to provide more detail. So you can take a look at the last 10-K and you'll see it. But my recollection is - and doing the math the last time that Fire is kind of like about 55% of the mix at this point in time, 45% then is the Direct sale business. And then to your point, we've tried to add some color that the Fire business is high single digits, 10% organic, whereas that Direct sale business is typically around 3%. Fire - the Fire business had a very good quarter. It improved gross margins and improved operating margins. But to your point, because of the fact that we lump those together for the accounting guidance, and we call it All Other, it blends this particular quarter to a little bit of a shrink in the gross margin by I think 10 basis points that was. But if that's more due to the - the mix shift and the fact that the direct sale business grew 5.8% and it shifts that mix and could cause that to move. But if you parse those two businesses out, Fire business actually improved their margins as I said.
Operator: Our next question comes from Seth Weber with RBC Capital Markets.
Seth Weber: Wanted to ask about working capital, it came down nicely relative to first quarter last year. Do you think you can kind of flip the negative? I think it was 2.60 or 2.75 or so for 2019. Do you think you can flip that all the way back to par this year? Or can you just talk to how you're thinking about working capital for 2020? Thanks.
Mike Hansen: Yes, when we - our thoughts on working capital are when we are growing, we're going to use some working capital. So for example, if we're growing the way we want to grow. Accounts receivable is going to grow. Inventories are going to grow, in-service inventory is going to grow because we are injecting new inventory into new customers and penetrated customers. So generally speaking, we expect in a growth environment, we expect to use working capital. Now last year, in the first quarter, our use of working capital was quite larger than it was this year in the first quarter. So we were in the midst of a lot of system integration activity, a lot of G&K integration activity, and so we had some disruption in the accounts receivable environment. We feel really good about where we are today. And so you've seen a little bit of a less of a usage there, from an inventory perspective last year and an in-service inventory last year. When we make an acquisition like G&K, there are points in time at which we are going through inventory a little bit more quickly because we're transitioning out of legacy G&K inventory into Cintas types of inventory. Now that didn't happen all at once in the first quarter last year, but it certainly picked up. It continues today but certainly at a lesser pace. And so that's - there was a little bit disruption last year in the first quarter, a little bit more of a steady state this year in the first quarter, but we would expect continued use as long as we can continue to grow.
Seth Weber: So the balance of the year probably look something like the balance of 2Q through - the balance of last year then. Is that a fair way to think about it?
Mike Hansen: Seth, I don't have the balance of last year right in front of me, but I would - generally speaking, yes. We wouldn't expect any - anything of a disruptive nature in those areas.
Seth Weber: And then just follow up on the SG&A, I appreciate you calling out there were some extra expenses there for the quarter. So would you expect, assuming those don't recur SG&A to be down then year-over-year for the rest of the year? Yeah.
Mike Hansen: That certainly is our - yeah that certainly is our expectation. From a self-insurance standpoint, we've had quarters in the past where we'll see one time claims pop up and it results in a little bit of a higher insurance, medical expense than normal. Those may continue to happen. But generally speaking, we expect to see some nice leverage in SG&A, particularly from the G&A side of things. Paul mentioned that labor, G&A labor was down a little bit and we are very pleased with that. So we'll have disruptions from quarter-to-quarter. Generally speaking, we do expect leverage, no doubt.
Seth Weber: And just, sorry, one last one for Paul, is tax rate kind of consistent here then for the balance of the year just spread evenly 2Q to 4Q?
Paul Adler: Yes, that's reasonable, Seth, but it's just that Q1 that is so - such an outlier because of the stock option exercises. So I think that's good for modeling for the remainder of the year.
Operator: Our next question comes from George Tong with Goldman Sachs.
George Tong: Going back to organic revenue trends. How much of the acceleration in the quarter would you say is due to traction with penetration of the no programmer market versus improving adds, stops or easing competitive trends that you're seeing?
Mike Hansen: Yes, George, not a lot of difference from a normal quarter from the standpoint of new business continues to be strong, productivity from our reps was really good. And within that new business, set was a good no programmer performance. So new business continues to lead the growth effort. From adds, stops nothing to call out really. But, as I mentioned earlier, pricing in the quarter did help similar to what we saw in the fourth quarter. So a little bit, certainly year-over-year help in that regard as well. So real nice sales productivity, little bit of pricing help, real nice execution from our partners.
George Tong: Your gross margins are continuing to improve across your segments. Can you elaborate on how your input costs are evolving and what your latest thoughts are around the impact of trade negotiations on the business?
Mike Hansen: Yes. So from a material costing standpoint, we haven't seen a lot of change right now. It seems like the trade and tariff conversation is more conversation than impact at this point, but it's still creating a lot of noise and uncertainty for our customers and us to a certain extent. But I haven't seen much of an impact. Keep in mind from a material perspective, most of our material costs get amortized over some period of time, whether it's the life of a garment or the life of a mat, and that amortization period really helps. It's a bit of a natural hedging that helps us smooth those kind of cost out. But I would say no costs to call out from that regard. Labor, we've talked over the course of the last year, we've seen it some pressure in pockets, and didn't see anything new or different in this quarter.
Operator: Our next question comes from Andrew Wittmann with RW Baird.
Andrew Wittmann: I just had a couple of maybe clarifying questions here. First just on the guidance, I think you guys - obviously the tax rate was low. We expected it to be low. I don't think you guys expected it to be quite this low. I'm just wondering how much of the tax rate was incremental or part of the guidance raise just to tease that element out of the total rates here versus your prior expectation?
Mike Hansen: Yes, I would say in the quarter it was about a $0.06 impact, for the year, probably about an $0.08 impact. And look, the - so much of that impact that we speak of is kind of out of our control. Well you've heard us talk about the equity piece of that and that's what kind of played out - that played the role in the first quarter here.
Andrew Wittmann: And then just on SAP, in the past you've talked about how well rolled out or how thoroughly rolled out that is. Can you just kind of update us as to where we were either at the end of the quarter or where we stand today, Mike?
Mike Hansen: Yes, Andrew. It's - we're about 75% of the way complete now. And so we're still on track to finish that implementation by the end of the fiscal year.
Andrew Wittmann: And then just for other detail here. You did some pretty good amount of buyback in the quarter. Can you give the total number of shares that you bought in and how much is remaining on the authorization that you currently have in place?
Mike Hansen: Yes. During the quarter, we - well, we have $263 million left on the authorization. We bought 837,000 shares for just under $200 million. Keep in mind that all of that purchasing was done prior to our July call. So it was - it did not have an impact on with the guidance that we gave you today.
Andrew Wittmann: And then I guess just the only other question I had was specific around labor. You talked about SG&A kind of labor savings, but in the gross margin in the plant, this has been an area that's been cited maybe more by some of your competitors, but you guys have talked about it a little bit as well. I was just wondering if there is any changes that you've seen in the marketplace for your plant-level labor and how you're dealing with that today, if there is something to be dealt with?
Mike Hansen: Well, you're right. We've talked a little bit about pressures here and there in pockets particularly in that production and plant environment. And I would say, we didn't see much of a change. It remains a competitive environment and we got to do - the best thing we can do is, is keep our turnover - our partner turnover as low as possible. And we've been pretty successful at that. So I know, not much of a change in this first quarter compared to what we've seen over the course of the last year.
Operator: Our next question comes from Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel, Nicolaus.
Shlomo Rosenbaum: You're talking about M&A earlier in the call. Have you guys ever purchased a company that had unionized labor force and is that something that would be a non-starter for you? Or is that something that you would still entertain, if there is a lot of synergy potential?
Mike Hansen: Well, Shlomo, G&K had about 20% union workforce when we acquired them. A union environment, a different culture, it certainly creates a different type of environment to operating environment and those kind of things can tend to make synergy capture a little bit more challenging. And so at the end of the day, would we evaluate something with a heavy union component? You know that's a value consideration more than anything else. And we'd have to take a good hard look at it, because it does complicate the synergy capture opportunity. But there is - that's a part of the conversation around value and consideration.
Shlomo Rosenbaum: And then, did I hear you right that you did not buyback any more stock after the last earnings call?
Mike Hansen: Correct.
Shlomo Rosenbaum: And then could you just - is that usually - usually when companies don't buyback stock and their leverage is below the level that the - consider a target level there is usually something that is a potential out there, is that an unfair assumption for us to make that there might be something in the near to intermediate term?
Mike Hansen: Well, Shlomo, we've always looked at that buyback as we've executed as an opportunistic program. And if you go back over the course of the last 10 years, we are not consistent from quarter-to-quarter and that's by design. We kind of look at a bunch of different things. We look at the performance of the business, the investment needs of the business. We look at M&A opportunities on the horizon. We look at things like upcoming dividends and we have a consistent history of not being consistent in the way that we execute on that buyback program. And I'm not sure I look into anything more than that.
Shlomo Rosenbaum: And then if you just look at kind of the margins of the business. The First Aid and Safety had really good growth, margin expansion was not a whole lot there. Is there a lot of investment going on in terms of building out routes or anything like that that you're not seeing more leverage here?
Mike Hansen: Well, we had a real nice gross margin quarter with the gross margin being up 110 basis points. And so we're with that growth, we are continuing to invest in routes and in capacity. But really you're right Shlomo, from an investment standpoint, we did continue to invest in the SG&A space. And so we do see a little bit of an elevated SG&A number compared to last year. Keep in mind, they are also affected by the medical. And that was about an 80 basis point headwind. But you're right, we are continuing to invest in that business. We do really like it.
Shlomo Rosenbaum: And do you mind just going over the days in each quarter year-over-year? So we get that straight for the next three quarters.
Mike Hansen: Yes Shlomo, it's 65 in each quarter of this fiscal year. And then, let's see, compared to '19. So we had 66 in Q1 last year, then 65 in Q2, 64 in Q3, and 66 in Q4.
Operator: Our next question will come from Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer. Thanks very much.
Scott Schneeberger: I just want to hone in a little bit more on pricing, you've mentioned a nice improvement from fourth quarter or at least still solid, which has improved from the third quarter. Could you delve in a little bit to the end markets where you're seeing that pricing improvement. Is there any competitive dynamic that's changed to affect that? And when I speak of end markets, also if you could just specify across the segments too, please. Thanks.
Mike Hansen: So from a market by market - from an end market perspective, and nothing to call out of any significance. You've heard us talk a little bit about the pricing environment over the years. When businesses in the rental business are performing well, when they are growing they have limited capacity and it generally tends to add a little bit of more readableness to the pricing environment, and so we do see a little bit of that going on. We also I think do a pretty good job of articulating to our customers, why at times pricing can be appropriate. And so I think that execution has been pretty good as well. So combination of the health of the marketplace, our ability to articulate I think that has combined to a nice environment.
Scott Schneeberger: And just following up on, in response to Manav's question early on in the Q&A, you were talking about a new item in the cabinet and how that could have a lumpy effect because the follow-on tapers a bit. I was just curious, how are you doing with opportunities like that rolling out and if you want to share what that new item was, that would be great. But how are you doing with deploying new offerings and servicing - services. And if you could tie that into G&K and if you're seeing any cross-sell benefit from there, that would be great? Thanks.
Mike Hansen: We do - we are seeing some cross-sell opportunities and benefits like we have over the course of the last year. And, but I would say generally speaking and we'd rather not call out that specific item, but generally speaking, we're always looking and investing for ancillary products ways that we can add some value for our customers. And so in this case, it was a nice benefit. Sometimes those happen in a particular quarter and didn't happen last year, they can be lumpy in terms of when the roll-outs occur, but we like where we are in terms of our ability to create those ancillary products within our businesses. That's what - we've talked many times about the umbrellas of image safety, cleanliness and compliance and when we think broadly like that with our customers, sometimes, we're able to come up with some pretty nice and unique ideas and we've been - we've had some success over the course of the last year, and that would go for legacy G&K customers as well as into legacy Cintas customers. We've had some nice success.
Operator: Our next question comes from Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan Securities.
Andrew Steinerman: It's Andrew. Could you give a quick comment on merchandise amortization, was it a headwind or a tailwind in the first quarter? And given the strong new wins, do you feel like merchandise amortization will be more of a drag going forward to margins?
Mike Hansen: Yes, right. No, there was nothing to call out in that regard during the quarter. We are in an interesting time as I was mentioning earlier Andrew, where we've injected a decent amount of new Cintas product into legacy G&K customers, and that can create some rippling and we're going to see a little bit of that as we move forward, but less of it today than a year ago I would say. As we move forward, we're going to continue to sell, hopefully a lot of new business, and so we'll continue to inject at pretty good rates. But again, I would say nothing to call out. Our managers are managing the inventory and the in-service pretty well.
Andrew Steinerman: Can I ask as you do inject, excuse me, inject Cintas uniforms into the G&K customer base, do they notice the - that there is a quality upgrade there?
Mike Hansen: We certainly would like to think so, I mean, when we look at the inventory, Andrew, our people understand the features and the functionality of the inventory in the garments that we have. And they are trained to point those features and functions out to our customers. So as long as we are doing our job and introducing those garments and introducing those prominent features and functions of them, I'm expecting that the customers certainly notice.
Operator: All right, thank you. And at this time there are no further questions in the queue.
Mike Hansen: Well. Thank you for joining us tonight. We will issue our second quarter financial results in December and we look forward to speaking you - speaking with you again at that time. Good night.
Operator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's teleconference. You may now disconnect. Please, enjoy the rest of your day.

===== 2019 Q4  (2019-07-16 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Cintas Quarterly Earnings Results Conference Call. Today’s call is being recorded.  At this time, I’d like to turn the call over to Mr. Mike Hansen, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead, sir.
Mike Hansen: Good evening and thank you for joining us. With me is Paul Adler, Cintas’ Vice President and Treasurer. We will discuss our fourth quarter results for fiscal 2019. After our commentary, we will be happy to answer questions. The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a Safe Harbor from civil litigation for forward-looking statements. This conference call contains forward-looking statements that reflect the company’s current views as to future events and financial performance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those we may discuss. I refer you to the discussion on these points contained in our most recent filings with the SEC. Revenue for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 was a record $1.79 billion, an increase of 7.4% over last year's fourth quarter. The organic growth rate, which adjusts for the impacts of acquisitions and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, was 7.6%. In the fourth quarter of fiscal ’19, the organic growth rate for the uniform rental and facility services operating segment was 6.8% and the organic growth rate for the first aid and safety services operating segment was 10.7%. Gross margin for the fourth quarter of fiscal ‘19 of $823.6 million increased 9.5%. Gross margin, as a percent of revenue, was 45.9% for the fourth quarter of fiscal ‘19 compared to 45.1% in the fourth quarter of fiscal ‘18. Uniform rental and facility services operating segment gross margin, as a percent of revenue, improved 100 basis points from last year’s fourth quarter to 46%. And the first aid and safety services operating segment gross margin percentage improved 70 basis points to 47.7%. Reported operating income for the fourth quarter of fiscal ‘19 of $314.4 million increased 18.4%. Operating margin was 17.5% in the fourth quarter of fiscal ‘19 compared to 15.9% in fiscal ‘18. Operating income was negatively impacted by integration expenses relating to the G&K acquisition by $900,000 in the fourth quarter of fiscal ‘19 and $15 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal ‘18. Excluding the integration expenses related to the G&K acquisition, operating income increased 12.4% and operating margin improved 80 basis points to 17.6% in the fourth quarter of fiscal ‘19 compared to 16.8% in the fourth quarter of fiscal ‘18. Reported net income from continuing operations for the fourth quarter of fiscal ‘19 was $226.2 million and reported earnings per diluted share from continuing operations for the fourth quarter of fiscal ‘19 were $2.06. Reported EPS was negatively impacted by integration expenses related to the G&K acquisition by $0.01 in the fourth quarter of fiscal ‘19. Excluding the G&K acquisition integration expenses, net income dollars increased 13.5% and net income margin was 12.6% compared to 12% last year. EPS increased 16.9%. We are pleased with these fourth quarter results, which conclude a very successful year. A year ago, in our prepared remarks, we shared our expectations for fiscal ’19. We provided revenue and earnings per share guidance, we committed to an estimated amount of synergies from the G&K acquisition and the continued conversion of operations to a new ERP system. We shared our excitement for -- with returning to our debt to EBITDA target ahead of schedule, and we committed to returning to our historical priorities for deployment of cash. We are happy to report that we not only achieved, but exceeded these expectations.  For the ninth consecutive year, our organic growth rate was in the mid-to-high single digits. This means, we've been able to grow consistently in multiples of GDP and employment growth. Due to our strong growth, innovative products and services, and hard work and dedication of our employee partners, we moved up 41 places to number 459 in the Fortune 500 ranking. For the ninth consecutive year, we achieved double digit earnings per share growth from continuing operations when adjusted for one time and special items. We paid an annual dividend of $220.8 million that increased 26.5% over the prior year. We've now increased the annual dividend paid to our shareholders for the 35th consecutive year, and the company deployed excess cash by purchasing 4.8 million shares of company’s stock for a total amount of $953.4 million. Fiscal ‘19’s achievements were especially noteworthy given that they were accomplished in a period of extreme change management, in which we were integrating our largest acquisition to date and implementing a new enterprise resource planning system, namely SAP. The integration of a very large acquisition required the extra effort of everyone in the organization. Our partners executed our playbook and made the right adjustments when necessary. Better revenue retention and more cost synergies have resulted in a higher return on investments and plan. In many respects, the implementation of an ERP system is like an integration of a very large acquisition. It impacts hundreds of operations and requires the involvement of experts from all departments of the company.  The conversion of each operation to SAP is an eight-month process of planning, changing business processes and employee mindsets, training and certification and customer communication. In implementing SAP, we are moving from a decade’s old platform to new technology that provides powerful information and data designed to help us improve our business. Through fiscal ‘19, about 65% of the operations are now in SAP. We will complete the roll out to the remaining locations in fiscal ‘20. The Cintas’ story is one of growth. We have grown both revenue and profit 48 of the past 50 years. The only exceptions were the Great Recession years. Our successful financial formula is organic revenue growth in the mid-to-high single digits, double digit earnings per share growth, significant cash generation, and prudent deployment of excess cash. Our priorities for uses of cash are investing in the business for growth, acquisitions, dividends, and share repurchases. Our opportunity for continued growth is great. We have a product or service to help nearly every business get ready for the work day. This is evident in a diverse customer base spread over numerous verticals in both services providing and goods producing sectors of the economy. All businesses care about image, safety, cleanliness, or compliance, and businesses continue to outsource to concentrate on their core competencies. We are well positioned to continue to benefit from these tailwinds. We enjoy unrivaled scale, innovate our product and service offering, invest in technology, and build our brand. Cintas possesses numerous competitive advantages, but our greatest one is our culture. This year, Cintas celebrates our heritage 90 years in the making. The Cintas culture is a foundation upon which the company is built, and it is the reason for the company's success. The culture reflects our integrity, professionalism, and dedication to our customers. Other hallmarks including positive discontent and competitive urgency drive us to innovate and stay out in front of the competition. The Cintas culture is why even after nearly a century of success, we believe our best years are ahead. Before turning the call over to Paul for more details, I'll provide our fiscal ‘20 expectations. We expect revenue to be in the range of $7.24 billion to $7.31 billion. We expect EPS from continuing operations to be in the range of $8.30 to $8.45. Note the following regarding the guidance. The growth rate at the revenue guidance range is 5% to 6.1%. However, our fiscal ‘20 contains one less work day than our fiscal ‘19. Adjusting for this one day difference, on a constant work day basis, the revenue growth rate range at guidance is 5.4% to 6.5%. One less work day also has a negative impact on EPS, reducing it about $0.06, which is a 90 basis point drag on the EPS growth rate. The guidance assumes an effective tax rate for fiscal ‘20 of 21% compared to a rate of 19.9% for fiscal ‘19. The higher effective tax rate in fiscal ‘20 negatively impacts our EPS growth about 180 basis points and total EPS by about $0.14.  Keep in mind that the tax rate can move up or down from period to period based on discrete events, including the amount of stock compensation expense. The guidance assumes a share count for computing EPS of 109 million shares. This consists of diluted weighted average shares outstanding, plus participating securities in the form of restricted stock. It does not assume any future share buybacks, any potential deterioration in the US economy or any further specifically identified G&K integration expenses.  And lastly, the guidance does not or does include the impact from the adoption of the accounting standards update 2016-02 on leases. With the adoption, significant changes to the balance sheet will occur. We expect the assets and liabilities to increase in the range of $160 million to $185 million. However, we do not expect any material effect on the P&L or the cash flow. I’ll now turn the call over to Paul.
Paul Adler: Thank you, Mike. Please note that our fiscal fourth quarter contained the same number of work days as the prior year fourth quarter. Looking ahead to fiscal ’20, please note that there will be one less work day than in fiscal ‘19. One less day will negatively impact fiscal ’20 total revenue growth by 40 basis points. To illustrate the magnitude of the headwind, using fiscal ‘19’s annual revenue, one less work day equates to about $27 million. One less work day also has a negative impact on operating margin and EPS. Fiscal ‘20 operating income margin will be reduced by about 12.5 basis points in comparison to fiscal ‘19 due to one less day of revenue. The negative impact on the margin occurs because certain expenses like amortization of uniforms and entrance mats are expensed on a monthly basis as opposed to on a daily basis and we will have one less day of revenue to cover the expenses. As Mike stated, one less work day is a headwind of about 90 basis points on EPS growth, and about a $0.06 drag on total EPS in comparison to fiscal ‘19. Each quarter of fiscal ‘20 will contain 65 work days. In comparison to fiscal ’19, the fiscal ‘20 Q1 will have one less day; Q2 will have the same number of days; Q3 will have one additional day and Q4 will have one less day. Please keep the quarterly day differences in mind when modeling our fiscal ‘20 results. We have two reportable operating segments, uniform rental and facility services and first aid and safety services. The remainder of our business is included in all other. All other consists of fire protection services and our uniform direct sale business. First aid and safety services and all other are combined and presented as other services on the income statement. Uniform rental and facility services operating segment includes the rental and servicing of uniforms, mats and towels, and the provision of restroom supplies and other facility products and services. The segment also includes the sale of items from our catalogs to our customers on route.  Uniform rental and facility services revenue was $1.43 billion, an increase of 6.4%. Excluding the impact of acquisitions and foreign currency exchange rate changes, the organic growth rate was 6.8%. Our uniform rental and facility services segment gross margin was 46.0% for the fourth quarter compared to 45.0% in last year's fourth quarter, an improvement of 100 basis points. Energy expense, as a percentage of revenue, was 2.4% compared to 2.55% in the prior year quarter. We are pleased with the gross margin expansion and our ability to overcome wage pressures and tariff impacts. Our first aid and safety services operating segment includes revenue from the sale and servicing of first aid products, safety products and training. This segment’s revenue for the fourth quarter was $163.5 million. The organic growth rate for the segment was 10.7%. The first aid segment gross margin was 47.7% in the fourth quarter, compared to 47.0% in last year's fourth quarter, an increase of 70 basis points. First aid segment gross margins continue to increase with strong top line growth. As our volume grows, we can negotiate better pricing from vendors. Growth also enables us to improve route density, reducing gasoline and diesel costs, and enabling our service teams to spend more time serving and upsell. Our fire protection services and uniform direct sale businesses are reported in the all other category. Our fire business continues to grow each year at a strong pace. The uniform direct sale business growth rates are generally low single digits and are subject to volatility, such as when we install a multimillion dollar account. Uniform direct sale however, is a key business for us and its customers are all often significant opportunities to cross sell and provide products and services from our other business units. All other revenue was $201.8 million, an increase of 12.7%. The organic growth rate was 11.6% and was driven by 14.3% organic growth in the fire business. All other gross margin was 43.7% for the fourth quarter of this fiscal year compared to 43.6% for last year's fourth quarter. Selling and administrative expenses, as a percentage of revenue, were 28.3% in the fourth quarter of fiscal ‘19 and ‘18. Lower labor expense, as a percent of revenue, was offset by increases in other expenses including stock compensation, insurance, workers’ compensation and medical. We are self- insured and therefore subject to some volatility in workers’ comp and medical expense from quarter to quarter. Our effective tax rate on continuing operations for the fourth quarter of fiscal ‘19 was 21.7%. As Mike stated earlier, the tax rate can move from period to period based on discrete events, including the amount of stock compensation expense. Our cash and equivalents balance as of May 31 was $96.6 million. Operating cash flow in the fourth quarter of fiscal ‘19 increased 31% from the amount of operating cash flow in the fourth quarter of fiscal ‘18.  Capital expenditures in the fourth quarter were $68.9 million. Our CapEx by operating segment was as follows: $54.7 million in uniform rental and facility services; $9.6 million in first aid and safety; and $4.6 million in all other. We expect fiscal ‘20 CapEx to be in the range of $280 million to $310 million. As of May 31, total debt was $2,849,000,000; $2,537,000,000 was fixed interest rate debt and $312 million was variable rate debt in the form of a term loan and commercial paper. At May 31, we were at our targeted leverage of two times debt to EBITDA. That concludes our prepared remarks. We are happy to answer your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Manav Patnaik with Barclays.
Unidentified Analyst: Hi, this is actually Greg calling in. I was just hoping to get an update on the G&K synergies in terms of where we were exiting 2019, what we expect in 2020, and how you guys are feeling about potential sources of upside going forward.
Mike Hansen: We finished fiscal ‘19 a little bit over $100 million for the year, a little bit better than we expected at the beginning of the year. And I would expect that in fiscal ’20, we’ll get to the neighborhood of $135 million, which is right in the middle of the range that we guided to three years ago when we announced the G&K deal. So we feel great about achieving the synergies we initially set out to do. If we can get to that 135 in fiscal ’20, that's a year ahead of schedule, we had talked about a four year plan, and so we feel really good about achieving that. The lifting, the heavy lifting that's left continues to be the route optimization that will continue in fiscal ‘20. That's, as we've talked about over the last few years, that's not a source of significant synergies. We will get some energy benefits as we eliminate mileage on our routes, but we certainly are growing and need to continue to add capacity on route. So all in all, Greg, we feel great about where we are in that G&K integration.
Unidentified Analyst: And then I also wanted to ask about natural adjacencies out of your, outside of what is the core business currently. It seems like we're getting towards the end of some of the heavy lifting on the integration and the SAP implementation. And leverage is pretty reasonable at this point. Just wondering if that changes how you guys think about potentially going after some of these markets and what kind of markets that could potentially be?
Mike Hansen: Well, we, I would say this, we -- I mentioned a little bit in my prepared remarks that we look for opportunities in image, safety, cleanliness, and compliance and those are some pretty good umbrellas to be covering for our customers, and there are a lot of opportunities there. As we've seen over the years, we have had product adjacencies in all of our businesses and we're continuing to look for those under those four umbrellas that I mentioned. And certainly, we're looking for other things that may also be included under those umbrellas that could be possibly a different route structure or what have you. But, we're being disciplined and we want to make sure that there is long term value that there's a big market opportunity for any new type of product adjacency or business. We certainly, as you mentioned, we are at our two times leverage kind of a goal, and we've got a strong balance sheet and so we're going to be looking for opportunities to deploy that cash and certainly acquisitions and other investments in our product lines are right at the top of our list. So we'll be looking for opportunities.
Operator: Our next question will come from Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley.
Toni Kaplan: Wanted to get a sense of how you're thinking about the economic and employment outlook and basically what you're hearing from your customers right now in terms of their propensity to spend going forward, just some background on the industry would be great.
Mike Hansen: Well, we feel pretty good about the macro; still, the environment still feels pretty conducive to sell new business to continue to penetrate and you see with our fourth quarter revenue results, as well as the guidance that we've given that we feel pretty good about the momentum that we have in the business and that we’ll continue into our fiscal ‘20. We look at GDP for calendar ‘19, it’s still above expectations or still above 2%. If you think about the last nine years, that's the neighborhood in which we've performed and we've had a pretty good nine year period where we have grown in excess of that GDP and employment. So we still like the macro environment. In the last quarter, we've seen just under 500,000 jobs being created in the last six months, a million in the last year, 2 million. And so the job growth has continued to be pretty good as well. So Toni, we like the environment and as you can see by our fourth quarter and our guidance, we like the momentum in the business.
Toni Kaplan: That's great. And then in terms of margins, how should we be thinking about expansion across the segments in the upcoming year and then additionally, how should we be thinking about incremental SAP costs over next year.
Mike Hansen: So, from a margin perspective, our guidance would imply something in the way of low-to-mid 17s as a company, and we're certainly striving within each of our businesses to grow margins and that's our expectation. That margin expectation for fiscal ‘20 would include some pretty good incrementals as a total business. And so, we continue to look for opportunities and expect improvements in that.  From an SAP cost perspective, we’ll continue to roll that system out this fiscal year. And we've talked about some of those rollout costs rolling off after fiscal ‘20. That's been somewhere in the, let's call it, $10 million to $12 million because we've talked about SAP costs from a few years ago, increasing about 25, about half of which has been costs that are related to the rollout whether it's training, consultants, et cetera. So we do expect that some of that will roll off in fiscal ‘21.
Operator: And next, we'll go to Kevin McVeigh with Credit Suisse.
Kevin McVeigh: Hey, really nice job, the organic growth in the fire business, the 14.3%, was there anything in there in particular that kind of drove that and then just really, really, really nice margin expansion. Can you give us a sense of how much of a headwind kind of the tariffs and we just work because obviously we're able to really offset that nicely.
Paul Adler: Yeah. Kevin, it’s Paul. I'll talk about fire and turn it to Mike on the tariffs. But in terms of fire, yeah, the organic growth was strong at 14%. But we continue to expect out of that business, organic growth of 10% or a little bit better. So, very good execution in Q4. But that's kind of par for the course with the fire business of late. So nothing specific to really call out. But we just continue to do a great job of winning business. We have a very professional, aggressive sales force, and kind of leveraging our service capabilities that we have in uniform rental, and our experiences there through the fire business and very professional service oriented businesses on the service side, and so we expect that strong organic growth to continue.
Mike Hansen: Kevin from a tariff standpoint, there certainly has been a lot of noise in the tariff environment, and -- but I would say, certainly a little bit of impact, not a lot, the noise around Mexico kind of came and went. China, while we have seen a lot of noise and seen some tariffs, we have not been too affected by the first couple of buckets of those tariffs. But we're not immune to additional tariffs that might happen. We have to stay ahead of those things and so we're seeing a little bit of it. But there's probably more noise than impact. From a labor perspective, we have certainly seen some impact market by market especially. I wouldn't say that it's been significant. We do, in our production or our plant’s environment, we do see a little bit more difficulty in hiring people. But generally speaking, the pressures that we've seen have been not significant and we've been able to deal with them quite well so far. We're certainly going to need to continue to keep our eyes on all of the tariff information that's going on, though as we move forward.
Operator: Our next question will come from Gary Bisbee with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Gary Bisbee: I guess if I could go back to margins and the margins implied in the guidance. I think if we back out the margin benefit from the tale of the G&K synergies and also the drag from one less work day, it doesn't sound like the guidance implies a whole lot of margin expansion outside of those -- from those two factors, so I know you tend to have some conservatism in how you guide, but is there anything else you'd call out that would lead to less operating leverage in fiscal ‘20?
Mike Hansen: No, and quite honestly, Gary, I'm not sure that I would agree. I think if you think about that margin improvement, that's, let's call it low to mid 17s compared to 16.7 for fiscal ‘19 would imply, at the midpoint, roughly incrementals right around 30%. That's at the high end of where we've talked about being. If you strip out those incremental synergies, you're still above 20% at the midpoint. So we feel we're right where we want to be with those operating margins and we do expect continued improvement even without the synergies, but inclusive of the synergies, we like the margin expansion quite a bit. Keep in mind, Gary, keep in mind that when we compare, if you're backing from EPS, we've got a $0.14 headwind in the higher tax rate than in fiscal ‘18 and then as you mentioned, we've got the $0.06 headwind from the one less work day. So if you're backing in from EPS, you got to keep in mind, there's a $0.20 headwind. 
Gary Bisbee: Yeah, I guess I was just doing, you said 35 million incremental savings, that's 50 basis points and then that's offset by 10 or 15 from the one less work day. It’s sort of like half that margin, but I guess your point is fair that the other half is still pretty good expansion, so that's fine. I guess I just want to ask one other thing…
Mike Hansen: Yeah. And I would say from a synergy standpoint, Gary, I would -- we think about it as 105 to 135. So about a $30 million improvement.
Gary Bisbee: Okay. All right, fair enough. And then on SAP, a two parter, you've, I guess, you said, you're 65% of the way through the network rollout at this point, you've talked about two benefits, the one you're most excited about is just the information allowing you to cross sell and run the business better. How is that playing out, once you've got one of your facilities that is up and running, is that pretty quick or is there a meaningful learning curve? And I guess what I'm really trying to get at is, are you beginning to benefit yet from the rollout to date, or should we think of it more as a future benefit, later this year, maybe even more so into next year.
Mike Hansen : Sure. There is a learning curve. No question about it. This is a system that is heavily data dependent and we have to change our business processes locally to be able to use that system most efficiently. So, there is a drag in terms of, we talked about an eight month planning process prior to implementation, there's also a period of time afterwards where we're getting efficient at using the system. So it certainly is a process and a lot of change going on.  From a local perspective, I think we are seeing some incremental benefits like new portable route computers for our SSRs and so there are some incremental benefits that are probably more on the minor side. I think from the ability to manage the information, we would typically do that at greater than a one location at a time type of a look. And so the more we get on, the more we can begin to look at different regional groupings and take advantage of the power of that information. So I think most of that is going to come as we move into ‘21 and ‘22.
Gary Bisbee: And then if I could just sneak in one quick cleanup number, you said last quarter you expected like in the cadence of ‘19, that the Q1 tax rate would be a lot lower. Is last year's number a good ballpark or should we think it's higher than that, but still much lower than the rest of the year?
Mike Hansen: Yes, you're right, Gary. It will be quite a bit lower. I would probably think of it in terms of a kind of a 12% to 13% type of a range and a lot of that will depend on the level of stock compensation benefits based on the price of our stock, the performance of the stock, but you're right, it'll be much lower than the rest of the year.
Operator: Our next question will come from Blake Johnson with Goldman Sachs.
Blake Johnson: Hi, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions. Regarding your revenue guidance, how much of the growth do you expect to be driven by further penetration of the non-programmer market versus headcount growth at existing customers? And can you discuss traction and penetrating underrepresented verticals such as healthcare and industrials this quarter?
Mike Hansen: Sure. So, for fiscal 20, our new business efforts are generally the driver of our revenue growth in all of our businesses and we like the opportunities there particularly in that no programmer space, we can get to that no programmer space with our unique garments, with our unique garment solutions like our scrub systems and we think there's a big opportunity there. So, we expect that to continue to drive the growth like it has for years past, but the penetration remains good. It's when we can provide a good product and articulate the value to our customers. They certainly have shown that they're willing to spend, so that certainly will be important for us, but it's led by the new business efforts. From a fourth quarter perspective, those under penetrated verticals continue to perform very well: healthcare, education, the government sectors, they continue to perform very well. We are focused on those areas, particularly with our sales efforts. And we're encouraged by what we have seen in ‘19 and expect good things out of those verticals also in fiscal ‘20 and beyond.
Blake Johnson: And then regarding G&K, one of the strategic benefits was to drive higher penetration of ancillary products to legacy G&K customers. Can you discuss any progress made here? Maybe the current percentage of cross selling between various lines of business or any other metrics that would be great.
Mike Hansen: We certainly have made progress in fiscal ‘19 in terms of some penetration, it's hard. I'm not going to provide any specific penetration because so much of that volume is intermixed with legacy Cintas volume. However, we certainly have seen that our penetration has been strong. Our hygiene growth has been strong for the year. And so we are encouraged and believe that we've made some good headway there and expect to continue that in fiscal ‘20. But I would say, overall, we're pleased.
Operator: Next, we’ll go to Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan.
Andrew Steinerman: Just a quick comment about client retention levels and any changes year-over-year and my second question is the pricing for new accounts, has that seen any upward movement in recent years?
Paul Adler: Andrew, it’s Paul. In terms of retention, I would say that really no significant change in our business. It's been roughly about 95% and that's still where it was last fiscal year, and that's where we still expect it to be. Of course, we're always working on improving that and there are opportunities, but I would say nothing significant to note. In terms of pricing, I've been doing a lot of businesses for new accounts. 
Mike Hansen: Andrew, it's a pretty competitive environment still out there. And I'll give you an example. When we're out there selling work wear, for example, our customers have lots of options and, and so there is a retail option, where we're seeing billions of dollars being spent at retail, large retailers, we're seeing direct sale options where those competitors can design and manage programs and we're seeing the rental option as well. So our customers have alternatives and options. And so we have to continue to innovate and create good garments and other products, we've got to be able to articulate the value of what we do versus a retail environment versus a direct sale program. And we've got to follow through on that great service. So the point Andrew is, our customers still have lots of options. The competition is certainly out there, and is available to them and we've got to make sure that we are providing the right value. And so all of that competition keeps, it's a bit of a governor on what we can do with pricing. And so while we are looking for the best price and we sell profitable new business, there certainly is competition that keeps that pricing in a bit of a tighter range.
Operator: Next, our question will come from Seth Weber with RBC Capital Markets.
Seth Weber: I wanted to ask about the big share buyback in the fourth quarter. In your prepared remarks, you kind of listed share buyback as I think, third or fourth in your pecking order. So, I mean, is this just a function of you couldn't find acquisitions that you liked or valuations just stretched above what you're willing to pay or can you just sort of characterize why the buyback was so strong in the fourth quarter relative to kind of your pecking order? Thanks.
Mike Hansen: Sure, our pecking order is just as we said, and we are certainly looking for opportunities, but I'll tell you, Seth, our cash flow was really good. In the fourth quarter, our cash flow from operations was just under $400 million. In the third quarter, it was $325 million. So $725 million in the second half of the year. So cash flow has been really good. And, look, we like to put that to work. We would love to be, we have continued to invest in the business. We would love to find acquisitions. We are aggressively working on those, but we can do the buyback that we just did in the fourth quarter and still do execute on a large acquisition if it became available. So it's a little bit opportunistic. We like the momentum in the business, the average of those, the average buyback was something in the way of just under $220 million for the fourth quarter. And based on where our stock sits today, it feels like a pretty good move for us. So I think it's opportunistic, we’ll continue to look at it this way. But we certainly love investing in the business and we love to make acquisitions as well.
Seth Weber: And then just maybe just to comment on the SG&A in the fourth quarter was kind of flattish year to year, you did mention some extraordinary costs, so I think, that offset the lower labor. So, how are you thinking about SG&A as a percentage of revenue for next year? Should you see some leverage there? Should it go down as a percentage of revenue?
Mike Hansen: We certainly do. If you think about the fourth quarter, one of the call outs that Paul made was our stock compensation expense. Our stock continues to perform very, very well and we love that. But it does result in greater stock comp expense, it was higher by about 30 basis points than last year. When we have a good stock performance, we generally will also get a lot of stock option exercises, which we had in the fourth quarter, which was why our tax rate was a little lower than guided. And when we have those exercises, because they are non-qualified stock options, there is an employer portion of payroll tax. And so when you combine those things, it's a little bit of a headwind. We don't mind it because of the stock performance, but it was there. For the year, our SG&A was down 30 basis points, and we certainly do expect to get leverage in fiscal ‘20 and beyond. That doesn't mean it's going to happen every quarter, but certainly over the course of the year, we expect it.
Operator: And next, we'll go to Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer.
Scott Schneeberger: I have three, but a couple might be quick and easy. First one, the way you guys have sized the synergies, it's been more in a time period of achievement than it has been, any change to the absolute level. And you said obviously, the route optimization is the last big piece that isn't going to be super impactful. So I guess the question I'm getting at is, is there potential upside to the 130, 140, once we get out a year from now, or is this probably going to be it for the way you guys discuss it?
Mike Hansen: Well, two things. First of all, the upside, I've mentioned a few times in the past, we think is coming, will come from our sourcing environment, as we kind of combine the G&K spend, legacy G&K spend and our spend. We have seen some of that heavy lifting that is rolling into our P&L and will continue to do so in fiscal ‘21. And we look for continued opportunities and benefits there. So if it gets above the 135, that I mentioned earlier, and we generally expect that it will, it'll likely be in that service, I'm sorry, in that supply chain area.  I'll say this though, Scott. It gets harder as -- the farther we get from the acquisition date, it gets harder and harder to specifically say whether it's a synergy or just more efficiency in the business. And so our expectation is after fiscal ‘20, we won't be talking about that quite as much and we'll be moving forward with looking for all different kinds of efficiencies in the business.
Scott Schneeberger: The next question is just on CapEx, looks like an increase of about 1% to about 12% at the high end of the range year over year. I was just curious what would be the swing factors of the 1% versus a 12% over the coming year on a year over year basis?
Mike Hansen: I'm a little confused by what you mean by 1% to 12%.
Scott Schneeberger: Just comparing the spend – for the guide of fiscal ‘20 versus fiscal ‘19, assuming my numbers are right.
Mike Hansen: So the guide of 280 to 310, you're saying it's a, you're saying a 12% increase over our CapEx for fiscal ‘19?
Scott Schneeberger: Yeah, that's correct. At the high end, it's 1% at the low end…
Mike Hansen: Yeah, I'm sorry. Sorry, it took me a bit to understand that. Look, we're growing, we're growing nicely. And we've, as you know, we consolidated quite a few G&K locations into Cintas locations, but there still are capacity needs, particularly in those markets that didn't have a G&K operation in them. And so we do have capacity needs as we continue to grow, and I would expect that that would, that that fact would continue, if we continue to grow the way we're growing. And so we're going to probably have a little bit of an uptick this fiscal ’20, just simply because we are continuing to grow and add more plants than probably we have in the last few years because of the consolidation efforts.
Scott Schneeberger: And that third question that I wanted to get in with was on the fourth quarter call and in years past, you've shared a little bit of information with regard to uniform segment revenue mix. I'm not anticipating much of a change, but is that something you're open to sharing this year?
Paul Adler: Yeah, Scott. I have that and you're right, not much of a change. Uniform rental, and as you mentioned, this is measured as a percentage of the uniform rental and facility services segment and it’s Q4 data. So uniform rental, 50% of the mix. Dust control came in at 18%; hygiene is 14%, shop towels at 5%, linen 9% and then catalog was about 4%.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And next we'll go to Justin Hauke with Robert W. Baird.
Justin Hauke: I guess the one question that I had here just on the balance sheet, and, kudos for getting the leverage down to where you're looking to hold it at two times. But I'm curious on the upside, in the cycle where we are today, how much leverage would you be willing to tolerate to the extent that there were opportunities, whether an ancillary business or your current business, maybe there were more material acquisitions that would be out there. How much leverage would you be willing to put on the balance sheet here?
Mike Hansen: Well, I'll start with, we currently have a covenant that limits us to 3.5 now. We've got a great banking group and if we had an acquisition that forced us to go above 3.5, then we would look at it in a couple of different ways. First, does it create the long term value that would warrant that kind of leveraging? And secondly, given then the combined cash flow, would we be able to reduce that fairly quickly like we did with the G&NK, after the G&K deal closed? We would look at it from those two standpoints. So I think it just depends on the value and the long term value creation. But we'd certainly, if we felt like it was a great opportunity, we certainly would evaluate that.
Operator: Our next question will come from Dan Dolev with Nomura.
Dan Dolev: So on uniform rental organic growth, I can't believe I'm complaining here, because 6.8 is truly an amazing number. But, comparison was about 120 basis points easier. I mean, what can get us upside to that number in fiscal ‘20? Is it productivity, is it up selling like, when can get to that heydays of the 8% organic growth? What needs to happen for that thing?
Mike Hansen: Well, we would certainly need a very good macro and we like the macro today. But we would need a good macro. We need to be firing on all cylinders in terms of our sales productivity and with some good and innovative products and services. And, we've got to be really on our game to sell into our current existing customers. Dan, the last four years, our organic growth has been right in this range where we came in this fourth quarter, and we talked about a few times in the past, we like this pace. It allows us to manage the growth in sales reps, the growth in route capacity, the growth in production capacity, and so we do like the pace and we think that we can get some pretty good margin improvement when we're at this kind of pace, we can manage the business very well. And we like it, the last four years, we've been -- our organic growth in total has been 6.8, 6.7, 7.1, 6.5 and obviously, the 6.5 included the first quarter, where we were bottoming out in terms of the post G&K. That's right where we want to be, that 6.8 and our guidance for next year is pretty darn close to that. So that's the pace we like, Dan.
Dan Dolev: And then just a quick follow up on the productivity just to be clear. I think last quarter, you said that sales productivity was good, but if I can quote, not as good as it was in the second quarter, is there an update to that one in terms of how it trended in the fourth quarter?
Mike Hansen: Yes, Dan, you are correct. We were making great progress on sales rep productivity, kind of coming out of the G&K acquisition in terms of filling the sales roles and getting everybody trained and up to speed and then also getting the systems converted, which was necessary for those G&K reps to sell the Cintas product line. You'll recall, we’re making nice improvement through Q2 and then last quarter in Q3 with some weather impacts, we noted that the productivity dipped, but in Q4, it did bounce back very nicely, even stronger than it was in Q2.
Operator: Our next question will come from Tim Mulrooney with William Blair.
Tim Mulrooney: A couple of quick ones here. First of all, if I go back to the fourth quarter, and I look at uniform rental segment gross margin expansion of 100 basis points year-over-year and that's a very solid result. Can you just walk us through the primary factors driving that expansion outside of the lower energy costs?
Mike Hansen: Yeah, we certainly got some good leverage from the revenue growth. We had some nice synergy capture. Energy, as you said, helped a little bit and we're selling profitable business. And so a lot of things went well in the quarter from a pricing perspective, probably a little bit better in the fourth quarter incrementally than in previous quarters, the pricing while still competitive, as I talked about, with Andrew’s question, probably just a little bit, incrementally more positive. And that certainly helps the margin as well. So all in all, great synergy, great leveraging, selling good profitable business and a little bit of energy help, all put together for a pretty good quarter. If I could add that this -- the rental gross margin for the year was up 170 basis points from our fiscal ’16, which was the year before the G&K deal. So if you think about adding a legacy G&K business with a gross margin of about 37.5% to now today that full rental gross – full your rental gross margin of 45.5, we've made some great progress in the last few years and our partners have worked so hard in integrating this acquisition. We bought a very good business and our new partners have done a great job, our existing partners have as well. And it really shows in this fiscal ‘19 year with some really good margins, especially in that gross margin area.
Tim Mulrooney: Yeah. I think everybody in the investment community would agree with that statement. It’s been very impressive. If I could move on, how much do you have remaining on your buyback, Mike, and does your guidance assume -- what does your guidance assume with respect to share repurchase?
Mike Hansen: We have 263 million on the billion that was authorized last fall. And the guidance assumes no additional share buybacks.
Tim Mulrooney: No additional share buybacks, okay. And lastly from me, any quantifiable impact from weather in the quarter. I mean, we had more rainfall across the US this quarter, but I'm not sure if that has the same level of impact that the cold weather had last quarter.
Mike Hansen: Not nearly the same widespread impact. So nothing worth calling out.
Operator: And that does conclude our question-and-answer session for today and I'd like to turn the call back over to Mike Hansen for any additional or closing remarks.
Mike Hansen: Well, thank you again for joining us tonight. We will issue our first quarter financial results in September and we look forward to speaking with you again at that time.
Operator: That does conclude our conference for today. Thank you for your participation.

===== 2019 Q3  (2019-03-21 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Cintas Quarterly Earnings Results Conference Call. Today’s call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Mike Hansen, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead, sir.
Mike Hansen: Good evening and thank you for joining us. With me is Paul Adler, Cintas’ Vice President and Treasurer. We will discuss our third quarter results for fiscal 2019. After our commentary, we will be happy to answer questions. The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a Safe Harbor from civil litigation for forward-looking statements.  This conference call contains forward-looking statements that reflect the company’s current views as to future events and financial performance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those we may discuss. I refer you to the discussion on these points contained in our most recent filings with the SEC. Revenue for the third quarter of fiscal 2019 was $1.68 billion, an increase of 5.9% over last year's third quarter. The organic growth rate, which adjusts for the impacts of acquisitions and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations was 6%. In the third quarter of fiscal 2019, the organic growth rate for the Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segment was 6.2%, and the organic growth rate for the First Aid and Safety Services operating segment was 8.6%. The organic growth rates of both segments were negatively impacted by a greater number of customers being closed for business in this year's third quarter compared to last year’s third quarter due to severe winter weather and the timing of the holidays, Christmas Eve and New Year's Eve fell on a Monday this year compared to on a Sunday in the prior year. Gross margin for the third quarter of fiscal 2019 of $755.2 million increased 7.8%. Gross margin as a percentage of revenue was 44.9% for the third quarter of fiscal 2019, compared to 44.1% in the third quarter of fiscal 2018. Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segment gross margin as a percentage of revenue improved 80 basis points from last year's third quarter to 44.9%, and the First Aid and Safety Services operating segment gross margin percentage improved 130 basis points to 48.2%. Reported operating income for the third quarter of fiscal 2019 of $278.3 million increased 39.1%. Operating income margin was 16.5% in the third quarter of fiscal 2019 compared to 12.6% in fiscal 2018. Operating income was negatively impacted by integration expenses related to the G&K acquisition by $800,000 in the third quarter of fiscal 2019 and $9.8 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2018. Operating income in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 was also reduced $39.7 million by a one-time cash payment to Cintas employees following the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act signed into legislation on December 22, 2017. Excluding the integration expenses related to the G&K acquisition and the one-time cash payment to employees, operating income increased 11.8% and operating income margin improved 90 basis points to 16.6% in the third quarter of fiscal 2019 compared to 15.7% in the third quarter of fiscal 2018. Reported net income from continuing operations for the third quarter of fiscal 2019 was $200.9 million, and reported earnings per diluted share from continuing operations for the third quarter of fiscal 2019 were $1.83. Please note that there were a few items impacting the comparability of reported financial results. First, G&K acquisition integration expenses negatively impacted reported EPS in the third quarter of fiscal 2019 and 2018 by $0.01 and $0.06 respectively. Also, reported EPS in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 included a negative impact of $0.24 from the one-time cash payment to employees. Finally, reported EPS in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 included a positive impact of $1.59 from benefits under the Tax Act, primarily due to a one-time re-evaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities. Excluding these items, net income dollars increased 31.7% and net income margin was 12% compared to 9.6% last year. EPS increased 34.3%. As Scott Farmer, our Chairman and CEO stated in today's press release, we're pleased with our third quarter financial performance. Our employee partners are working diligently to exceed customer expectations while also making significant progress on integrating the G&K acquisition and converting more operations to our new enterprise resource planning system. And while our employee partners are focused on getting customers ready for the work day, we remain committed to efforts to increase shareholder value. In this year's third quarter, we paid an annual dividend totaling $220.8 million. The dividend of $2.05 per share was an increase of 26.5% over last year's dividend. Also in the quarter, we purchased $100 million of Cintas stock under our buyback program. As of February 28, we have now purchased $546.6 million of Cintas stock during fiscal 2019, and the amount remaining under our buyback program is $863.4 million. We updated our annual guidance for fiscal 2019, we expect revenue to be in the range of $6.87 billion to $6.885 billion. This implies a strong finish to our fiscal 2019 year, with fourth quarter revenue growth in the range of 6% to 7%, and operating income margin in the range of 17% to 17.5%. We expect EPS from continuing operations excluding certain items to be in the range of $7.42 to $7.48. Note the following regarding the EPS guidance, it assumes an effective tax rate for fiscal 2019 of 20.6%. This implies a fourth quarter effective tax rate of 24.5%. The reported effective tax rate in last year's fourth quarter was 21.5%. The higher tax rate expected in the fourth quarter of this year will have a negative impact of $0.07 to $0.08. Keep in mind that the tax rate can move up or down from period-to-period based on discrete events including the amount of stock compensation benefits. Our guidance assumes that diluted share count from -- for computing EPS of 111.5 million shares. It does not assume any future G&K integration expenses and it does not assume any future share buybacks. I'll now turn the call over to Paul.
Paul Adler : Thank you, Mike. Please note that our fiscal third quarter contained the same number of work days as the prior year third quarter. Additionally, there will be no work day differences in our fiscal fourth quarter. Looking ahead to fiscal 2020, please note that there will be one less work day than in fiscal 2019. Each quarter of fiscal 2020 will contain 65 work days. One less day will negatively impact fiscal 2020 total revenue growth by about 40 to 50 basis points. To illustrate the magnitude of the headwind using fiscal 2019’s third quarter revenue, one work day is about $26 million. One less work day also has a negative impact on operating margin. Fiscal 2020 operating income margin will be reduced by about 10 to 15 basis points in comparison to fiscal 2019. The negative impact on the margin occurs because certain expenses, like amortization of uniforms and entrance mats are expensed on a monthly basis as opposed to on a daily basis, and we will have one less day of revenue to cover the expenses. Please keep these headwinds in mind when modeling our fiscal 2020 results. We have two reportable operating segments, Uniform Rental and Facility Services, and First Aid and Safety Services. The remainder of our businesses included in All Other. All Other consists of Fire Protection Services, and our Uniform Direct Sale business. First Aid and Safety Services and All Other are combined and presented as other services on the income statement. Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segment includes the rental and servicing of uniforms, mats, and towels, and the provision of restroom supplies and other facility products and services. The segment also includes the sale of items from our catalogs to our customers on route. Uniform Rental and Facility Services revenue was $1,358 million, an increase of 5.7%. Excluding the impact of acquisitions and foreign currency exchange rate changes, the organic growth rate was 6.2%. As Mike mentioned earlier, the organic growth rate was negatively impacted by customer closures caused by the severe weather and the holiday calendar. Our Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment gross margin was 44.9% for the third quarter compared to 44.1% in last year's third quarter, an improvement of 80 basis points. Energy expense as a percentage of revenue was 2.4% compared to 2.5% in the prior year quarter. We are pleased with the gross margin expansion and our ability to overcome the weather and holiday challenges, as well as continued wage pressures, increased commodity costs such as for hangers which are sourced mostly from China, and the inefficiencies that are customary with an acquisition integration and an ERP system implementation. Our First Aid and Safety Services operating segment includes revenue from the sale and servicing of First Aid products, safety products and training. This segment’s revenue for the third quarter was $149.2 million. The organic growth rate for the segment was 8.6%. This segment too was negatively impacted by severe weather and the timing of the holidays. The First Aid segment gross margin was 48.2% in the third quarter compared to 46.9% in last year's third quarter, an increase of 130 basis points. Note that First Aid segment gross margins are at record levels and had been marching higher since the acquisition of ZEE Medical three and half years ago. National account new business continues to help drive high-single digit organic growth. Penetration of existing customers with more products and services is also a major contributor to top line growth and it results in above average gross margins. Our Fire Protection Services and Uniform Direct Sale businesses are reported in the All Other category. Our Fire business continues to grow each year at a strong pace. Uniform Direct Sale business growth rates are generally low-single digits and are subject to volatility, such as when we install a multimillion dollar account. Uniform Direct Sale however is a key business for us and its customers are often significant opportunities to cross sell and provide products and services from other business units. All Other revenue was $174.8 million, an increase a 4.5%. The organic growth rate was 2.3% and was driven by 11.3% organic growth in the Fire business. All Other gross margin was 42.3% for the third quarter of this fiscal year compared to 41.7% for last year's third quarter. Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue were 28.3% in the third quarter compared to 30.9% in last year's third quarter. Note that the one-time cash payment to employees in last year's third quarter that Mike mentioned earlier was recorded in selling and administrative expenses. Excluding this payment, last year’s selling administrative expense as a percent of revenue was 28.4% compared to 28.3% in this year's third quarter. Our effective tax rate on continuing operations for the third quarter of fiscal 2019 was 20.1%. In the third quarter of fiscal 2018 we realized a significant tax benefit from the Tax Act, primarily due to a one-time revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities. Our fiscal 2019 EPS guidance assumes an effective tax rate of 20.6% this implies a fourth quarter effective tax rate of 24.5%. The effective tax rate in last year's fourth quarter was 21.5%. As Mike stated previously the higher expected tax rate will have a negative impact on fourth quarter EPS of $0.07 to $0.08.  Our cash and equivalents balance as of February 28 was $80.9 million. Operating cash flow in the third quarter of fiscal 2019 increased 15.7% from the amount of operating cash flow in the third quarter of fiscal 2018. Capital expenditures in the third quarter were $70.2 million, our CapEx by operating segment was as follows, $55.8 million in Uniform Rental and Facility Services, $8.1 million in First Aid and Safety and $6.3 million in All Other. We expect fiscal 2019 CapEx to be in the range of $270 million to $285 million. As of February 28, total debt was $2,754.5 million, $2,537 million is fixed interest rate debt and $217.5 million is variable rate commercial paper. At February 28, we are at our targeted leverage of 2 times debt to EBITDA.  That concludes our prepared remarks. We are happy to answer your questions.
Operator: Thank you. The floor is now open for questions. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley.
Toni Kaplan : Hi, good afternoon.
Mike Hansen: Hi, Toni. 
Toni Kaplan : Uniform Rental was a bit below what we'd expected this quarter. Could you just give us the organic growth ex the holiday shift and ex the weather closure? And is it possible that any sales were bumped into the fourth quarter?
Mike Hansen : We expect that the impact was about 60 basis points to the growth of both rental and the total company. And I would say that we don't expect much to be bumped to the fourth quarter, and that's why you see the guidance coming down from a revenue perspective a little bit greater than the 60 basis points for the third quarter, 60 basis points is roughly $10 million in the quarter. When we think about that quarter, this is the first year since fiscal 2015 that the holidays weren’t either on a Friday or a Monday. A Friday, the weekend or a Monday. And we just found there were many of our customers not only took off for holiday, but took off the Monday before the holiday, took off a day or so after the holidays as well. And when that happened, it just created a lot of disruption to our -- for example our new business effort where appointment setting for our sales reps became very, very difficult, and the momentum that they had going into the holidays was really stopped. And they had to regain that momentum with the decision maker meetings, et cetera after the holidays. The other thing was the weather, I mean, we -- if you think about the polar vortex for example, we had customer shutdowns from Minnesota all the way to the East Coast. And again, that creates real challenges for our sales people to get continued momentum of meeting with decision makers, et cetera, and it also has an impact on our drivers. Our drivers we call them service sales reps or SSRs.  When our customers close, our SSRs have to squeeze more stops into a fewer number of days. And when that happens, our SSRs have less time to look for revenue opportunities. There's less -- because the customers are closed, there is less customer traffic to use our restroom products, for example. So, it certainly did have an impact on the quarter.
Toni Kaplan : Okay, great. And then I wanted to understand all other a little bit better. It sounds like fire was really strong with 11% organic growth. So I'm guessing that means that direct sales were sort of weaker. Was it fire that drove the strong margins in that segment? I know that they jump around, but given last quarter was a little bit on the weaker side, was this sort of a catch up or was it the mix shift; just wanted to understand all other margin a little bit better? Thanks.
Paul Adler: Yes, Toni, it's Paul. You are right, fire had a very strong quarter organically. And so, then the corollary is that Uniform Direct Sale did not perform as well. You know, that that direct sale business, it's non-recurring revenue, so it's a little harder to forecast, it's lumpier, it depends on rollouts, and it's tougher to forecast and the sales cycle is longer as well. So it's UDS, the Uniform Direct Sale business did come in lighter than we expected, and of course that suppressed margins as well. The Fire business overall, still continues to perform very well, high-single digit organic growth is the expectations and those margins will continue to improve rather as the organic growth continues to tick up.
Toni Kaplan : Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Manav Patnaik with Barclays Capital.
Manav Patnaik: Good evening, guys. I just wanted to see if I could reconcile this right. So you said the impact in the quarter from both weather and I guess two less days was $10 million, but then for 2020 one less work day impacts you $26 million for the full year. So I mean is -- like is it just because it was in that holiday period maybe and it was less of an impact?
Mike Hansen : Well, Manav when we have customers close, our goal is to reschedule the visit to them. So it's not like we completely lose one full day of revenue. We will still get the rental revenue. We just have to reschedule the stop so that we can pick up for example, dirty uniforms drop off clean, and we will still generate revenue because of that. But when we are doing that, it's the things like continuing to look for the penetration opportunities that suffer a bit. It's the new business that suffers a little bit.  So we don't lose all of the days’ revenue. Because we have to still visit and serve the customer, it’s just that the penetration opportunities and the new business productivity was challenged a bit. And despite all of that, 6.2% organic growth rate is still a pretty good performance by our rental business despite the challenges that we have. You're right though, as we think about 2020 that's a full day that we lose and don't get back in terms of the revenue within that fiscal year. And so that $26 million that Paul referenced, that's just an example of if you take our total revenue, divided by the number of workdays this past quarter, that's effectively the impact that it would have next year.
Manav Patnaik: Okay, got it. And then maybe just the latest on the G&K integration, I guess just what's the next milestones we should be looking to hear from you guys?
Paul Adler: Yes, Manav, the integration continues to progress very nicely. It doesn't mean though, that there's not heavy lifting going on in our operations still. That heavy lifting is typically now in the form of rerouting. And we expect that to continue into fiscal 2020. What we're really trying to do Manav is, in certain markets to minimize the disruption kind of sync up the rerouting for the G&K acquisition with the SAP conversion. So to minimize disruption to the operation, to the customers kind of handle all that change management at one-time.  So yes, still some inefficiencies exists in those markets where they're going through that. As I mentioned, that'll continue into 2020. But, the operations are doing a very nice job of taking care of the customer. And I think that the solid financial results are kind of a testament to that fact.
Manav Patnaik: Got it. Thanks a lot, guys.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan Securities. 
Andrew Steinerman : Hi, guys. You're going to hate this question, but I'm going to try it. When you look at the legacy G&K portfolio business, how fast do you think it's growing relative to 6% organic overall. And if you could talk about, sales force productivity in getting that G&K legacy business cross selling, et cetera? 
Mike Hansen : So, you're right, Andrew that's a really tough question. But I would say that the growth isn't quite near the legacy Cintas levels yet. We are seeing some nice performance in things like our hygiene penetration. And so we really do like the direction, but I would say we're likely not where legacy Cintas locations are just yet, but it's really hard to tell, because we have we have transferred so much volume from close locations to Cintas locations, we have as we optimize routes, we are moving G&K volume into Cintas and Cintas into G&K. So it's really -- it’s very muddy when you try to parse that out. As it relates to the sales rep productivity, we have one sales team. Let's make sure we're clear on that. And the productivity is still very, very good. It's better than a year ago, it's not quite as high as it was in the second quarter because of some of the challenges that I mentioned a few minutes ago. But we're still very pleased with that performance.
Andrew Steinerman : Any milestones ahead on crush selling that you could talk about into that G&K legacy business.
Mike Hansen : I would say, because the business is so blended, Andrew. Our goal is just continuing to manage the business location by location, but we'll be reporting on it in total because it's so difficult. And we'll do our best to give some color like we have in the last couple quarters of that we like the revenue performance in former G&K customers. But it's going to be -- there's going to be a little bit more anecdotal as we go forward because of the blending of that. But if you think about the impact that I mentioned in terms of the weather on holidays, that's kind of turns of 6.2 into about a 6.8. And that performance we really like and certainly there is some help compared to where we were a year ago in terms of penetration at legacy G&K customers. Pretty hard to give a specific number, but we know there are some -- these certainly are signs of success.
Andrew Steinerman : Okay, thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Gary Bisbee with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Gary Bisbee: Hey, guys. Good afternoon. I guess the first one just following up on Andrew’s question. This is the question, I think we all get all the time about the cross sell and you've never really provided any disclosure of any metrics consistently that would help people think about it. Have you -- and I know you have historically said, competitive reasons you didn't want to give too much.  But I mean, have you thought about, potentially, at some point introducing some metrics to help us track the success that you're having, whether it's customer accounts that we could look at revenue per customer or any other metric, it seems to me it would be helpful to your investor base if you were to provide something.
Mike Hansen : Well, I certainly can appreciate that, Gary. We -- as you said, for competitive reasons, we don't like to give too much of that information. But I will tell you practically, if you think about what we've had going on over the last few years, we're talking about the largest integration that we've had in our rental business, the largest integration we've ever had in our First Aid business, and an SAP conversion. There's a lot going on and to try to get the kind of data that we would be comfortable enough providing externally out of the three different systems that we've been on that would be very, very challenging. And I understand your request and as we get fully on to SAP, we will certainly give that some hard thought. But gosh, we're in the midst of a lot of things going on that would make that kind of reporting pretty challenging.
Gary Bisbee: Yes, fair point. I'll ask you again once SAP is fully up and running. That's a good point. 
Mike Hansen : I will expect that question in a couple years.
Gary Bisbee: Fair enough. A couple of other ones. So a quarter ago, you said fairly strongly that you are seeing no signs of economic weakness from the customer base in the U.S. and Canada, do you have the same level of conviction or is that same statement ring through today or give -- has the trade impact and some of the other things that have been out there? Have you noticed any impact in the last three months that would change that kind of statement? Thanks.
Mike Hansen : Gary, we still like the environment that we're operating in. Aside from the weather challenges, we like the environment and our customers seem to be very healthy. They're investing. There are lots of job openings. And GDP is still at a level today and expected for the rest of the calendar year where we'd like to operate. So we haven't seen a lot of change other than the weather disruption, which was certainly real.
Gary Bisbee: Thank you. And then just one last one, the amount of SG&A leverage if we back out the one-time payment a year ago, still positive but narrowed relative to the last few quarters. I would guess that the revenue impact this quarter had -- was part of the reason. But is there anything from your perspective changing in the ability to deliver operating leverage in the near-term or was that anything else to explain that? Thank you.
Mike Hansen : Yes, the weather that we’ve talked about, the revenue challenge that we’ve talked about probably took 20 basis points of additional leverage in SG&A. So we probably would have been 30 basis points better than last year in total. No, there are ups and downs we are self-insured we get some things that are -- that go up and down. We invest for example in our First Aid and Safety business where we've been growing so nicely. But there's nothing that I would look at as a challenge as we move forward to continue to see that number tweak down.
Gary Bisbee: Great, thanks a lot.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Justin Hauke with R.W. Baird. 
Justin Hauke : Yes, great. Thanks guys. Two questions here, I guess one, I think the positive that we can take away from this is the margins were pretty good considering the revenue shortfall. And, you called out some of the factors that are still out there the inflationary costs and whatnot. But I guess I was curious on the labor costs specifically, if you could just comment on maybe where that's trending were net pricing is trending? How those have changed from maybe three or six months ago?
Mike Hansen : Yes, labor pressures, I would say, are about the same as we've seen in the first two quarters of this fiscal year. I wouldn't call it any worse. But they still remain. And as we've talked about in the past, we work diligently to deal with those. First of all, we want to retain our partners. And so, we do as much as we can to keep our partners engaged and satisfied in terms of working with us. We want to pay them the right wages for sure so that we can, again help keep them engaged. And that's -- partner retention, which remains high for us is such an important part of managing our labor. But in addition to that, we look for opportunities for process improvement, we look for automation and other types of efficiencies and we've been doing a pretty good job of that so far, not to mention the fact that the synergies that we're getting off of the G&K integration certainly help and are timely. But they remain. And our goal is to continue to perform well despite them. As it relates to the pricing environment, we haven't seen a lot of change from quarter-to-quarter in that environment either. And I don't look for that to change a whole lot as we move forward, at least in the next quarter or so.
Justin Hauke : Okay, great. Second one here, just maybe more numerical, but the G&K integration expense was pretty light and your guidance to $0.09 looks like it's probably going to stay fairly light in the fourth quarter as well from the -- I think you were saying $18 million to $22 million was the total for the year. So is it because you're just ahead of schedule, and there's not more expense or those moving into 2020? Or just how should we think about the level of integration expense that remains?
Paul Adler: Yes, Justin. I mentioned earlier about the integration activities, and it's largely rerouting and then our supply chain is still hard at work. Realizing synergies as well. But, rerouting does not really drive significant costs. The purpose of the rerouting is to get those routes more dense that lowers energy costs provides us with more time to spend with the customers. So, it's a smallest bucket of the synergies. And the fact is that the larger expenses related to the integration came when the plant closings occurred, closing the plants, decommissioning them, severing and we just don't have any of that left. So we would expect another maybe $2 million to $3 million of integration expenses in the fourth quarter. So we'll probably end the year at about $16 million in total. And then looking ahead to fiscal 2020, it's going to be very small, very nominal amount of integration expenses. But again, we're not finished with the integration activities. We're still rerouting. A lot of challenges out there for our operations, but it just doesn't drive the significant expenses that the other activities did.
Mike Hansen : And just to be clear, there are still expenses and inefficiencies for example duplicate routing, training overtime and attempts. But the expenses Paul talking about are those that are identifiable that can be really called out into that integration line. The heavy lifting in the route optimization remains and the inefficiencies and the costs associated with it also remain, they're just really hard to call out. So for example, when we're training SSRs to -- on new routes, we've got a little bit of duplicate labor going on when we're training and pulling them out of their off of their routes. There's a little bit of inefficiency in duplicate labor. When we've got overtime, it's hard to tell how much of that is the day-to-day and how much of that is the true integration work. So there are expenses and inefficiencies that remain. They're just much harder to call out specifically.
Justin Hauke : That makes sense. That's helpful. Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Dan Dolev with Nomura Securities International.
Dan Dolev: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Appreciate it. So sorry to harp on this, but if I think about the organic growth even ex. the impact of weather, et cetera, the 6.8 it's about a 20 basis points acceleration. And if I look back your comp was getting about 80 basis points easier if I'm not wrong. Is there anything to read into that and what is driving that as far as I remember back in like 2017 you put out like 8% comp quarters like what are the odds of us getting back to those rates and what's driving the meter acceleration ex. weather? Thanks.
Mike Hansen : Yes, the -- I mean, Dan, the 8% that you're referring to they were strong and they were without any G&K in them that was prior to G&K becoming inorganic. And so we're -- we -- I had a question from Andrew a little bit ago about how much is the legacy G&K business growing and while it's very, very difficult to tell, it's also pretty clear that that they are not growing quite at the legacy Cintas levels yet. We certainly believe that they can get there over time, but that doesn't happen overnight. As we look to the fourth quarter, the range of revenue that we've given is a 6% to 7%. We think it's a very, very healthy range. And at the midpoint there's some acceleration there. And so we're very, very pleased with the progress that we've made. We got a little bit of a hiccup with the weather and the holiday challenges, customer closure challenges, but gosh, we're right where we wanted to be.
Dan Dolev : Got it. And just 6% to 7% overall not just uniformly, right?
Mike Hansen : 6% to 7% overall, yes. 
Dan Dolev : Got it. And then my second question is -- sorry.
Mike Hansen : Go ahead.
Dan Dolev : No, I was going to ask about the synergies in the quarter and like if you can give us I think last time you had $25 million.
Paul Adler: Yes, Dan, the synergies and we began the fiscal year and we said got it to $90 million to $95 million in total for the year. And we're on track to achieving that, we'll actually probably wind up a bit above the top end of that range. And then next fiscal year, think about incremental synergies of maybe $30 million to $35 million. So, the bottom line is that we continue to track very nicely what we committed to in the beginning, which was the $130 million to $140 million of synergies within those four years.
Dan Dolev : Perfect. Good stuff, thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from George Tong with Goldman Sachs.
George Tong: Hi, thanks, good afternoon. You’ve previously indicated that ancillary products such as First Aid and Fire Safety have less than 20% penetration among Uniform Rental customers, can you help frame where that number can go as cross selling increases not only at G&K, but also the broader Cintas customer base?
Mike Hansen : Yes, we haven't really talked about that a lot publicly and the reason is it's -- that's a difficult thing to specifically target, we certainly think about that in the different verticals. And some verticals are better than others for that penetration. But George, we're not really ready to give goals and targets. I would say this, the standalone businesses are still growing very, very nicely. And we think there's a lot of runway in just simply growing each business on their own. But there's no question there's more penetration opportunity available, but I'm really hesitant to put that -- put us in a box and say there's a goal there just yet.
George Tong: Got it. And then drilling down into the SAP implementation, can you give us an update on how many branches have undergone the conversion and when you would expect to start seeing margin benefits?
Paul Adler: George, we are about 57% now through the conversion, and that's about 202 operations that are now on SAP. If you remember, like this time last quarter, we were at 48% converted. So, a lot of good activity obviously in this past quarter. As far as the margin benefits, we haven't quantified any of the benefits, we've talked about and given examples in terms of the power of the system, and what it can do for our route people with a satellite based type of handheld device, the efficiencies that that brings, opportunities in our stock rooms with managing inventory and sharing it and having visibility. But then also a lot of benefits in terms of opportunities to cross sell and look into the system of First Aid and Safety to better understand national accounts and just a lot of opportunities around big data and being able to do profitability analysis and price reviews and all that type of stuff.  So we will have more commentary on that as we continue to get through the rollout, but a lot of those benefits for the system, especially as they relate to the top line and some profitability improvements. You need the entire network to be in and we're just over half of the way. So nothing that we can quantify for you at this point in time in terms of the benefits.
George Tong: Got it, thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Hamzah Mazari with Macquarie Capital.
Mario Cortellacci : Hey guys, this is actually Mario Cortellacci filling in for Hamzah. Could you give us any color on your net add stops during the quarter. And actually just curious how relevant that metric is to-date compared to it was -- compared to history because the portfolio has changed with the time. So once you see if that's actually relevant anymore.
Paul Adler: Yeah, the add stops metric, is a real -- we consider it a very old legacy Uniform Rental type of metric that, we use decades ago when we were predominantly providing uniforms and entrance mats, it might be meaningful still to some of our comp competitors. But it's not as meaningful to us because we have such a huge breadth of products and services that we have more to offer to customers than just uniforms and mats.  And we are not also dependent upon the customer base, just adding jobs and going along with GDP and kind of being propelled or held back by employment you look back at our results and we have grown consistently in multiples of excess of GDP and jobs. So the add stops metric, which is more about kind of same store sales, how is that particular customer growing? Are they adding or subtracting? It's not as meaningful to us. We're trying to drive the growth through penetration and through attacking new verticals like scrub rental with new products and services.  So long winded answer to say, it's not meaningful to us, there wasn't anything significant to note in add stops. I would say that, to Mike's point earlier, we rely on penetration of our existing customers. And it was clear in looking at our operational data, that the weather and the holidays did impact that our ability to penetrate and then that's part of that 60 basis points headwind that we had this quarter.
Mario Cortellacci : Got it. And just one more, I'll turn it over. I guess just given the portfolio changes, since the last major slowdown. Could just give us a sense of how Cintas might perform in a decelerating macro environment? I'm sure a piece of your business could be a little considered late cycle, I assume that First Aid would be a little more resilient. And I just didn't know I guess obviously a piece of the business is still levered to the employment cycle. But I guess what would that look like if there was slowdown?
Mike Hansen : Mario, I typically answer those questions by -- with starting out with it depends on how deep and how broad that next slowdown would be. We have a very diverse customer base. We've got customers of all types in all types of verticals, customers of all sizes. And so we've got a very diverse customer base, and that helps us when things like a few years ago, the oil and gas customers really were suffering with low oil prices helped us a few years ago when there were some measurements of an industrial recession. And we still grew through those kind of things. But it really depends on how deep and how broad. If we can hit our revenue guidance, and our EPS guidance, it will be 48 out of the last 50 years, where we have grown sales and grown profits. And that would be growing through six out of the last seven recessions. So how do we stand in the next one, depends on how deep and how broad. We have done some things since the great recession that we think are beneficial to our performance through the next slow down and that would be a broader product line, so that we have more things to offer to our prospects and our existing customers. We have a sales team that is a little bit more sophisticated than it was prior to the great recession where we specifically attack specific certain verticals. And we sell to existing customers a little bit more proactively. So we look to drive more revenue that way. And we have probably even more diverse customers today than we had prior to the last recession where we’ve really targeted things like health care and education, which are a little bit more recession resistant. So we've made some changes since the great recession. But we've also performed very well over the course of the last 50 years in all kinds of economic cycles. But I would always go back to dependent on how deep and how broad.
Mario Cortellacci : Got it, thank you so much.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer.
Scott Schneeberger: Thanks. Good evening, guys. You just gave synergy guidance for next year as well on an earlier question. I found it interesting because it sounds like you're trending really well on the 90 to 95. So, the inferences you're at the high end of that. And then the incremental guide 30 to 35 the high end of that gets you to the 130 the low end of the total. So, just kind of curious, is there might you finish a year earlier than originally anticipated? Or might be there -- might there be incremental upside that we see in this? And, if so, where the areas sourcing, routing, you touched on a little bit books, where the areas that maybe you're progressing ahead of that are worth addressing at this juncture? Thanks.
Mike Hansen : Yes, great question. Scott. I would say this, we have some sourcing synergies that we are still working on. And as we've talked about, they come a little longer because we had to burn through G&K inventory. And then we have to source from either our new supply chains or put the volume, the greater volume into our existing supply chains. We have to then get the inventory to our locations and put it in service where it becomes -- where it begins to amortize. And so there will be synergies in our fiscal 2021 that still are from that global supply chain effort. And it's hard to pull those forward. So getting back to your question, I think there may be a little bit of upside, and I think that upside, you may have heard me say a few times in the past, I think the biggest bucket for the upside is that sourcing and supply chain. Where we kind of built that opportunity off of the G&K inventory and supply chain. And the opportunity -- the upside opportunity might be does that impact the Cintas sourcing and supply chain. In other words, does the combined volume then help even the Cintas pricing to drive lower as well. I'm not ready to give any kind of numbers, but I think that's where the opportunity lies. And as you suggested, we expect to be at the low end of that range next fiscal year and driving towards the high end and possibly through the high end in fiscal 2021.
Scott Schneeberger: Great, thanks. It’s good progress. More a housekeeping question for my follow up, tax rate has been jumping around and just for our benefit in modeling fiscal 2020, how would you think about it for the annual and quarterly as we model out ahead, just some rules of thumb because I think without a little guidance that could be all over the place?
Mike Hansen : Yes, you're right about that, Scott. I think with the with the change in the stock compensation a few years ago, this tax rate has really been bouncing around because we don't -- we can't control the exercises of options and we can't control the stock price. We talked a little bit about a 24.5% in the fourth quarter. So that is our expectation there. And as we look to finish this year, if we do that 24.5% in the fourth quarter, that would put us at a 20.6% for the full fiscal 2019 year. That's lower than we would expect our typical run rate to be. With our stock performance, we had a tremendous amount of exercises this year. And it's hard to say that those are going to repeat next year. So I would expect that our tax rate would be right in the range of 22% next year, with a fairly low tax rate in the first quarter because we generally get more stock comp benefits followed by a higher rate in Qs two through four. And I would suggest maybe using fiscal 2019's quarterly rates that we've talked about as maybe a bit of a guide to ratably get you there. But I would say for the full year, I think a 22% type of a number would be right, where I would say that's currently our expectation. So obviously then that if we are at a 22% next year and a 20.6% this year, that puts a little bit of pressure on us with that increase.
Scott Schneeberger: Great, thanks. I appreciate that incremental color. Good job, guys.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Tim Mulrooney with William Blair.
Tim Mulrooney: Yes, good afternoon, guys. Pretty much hit on everything. But maybe I'll talk -- ask about the balance sheet, a 2 times leverage it seems like a good point to check in on your capital allocation priorities. How should we think about capital deployment after CapEx between the dividend, share repurchase and M&A?
Mike Hansen : Yes, so our cash flow remains healthy. In fact it was very good in the third quarter and we expect it to continue to perform well into the future. That creates opportunities obviously. We want to continue to invest in the business, we will do that by growing the business via things like adding routes, adding sales people and doing advertising and R&D. Those things will run through the P&L just like they have, but those are very, very important pieces for us. Our CapEx, I would expect to continue kind of in that 4% to 4.5%. And that's very important to us. We want to make sure we are creating the capacity for growth. Those are our two highest priorities. Aside from that, we certainly love the tuck-in acquisitions, and we will continue to look for opportunities there as best we can in our Rental, First Aid and Fire businesses. We will also look at there are larger opportunities, particularly in our existing businesses, we would love to take a look at those. So we'll be as aggressive as we can be on looking for great value out of small and larger types of acquisitions, particularly within our businesses. That's going to leave us though with some cash. And so, we certainly love to increase the dividend we've done so every year since 1983. I would expect that the Board will continue to look very strongly at that, and then there may be buy backup opportunity. And as we've shown so far this fiscal year, where we've acquired almost $550 million through our first three quarters. We like that program, we like the momentum of the business. And I would expect that we'll continue to look at that opportunistically. In addition to all of that, our EBITDA continues to grow and we like that 2 times leverage neighborhood. We are there right now and our expectation is we’ll continue to be in that range.
Tim Mulrooney: Okay, Thanks, Mike. Thank you for the thoughtful answer. Just on the M&A front, are there still areas in the U.S. where you feel there may be more room to grow through M&A in your Rental business? And also what's your position with respect to expanding internationally? Thanks for your time.
Mike Hansen : Sure, from a U.S. perspective, it's more about the opportunities and it is the geography. We are in almost all geographies in U.S. and Canada, but there are still 600 or so independent operators out there. And so the opportunity really is more about the location of those independent operators and having a dialogue with them and understanding if we can team up and create long-term value together. So we will, will continue to look for those opportunities, no matter the geography in the U.S. and Canada. From an international perspective, I would say this, we love the U.S. and Canadian opportunities. We think there are a lot there, we will continue to invest heavily in those businesses. I think there may be a time in our future where we get in into other international geographies. It's not our highest priority. But I think that's something that we’ll keep our eyes on. I would say that in our business, startups are pretty difficult. And so it would likely be through some sort of M&A, but it would have to be with the right partner, in the right geography, and one in which we felt like we could operate successfully.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Seth Weber with RBC Capital Markets.
Seth Weber : Hey, guys, good afternoon, and thanks for keeping the call going here. Most of the questions have been asked and answered, but maybe just going back to the CapEx commentary for a second. I think, earlier this year, you had brought the CapEx number down a little bit because you had sort of message that you're able to extract some of the -- some benefits from the G&K business.  So how should we be thinking about CapEx going forward? Is it brick and mortar? Are you -- do you feel like you need more capacity here? Or is there anything that you could point to that you'll be spending money on specifically? Thank you.
Mike Hansen : Well, we -- you're absolutely right, Seth, we did get some benefit from the G&K acquisition in terms of capacity, and it allowed us to delay certainly some CapEx related to new capacity both in plants and in our routes. But we're continuing to grow and we're continuing to grow well. And capacity is really a local thing. And so there are certainly still geographies where there may not have been a G&K presence, where we're growing well, where we need capacity. And so we'll continue to look for or we will have a CapEx related to laundry capacity and routing capacity. I would say from a growth perspective most of our CapEx growth will be in that form, laundry facility capacity and routes and i.e. trucks. Same goes for our First Aid and Fire businesses as well. We are growing very, very nicely. And the growth will come primarily in the way of additional trucks. We’ll certainly have some maintenance CapEx too, but from a growth perspective, yes, certainly bricks and mortar and trust.
Seth Weber : Super, that's all I had guys. Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. And we have another other questions at this time. I would now like to turn the conference back to Mr. Mike Hansen for any closing remarks.
Mike Hansen: Well, thank you again for joining us tonight. We will issue our fourth quarter financial results in July, and we look forward to speaking with you again at that time. Thank you.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good day, everyone and welcome to the Cintas Quarterly Earnings Results Conference Call. Today’s call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Mike Hansen, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead, sir.
Mike Hansen: Thank you and good evening. With me is Paul Adler, Cintas’ Vice President and Treasurer. We will discuss our second quarter results for fiscal 2019. After our commentary, we will be happy to answer any questions. The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a Safe Harbor from civil litigation for forward-looking statements. This conference call contains forward-looking statements that reflect the company’s current views as to future events and financial performance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those we may discuss. I refer you to the discussion on these points contained in our most recent filings with the SEC. Our revenue for the second quarter, which ended November 30, was $1.718 billion, an increase of 7% over last year’s second quarter. The organic revenue growth rate which adjusts for the impacts of acquisitions and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations was also 7%. The organic revenue growth rate for the Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment was 6.6%, and the organic growth rate of the First Aid and Safety Services segment was 10.2%. Since the announcement of the G&K Services acquisition nearly 2 years ago, we communicated our expected trajectory of the acquired revenue and its impact on Uniform Rental and Facility Services growth rates. We have discussed that the organic revenue growth rate would reach bottom in the first quarter of this fiscal year, due to the lapping of the G&K acquisition, and we expect the organic growth rate to accelerate during the remainder of fiscal ‘19. Our second quarter rental organic growth rate of 6.6% rebounded as expected from the first quarter’s rate of 4.9%. In fact, this organic growth rate of 6.6% exceeded our internal expectations. We have seen our sales rep productivity reach pre-acquisition levels, and we have seen good performance in penetrating legacy G&K customers, particularly in the hygiene space. Gross margin for the second quarter of fiscal ‘19 of $775 million increased 8.2% from last year’s second quarter. Gross margin as a percentage of revenue was 45.1% for the second quarter of fiscal ‘19 compared to 44.6% in the second quarter of last fiscal year. Uniform rental and facility services gross margin as a percentage of revenue improved to 45.3% from 44.7% in the second quarter of last fiscal year. Gross margin improved in the quarter and year-to-date despite some cost headwinds we cited on last quarter’s earnings call, including wage inflation and higher costs for certain commodities. Reported operating income for the second quarter was $275 million compared to $235 million in last year’s second quarter. Operating income was negatively impacted by integration expenses related to the G&K acquisition by $7.8 million in the second quarter of fiscal ‘19 and $13.1 million in the second quarter of fiscal ‘18. Excluding integration expenses, our second quarter operating income grew 14.2%, resulting in an operating margin of 16.5% compared to 15.5% last year. Net interest expense was $4 million lower in the second quarter of fiscal ‘19 compared to last year due to debt reduction. Net income from continuing operations for the second quarter of fiscal ‘19 of $243 million increased to 76% from last year’s second quarter net income from continuing operations of $138 million. Diluted EPS from continuing operations for the second quarter of fiscal ‘19 were $2.18, an increase of about 76% from the EPS from continuing operations for the second quarter of fiscal ‘18 of $1.24. Net income and EPS from continuing operations were positively impacted by a lower effective tax rate in this fiscal year second quarter compared to last year’s second quarter, primarily from the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Net income and EPS from continuing operations for the second quarter of fiscal ‘19 benefited $0.47 from a gain on the sale of a cost method investment. Also net income and EPS from continuing operations were negatively impacted in the second quarter of fiscal ‘19 and ‘18 by $0.05 and $0.07 respectively from integration expenses related to the G&K acquisition. Excluding these special items, our second quarter EPS from continuing operations were $1.76 compared to last year’s EPS from continuing operations of $1.31. We’ve provided these figures in a table in today’s press release. As a result of our second quarter results and forecast for the remainder of the fiscal year, we are increasing our annual guidance. We are raising our revenue guidance from a range of $6.8 billion to $6.855 billion to a range of $6.87 billion to $6.91 billion and EPS from continuing operations from a range of $7.19 to $7.29 to a new range of $7.30 to $7.38. Note the following regarding the EPS guidance. It assumes an additional $2.5 million to $3 million of interest expense from last quarter’s guidance due to having some commercial paper. It still assumes an effective rate of 21.7% for the year. This is the same rate guidance as last quarter. It assumes a total diluted share count for computing EPS of 112 million shares. It does not assume any additional G&K integration expenses. However, we do expect to incur these in the range of $18 million to $22 million for the full fiscal year. As our Chairman of the Board and CEO, Scott Farmer was quoted in today’s press release, we are pleased with our progress on the integration of the G&K acquisition and the implementation of our enterprise resource planning system. We are on track to achieve another year of solid revenue and earnings growth. And additionally, we continue to generate strong cash flow and commit to effectively deploying cash to increase shareholder value. As a reminder on December 7, we paid an annual dividend of $2.05 per share, an increase of 26.5% over last year’s annual dividend; and through the end of our second quarter, we purchased $447 million of Cintas stock under our buyback authorizations. I will now turn the call over to Paul.
Paul Adler: Thank you, Mike. Please note that our fiscal second quarter contained the same number of work days as the prior year second quarter. Additionally, there will be no workday differences the remainder of the fiscal year as each quarter of fiscal ‘19 contains the same number of work days as the comparable quarter of fiscal ‘18. We have two reportable operating segments, Uniform Rental and Facility Services and First Aid and Safety Services. The remainder of our business is included in All Other. All Other consists of Fire Protection Services and our Uniform Direct Sale business. First Aid and Safety Services and All Other are combined and presented as Other Services on the income statement.  Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segments includes the rental and servicing of uniforms, mats and towels, and the provision of restroom supplies and other facility products and services. The segment also includes the sale of items from our catalogs to our customers en route. Uniform Rental and Facility Services revenue was $1.390 billion, an increase of 6.3% compared to last year’s second quarter. Excluding the impact of acquisitions and foreign currency exchange rate changes, the organic growth rate was 6.6%. Our Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment gross margin was 45.3% for the second quarter compared to 44.7% in last year’s second quarter, an improvement of 60 basis points. Energy expenses as a percentage of revenue was 2.4% equal to last year’s second quarter. We are pleased with the gross margin expansion this quarter and year-to-date and our ability to overcome wage inflation increased commodity costs such as for hangers which are sourced mostly from China and the inefficiencies that are customary with an acquisition integration and an ERP system implementation. Our First Aid and Safety Services operating segments includes revenue from the sale and servicing of first aid products, safety products and training. This segment’s revenue for the second quarter was $153 million, which was 10.3% higher than last year’s second quarter. On an organic basis, the growth rate for the segment was 10.2%. This segment’s gross margin was 48% in the second quarter compared to 46.9% in last year’s second quarter, an increase of 110 basis points. Organic growth continued to be very strong and was benefited by penetration of existing customers and national account new business, solid revenue growth and expanding gross margins are confirmation of the value that businesses in all sectors of the economy place on outsourcing to Cintas, the management of their first aid, safety and training programs to help keep their employees healthy, safe and productive. Our fire protection services and uniform direct sale businesses are reported in the all other category. Our fire business continues to grow each year at a strong pace. Uniform direct sale business growth rates are generally low single-digits and are subject to volatility such as when we install a multimillion dollar accounts. Uniform direct sale however is a key business for us and its customers are offing significant opportunities to cross-sell and provide products and services from our other business units. All other revenue was $174 million, an increase of 9.3% compared to last year’s second quarter. The organic growth rate was 6.9% and was driven by 14% organic growth in the fire business. All other gross margin was 41.2% for the second quarter of this fiscal year compared to 42.1% for last year’s second quarter. Improvement in the fire business gross margin year-over-year was more than offset by lower gross margins in the uniform direct sale business. Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue were 28.6% in the second quarter compared to 29.1% in last year’s second quarter. In the second quarter of fiscal ‘19, it was a benefit of $6.1 million from lower commission expense resulting from the adoption of the Accounting Standards Update 2014-09 revenue from contracts with customers. We discussed this on our July earnings call when we provided our initial fiscal ‘19 guidance. In addition to this benefit, we are getting good leverage from increased revenue covering fixed costs. Our effective tax rate on continuing operations for the second quarter benefited from the new U.S. tax legislation. Our EPS guidance for fiscal ‘19 assumes an effective tax rate of 21.7%. Note that the effective tax rate will fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter based on tax reserve builds and releases relating to discrete items, including the amount of stock compensation benefits in each period. Our cash and equivalents balance as of November 30 was $88 million. Capital expenditures in the second quarter were $73 million. Our CapEx by operating segment was as follows: $58 million in uniform rental and facility services; $10 million in first aid and safety; and $5 million in all other. We expect fiscal ‘19 CapEx to be in the range of $270 million to $285 million. As of November 30, total debt was $2.710 billion, $2.536 billion is fixed interest rate debt and $173 million is variable rate commercial paper. And November 30, our leverage was 2.1x debt to EBITDA. That concludes our prepared remarks. We are happy to answer your questions.
Operator: Well, thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Manav Patnaik with Barclays.
Manav Patnaik: Thank you. Good evening gentlemen. First broader question obviously is, -- just curious obviously you have seen the market reacting in a fearful manner. Just curious from what you are hearing from your customers, any signs of things slowing down or any signs of worry based on what you are hearing and seeing there?
Mike Hansen: No, Manav. I think from based on our results, which we believe are pretty good, we have seen a pretty good economic environment for the last quarter, and we are not hearing signs of slowdown right now. And I would suggest that our guidance is pretty strong as well and reflects confidence that we are going to finish the year pretty strong, so no.
Manav Patnaik: Okay. And then on the G&K side, you talked about making some progress, I guess on the revenue synergy side, especially in the hygiene area. I was just hoping you could help maybe quantify or give some color there and how we should think about what the future opportunities there are?
Mike Hansen: Well, we haven’t quantified that specifically other than to say certainly that Cintas percentage of hygiene revenue is greater than G&K’s was prior to us acquiring them. We are making some nice progress on that. I don’t have a specific number to share with you, because many of the accounts are kind of blended in, but we certainly know that we are getting some traction there, and we like that restroom product opportunity. We like this substituting our entrance mats for theirs. We think there is still an opportunity in the future for Carhartt garments and other things, but making some progress so far and we like what we have seen.
Manav Patnaik: Alright, got it. And then just last question, just moving pieces on the energy side with obviously the oil prices down, any color on how we should think of that or if you’ve factored that -- some of that in your increased guidance today?
Paul Adler: We have assumed that we may still have just a slight touch of pressure for the rest of the year, even though we didn’t have any in the second quarter. It’s hard to predict what that’s going to look like for the second half, but right now we haven’t really changed our outlook and that was to be up slightly in the second half of the year.
Manav Patnaik: Alright. Thanks, guys.
Operator: And next will be Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley.
Toni Kaplan: Hi, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions. Just looking at the guidance, this quarter you bought back just under $370 million of stock and in the back half of the year that should be a pretty nice help to you just given the lower share count from that. I am calculating somewhere around, call it $0.08. You beat consensus this quarter, I know that’s not necessarily your internal target, but let’s just say you beat by at least a couple of cents there, and then obviously you mentioned the higher interest, so maybe $0.02 from that as an offset, but basically a $0.10 guidance raise sort of implies to me that either maybe there is some conservatism there or just trying to get a sense of -- I know you just mentioned that you are expecting a good back half of the year, but like basically, why not raise by more? Sorry for the longwinded question.
Paul Adler: No problem. Toni, the low end of our guidance now is higher than the high end of our guidance last quarter. You are right on it in terms of the second half of the year buyback impact. But Toni, the second half of the year, last year we did operating margins of 16.3%. The guidance that we have provided would suggest the high – mid-to-high 16%, so there is still going to be some nice margin improvement in the second half of the year. The revenue is looking very good. That was a pretty good increase as well, where the low end of the range is higher than our previous – I am sorry the low end of the range is higher than our previous high end of the range. We think it’s a pretty nice second half of the year. And if we can achieve that guidance, that’s a pretty darn good year with margin expansion, continued G&K integration, SAP integration, and increasing organic growth.
Toni Kaplan: Okay, great. And then just one more on buybacks, just given you have 744 authorization remaining in your program, just given where the stock has been trading recently and you just did a lot of buybacks in this past quarter like how should we be thinking about sort of your views on timing of repurchases or your – going forward? Thank you.
Mike Hansen: Well, our remaining authorization is a little bit over $800 million, it’s about $860 million. We did run out a previous authorization during the quarter. We expect it to continue to have pretty good cash flow. We obviously think that the stock price today is an opportunity, but we also like our leverage level, we’re at 2.1 times, that’s right at our target. And I would suggest that we’re going to continue to be right around that level unless we see something different change, something new come about. We certainly have seen it to be a buying opportunity though, and I think that there’s been certainly an overreaction to our stock in the last 90 days.
Toni Kaplan: Thanks. Happy holidays.
Mike Hansen: Thank you. You too.
Operator: And our next question will come from Gary Bisbee with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Gary Bisbee: Hey guys, good afternoon. I guess the first question, just last quarter you talked about the second half of the year getting back to 5.5% to 6% organic revenue in rentals, obviously you blew right through that, and you’ve taking the guidance up. But as we look at it, it appears like the comps get easier on a year-over-year basis. Is there anything that would lead to any deceleration from that or was there anything that was a benefit this quarter? Just trying to think if this is a good run rate in the near term?
Mike Hansen: Well, when we think about this quarter, we think about the impact of better sales rep productivity than we initially expected, so I don’t see that changing much. We also talked about the penetration opportunities with all of our customers remains pretty strong. So that guidance range that we gave is something in the way of 6% to the low 7%, and we think that’s a pretty good range for us to be in. That’s right in our sweet spot.
Gary Bisbee: You – on the last couple of calls, you’ve mentioned the national accounts opportunity of First Aid and Safety. Is that – I don’t remember hearing you mention that a lot over the last few years. Is that a newer opportunity or just something that you’re calling out now and I guess, I’ve always thought as much – mostly a local business, what are you doing on the national account front?
Mike Hansen: It’s not necessarily a new opportunity. It is one that we have started to talk about and we love the opportunity and it is the same as you might think in rental, where we have – we have the ability to provide large multi-location customers with a consistent Safety – First Aid and Safety Program and that’s important to these large customers. It allows them to track their locations a little bit better, to understand their compliance on a more consistent basis. And so we’ve got an offering that not many others can provide and that has become a real nice growth opportunity for us in the business, and one that we started to call out a little bit more.
Gary Bisbee: Great. And then just on the tax rate, can you help us flush out what sort of the statutory rate or the normalized rate post-tax reform now that we’re almost a year into that? And how much is the tax rate benefiting from that equity comp accounting change of year and a half ago or so? And I guess, I’m just trying to think over the next few years, what could the tax rate go up to if that accounting change benefit around the equity comp were to flatten out?
Mike Hansen: Yes. It’s a real good question, Gary. We certainly with the new accounting guidance, we’re going to see a little bit more fluctuation in our tax rate. I – we expect it to be in a 24-ish type of a percent range. And again that can move now, not all of that difference from 24% to 21.7% is the equity comp, but it certainly is a good chunk of that. If that turns around, we could see it get closer to 24% and in some cases may even get higher than 24%, but that’s kind of where we see a steady range. And what you saw in the second quarter of 24.2% roughly is a quarter without a big stock compensation benefit like you saw in the first quarter.
Gary Bisbee: Great. And then if I could just sneak one other. Is there any update on that accounting change benefit for this year, I think you said 16 to 19, the higher end of 16 to 19, is that still a good run rate? Thank you very much.
Mike Hansen: The benefit I think Paul called that out, it was $6.1 million in the quarter.
Gary Bisbee: For the year [Multiple Speakers] ‘18 [ph] still – 
Paul Adler: Yes, in that range.
Mike Hansen: I think given that it’s been what 11 in the first half of the year, it’s probably going to be closer to that type of 20 to 22 type of a range.
Gary Bisbee: Thank you very much. Happy holidays.
Mike Hansen: Thanks. You too.
Operator: And moving on, our next question comes from Hamzah Mazari with Macquarie.
Hamzah Mazari: Good evening. Thank you. My first question is just on cross-selling as well. Maybe if you could just frame for us how many customers are buying multiple services from you today versus sort of historically, and where does that number go through, or what can it go to, any thoughts on penetration there?
Mike Hansen: Yes, we don’t have those numbers to share with you, Hamzah. But we think there’s certainly is a big opportunity there. As we’ve talked in the past, the biggest penetration is with our uniform rental and entrance mat products. But all of our other products would then be under 20% penetrated, and we certainly think that we can get above 20% with many of those. So we still have a lot of run rate. And we – that certainly has been beneficial to the growth over the last few years.
Hamzah Mazari: Yes. Got it. And then just on First Aid, one of your competitors said recently that they are going to get into that market. Just maybe frame for us, how sustainable is that 10% organic growth number and sort of the competitive dynamic you see in First Aid today just sort of update us there?
Mike Hansen: Sure. We – when we think about that business, we like the high singles and low doubles digits in terms of organic growth run rate and do we think it’s sustainable, we do, certainly in the next – for the next several years, absent a big change in the macro environment. You know in this business the biggest competition is what we might call in the rental business the no programmer or the customer that’s doing it themselves, there are still many of them out there and we believe we’ve got a great value to provide to them. So we do think there are many opportunities out there for our service and we think there’s a great value in our ability to deliver that compared to the do-it-yourself [sic] and the catalog purchasers and that kind of thing. So we like the – we love the business. We like the organic growth rate. We think that can continue.
Hamzah Mazari: Great. And then just last question, you talked about buybacks, your debt is pretty low on leverage sort of 2.1. How are you guys thinking about M&A? Do you have too much on your plate with the synergies and ERP or are you sort of ready to look at M&A maybe in a different vertical? Any thoughts on M&A? Thank you very much.
Mike Hansen: We are looking at M&A, we are ready, and if – the thing about M&A is, we can’t always predict when those opportunities come along, and so we want to make sure that we are ready and we’re looking at – we’re looking in our – certainly in our rental business, in our First Aid and Safety business and our Fire business, if we can find tuck-ins or even larger than tuck-in opportunities, we will certainly take a look at them. We think there is a lot of long-term value in that kind of investment.
Hamzah Mazari: Great. Have a very good New Year. Thank you.
Mike Hansen: Thanks. You too.
Operator: And our next question comes from Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan.
Andrew Steinerman: Hi. When you mentioned what was driving the strength in rental organic revenue growth, you mentioned penetration of existing accounts and some national account wins. I was wondering if you just give us directionally the other typical drivers of revenue growth, how was retention year-over-year, is net realized pricing accelerating at all, and, of course, just a quick comment on add-stops?
Mike Hansen: That was led by our new business as it usually is, but we’ve seen some real nice productivity out of our sales team. That sales team also as we’ve talked about over the last several years, that sales team also sells into existing customers and that’s been going very well also. And so that has helped to the historical net add-stop metric that we talk about in our industry. It certainly has been positive from the standpoint of getting some benefit from our sales team. Retention is right where we want it to be and it’s as good as it’s been. It’s in the mid 90% range and has not changed a bunch over the last couple of quarters. And pricing remains favorable pricing environment. I wouldn’t say it’s changed much in the last several quarters, but still a pretty good environment nonetheless.
Andrew Steinerman: Okay. And just as a quick follow-up, just clarify what you meant before when sales productivity is back to pre-merger levels. Did you mean that both the Cintas legacy sales force and now you inherited G&K sales force were back to Cintas levels of sales productivity, I didn’t quite understand if you meant both?
Mike Hansen: Well, let’s be clear, it’s one sales team now.
Andrew Steinerman: It is.
Mike Hansen: And so we measure it altogether and it is higher combined than it was pre-acquisition. So in other words, our new partners and our recently hired partners from that deal, they have made some real nice progress and are certainly being productive in a way that we want them to be productive.
Andrew Steinerman: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: And the next question will come from George Tong with Goldman Sachs.
George Tong: Hi. Thanks. Good afternoon. You’ve indicated that you’re assuming a touch of pressure for the rest of the year from energy. Can you elaborate on whether you’re internally planning for oil prices to stay at current levels as you think about the demand impact and how you expect gross margins to be impacted by energy?
Paul Adler: Well let’s talk about the pressures, the cost pressures that we’ve cited. From an energy perspective, it was flat in the quarter year-over-year and we’re expecting it to be just up slightly. We don’t get specific enough to provide you an oil price, but we think it will be up slightly for the back half of the year. We have talked a little bit about the labor. We’re seeing that in pockets as we’ve said over the last several quarters, and that’s certainly is within our numbers for the first half of the year and it is contemplated in our guidance for the second half of the year. So the great news is, we’ve been able to increase gross margins in this quarter and for the year and expect that to continue despite some pressure from labor. We also talk a little bit about some commodities that you can kind of think of this as the trade impact, right, and last, if you think about China for example, we’ve seen a bucket announced in July of tariff increases on a certain set of products and services, we were not impacted by that. The second bucket came in September. We were slightly impacted by that and we touched on that last quarter. And again, it’s a pretty small amount, but that may continue. And certainly, then it’s too early to tell on anything else that may change with China. We also – we didn’t touch on it last time, but certainly NAFTA has been in the news quite a bit. And if we can continue to see the structure to replace NAFTA or continue NAFTA, but if we can see the structure to replace NAFTA in the USMCA, they’re not much of a change there either. So the really good news is, while we do see a little bit of an impact, it hasn’t been significant and it is certainly within our guided numbers. And really while we’re on-trade, if we think about our supply chain, we’ve got a really good global supply chain, and we’ve talked about how we control much of what we purchase and when I say control, we either have owned manufacturing to a lesser extent, but we also control then fabric purchases and the shipment of those fabrics around the world to different sowing suppliers. We have the ability to be flexible with that and as trade – and as trade changes we have the ability to be flexible where many of our competitors do not, they are either tied to their own manufacturing or tied to third-party suppliers, we have the flexibility to be much more flexible than that. And so as we think about all of these different pressures, we like the way we are able to perform, we like the way we’re able to leverage our infrastructure to find efficiencies, and that’s what you’re seeing in this guidance and in our current results, we’re able to increase our gross and operating margins despite some of these pressures. Now that could change if the macro environment or trade significantly changes and we’ll certainly let you know about that. But as we stand today, we like the way we’re able to adapt to some changes in the environment and still improve margins.
George Tong: Got it. That’s very helpful. And as a follow-up, can you talk about what you’re seeing in the manufacturing verticals and in the oil and gas verticals given the recent move in oil prices, if the pipeline looking out over the next several quarters has changed at all, especially when you compare to earlier oil cycles with that have experienced similar levels of decline?
Mike Hansen: Yes, I can’t say that we’ve seen much of a change at this point in time, it may be a little early. But we’ve seen at least our business be pretty healthy in those and many other verticals.
George Tong: Got it. Thank you.
Operator: And next will be Andy Wittmann with Baird.
Andy Wittmann: Great. Thanks. I just thought I would ask and maybe I missed it in the script, but could you talk about the SAP implementation, Mike, can you talk about maybe an update on where you are in terms of the number of locations or maybe the percentage of revenue that is now operating under that system and kind of what your outlook is here on the implementation in terms of timing if the endpoint of that has moved?
Paul Adler: Andy, it’s Paul. We did not comment on SAP in particular in the script, but we are still making nice progress. I think last quarter we mentioned, but I can’t remember the number of locations, but we said that we had implemented about 42% of them and we’re now at about 48%, so just about halfway through. So again like we’ve talked about previously, things are going very well because of the nature of the implementation and how our existing operating new IT system is with a series of new AS400s boxes all over, it takes time to go from one to the other to the other, but everything is going well and we’re still on track to complete the implementation in fiscal ‘20.
Andy Wittmann: Great. Thanks. And maybe just a kind of a similar question given that a lot of this is concurrent. But just on the G&K integration, this was the year with a lot of the re-routing, which is obviously a very tricky thing or can be. Can you talk about where you are on that key thing, process in terms of how much has been re-routed and how that’s going? And then maybe just more broadly on G&K overall, as you get more intertwined here, how are you feeling about that synergy number and what was recognized in the run rate maybe that synergies that you recognized in the quarter in the run rate that you are on today?
Paul Adler: Sure. The route optimization continues, but as we’ve talked about, we remain cautious in doing that because of that, really touches the customers it’s movement of volume, it’s affecting our SSR relationships and so we’re being very cautious I don’t have a percentage or $1 revenue number to share, Andy but, we are continuing to move forward with that and it’s going well and I think the cautious approach is certainly helping us from an overall G&K standpoint as you mentioned, it continues to get more and more intertwined and part of the re-routing and route optimization is even more intertwining so I think, I’ve talked a little bit about this, where if we have multiple locations, legacy Cintas and legacy G&K part of that route optimization, results in volume possibly moving from one plant to another so even a legacy G&K facility today that has participated in route optimization may have some legacy Cintas volume in there so it gets more and more intertwined however, we certainly like the performance that we’ve seen out of the business, out of the integration activities and we still feel very good about the synergy numbers that we’ve put out there we estimate that the current quarter is about $25 million in synergies that continues us very well onto our expectation for this fiscal ‘19 year and we still feel very good about hitting our targets for the overtime for the entire acquisition.
Andy Wittmann: Great, I will leave it there. Have a good evening.
Mike Hansen: Thanks.
Operator: And the next question comes from Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer.
Scott Schneeberger: Thanks. Good evening guys. Actually, three. I want to slip one here in front in Uniform Rental Facility Services, I’m just I’m curious, you may have said it, I might have missed it the fiscal second half organic growth because the 6.6 was last year than you had expected I’m just curious what is the expectation in the second half, are we talking high sixes or better or should be tempered because you said, kind of I just kind of curious if there are any more clarification, if I missed it?
Paul Adler: We don’t give guidance by segment, Scott but, the guidance range that we do have for the total company is about 6 to 7.2, I think and that would certainly suggest that there is room for continued acceleration in that range.
Scott Schneeberger: Right, thanks. Appreciate it. That’s helpful. So, visibility is my question. It’s been asked a lot, obviously you guys and you mentioned some new business wins in the way that maybe trickles into the back half it sounds like you’re very confident for the back half I’m curious if you could talk maybe to some of your end markets, what the visibility would be out, you know, you have to speak to your current business conditions but what visibility is typically can you see out more than six-months and if so how far? Thanks.
Paul Adler: Well, we try to see out as far as we can and that’s we prep from an external point of view, we generally keep our guidance to the current fiscal year internally, we are certainly looking ahead and how we expect to perform in fiscal ‘20 and ‘21 and going forward I would say this, Scott absent a significant change in the macro, we like the way we are performing right now. Our sales force is performing very well, our integration continues and we as we get more and more of that behind us, we can get more and more efficient in the way we operate we like our products and services, we think it’s a broad opportunity, we are not certainly not fully penetrated and so we continue to like the opportunity to sell to existing customers so, we feel like the business is running very well and I don’t see a change in our ability to execute, unless something happens in the macro that throws a wrench in the works but what we are we all here at Cintas look forward to is getting more and more of the integration and the SAP implementation behind us so that we can even become a little bit more efficient in the way we operate.
Scott Schneeberger: Okay, great answer. Thanks. And lastly, the CapEx guidance went down this quarter from last quarter, which went down from the prior quarter not huge, but it’s trickling down I’m just curious, is that maybe SAP related or is it something else, just kind of curious on that development?
Mike Hansen: It’s purely timing, Scott. We are continuing certainly to invest where we need to, some of it is timing from the standpoint of when we may need to bring a new plant online that can move a little bit here and there, depending on the situations in those local markets so, more than anything, it’s just timing.
Scott Schneeberger: Okay. Thanks, guys.
Operator: And the next question comes from Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel.
Shlomo Rosenbaum: Hi, thank you for taking questions. Hi, Paul. Just wanted to ask a little bit on the free cash flow, it’s down first half like 40 million AR. DSO is up 3 days sequentially. Is there a build in anticipation of future sales or something, is there a timing thing or just kind of build up as you’re expecting continued sales execution if you give us some clarity on them?
Paul Adler: Yes, I mean as you can see it’s on working capital and there is really two, I guess two larger categories that are driving it and both are temporary so we don’t think there’s anything structural here and that we’re concerned with one is, accounts receivable I mean, you can certainly see that on the balance sheet and on the cash flow statement and we don’t have concerns about collectability our customers is really need and once what we provide and they do pay, but Mike has talked many times on prior calls about the inefficiencies that exist within the organization when you have two significant projects going on at same time the G&K integration, the SAP implementation, we have a lot of system conversions, customers are impacted, billing changes, invoices look different and because of that disruption it is causing some slowdown in cash coming in a little bit of a build of AR but again, we believe it’s nothing, but temporary and we will collect.
Mike Hansen: And let’s not forget, we’ve got some really nice growth and that’s certainly increases the AR and there was about close to a $20 million impact from the rev rec adoption.
Paul Adler: Yes. And to build on Mike’s comment about the growth the other bucket is inventory and we talked last quarter about the fact that to support our growth we have a new distribution center facility services distribution center that came online, we’re building inventory to ramp that up and get ready to put that operation in place so we’re still burning off that inventory it’s a little bit elevated at this point in time and then finally Shlomo we have a little bit of inventory build, because what we’re finding is we’ve had skews historically with just Cintas stand-alone that were not sufficient enough in the demand for us to inventory them in stock of them in our distribution centers so what would happen is our operations would just order these items from various vendors directly and they would ship back to those operations, but now with the increased volume from G&K, it does make sense to put more skewed in the distribution manage it centrally negotiate better cost by doing that, and so that is a little bit of an inventory build, but ultimately again that’s a timing thing and that’s a measure we’re putting in place because we believe that will help us manage cost and lower them enough.
Shlomo Rosenbaum: Okay, great. Thanks for the color. And then just, it’s been close to a year since Aramark and AmeriPride, I was just wondering if you are seeing any change in terms of their competitiveness there kind of a year into their integration. It was mentioned that they are planning to get into First Aid and Hygiene. I was just wondering from your guys in the ground, the ones that are actually talking to customers and noticing who else is driving around, are you seeing any changes from them that you’re kind of monitoring?
Mike Hansen: Well, we always like to monitor what our competitors are doing? And that’s not just Aramark and AmeriPride, but all of our competitors I would say nothing significant that we would call out at this point.
Shlomo Rosenbaum: Okay, great. Thank you very much.
Operator: And moving on to John Healy with Northcoast Research.
John Healy: Thank you, Mike. I wanted to ask a question, just trying to look at legacy Cintas customers and what Cintas customers now, but acquired through G&K, if you look at the revenue per staff per the revenue, per where however you kind of maybe boil that metric down what would you say is the difference between the Cintas legacy customer and what you acquired from G&K and if you look out over the next year or two how much of that gap do you think you still has potential to close?
Mike Hansen: Well, we our revenue per stop certainly was greater than G&K was prior to the acquisition, and we think there certainly remains that opportunity we are, I would say we’re closing the gap, but that’s going to be a very it’s a slow trip I guess, and it will take some time and one thing to keep in mind is we’re still adding many new customers every year and those customers, we want to continue, we have the opportunity to continue to penetrate as well so I don’t have a very specific metric that I can share, but certainly our revenue per staff was greater and there still is more opportunity both in our existing our legacy customers and the legacy G&K customers we like that penetration opportunity.
John Healy: Okay, fair enough. And then I wanted to ask what is the movement in oil and doesn’t sound like you guys have seen great change in the business was there much difference between how the U.S. and the Canadian operations performed in the quarter, just kind of curious if you’re seeing much deviation there?
Mike Hansen: No, I mean there’s a lot going on in both countries in terms of implementations and integrations and I would say no, nothing to call out.
John Healy: Okay, great. And then just kind of one big picture question for you, Mike, I feel like every business leaders comments are extremely scrutinized right now in terms of how they feel about the economy and pace of investments and things all along those lines when I hear your call and look at your numbers, there really isn’t much to be negative about I mean quite strong across the board and you guys are buying a ton of stock back beneath the surface though, are you doing anything different versus 3 months ago, than you thought you would be in terms of hiring people? Making any sort of internal investments? Whether it’s in the technology or logistics or operations? I was just curious, from a CFO’s perspective, are you doing anything different versus what you thought maybe 3 months ago?
Mike Hansen: The only thing we are doing is the revenue and the growth has been better than we thought 90 days ago certainly as you can tell from our guidance raise and we continue to invest for the future we like the way that the economy is operating right now it creates and provides a lot of opportunity for our products and services in all of our businesses and we’re continuing to move forward the last thing we want to do is start pulling back on our growth levers, it’s simply to try to predict a change in the economy, we are continuing to invest and grow like we set out to do at the beginning of this fiscal year.
John Healy: Great. Thank you, guys.
Operator: And the next question will come from Tim Mulrooney with William Blair.
Tim Mulrooney: Hi, guys. Thanks for fitting me in at the end here. So, now that you basically got half your branches converted to the new SAP system do you have any early takeaways that you can share with us, with respect to the new system? Have you been positively surprised by anything? Finding new opportunities and how are these branches responding to change management which I know can be difficult, sometimes any extra color here would be great?
Mike Hansen: Yes, I think the further we get into the integration the implementation of SAP, I would say, the easier it gets because we are getting better and better at it we have, as Paul said, we’ve got a lot of locations in a lot of different markets and we learn from everyone and each one becomes a little bit more efficient so it is, certainly is still a big change management project and like I said, we’re learning with each market that converts and that means we are getting ahead of the conversion we do a lot of communication we do a lot of training we do a lot of, not just training in terms of looking at documents and understanding but actually doing and working in the system so we’ve gotten and we believe to be pretty efficient in pretty good at getting our locations prepared having said that certainly is still a disruption and it takes time to get through, it takes time to get our customers used to seeing that different kind of invoice etcetera. so, disruption will continue until we’re finished with it, but we get better and better with each one from a standpoint of what have we seen out of the system we really do like the efficiency that brings to our SSRs our SSRs are our drivers, they have handheld computers, they are much better and much more efficient than they used to be and so we like how those are working our First Aid and Safety business has been on SAP for a few years and we like the knowledge and the information that gets to that business, we’re starting to see a little bit of that in the rental business and as you can tell from the First Aid and Safety business we like how our growth is going there so we, I wouldn’t say that, we have seen a lot of surprises from the standpoint of things that we didn’t expect, but we like what we see.
Tim Mulrooney: That’s great. Thanks for the color. I will leave it there. Happy holidays gentlemen.
Operator: And that does conclude the question-and-answer session. I’ll now turn the conference back over to you for any additional or closing remarks.
Mike Hansen: Well, thank you again for joining us tonight. We will issue our third quarter financial results in the mid to late March and we look forward to speaking with you again at that time and happy holidays to all.
Operator: Well, thank you. That does conclude today’s conference. We do thank you for your participation. Have a wonderful day.

===== 2019 Q1  (2018-09-25 17:00:00) =====
Executives: Michael Hansen - EVP and CFO Paul Adler - VP and Treasurer
Analysts: Toni Kaplan - Morgan Stanley Hamzah Mazari - Macquarie Capital John Healy - Northcoast Research Greg Bardi - Barclays Capital George Tong - Goldman Sachs Andrew Wittmann - R.W. Baird Dan Dolev - Nomura Securities
Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Cintas Quarterly Earnings Results Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Mike Hansen, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead, sir.
Michael Hansen: Good evening. Thank you for joining us. With me is Paul Adler, Cintas Vice President and Treasurer. We will discuss our first quarter results for fiscal 2019. After our commentary, we'll be happy to answer any questions. The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a safe harbor from civil litigation for forward-looking statements. This conference call contains forward-looking statements that reflect the company's current views as to future events and financial performance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those we may discuss. I refer you to the discussion on these points contained in our most recent filings with the SEC. Our revenue for the first quarter, which ended August 31, was $1,697,000,000, an increase of 5.4% over last year's first quarter. The organic revenue growth rate which adjusts for the impacts of acquisitions and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations was 5.2%. The organic revenue growth rate for the Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment was 4.9%, and the organic growth rate of the First Aid and Safety Services segment was 9.0%. Note that the lower organic revenue growth rate for the Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment was expected and as we have previously communicated, was due to the lapping of the G&K Services acquisition. We expect this organic growth rate to increase during the remainder of fiscal 2019.  Reported operating income for the first quarter was $265 million compared to $249 million in last year's first quarter. Operating income for the first quarter of fiscal 2019 was negatively impacted by $19 million in stock-based compensation expense related to a change in the Cintas retirement policy, in which the retirement agent tenure requirements were reduced. Slightly offsetting this was a $5.7 million benefit from lower commission expense, resulting from the adoption of the Accounting Standard Update 2014-09, revenue from contracts with customers. We discussed both items on our July earnings call, when we provided our initial fiscal 2019 guidance.  Lastly, operating income was reduced about $5 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2019, and about $4 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 by integration expenses related to the G&K acquisition. Excluding these items, our first quarter operating income grew 12%, resulting in an operating margin of 16.7% compared to 15.7% last year.  Interest expense was $6 million lower in the first quarter of fiscal 2019, compared to last year due to debt reduction of about $300 million. Net income from continuing operations for the first quarter of fiscal 2019 of $212 million, increased 31.9% from last year’s first quarter net income from continuing operations of $161 million. EPS from continuing operations for the first quarter of fiscal 2019 were $1.89, an increase of about 30% from the EPS from continuing operations for the first quarter of fiscal 2018 of $1.45. Net income and EPS from continuing operations were positively impacted by a lower effective tax rate in this fiscal year’s first quarter, compared to last fiscal year’s first quarter, primarily from the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Net income and EPS from continuing operations were negatively impacted in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 and 2018 by $0.04 and $0.03 respectively from integration expenses related to the G&K acquisition. As a result of our first quarter results and forecast for the remainder of the fiscal year, we are increasing our annual guidance. We are raising our revenue guidance from a range of $6.75 billion to $6.82 billion to a range of $6.8 billion to $6.855 billion. And EPS from continuing operations, from a range of $7 to $7.15 to a range of $7.19 to $7.29.  Note the following regarding EPS guidance; it assumes an effective tax rate for the full fiscal year of 21.7%, which is the same rate we provided in July for our initial fiscal 2019 guidance. Keep in mind that this tax rate can move up or down from quarter-to-quarter, based on discrete events including the amount of stock compensation benefits. The guidance assumes that diluted share count for computing EPS of 113.5 million shares, it does not assume any G&K integration expenses. However we do expect to incur these in the range of $15 million to $20 million for the full fiscal year. As our Chairman of the Board and CEO, Scott Farmer was quoted in our earnings release, we are pleased with the start to the fiscal year. Our employees and we call partners continue to execute at a very high level, while also making significant progress on the integration of the G&K acquisition and the implementation of our enterprise resource planning system. I'll now turn the call over to Paul.
Paul Adler: Thank you, Mike. First, please note that our fiscal first quarter contain the same number of workdays as the prior year first quarter. Additionally, there’ll be no workday differences the remainder of the fiscal year, as each quarter of fiscal 2019 contains the same number of workdays as the comparable quarter of fiscal 2018. We have two reportable operating segments, Uniform Rental and Facility Services, and First Aid and Safety Services. The remainder of our business is included in all Other. All Other consists of Fire Protection Services and our Uniform Direct Sale business. First Aid and Safety Services and All Other are combined and presented as Other Services on the income statement. The Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segment includes the rental and servicing of uniforms, mats and towels and the provision of restroom supplies and other facility products and services. The segment also includes the sale of items from our catalogs to our customers on routes. Uniform Rental and Facility Services revenue was $1.37 billion, an increase of 4.8% compared to last year's first quarter. Excluding the impact of acquisitions and foreign currency exchange rate changes, the organic growth rate was 4.9%. As Mike previously stated, the organic growth rate was negatively impacted by the lapping of the acquired G&K business. However, we believe that the organic growth rate has reached the bottom. We expect the organic growth rate to increase during the remainder of the fiscal 2019. Our Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment gross margin was 45.7% for the first quarter compared to 46.1% in last year's first quarter. We were starting to see cost pressures in a few areas. Energy expense was a headwind of about 20 basis points. We are experiencing wage inflation in certain areas and we’ve seen some cost pressures on our hangers, which largely are sourced from China. Keep in mind, that all of these are considered in our updated guidance. In addition as previously disclosed, we continue to experience the inefficiencies that are customary with an acquisition integration and an ERP system implementation and these activities weigh on margins in the short-term. With all that being said though, we were pleased with the gross margin expansion on a sequential basis of 70 basis points. Our First Aid and Safety Services operating segment includes revenue from the sale and servicing of first aid products, safety products and training. This segment's revenue for the first quarter was $153 million, which was 9.1% higher than last year's first quarter. On an organic basis, the growth rate for the segment was 9.0%, which was a noteworthy accomplishment against the difficult comparison of prior year first quarter organic growth of almost 12%. This segment's gross margin was 47.9% in the first quarter compared to 47.5% in last year's first quarter, an increase of 40 basis points.  Organic growth continue to be very strong and was benefited by penetration of existing customers and national account new business. The combination of the solid revenue growth plus expanding gross margins are confirmation of the value that businesses in all sectors of the economy place on having Cintas manage their first aid, safety and training programs to help keep their employees healthy, safe and productive. Our Fire Protection Services and Uniform Direct Sale businesses are reported in the All Other category. Our Fire business continues to grow each year at a strong pace. The Uniform Direct Sale business growth rate are generally low single-digits and are subject to volatility, such as when we install a multi-million dollar account. Uniform Direct Sale however is a key business for us and its customers are often significant opportunities to cross-sell and provide products and services from our other business units. All Other revenue was $169 million, an increase of 6.6% compared to last year’s first quarter. The organic growth rate was 4.0% and was driven by 8.9% organic growth in the fire business. All Other gross margin was 42.9% for the first quarter of this fiscal year compared to 42.5% for last year's first quarter, an increase of 40 basis points. Both Fire and Uniform Direct Sale realized expansion of gross margins. Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue were 29.7% in the first quarter compared to 30.2% in last year's first quarter. A 110 basis point increase in stock-based compensation expense was more than offset by lower labor, workers compensation, medical and other expenses. We are getting leverage from increased revenue covering fixed costs. Our effective tax rate on continuing operations for the first quarter of 12.0% benefited from the new U.S. tax legislation. In addition, it was positively impacted by stock-based compensation. Our EPS guidance for fiscal 2019 as soon as an effective tax rate of 21.7%. Note that the effective tax rate will fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter based on tax reserve build and releases relating to discrete items, including the amount of stock compensation benefits in each period. Our cash and equivalents balance as of August 31st was $118 million. Cash flow remained strong and we expect fiscal 2019 operating cash flow to exceed fiscal 2018. Capital expenditures in the first quarter were $64 million. Our CapEx by operating segment was as follows: $51 million in Uniform Rental and Facility Services, $9 million in First Aid and Safety and $4 million in All Other. We expect fiscal 2019 CapEx to be in the range of $275 million to $300 million. As of August 31st, total debt was $2,535,000,000 and consist entirely of fixed interest rate debt. At August 31st, our leverage was 2.0 times debt to EBITDA. That concludes our prepared remarks. We are happy to answer your questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley. 
Toni Kaplan: Good morning or good afternoon, I should say.
Paul Adler: Hi, Toni.
Toni Kaplan: Free cash flow was a little bit lighter than what we were expecting driven by working capital. Could you just give us some color on some of the drivers that were impacting working capital this quarter?
Paul Adler : Yes, Toni, this is Paul. I think from a cash flow perspective, we did have some timing issues in this quarter, but as we just mentioned in our prepared remarks and looking at our forecast for the remainder of the year, we believe that our operating cash flow will be strong and even exceed prior year.  So there are some timing things and accounts payable, et cetera. But the one thing to note that I can tell you about from the balance sheet is inventory we’ve had an increase in new goods inventory, we have a new distribution center. It’s a facility services distribution center that we just started up very recently due to the need to support that strong Facility Services growth. And so typical with a start-up of a new distribution center, we’ve had a build of inventory. And once that DC continues to run as expected, it’ll burn that inventory off and that’ll come down. So again, nothing structural in terms of the organization that has us concerned about cash flow, just some timing effects, and we believe it will be strong at the end of the year.
Toni Kaplan: Okay, great. And you mentioned the wage inflation and costs pressures from the energy and from hangers in China. And I know you mentioned that in the guidance. But could you give us a sense of, if you’re expecting these to continue through the whole year, if you’re expecting them to get worse or better. And if you can give any color of how much is in the guidance that would be helpful too? Thank you.
Paul Adler: If you put all of those together Toni, it's probably somewhere in the 50 to 60 basis points in the quarter. And we generally expect that to continue through the rest of the year.
Toni Kaplan: Thank you.
Operator: And our next question is Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer.
Unidentified Analyst : Hi, it's Daniel on for Scott. Could you guys speak to the synergy progress and help us think about the narrative for a scenario where you could exceed the synergy target for the full year?
Paul Adler: The integration efforts continues and we're very pleased with it. We are continuing to -- well, we're really getting into the route optimization process. So that'll take -- we're working on that most of the year. We've closed all of the redundant plants. But still some inefficiency about getting all of the plants that accepted new volume still working through inefficiencies and getting them back to kind of a normal operating environment.  And so we continue and we’re very pleased with where we are and we talked about in July, getting an additional something in the way of $32 million to $37 million of synergies on top of the $58 million that we got last fiscal year and we’re very confident that we will see those. What can get us above the synergy target in total of $130 million to $140 million, I think more than anything that would come from the sourcing opportunity, I think that’s the biggest opportunity for outperformance.  So in other words, can we take the volume from G&K and incorporate that into our supply chain and translate that into larger sourcing savings than we have modeled. I am not ready to say that we can do that, but I think in answering your question, if we were to outperform that’s likely where it would come from. But generally the integration continues, just as we expected and we’re very pleased with it. 
Unidentified Analyst: Got it, thank you. On capital allocation, could you just provide us an update on how you think about that on a go forward basis. I mean, you had a decent quarter in buybacks, so if you can discuss capital allocation on a go forward basis, please?
Michael Hansen: Yes, I would say the capital allocation is similar to pre-G&K acquisition philosophy and that is we want to grow organically and we’re going to invest in the business in the way that, that we need to in order to continue to grow, that means CapEx will be important for us both in adding plant capacity, adding route capacity and other system investments. So that’s important to us.  We love tuck-in acquisitions and acquisitions that are in our current businesses. And so we’ll continue to look for those kinds of opportunities in our Rental business, in our First Aid and Safety business and in our Fire business. And so we’re -- I would expect that we will return to being aggressive after taking for the most part fiscal 2017 and 2018 off, because of the G&K deal. We have raised our dividend for every year since we went public. I would expect that we’ll evaluate that and that’s very important to us. And then if we have additional cash and we have an opportunity to be opportunistic with that cash, we will execute on the buyback program. We did a little bit of that in the first quarter and I would say that if we feel like there are opportunities to use that program, we’ll continue to do that into the future.
Unidentified Analyst: Great, thank you very much. 
Operator: Our next question comes from John Healy with North Coast Research. We’ll take our next question from Hamzah Mazari with Macquarie Capital.
Hamzah Mazari: Good afternoon, thank you. My first question is just, how do you think about just underlying operating leverage in the business post G&K. I know you highlighted some costs pressures, some ERP distraction or disruption, maybe that’s natural when you have that sort of thing. And then obviously some of the integration around G&K. But, how do you think about sort of natural operating leverage in the business post G&K relative to sort of legacy Cintas?
Michael Hansen: Well I’m going to speak to the whole company -- to the whole business now including G&K. Now we’re going to continue to work on the synergies, but our goal has generally been incremental operating margins in the 20% to 30% range and that will continue going forward. We believe that as we continue to grow, we’ve got very large investment in capacity and route structure and we have leveraged that in the past very well and we expect to continue to do that into the future, especially as we continue to sell to existing customers and to get more revenue per stop. So, there really isn’t a change in the way we view that opportunity going forward, but in this current fiscal 2019 year just as in fiscal 2018, we do have the integration efforts going on and we have the SAP efforts going on. And that will create a little bit more of a let's called it a bumpy ride in terms of that incremental margin, but our philosophy and our belief in that incremental margin and leveraging going forward has not changed.
Hamzah Mazari: Okay, great. And just any updated view on the China Tariffs? I know there is not a lot of direct exposure. I know you mentioned hangers, but anything you're hearing from your customer base or how you think this plays out in terms of your portfolio on an indirect basis?
Michael Hansen: Hamzah I think it's too early to tell. We haven't seen much direct impact yet, other than we called out hangers in a -- it's not a significant amount, but it is something that’s starting to creep in. Aside from that, we haven't seen much direct or indirect impact yet. I think we just need to see more play out.
Hamzah Mazari: Okay. And just a follow-up, I'll turn it over. On the ERP, did you sort of mention how to think about benefits of that system once it's in place longer term?
Michael Hansen: We talked a little bit about the power of the information that we'll get from that system. There will certainly be some costs that can be eliminated particularly the implementation costs. But really we look at that system from the power of the information and how that can make us more efficient, our sales people more productive more targeted in the way that we sell both prospecting, but even more to existing customers. And so we think the power is in the efficiency of the selling process, the productivity and kind of that revenue opportunity as we move into the future. 
Hamzah Mazari: Great, thank you. 
Operator: And we now have a question from John Healy with Northcoast Research. 
John Healy: Thank you. Wanted to ask just a little bit about the cadence of organic growth and the expectation there. I know you guys have said that this would mark the bottom the 4.9%. But when I kind of look at the guidance for the year, it assumes probably the number approaching 6% towards the end of the year. And we just kind of curious to know how quickly you think that steps up from here?
Michael Hansen: Yes, John I think the first quarter we're very pleased with that quarter. As you can tell from maybe the -- what we did with the revenue guidance, we beat our internal plan by a little bit. We have some real nice execution, we saw a nice uptick in our sales rep productivity. And we also saw some nice performance in the first quarter of selling Cintas Facility Services products into our acquired G&K customers.  So we liked what we saw in the first quarter and what you're seeing in our guidance raise is a little reflection that we continue to feel good and be encouraged by the rev productivity, as well as seeing some benefit from the penetration opportunities in our G&K customers. With that being said, we expect an uptick in the second quarter. And as I mentioned in our July call, that second half of the year we expect -- I mentioned in July, we expected that to be in the 5.5% to 6% range and certainly by our guidance increase, we still feel very comfortable about that. So I would expect the second half of the year to be fairly good performance. 
John Healy: Great. And then just one question on SG&A, if I kind of back out the $19 million or so with the stock comp kind of the one-time hit there, very good SG&A kind of management. And I was just curious if there were kind of any onetime items that maybe helped the cause there a little bit or maybe kind of what was going on in the SG&A line that really allowed you guys to outperform that?
Michael Hansen: Well, we are in some really nice leverage as Paul mentioned and the synergy opportunities there are certainly taking effect. And so we've seen some lower -- we've seen a lower labor number and along with that then comes a little bit of a lower medical workers comp kind of number. And so we feel really good about the structural piece of G&A. And I would say that there aren't any significant one time call outs. It's just I would say it's more than anything pretty good performance and cost control. 
John Healy: Great. And just one final question for me. Any updates on kind of the ERP implementation any bright spots or any thoughts on timing there? 
Paul Adler: John, the SAP implementation continues to go very well. And it continues to go as scheduled. Last quarter, back in July, we had I don't know maybe 34% of our operations have been converted to the SAP system. That's now up to about 42% or a little bit more at this point in time. So, it's going very well, it'll still extend into fiscal 2020. Just to give you the some color on this implementation and the scope of it, we've had 3,000 routes impacted and converted by SAP, 235,000 customers. So it's a big undertaking, but everything is going very well. Nothing significant to update you on. 
John Healy: Great, congrats on a great quarter, guys. 
Michael Hansen: Thank you. 
Operator: Our next question is from Manav Patnaik with Barclays Capital. 
Greg Bardi: Hi, this is actually Greg calling in. Just wanted to hit on the tight labor market a little bit more both in terms of what you're doing to attract talent given the low unemployment rate. And then maybe from a customer perspective, if you're seeing any benefit in terms of net new sales from hires?
Michael Hansen: So from a labor standpoint, the pressure that we see the most is in our plants. And so the number one thing that we are doing is working on partner retention and we want to make sure that we are very competitive in the wages, in the benefits that we provide a great working environment and our retention is very good. When we grow however, we do need to go and find additional labor and finding additional labor has been a little bit more challenging and we’re recruiting certainly aggressively from the standpoint of looking at trade schools and recruiting fairs and other types of things. But it really begins with partner retention. That’s the most important thing for us.  From the standpoint of the new business, I believe your question was the productivity from new hires our sales people. We, as I mentioned a few minutes ago, we’ve seen a nice uptick in our sales rep productivity and we really like where we’re headed. We are not back to pre-G&K levels yet. But we really like where we’re headed and the performance has been good and that gives us some confidence to raise our revenue guidance, like I mentioned. 
Greg Bardi: Okay. And then on the rule 2014-09. I think last quarter, you talked about a $16 million to $19 million benefit for the full year. Is that still the expectation?
Michael Hansen: It was about $5.7 million in the first quarter and I would say it’s probably going to be a little bit on the higher end of that range and we’ll update you as we go through the year. 
Greg Bardi: Okay, thank you. 
Operator: And our next question comes from George Tong with Piper Jaffray.
George Tong : With Goldman Sachs. So I guess, first question around cross-selling, can you talk about the extent to which your structural organic growth will change as your cross-selling and penetration opportunities increase with the G&K deal? And then secondly, how does the SAP timelines impact your ability to achieve those cost penetration synergies? 
Michael Hansen: Well, the impact on organic growth, I would say is going to be fairly subtle. In other words, just like with our own business penetration takes some time and it’s not something that we rush into with any of our customers. So it's going to be a bit of a subtle improvement but it's certainly is something as I mentioned a few minutes ago that gives us confidence to raise our guidance a little bit this year. And I would expect that that will continue into the future. It does certainly the system conversion certainly does have an impact on that conversion. Now all legacy G&K locations are on Cintas operating systems. And so that allows us to really get into and start that process, which we have started in this certainly more in earnest in the first quarter. I think as we move forward, the system conversion will just like it is with all of our business. There is going to be some disruption market-by-market, but the good news is we're not converting the entire company at one time. It is a market-by-market conversion. And so that disruption is not going to be significant from quarter-to-quarter. But I don't think that's going to have much impact on our ability to penetrate. It is going to have a little bit -- that system conversion is going to have a little bit more impact on the timing of route optimization, but that's a little bit of a different topic.
George Tong : Got it, very helpful. And then on the topic of margins, can you discuss your thoughts around reinvesting your cost synergies, whether the expectation is to flow through 100% of the cost synergies you've outlined from the G&K acquisition, or are you going to be reinvesting a portion of the synergies back into the business to drive growth.
Michael Hansen: Well, we're going to invest the way we need to invest in order to make our locations as efficient as possible. Now our intention is that that will not require a significant amount of that 130 to 140 in cost synergies to be reinvested. But there certainly will be investments from quarter-to-quarter to make sure that we are maintaining our equipment that we are staffed properly, et cetera. So I don't -- we don't have an expected number that we are going to reinvest, it's going to be part of our CapEx and part of our operating margin going forward. But certainly there is investment that will happen.
George Tong : Very helpful. Thank you. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Andrew Wittmann with R.W. Baird. 
Andrew Wittmann: Great, thanks. Mike, just digging into the guidance to be helpful for everyone. Maybe if you could just talk about the guidance raise that you put out there. How much of it was just passing through what you got in 1Q? I mean, clearly there is you've talked about the revenue and that's very clear. But was tax here in 1Q a little bit better than you expected is that the pass through or has your balance of the year forecast changed? You gave us a lot of the inputs there the one question I think specifically for the balance of the year, that would be helpful to get your view on the margins given some of the headwinds that you called out.
Michael Hansen: Yes, the first quarter tax rate was just a little bit lower than we expected. But as we mentioned in our guidance comments, our full fiscal year tax rate of guidance of 21.7% is the same that we gave you in July. So from a tax perspective, the guidance really didn't have -- really wasn't affected by that. It's the same tax rate in July as we gave you tonight. We feel good about the first quarter. The performance was pretty strong. And we feel good that with the growth coming in Q2 through Q4, we certainly do see some real nice opportunities to increase operating margins certainly year-over-year as we move through the last three quarters. So I would not attribute any of it to taxes, it's really more about can we continue to gain synergies and can we continue to leverage the business and get the real nice growth margin that we expect? That help?
Andrew Wittmann: Yes, it sounds like -- yes it does help. It sounds like there, that it's operating maybe you got the revenue guidance upside here and then it looks like that’s going to flow through to the margins. So it looks like -- it sounds like there is a core operating lift here to the numbers, the share count didn’t change substantially, tax didn’t change substantially, revenue is up and that flow through the EPS. Is that kind of another way to summarize it?
Michael Hansen: Yes, if you think about the operating margins for Q2 through Q4 last year, the average was right about 16% with this guidance for the remaining three quarters, we expect that we’re going to beat that 16% and be into the high 16% range. So we expect some nice operating margin improvement as we move through the year.
Andrew Wittmann: Okay, that’s super helpful. So then just talking on a couple other things maybe for peoples models here, with the new stock compensation accounting that you’re doing here, it was running in the kind of just sub $30 million range per quarter now $46.2 million, is that a good run rate and same thing with the intangible amortization associated primarily as presumably with the sales commissions now being capitalized and amortized. Is this rate of around $33.5 million, a pretty good run rate for the balance of the year on those two items?
Michael Hansen: Yes, great question Andy. From an amortization standpoint, yes. With the accounting change, that commission expense does run through the amortization now. So, you -- that’s a pretty good run rate, keep in mind that’s going to be offset down in working capital and the prepaid expenses line, you’ll see a big increase there and that offset will continue through the rest of the year as well. So, net-net the operating cash flows aren’t really impacted much by this change in accounting. So that’s the rev rec change. From a stock-based compensation, that $46 million that you see in the first quarter is loaded with that $19 million impact that we mentioned earlier. And so that is not a good run rate, you would take out a fairly good chunk of that, probably most of the $19 million to get to a better run rate for the rest of the year. That $19 million is kind of a change where we expense -- we accelerate the expense of certain stock options and restricted shares related to Cintas partners who have attained retirement agent tenure. And that’s going to generally occur in the first quarter, when we do -- when we provide our grants.
Andrew Wittmann: Yes, got it, because if you exclude the full 2019, then you’re almost back to the historical level that you’re running at. So it really does seem like it’s pretty heavy in this quarter then pretty de minimis for the balance of the year, right?
Michael Hansen: Yes, that’s correct. 
Andrew Wittmann: Okay. And then just one other thing to clarify, can you talk about the number of shares that were repurchased in first quarter and maybe the total amount of the average price that was paid for them?
Michael Hansen: Under the buyback program, we repurchased about 400,000 shares at an average price of $201.20 and that totaled about just over $80 million. We have right about $330 million left on our authorization.
Andrew Wittmann: Thank you very much. 
Operator: And our next question comes from Dan Dolev with Nomura Securities International. 
Dan Dolev: Hey guys, can you hear me?
Michael Hansen: Hi, Dan. Yes. 
Dan Dolev: Hey guys. Nice job on the quarter. I’ve got two quick questions, organic revenue in the rental business was strong, it was a ted weaker than what we were modeling. I know you were about 5.2 versus 4.9, I know you’re not giving the breakdown anymore, but could you maybe give us like a sense of what the GK part was. And I am sorry if you mentioned it already and we missed it, you were down mid-single-digit, I think in the last two quarters. So what was the -- I am trying to figure out where the weakness was in our model, versus your results?
Michael Hansen: Yes, Dan, we did not provide a G&K number, because as we mentioned back in July, it is now so comingled with the Cintas business that it’s just too hard, it’s really too many assumptions to try to build into that number. So I am not going to be providing that. This is -- this 4.9 is right where we internally expected, maybe a little bit better than what we expected. And we feel real good about that performance both of the let's call it standalone G&K locations, as well as standalone Cintas locations. And the sales reps that are selling around those. But just simply because it's so comingled for all of the locations that we've closed and we've merged accounts and into various Cintas locations, it gets really difficult to report on the entire block of business. 
Dan Dolev: No, I understand that’s fair. And then my follow-up is on the energy you called out the 20 basis points energy headwind. I know in prior years you were also talking about whenever there is a headwind to cost there's also a tailwind to revenue. Can you maybe specify if there is a -- if that was also accompanied by a tailwind to organic revenue and rental? Thank you. 
Michael Hansen: Yes, those things don't happen necessarily at the exact same time. I -- this is -- we are seeing a fairly healthy energy sector. It's not back to where it was from a few years ago. But it is a healthy sector, it I wouldn't say that it's outperforming the rest of the business at this point.
Dan Dolev: Got it, thank you very much. Nice results.
Michael Hansen: Thank you. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions].
Michael Hansen: If there are no other questions, thank you for joining us tonight. We will issue our second quarter fiscal 2019 earnings in December. Thanks for joining us, and we look forward to speaking with you again at that time.
Operator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today’s teleconference. You may now disconnect.

===== 2018 Q4  (2018-07-19 17:00:00) =====
Executives: Michael Hansen - CFO & Executive VP Paul Adler - VP & Treasurer
Analysts: Hamzah Mazari - Macquarie Capital Toni Kaplan - Morgan Stanley George Tong - Piper Jaffray Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer Andrew Wittmann - RW Baird Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel Nicolaus Andrew Steinerman - JPMorgan Securities Tim Mulrooney - William Blair
Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Cintas Quarterly Earnings Results Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Mike Hansen, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Sir, please go ahead.
Michael Hansen: Good evening. Thank you for joining us tonight. With me is Paul Adler, Cintas Vice President and Treasurer. We will discuss our fourth quarter results for fiscal 2018. After our commentary, we'll be happy to answer any questions. The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a safe harbor from civil litigation for forward-looking statements. This conference call contains forward-looking statements that reflect the company's current views as to future events and financial performance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those we may discuss. I refer you to the discussion on these points contained in our most recent filings with the SEC. Our revenue for the fourth quarter, which ended May 31, was $1,670,000,000, an increase of 9.1% over last year's fourth quarter. The organic revenue growth rate, which adjusts for the impacts of acquisitions and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, was 5.1%. The organic revenue growth rate for the Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment was 5.3%, and the organic growth rate for the First Aid and Safety Services segment was 9.4%. Note that the lower rate of organic revenue growth for the Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment was expected and as we have previously communicated, was due to the inclusion for the first time of the acquired G&K Services business and organic as opposed to inorganic revenue. Reported operating income for the fourth quarter was $265 million compared to $177 million in last year's fourth quarter. Operating income was reduced $15 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal '18 and $63 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal '17 by transaction and integration expenses related to the G&K acquisition. Excluding these items, our fourth quarter operating income grew 16.4%, resulting in an operating margin of 16.8% compared to 15.8% last year. In March, we gave fourth quarter EPS guidance in the range of $1.64 to $1.69. That excluded G&K integration expenses, and it assumed an effective tax rate of 24%. Against this guidance, fourth quarter EPS was $1.77. Our tax rate was slightly better than the guided 24%, and this resulted in a benefit of $0.04. The remaining beat of guidance was primarily due to higher revenue than expected. We're pleased with these fourth quarter results and our full year performance. Our fiscal '18 results extended our record of success. We have now grown revenue and profit 47 of the past 49 years with the only exception being the two years of the Great Recession. For the eighth consecutive year, organic growth was in the mid- to high single-digit range, and we continue to grow revenue by multiples greater than both gross domestic product and employment. Strong execution on the fundamentals is a hallmark of Cintas, but fiscal '18's achievement was especially noteworthy given that it occurred in a period of extreme change management. While delivering solid returns to shareholders in 2018, we also made significant progress on two important investments, G&K and SAP. The first year of the integration of the largest acquisition in Cintas history required the expertise of every part of the organization, including sales, production, service, global supply chain, IT, engineering, HR and finance. Very important tasks included winning the hearts and minds of acquired employees whom we call partners and earning the trust of acquired customers through our outstanding service. Our partners ran our acquisition playbook and effectively adjusted where necessary. We have now closed nearly all operations necessary to eliminate redundancies, which is 63 operations to date. All G&K locations, 148 in total, have been converted to Cintas operating systems. About 1,500 G&K trucks have been painted and rebranded as Cintas. Important integration work still remains for fiscal 2019, but after our first year of integration efforts, we are still on track for the achievement of our synergy commitments. When we acquired G&K less than 18 months ago, our debt to EBITDA ratio rose to about 3.1 times. Our commitment was to return our leverage to a target of about 2 times in 3 years. We are now there and are thrilled to have delivered on this commitment well ahead of expectations. Fiscal '18 was also a year of tremendous technological change. In addition to moving G&K locations to Cintas systems, we continue to convert our operating system from a homegrown system to that of SAP. And information system conversion is like an acquisition integration in that it requires the involvement of experts from all departments of the company, including operations, sales and corporate support. The conversion of each operation to SAP is an eight month process. Our employees are coached on change management. Data standardization activities are performed. Garments are scanned and inventoried, and employees are trained and certified. Customers are notified of changes to invoice appearance and introduced to improvements in doing business with us because of the technology enhancements. Training and care continue for two months following the go-live date of the new system. A total of 108 operations have now been converted to date, which is about 34% of the total planned. Looking ahead to -- looking ahead, fiscal 2019 will share some similarities with fiscal '18. We will continue to integrate G&K and realize more of the $130 million to $140 million in anticipated annual synergies. We expect to realize $90 million to $95 million in synergies in fiscal 2019 or $32 million to $37 million in incremental synergies. In addition, efforts will continue to convert more operations to the new SAP ERP system. Like fiscal '18, inefficiencies will exist as our partners make further progress on acquisition integration and system implementations while executing on the day-to-day for our customers. However, we expect to extend our streak of profitable growth to 48 out of the past 50 years. We will accomplish that via the solid execution of our -- our shareholders have come to expect. One important area in which fiscal '19 will differ from fiscal '18 is in capital allocation. With $600 million of acquisition debt repaid and our leverage target achieved, we returned to our historical priorities for deployment of cash, which are CapEx, acquisitions, dividend payments and share repurchases. We are honored to have been recently included in the Fortune 500 as number 500. As our CEO, Scott Farmer, has stated, this accomplishment is built on our strong sense of culture, principles and values and reflects our strong financial growth, expanding line of products and services and innovative technologies. It's a testament to the hard work and dedication of our employee partners. We're not satisfied with being number 500, though, and our continued progression higher into that ranking starts in fiscal '19. Our expectations for fiscal '19 are for annual revenue to be in the range of $6.750 billion to $6.820 billion. I stated earlier that in our fourth quarter of fiscal '18, we lapped the one year anniversary of the acquisition of G&K. For the first time, G&K's revenue was organic as opposed to inorganic. This resulted in a lower organic growth rate due to the combination of a strongly growing Cintas legacy business and a significantly sized G&K business that historically grew slower than Cintas. We expect this lower organic growth rate to be temporary just as it was for our First Aid and Safety segment after it acquired ZEE Medical. With continued investment in selling resources, we expect the total Uniform Rental and Facility Services organic growth rate to hit bottom in the first quarter and then strengthen as we move through fiscal '19. We expect fiscal '19 EPS from continuing operations to be in the range of $7 to $7.15. Let me make a few comments about this EPS guidance. It assumes an effective tax rate of 21.7%. Keep in mind that this tax rate can move up or down from quarter-to-quarter based on discrete events, including the amount of stock compensation benefits. The guidance assumes a diluted share count for computing EPS of 114 million shares. It does not assume any G&K integration expenses. However, we do expect to incur these in the range of $15 million to $20 million in fiscal '19. The guidance does include the impact of a change to our Cintas partner retirement policy in which the retirement age and tenure requirements were reduced. This change results in a shorter time period over which future stock-based compensation grants will be amortized. It is a non-cash impact, and it is expected to increase stock-based compensation expense by roughly $20 million in fiscal '19. And lastly, the guidance also includes the impact of adoption of the Accounting Standard Update 2014-09, revenue from contracts with customers. With the adoption, we expect the following. Fiscal '19 revenue will be negatively affected by roughly $8 million along with the loss of the incremental operating margin associated with that revenue. SG&A, however, will benefit from the capitalization of sales rep commission payments and the subsequent amortization of those commissions over the expected service period of our contracts. This is also a non-cash impact, and we expect the net benefit to be roughly $16 million to $19 million. Overall, these last two non-cash items included in guidance will both be recorded in SG&A and generally will offset each other to have only a minor negative impact. Before I turn the call over to Paul, I'd like to say thank you to Phillip Holloman, who is retiring from Cintas this month. Phillip has been with Cintas for 22 years and has been our President and Chief Operating Officer for the past 10 years. In our press release last month in which Scott Farmer thanked Phillip for his many contributions, Scott said, those of us who have had the privilege of working with Phillip know that Cintas is a better company because of him, and he will be missed. Thanks again, Phillip. Phillip's retirement has led to several other leadership changes at Cintas. Scott Farmer announced the promotion of Todd Schneider to the position of Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer with the responsibility of leading all of our business divisions. Todd has been with Cintas for 29 years and has been our Rental division President and Chief Operating Officer for the last 5 years, leading our largest business through a very successful period and most notably, leading us through the integration of G&K. Scott also announced the promotion of Mike Thompson to the position of Executive Vice President and Chief Administration Officer. Mike has been with Cintas for 24 years and has been Cintas' Chief Information Officer for the last five years, most notably leading us through our SAP conversion. Mike will continue to lead our IT efforts and will also be responsible for our global supply chain and our safety and engineering groups. These changes are part of our normal succession planning process, and as we move into our fiscal '19 year, we remain as excited as ever about the future of Cintas. I'll now turn the call over to Paul.
Paul Adler: Thank you, Mike. First, please note that our fiscal fourth quarter contained the same number of workdays as the prior year fourth quarter. Looking ahead, there will be no workday differences next year as each quarter of fiscal '19 contains the same number of workdays as the comparable quarter of fiscal '18. We have 2 reportable operating segments, Uniform Rental and Facility Services and First Aid and Safety Services. The remainder of our business is included in All Other. All Other consists of Fire Protection Services and our Uniform Direct Sale business. First Aid and Safety Services and All Other are combined and presented as Other Services on the income statement. The Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segment includes the rental and servicing of uniforms, mats and towels and the provision of restroom supplies and other facility products and services. The segment also includes the sale of items from our catalogs to our customers on route. Uniform Rental and Facility Services revenue was $1,342,000,000, an increase of 10.1% compared to last year's fourth quarter. Excluding the impact of acquisitions and foreign currency exchange rate changes, the organic growth rate was 5.3%. As Mike stated, the organic growth rate was negatively impacted by the inclusion of G&K and organic as opposed to inorganic revenue for the first time. We expect the organic growth rate to hit bottom in the first quarter of fiscal '19 and strengthen as we move through the fiscal year. Our Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment gross margin was 45.0% for the fourth quarter compared to 44.6% in last year's fourth quarter, an increase of 40 basis points. While we continue to experience the inefficiencies that are customary with an acquisition integration and an ERP system implementation, we are realizing the expected cost synergies, which are benefiting our margins. These synergies plus better-than-expected revenue also enabled us to overcome an almost 20 basis point increase in energy expenses. Our First Aid and Safety Services operating segment includes revenue from the sale and servicing of first aid products, safety products and training. This segment's revenue for the fourth quarter was $147 million, which was 9.9% higher than last year's fourth quarter. On an organic basis, the growth rate for this segment was 9.4%. This segment's gross margin was 47.0% in the fourth quarter compared to 44.5% in last year's fourth quarter, an increase of 250 basis points. The significant amount of margin expansion was fueled in large part due to the realization of synergies from the ZEE Medical acquisition. With the synergies now realized in full, we expect margin expansion to continue in fiscal '19 but at a normalized rate. The fourth quarter was another outstanding quarter for this segment. Organic growth continued to be strong and was benefited by penetration of existing customers and national account wins. The solid revenue growth plus expanding gross margins are evidence of the value businesses place on having Cintas manage their first aid safety and training programs to help keep their employees healthy and safe. The future of the first aid business segment remains bright. Our Fire Protection Services and Uniform Direct Sale businesses are reported in the All Other category. The Uniform Direct Sale business long-term growth rates are generally low single digits and are subject to volatility, such as when we install a multi-million-dollar account. Our fire business, however, continues to grow each year at a strong pace. All Other revenue was $179 million, an increase of 1.8% compared to last year's fourth quarter. The organic growth rate was 0.2%. The fire business organic revenue growth rate was double digits. However, the strong performance was offset by a difficult revenue comparison for the Uniform Direct Sale business. In last year's fourth quarter, Uniform Direct Sale revenue included the rollouts of new uniform styles for the pilots and flight attendants of Southwest Airlines. Large rollouts such as these do not repeat each year as businesses typically rebrand every 3 to 5 years. The benefit from Southwest last year was a headwind of about $13 million to this year's fourth quarter revenue. All Other gross margin was 43.6% for the fourth quarter of this fiscal year compared to 42.8% for last year's fourth quarter, an increase of 80 basis points. All Other gross margin expansion was driven by the fire business. Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue were 28.3% in the fourth quarter compared to 28.6% in last year's fourth quarter. SG&A benefited from favorable workers' compensation claims experience. In addition, we are getting leverage from increased revenue covering fixed costs. Our effective tax rate on continuing operations for the fourth quarter benefited from the new U.S. tax legislation. The effective tax rate, excluding G&K integration expenses, was 22.1%. Our EPS guidance for fiscal 2019 assumes an effective tax rate of 21.7%. Note that the effective tax rate will fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter based on tax reserve builds and releases relating to discrete items, including the amount of stock compensation benefits in each period. Our cash and equivalents balance as of May 31 was $138 million. Free cash flow in fiscal '18 was $692 million, an increase of $201 million or 41% from the prior year period. Capital expenditures for fiscal '18 were $271 million. Our CapEx by operating segment for the year was as follows: $225 million in Uniform Rental and Facility Services, $28 million in First Aid and Safety, and $18 million in All Other. We expect fiscal '19 CapEx to be in the range of $290 million to $320 million. In the fourth quarter of fiscal '18, we repatriated about $110 million of international cash. We used the funds to pay down debts and to buy back stock. In the quarter, we purchased about $90 million in Cintas stock, and $410 million remain on the share buyback authorization approved by the Board of Directors. As of May 31, total debt was $2,535,000,000. At May 31, our leverage was 2.1x debt to EBITDA. As Mike stated earlier, when we acquired G&K less than 18 months ago, we committed to return our leverage to a target of about 2 times in three years. We are pleased to have delivered on this commitment well ahead of expectations. We are excited to have returned to our historical priorities for deployment of cash, which are CapEx, acquisitions, dividend payments and share repurchases. That concludes our prepared remarks. We are happy to answer your questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Hamzah Mazari with Macquarie Capital.
Hamzah Mazari: Good afternoon. Thank you. The first question is just on consolidation in the space broadly. I know you've sort of outlined cost synergies. Maybe if you could touch on -- there's been another uniform deal in the space. Could you maybe touch on the revenue side? Do you expect pricing to get better in the space post-consolidation? I realize it's a local business, so there may be some nuances there. So maybe if you could just touch on that and then how to think about G&K revenue synergies?
Michael Hansen: Sure. So from the standpoint of pricing, the pricing environment, I would say, hasn't changed much in the last 90 days since we spoke last. And quite honestly, I don't expect that the consolidation that has happened will have much of an impact on the pricing environment. It's still a very competitive environment. We face legacy like competition as well as other catalog type competitors, and so that's not going away. So I don't think that's going to have much of an impact on the pricing environment. From the standpoint of the revenue synergies, we're moving cautiously as we have as we've talked about in the past. But we have begun to introduce some of the products where we can, where we have converted systems or where we have integrated routes into Cintas locations. And while it's early, and we haven't seen any notable impact, it's anecdotally positive so far. So I would say, as we continue to move through this year, we've got a lot of integration activity left, and we're going to continue to introduce Cintas products and services to those customers. But I would not expect much of an impact at this point in time.
Hamzah Mazari: Okay. And then just on the SAP, I know you sort of gave color on the integration of the SAP and time line. But maybe you're not ready quantitatively, but qualitatively, should -- once SAP is implemented, should we expect that 28% of sales SG&A run rate to come down materially? Or how are you thinking about sort of benefits of SAP maybe just qualitatively if you want to address that?
Michael Hansen: Yes. I think we'll see once we get through that implementation effort, which we expect to be by the end of fiscal '20. We do expect some expenses to roll off, certainly, those that are part of the integration and implementation effort. So we will certainly see some benefit from that in fiscal '21. But more than anything from that system, we like the information and the power of that information. And we're not necessarily looking for a significant cost reduction. What we are looking for is more opportunity to make our selling team more productive. So how can we create warmer leads with better information? How can we use that information to be more directive in the way we approach our customers with our various products and services? So we're not looking necessarily for a significant SG&A reduction. We really want to help our selling partners become more efficient.
Hamzah Mazari: Okay. Just a follow-up. I'll turn it over. Any updated thoughts on the tariffs and how that impacts you either directly or indirectly through customer demand?
Michael Hansen: From a direct standpoint, we have -- certainly have some impact like hangers, but overall, it has not been significant. From an indirect standpoint, and when I say indirect, I mean from the vendors -- from our vendors, it remains to be seen how they will be impacted and how that might in turn impact us. We're certainly keeping our eyes on that, but we need a little bit more time for that to play out. From a customer perspective, too early to see much of an impact.
Hamzah Mazari: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley.
Toni Kaplan: Hi, good afternoon, guys.
Hamzah Mazari: Hi, Toni.
Toni Kaplan: So you mentioned a couple of times now you've hit your gross leverage target in this quarter. Your capital priorities are returning to historical ones. How should we think about the level of share repurchases this year or if you want to just talk directionally as sort of what the algorithm would be in that? Or - and then also just with tax reform, how should we -- should we expect 5x to be above the historical average that you've been running at?
Michael Hansen: Well, we -- as Paul mentioned, CapEx is very important to us, and we will make sure we spend and invest in the business. We also will likely be more aggressive than we were in the last 2 fiscal years in acquisition activity. From the standpoint of share repurchases, we have a $410 million -- we have a $500,000 authorization, where $410 million is remaining. And I would say that we're going to continue to do what we have done in the past, and that is be opportunistic about the way we use that. And so that -- I'm not ready to say whether that will increase where we have historically been. But I would say our expectation is to get back to something of that historical type of environment.
Toni Kaplan: Terrific. And I know it might be difficult to parse this out. But could you give us some color on what kind of G&K growth is incorporated into the '19 guidance?
Michael Hansen: That is very difficult to parse out. And you may have noticed when we gave guidance, we didn't include any specific G&K information because it's pretty difficult to take the business that is so co-mingled into our legacy business. But if you kind of think about the revenue guidance and you just make an assumption that it's flattish, that opening guidance is pretty much in the range of that 5 to 6.5 where we've been in the last few years. So we think that's right where we want to be. That -- we believe that's our -- that's kind of our sweet spot as we opened the year and feel good about it moving into this first quarter.
Toni Kaplan: That's helpful. And just lastly, historically in the fourth quarter, you've given revenue growth by product within the uniform business. Is that something that you'd be able to provide for us today?
Paul Adler: Yes, Toni. We do have that, and this is the mix of the Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment. Uniform rental was 50%. Dust control is 17%. Hygiene is 14%. Shop towels are 5%. Linen is 10%, and then catalog revenue was 4%.
Toni Kaplan: Thanks so much.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question will come from George Tong with Piper Jaffray.
George Tong: Hi, thanks. Good afternoon. You've indicated that, over time, G&K's revenue growth can approach Cintas' historical revenue growth in the uniform rentals business. Can you think of any potential structural barriers that might prevent G&K organic growth from reaching your historical levels? And maybe talk a little bit about the initiatives you have in place to improve G&K's growth outlook over the near to intermediate term.
Michael Hansen: I don't see any roadblocks. And George, as we move in to this year, you -- it's hard to think about that business as being separate at all. It's -- so many of the locations have been absorbed into legacy Cintas locations or have traded volume. So it's really hard to look at it separately. However, as we were working through the integration of last year, one of the biggest pieces was coming out of the closing of that deal. We had a sales team at G&K that had been -- had a tough environment, and we wanted to pull them out of their positions so that we can train them, get them to understand our systems, our products and services. There certainly were open positions that we had to fill, and that has gone very well. But as we've talked about in the last several quarters in our business, when you lose that new business momentum for a number of quarters, it takes a little bit of time to reverse that trend. We have done a very good job of training our new salespeople. We have seen the productivity tick up slightly each quarter throughout fiscal '18. And so the thing that will get us back to the Cintas like levels of growth will be a combination of those sales partners being more and more productive and our ability to penetrate the G&K customers like we do with all of our other Cintas customers. So as we mentioned, we expect our first quarter organic growth to be somewhat similar, maybe slightly lower than what we reported here in this fourth quarter for our rental business. But we expect to see some improvement as we then go through the year to the point where fiscal '20, I would expect, we'd be back to our historical like levels, barring any change in the macro environment.
George Tong: Got it. That's very helpful. And then on the topic of revenue synergies and cross-selling, I know it's still very early days. But can you provide a progress report on how cross-selling initiatives are progressing? And what, in your view, is the longer-term revenue opportunity from bundling?
Michael Hansen: Well, we are -- and I'll speak to our total business now, not just G&K. But we have opportunities. When we first sell a new account, we don't normally sell everything. And so we continue to look for ways and opportunities for our drivers, who we call SSRs or service sales reps. Our SSRs and our salespeople, we look for opportunities for them to penetrate existing customers. And we're getting better at that, but we can always improve and especially when it comes to getting First Aid and Safety and fire into our uniform and facility services customers. So we're continuing to work on ways to improve the efficiency there in the -- or while we are waiting for SAP to come. And once we get SAP, we do believe that, that will make the visibility for all of our people better, and this should allow us to improve that penetration even more.
George Tong: Very helpful. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Manav Patnaik with Barclays Capital.
Unidentified Analyst: Hi. This is actually Greg dialing in. First, just wanted to hit on the G&K guided synergies. Can you talk to the buckets that are showing up in the $35 million or so synergies you expect to realize in '19? And then what are the other buckets that are going to be seen in year three and year four?
Michael Hansen: Sure. I think we've talked a lot about the 4 buckets in the past. And as we move into year two of that integration, I would expect that we will get more production synergies. We did a lot of that heavy work in fiscal '18, and we're still not quite as efficient as we want to be in our plans, but we're moving through that. And I would expect that production is a big component. We will do a lot of route optimization. And while we have only just begun that, that's going to be the largest activity that we have going on in fiscal '19. So we'll start to see some of those routing benefits. And when I talk about routing benefits, what I really mean is improved fuel utilization. We are not looking to eliminate routes. What we're really looking to do is make all of our routes more efficient and give them -- give our SSRs more time with our customers. But that's going to be a big project, and there will be -- we will start to see some of that benefit. We have already gotten a lot of G&A benefits, and we still have some more to go. But that will be a lesser component in year 2 than the production impact. And then we'll start to see some sourcing synergies, but I would expect more of those to be in that year 3 and 4. So thinking about that prioritization, I would expect production to be the largest piece followed then by those other 3 where we're touching now on the routing and the sourcing and also getting a little bit more incremental G&A.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay. That's helpful. And then I just wanted to quickly ask how you guys are thinking about inflation pressures and what's embedded in guidance. And how you're thinking a rising labor and raw material cost backdrop, how you think about your ability to pass on that pricing to customers?
Michael Hansen: Well, when we think about the economy as we stand today and looking forward from today, we feel like it's a positive environment. The activities are good. Our team has been fairly successful in both selling new business and in penetrating. And so it's a positive environment. There are certainly those things that you mentioned that we're keeping our eyes on. Certainly, the tariff uncertainty is a wildcard, and as we -- as I was mentioning a little bit earlier, the indirect pieces of those, we're keeping our eyes on, but again, it's a wildcard about how that'll impact us. From an energy perspective and fuel perspective, we have modeled that we will see about a 20 basis point increase in fuel in fiscal '19, and we're seeing that already in June in our prices at the pump. And from a labor perspective, we certainly are starting to see the tightening of labor. It's not affecting us widespread, but it certainly is an impact. And we're keeping our eyes on how do we manage the best we can and be as efficient as we can. And one way to do that is to really work on our partner retention. That is very important for us, and it certainly makes this tighter labor market easier to deal with if we can retain our current partners. That's very important to us. But those things are certainly starting to creep in. They are included in our guidance, but we're -- those are things to keep our eyes on.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay. All very helpful. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer.
Scott Schneeberger: Thanks. Good afternoon. Just following up on that last question, it looks like cotton's gotten expensive again. Could you remind us -- you considered synthetics last time. You weathered the storm pretty well, though, when those prices increased a few years ago. Could you just remind us how maybe this time compares to last time and how you think about that?
Michael Hansen: Yes. I don't think we've seen the spikes that we saw last time quite yet, but in any event, cotton is something that just takes a long time to get into our P&L. When you think about the standard garment that we have, certainly, the fabric is a component of that. A bigger component is the labor. And you also have things like trim and freight into our distribution centers. But certainly, the fabric is a component of that, and cotton is a component of that fabric. So when you break it all down, it's not a significant amount of the cost, but there is an impact. But when we see these spikes, in order for it to impact our P&L, it's got to be a long time of that spike. In other words, it has to last through the production of our garments, the shipping of those into our distribution center, sitting in our DC for return, then getting out into our rental locations where it begins to amortize generally over 18 months. So in that first month of shipping into the rental location, we see 1/18 of the impact. So as you can imagine, that cotton has to spike and stay elevated for quite a while before it has a real meaningful impact, and we haven't seen any of it yet.
Scott Schneeberger: You guys have referenced that the low watermark for the organic growth progression is going to be in the first quarter. I don't know if you're comfortable getting into more detail, but just curious how it might compare to fourth quarter and kind of the cadence of next year.
Michael Hansen: Yes. I think it's going to be slightly -- from a -- I'm speaking from a rental perspective now. I think it's going to be lower than this fourth quarter, but then in the second quarter, should see a move upward and followed by the second half of the year that it's getting closer to the 5.5 to 6 level. But we're a ways from there. I would expect, if the economy continues to perform like it is, I would expect that we should be near that top of that guidance that we gave, and that should play out quarter-by-quarter in the way I mentioned.
Scott Schneeberger: Appreciate that. One more similar question, kind of housekeeping. You talked about the full year tax rate guidance and that it would fluctuate quarter-to-quarter. Any rules of thumb on any particular quarters that we should follow being above or below that just for the modeling purposes?
Michael Hansen: Yes. I think that's a good question, Scott. I would expect from an EPS quarter-to-quarter perspective, we're going to have -- I mentioned the change to our retirement policy and an increase in our stock-based compensation. We're going to see a good chunk of that in our first quarter, and so it's going to pressure our first quarter margins. Because of that, we also get a benefit, a greater benefit on the tax side of things. So I expect that our first quarter tax rate will be quite lower than the remaining 3 quarters, all of which will probably be closer to that 24% like range.
Scott Schneeberger: Okay. Thanks very much.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Andrew Wittmann with RW Baird.
Andrew Wittmann: Thanks for taking my question, guys. I was just looking at the guidance, and it looks like bridging between EPS and revenue that somewhere in the low 16s is the EBIT margin assumption that you have implicit in your guidance. I guess, with the moving pieces of roughly $35 million of cost synergies that you're expecting this year, it does look like you're putting up some incremental margins. But I was just wondering how you expect this year to play out versus your normal expectation for around 30% incremental EBIT margins. Is that what's implied here, Mike?
Michael Hansen: Implied from the low end to the high end is certainly margin improvement, operating margin improvement, and I would say, I think of it in -- a little bit higher than you had said. I think you had said in the low 16s, I would put it more in the mid-16s and at the high end, maybe even a little bit higher than that. So ex synergy, still some nice margin improvement at the top. Now Andrew, we talk about 20% to 30% incremental margin, and clearly, with all of the integration and implementation work that we have, this is not a normal year. And I -- inclusive of all of that, that incremental is going to be a little bit different this year than we would normally think of. When you think about incremental -- when you think about the inefficiencies of the implementation and the integration, when you think about a little bit of a higher energy number, it's not your normal incremental year certainly.
Andrew Wittmann: Got it. So just in terms of like the in-specific integration costs, if you will, like the things that you weren't able to back out, now that you're more than a year into owning G&K, does that become a slight tailwind as well because you're like not relabeling garments? Or is there still or maybe more of those types of costs that are in your guidance?
Michael Hansen: More of those types of costs are in the guidance. So when you -- I mentioned earlier that we're -- one of the heavy projects is the route optimization. So I'll give you an example of a market route optimization. In a market where we've got Cintas facilities and G&K facilities that will remain open, we're going to take a look at all of the customers in that marketplace, and we are going to then take those customers in that marketplace and effectively reroute them to make all of our routes in that marketplace more efficient. Now we are certainly cautious because the -- our goal through this process is to minimize the disruption to the customer. And so we always have to keep that in mind, but we will make those routes more efficient. And sometimes, that means moving the processing of certain customers from one location to the other. And when we do that, that means we have to pull garments out of one location and transport them to the other location. That receiving location then has to rebarcode all of those garments, enter them into the system, and they have to do a little bit of that production integration all over again. That's an important part of what we're doing. And we're going to be cautious about it because, again, we're not -- we want to make sure that we don't disrupt the customer or minimize that. And again, we're not looking at a route reduction. We're looking at a route efficiency opportunity. But as you can imagine, moving those garments in between those facilities creates, again, the same kind of inefficiency that we talked about last year.
Andrew Wittmann: I wanted to ask one final question here, and that's just regarding kind of the revenue trends in the core rental segment, specifically, just getting some subjective comments from you on the level of sales force productivity, particularly those G&K folks who stayed with you that are now more accustomed to the suite of products and services that you're selling as well as get some sense from you about the level of retention that you're experiencing in your customer base today, any comments on add-stop? Or the level of no [ph] programs would also be welcome.
Michael Hansen: Let's see. That was a lot, Andrew. From the retention standpoint, look, we talked about it all year long and it's been better than we expected. And we are very, very pleased with that. Again, the legacy G&K business was a very good business. They took care of their customers well. We've continued to do that, and we try to make that disruption of the integration as minimal as -- of a disruption as we can. And that has -- that's led to some real nice retention. From the legacy salespeople standpoint, look, we -- they have some very good selling skills. It's just more a matter of making sure they understand our environment, our systems, our products and services and our expectations. And that can take a while to retrain and ramp up. But we like -- as I mentioned, we like the trend that we've seen in each quarter in fiscal '18, and we're encouraged by what we've seen and encouraged by the opportunity that we have moving forward.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel Nicolaus.
Shlomo Rosenbaum: Hi, thank you. I don't usually ask questions about M&A. But given some of the commentary you made about being more selective or opportunistic in share repurchases together with the significant capacity that you now have on the EBITDA side. I was just wondering if -- when you are looking, and I'm sure you're paying more attention to deals that are coming your way, should we expect more of the same in terms of companies more in the uniform rental business? Doesn't seem like there's a ton at least in the first aid side or is there an adjacency or something that you guys are entertaining as well?
Michael Hansen: We would love to continue to be acquisitive in our rental business, in our First Aid and Safety and in our fire businesses. We like all of those opportunities, and we will have an opportunity to be more aggressive in fiscal '19 than we have been in the last few years. And those acquisitions are important to us. Would we look for a different type of opportunity? It depends on the characteristics of the business. And it can -- can it help us continue to grow? And can our current customers take advantage of that new offering? A lot of things that we would have to take into account and the value would have to be at the right place. Having said that, if those things do happen, we'll absolutely be aggressive in looking at it if we feel like it is the right opportunity.
Shlomo Rosenbaum: So is there anything like particular out of the wheelhouse that you think would surprise us? Or really, hey, you feel like this as a company that wants to stick to its knitting and that's what we should expect?
Michael Hansen: Well, Shlomo, we -- when we think about our business, we think about the opportunity to create value to over 1 million businesses that we currently serve and many more that we don't currently serve. And that value can come in the way of image, safety, compliance. And so there are a lot of different ways that we can provide benefits to businesses, and that also then allows us to kind of expand what we currently do, both in our current businesses and maybe then in some type of new offering. In the past, we have moved from the rental business to a first aid to a fire to document management to deep cleaning. There have been opportunities, and we've taken advantage of those. And again, if those kind of opportunities exist, we would certainly love them. I don't know if some of those kinds of services would be surprising to any of you. That I can't answer. But we're not satisfied with simply staying in our swim lanes and not being aggressive in terms of adding value to our customers and to other prospective customers.
Shlomo Rosenbaum: Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan Securities.
Andrew Steinerman: Hi. Mike, looking back at the fourth quarter in terms of uniform rental organic revenue growth, could you tell us how G&K did versus the Cintas space? And did the upside in rental revenue growth come from G&K better than expected or the Cintas space?
Michael Hansen: Andrew, it's really hard to pull it apart, but our expectation was that we certainly still did see shrinkage in that G&K base but likely a little better just based on the top line, likely a little bit better than we had expected. I would say more of the beat of our guidance was our legacy business, and that's operating very, very well even in the midst of lots of moving parts within those locations because of the integration. I can't give you a specific number though, Andrew.
Andrew Steinerman: So did you think that G&K declines narrowed from the third quarter declines? Because you did give us third quarter declines of mid-single digits.
Michael Hansen: Yes, I would say if I had to -- I am guessing. I would say it's fairly similar to that third quarter number.
Andrew Steinerman: Okay. Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Tim Mulrooney with William Blair.
Tim Mulrooney: Good afternoon. Can you guys hear me okay?
Michael Hansen: Yes, I can.
Tim Mulrooney: Hi. Just a couple of questions here. So with non-pharma employment continuing to grow, I'm sure you guys are benefiting from that to a degree. In thinking about new customer growth, are there any areas, other end markets or regions where you see particular strength?
Michael Hansen: Well, we -- first of all, I would say it's been broadly a positive environment. But we talk a lot about health care in the last few years, and health care remains an exciting opportunity for us for many of our products and services. And that industry vertical continues to grow at very good levels. But I would say, generally, Tim, it's been a fairly broad performance, and we're real pleased with it.
Tim Mulrooney: Okay. Thanks. And then on a dollar basis, can you share with us how much acquisitions added to both the uniform rental and other segments in the quarter?
Michael Hansen: Let's see. From a dollar perspective, in the quarter, it's, let's call, at about $53 million for rental and a very small number for the others, less than $5 million, only really a couple million dollars.
Tim Mulrooney: Got it, okay. And then with SAP, you've converted 34% of the base so far with plans to be complete in fiscal 2020. Where do you guys expect to be by the end of 2019 if you're willing to share?
Michael Hansen: We've got a lot of moving pieces, and I would say we're going to make significant progress. But I don't have a schedule in front of me, and I don't know that I'm -- I want to get to that level of specificity just simply because it changes quite often. It changes based on what we've got going on in each market from an integration standpoint, from a customer perspective. And as I mentioned a few times, our goal is to minimize customer disruption. And so that might mean moving a little bit from one market to another. So it's hard to pinpoint that, and I'd rather not.
Paul Adler: But Tim, I guess, I would add from like a modeling perspective, like we don't anticipate that in fiscal '19, the SAP expenses, anything much different than fiscal '18, so we don't expect the expense to be a headwind.
Tim Mulrooney: Okay, that's essentially what I was looking for. Two more quick housekeeping ones, guys, number one, the change to the retirement policy. Did you say higher stock comp would impact by $15 million to $20 million in 2019?
Michael Hansen: I said $20 million roughly.
Tim Mulrooney: Roughly $20 million. And you said that a big piece of that, Mike, might hit in the -- will hit in the first quarter. How should I think about modeling that? Is it most of it in the first quarter? Half? Any detail would be helpful?
Michael Hansen: I'm not -- I don't want to get into the very specific level. I don't have it in front of me nor do I want to get into that level of detail. But in our first quarter, we are generally wrapping up our fiscal -- our prior fiscal year compensation plans. And so that's generally when we provide the grants. And because of that, that is when a lot of the activity happens. But I can't get into the level of detail, that level of detail that you want.
Tim Mulrooney: No, that's still helpful. One last one. Did you say shares outstanding of 114 million in 2019?
Michael Hansen: We did, yes.
Tim Mulrooney: So you were at 111 million at the end of the fourth quarter. Is that increase related to the change in the retirement policy? And then if you -- could you share the cadence of how should we think about that through the year?
Michael Hansen: We were over 111.5 million. We're modeling a little bit higher. Tim, when our stock performs as well as it does, the effect of diluted securities really starts to rise. And while there aren't additional shares out there, the effect of those securities increases. So that's why we're seeing that number at that 114 million level.
Operator: All right, gentlemen, there are currently no further questions in the queue.
Michael Hansen: Okay. Thank you very much, and we will be with you at the -- near the end of September for our first quarter results. But thank you for joining us, and have a great rest of your summer.
Operator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's teleconference, and you may now disconnect.

===== 2018 Q3  (2018-03-22 00:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Cintas quarterly earnings results conference call. Today's call is being recorded. 
 At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Mr. Mike Hansen, Senior VP of Finance and Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead, sir. 
J. Hansen: Thank you. Good evening, and thanks for joining us tonight. With me is Paul Adler, Cintas Vice President and Treasurer. We will discuss our third quarter results for fiscal 2018. After our commentary, we will be happy to answer any questions. 
 The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a safe harbor from civil litigation for forward-looking statements. This conference call contains forward-looking statements that reflect the company's current views as to future events and financial performance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those we may discuss. I refer you to the discussion on these points contained in our most recent filings with the SEC. 
 In a moment, we're going to share with you our third quarter results, which represent another strong quarter of execution and performance. There's a lot of noise in our results. So we'll do our best to help you decipher the performance of the business. Before diving into the numbers though, we thought it fitting to recognize that yesterday was the anniversary of the closing of G&K Services deal. The past year has been quite transformative for Cintas. Our employees, whom we call partners, including our partners who came to us from G&K, have done some great foundational work over the last year to position us for success going forward. We remain as excited as ever about our future. 
 In early February, we were thrilled to be able to share with our partners a onetime cash payment. The timing couldn't have been better for us given the work done during the past year since March 21 of 2017. As our Chairman and CEO, Scott Farmer, indicated in today's press release, the recently passed U.S. tax reform legislation is good for Cintas, our shareholders and our customers. And again, our success wouldn't have been possible without our motivated and engaged partners, and we were excited to share it with them. 
 Moving on to our third quarter results. Our revenue for the third quarter, which ended February 28, was $1,589,000,000, an increase of 26.6% over last year's third quarter. The organic revenue growth rate, which adjusts for the impacts of acquisitions and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, was 7.8%. The organic revenue growth rate for the Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment was 6.5%, and the organic growth rate of the First Aid and Safety Services segment was 10%. 
 Reported operating income for the third quarter of $200 million compare to $192 million in last year's third quarter. However, there are some items worth noting that impacted the comparability of results year-over-year. First, our operating income was reduced $10 million in the third quarter of fiscal '18 and $9 million in the third quarter of fiscal '17 by transaction and integration expenses related to the G&K Services acquisition. Second, operating income in the third quarter of fiscal '18 was also reduced by the onetime cash payment to Cintas partners that I just mentioned, which amounted to an expense of approximately $40 million. Excluding these 2 items, our third quarter operating income was approximately $250 million or 15.7% of revenue. This measurement is consistent with the way in which we reported our first 2 quarters of this fiscal year. Keep in mind that operating income includes $12 million of intangible asset amortization expense from the purchase price accounting of the G&K deal and $5 million of incremental depreciation and implementation costs of our enterprise resource planning system, SAP. These 2 items total 1.2% of revenue. 
 Reported net income from continuing operations for the third quarter of $296 million increased 152.9% from last year's third quarter. Reported earnings per diluted share, or EPS, from continuing operations for the third quarter were $2.66 compared to $1.06 in last year's third quarter. Again, there were a handful of items that impacted the comparability of net income and EPS results to prior year: First, fiscal '18 and fiscal '17 third quarter EPS included a negative impact of $0.06 from G&K transaction and integration expenses. Second, fiscal '18 third quarter EPS also included a negative impact of $0.24 from the onetime cash payment to Cintas partners. Lastly, more than offsetting these negative impacts was a significant benefit to EPS of $1.59 from the benefits of the new Tax Act. Excluding these items, to provide better visibility to financial performance, net income dollars increased 24.1% and net income margin was 9.6% compared to 9.8% last year, and EPS increased 22.3%. Note again that net income includes intangible asset amortization expense from the purchase price accounting of the G&K deal and incremental depreciation and implementation cost of SAP. These 2 items, net of tax, total 0.8% of revenue or $0.12. 
 In addition to strong execution on the fundamentals, our third quarter was one of solid progress on 2 important long-term investments: G&K and SAP. The integration of G&K remains on track. We have now closed 60 duplicate operations, which is 95% of the total planned closures. Also, 59% of G&K locations have been converted to the Cintas operating system. This is an increase from 47% at the end of the second quarter. The system conversions are very important as they are necessary for us to achieve numerous operational synergies. These activities helped us in the third quarter to realize about $15 million in synergies, which is in line with our expectations. Regarding SAP, significant advancement continues in our implementation, which remains on schedule. In our third quarter, 24 operations were converted. A total of 79 operations have now been converted to date, which is about 25% of the total planned. 
 As I have previously detailed, we have several third quarter items, including the benefit of tax reform, that make the comparability of our full fiscal year results to prior year complex. Rather than provide full fiscal year guidance, we believe it's more beneficial, for the sake of simplicity, to provide specific guidance for our fourth quarter of fiscal '18. We expect fourth quarter revenue to be in the range of $1,625,000,000 to $1,645,000,000. I want to reiterate a point we have made in the past: In our upcoming fourth quarter, we will lap the 1-year anniversary of the acquisition of G&K. For the first time, G&K's growth will be organic as opposed to inorganic. In the fourth quarter, we will report an organic growth rate that is the combination of a strongly growing Cintas legacy business and a significantly sized acquired G&K business that historically grew slower than Cintas and that will have declined year-over-year in the fourth quarter. We expect this lower organic growth rate to be temporary just as it was for our First Aid and Safety segment after it acquired ZEE Medical. With the investment in selling resources having already been made to grow the G&K business, we expect the total Uniform Rental and Facility Services organic growth rate to accelerate as we move through fiscal 2019. 
 For our fiscal 2018 quarter, we expect EPS from continuing operations to be in the range of $1.64 to $1.69. Guidance assumes a fourth quarter tax rate of 24%. We anticipate healthy fourth quarter operating margins in excess of last year's fourth quarter. Note that while the EPS guidance excludes any future G&K transaction and integration expenses, we do expect that these expenses will be incurred in the fourth quarter as we continue to integrate this significant acquisition. We estimate that these expenses will range from $10 million to $15 million. 
 I will now turn the call over to Paul. 
Paul Adler: Thank you, Mike. First, please note that our fiscal third quarter contained the same number of workdays, 64, as the prior year third quarter. However, on a sequential basis, it had one less workday than the second quarter. One less workday in a quarter adds an impact of approximately 50 basis points on operating margin due to many large expenses, including rental material cost, depreciation expense and amortization expense being determined on a monthly basis instead of on a workday basis. Our upcoming fiscal fourth quarter will contain 66 days, the same number of days as the fourth quarter of the prior fiscal year. 
 We have 2 reportable operating segments: Uniform Rental and Facility Services; and First Aid and Safety Services. The remainder of our business is included in All Other. All Other consists of Fire Protection Services and our Uniform Direct Sale business. First Aid and Safety Services and All Other are combined and presented as Other Services on the income statement. 
 Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segment includes the rental and servicing of uniforms, mats and towels and the provision of restroom supplies and other facility products and services. The segment also includes the sale of items from our catalogs to our customers on route. Uniform Rental and Facility Services revenue was $1,284,000,000, an increase of 30.0% compared to last year's third quarter. Excluding the impact of acquisitions and foreign currency exchange rate changes, the organic growth rate was 6.5%. Our Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment gross margin was 44.1% for the third quarter compared to 45.1% in last year's third quarter. The reduction in margin is attributable to the inclusion in this year's third quarter of the lower margin G&K business. The margin of the G&K business has continued to decline as the top line has lowered. In addition, we continue to incur the typical conversion costs, which impact margins in the short term. While the assimilation of the G&K business continues at a great pace -- Mike mentioned 95% of duplicate operations have been closed, more work remains. The G&K gross margins will improve to Cintas legacy levels as we further integrate this business and we increasingly realize more of the synergies. We are on track. 
 Our First Aid and Safety Services operating segment includes revenue from the sale and servicing of first aid products, safety products and training. This segment's revenue for the third quarter was $137 million, which was 10.5% higher than last year's third quarter. On an organic basis, the growth rate for the segment was 10.0%. This segment's gross margin was 46.9% in the third quarter compared to 44.8% in last year's third quarter, an increase of 210 basis points. The third quarter was another outstanding quarter for this business. Strong new business wins and expanding gross margins are evidence of the value businesses of all types place on having Cintas manage their first aid and training programs to help keep their employees healthy, safe and ready for the workday. 
 Our Fire Protection Services and Uniform Direct Sale businesses are reported in the All Other category. The Uniform Direct Sales business long-term growth rates are generally low single digits and are subject to volatility, such as when we install a multimillion dollar account. Our fire business, however, continues to grow each year at a strong pace. All Other revenue was $167 million, an increase of 17.0% compared to last year's third quarter. The organic growth rate was 14.9%. All Other gross margin was 41.7% for the third quarter of this fiscal year compared to 41.2% for last year's third quarter, an increase of 50 basis points. All Other gross margin expansion was driven by the higher-margin fire business. 
 While Uniform Direct Sale business growth was strong in the third quarter, note that the business will face some difficult sales growth comparisons in the fourth quarter. Last year's fourth quarter benefited from a significant roll-out of new uniform styles for the pilots and flight attendants of Southwest Airlines. Large roll-outs such as these do not repeat each year as business typically rebrand only every 3 to 5 years or so. The benefit from Southwest last year will be a headwind of about $13 million to this year's fourth quarter revenue. 
 Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue were 30.9% in the third quarter compared to 28.6% in last year's third quarter. Please note that the onetime cash payment to Cintas partners Mike mentioned earlier was recorded in SG&A. Excluding this onetime payment, this year's third quarter SG&A as a percentage of revenue was 28.4% compared to 28.6% last year. SG&A benefited from improved receivables collections and favorable workers' compensation claims experience. On a year-to-date basis, SG&A, excluding the onetime payment, is up 50 basis points over last year. However, note that current year SG&A is negatively impacted about 100 basis points by intangible asset amortization expense resulting from the purchase price accounting of the G&K acquisition and incremental SAP depreciation and implementation costs. We are getting leverage from increased revenue covering fixed costs and making good progress on reducing general and administrative expenses as a percent of revenue. 
 As Mike stated earlier, our third quarter fiscal 2018 effective tax rate on continuing operations benefited from the new U.S. tax legislation. The benefit of the Tax Act to the third quarter EPS was $1.59. Our EPS guidance for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 assumes an effective tax rate of 24.0%. Note that the effective tax rate will fluctuate from quarter to quarter based on tax reserve builds and releases relating to discrete items, including the amount of stock compensation expense realized each period. 
 Our cash and equivalents balance as of February 28 was $152 million, and we had $33 million in marketable securities as of quarter end. Free cash flow in the first 9 months of fiscal 2018 was $464 million, an increase of $200 million or 75% from the prior year period. 
 Capital expenditures for the first 9 months of the fiscal year were $196 million. Our CapEx by operating segment for the 9-month period was as follows: $163 million in Uniform Rental and Facility Services, $21 million in First Aid and Safety and $12 million in All Other. We expect fourth quarter 2018 CapEx to be approximately $65 million.
 As of February 28, total debt was $2,722,000,000, consisting of $187 million in short-term debts and $2,535,000,000 of long-term debt. At February 28, our leverage was 2.3x debt-to-EBITDA. Overall, our cash flow remains strong, and we expect our leverage ratio to decrease to approximately 2.0x debt-to-EBITDA at May 31, 2018. 
 That concludes our prepared remarks. We are happy to answer your questions. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And we'll hear first from Manav Patnaik with Barclays. 
Gregory Bardi: This is actually Greg calling on for Manav. Just wanted to hit on G&K first if that's okay. Maybe I missed it, but could you give the revenue and growth rate you saw in the third quarter? And then maybe more broadly touch on any early signs you're seeing from a potential revenue synergy opportunity? 
J. Hansen: Third quarter revenue was slightly over $230 million, and it was down about 4.7%. I would tell you, Greg, that being able to specifically identify that G&K revenue gets harder and harder as we have, as you heard us say, closed 60 locations and now that revenue is really starting to mix in with the Cintas locations, so getting a little harder and harder to identify. But those were the estimated third quarter numbers. From a revenue synergy standpoint, we think opportunities are going to be there. We are moving somewhat slowly on that because we want to make sure that through the large disruption of closing and system conversions that we maintain a very good customer relationship, and introducing new things to them in addition to that kind of disruption gets to be overwhelming sometimes. So we're moving fairly slowly on that. I would expect it will start to see some benefit in the back half of fiscal '19 and certainly in fiscal '20. But from our standpoint today, early signs are we feel pretty good about that opportunity in the future. 
Gregory Bardi: Okay. And then from the core Cintas side, I know it's a metric we don't look at quite as much anymore, but maybe some color on what you're seeing from the net add-stops and hiring from some of your existing customers. 
Paul Adler: Yes, Greg. It's Paul. So the add-stops metric was positive. I think the only thing really of note was that we had some good lift in the dust mats area, carpeted mats. Wet and cold winters with a lot of snow, good precipitation definitely give us a little bit of a lift, but outside of that, nothing significant to add especially in terms of anything in the garment area. 
Operator: Our next question will come from Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley. 
Toni Kaplan: Just following up on the G&K, you mentioned that it was down 4.7% in the quarter. I think last quarter, you mentioned in your guidance $895 million to $915 million for the year. So I'm just wondering, is that still like a good number for the year? Or was this quarter a little bit better than what you're expecting previously? 
J. Hansen: We have been very pleased with the performance of that G&K revenue block so far, and it was a little bit better than we expected in the third quarter. And I would say we're going to be at around $920 million for the year, which is slightly better than that range that we gave last quarter. And we continue to see very positive things from not just the revenue performance but overall performance. 
Toni Kaplan: Okay, got it. And this quarter, I guess the legacy Cintas organic growth decelerated for the second quarter to 6.5%. So I just wanted to get a little bit of extra color on sort of what you're seeing in that Cintas legacy business. Like should we expect -- I guess G&K will be inorganic. So of course, the fourth quarter will be even lower. But just on the legacy Cintas business, is there something sort of driving the deceleration? Or is it just that the comps are getting harder? 
J. Hansen: We believe that the execution and the performance of the business is still very good. We're very pleased with it. And as you probably noticed, we increased our guidance for the fourth quarter as well. So we still feel very good about the performance. Look, in every quarter, there are puts and takes. For the first half of the year, for example, we got a little bit of an energy headwind in the third quarter. Last year's third quarter was very strong. And so there are puts and takes in every quarter, but we're still in a range where we want to be, and we feel like we're operating very efficiently throughout this fiscal year. When you think about our fourth quarter guidance, we effectively raised the bottom end about $67 million and the top end about $22 million, and again, a bit of a signal that we still feel good about the business. And generally speaking, if we hit the top of that guidance range in the fourth quarter, I would expect that the legacy Cintas business may see a little bit of an uptick in organic growth in that fourth quarter. We won't report it that way because we're co-mingling the G&K and the Cintas business, but we feel good about it. 
Operator: We'll now go to Hamzah Mazari with Macquarie Capital. 
Hamzah Mazari: The first question is just if you could give us a sense of how to think about utilization across your facilities. I realize facility capacity is measured locally versus nationally, but maybe just give us some sense how many facilities are at, say, 75% plus utilization. What's underutilized in your platform? I know you're going through a consolidation as well. So just any color where are we, utilization-wise, however you want to answer that. 
J. Hansen: Sure. Hamzah, as you mentioned, capacity is local, and there are some markets that are reaching their capacity. There are others that have plenty. When we need extra capacity, we will do certain short-term steps before building a fully new facility, like we may add a washer and a dryer to our wash alley. We may bump out our wash alley and make it even larger, and that will add capacity. And we usually do those things as we start to creep up on the capacity, and that allows us to expand the existing capacity. We'll continue to do those things we have in the last several years. But we will also add, I would say, something in the way of 2 to 4 plants per year. We have done that this fiscal year, and I would expect it will continue to do something like that into the future as we -- or if we continue to grow like we have been. Does that answer your question? 
Hamzah Mazari: Yes, that's very helpful. And then maybe any view? I know it's early days. There's low visibility. But any thoughts on the Trump tariffs and how that impacts your business either directly or indirectly and anything you're hearing from customers, anything you're hearing from your procurement guys? Just any sense, early sense of that. 
J. Hansen: Well, we didn't fare too well in the market today. I'll start by that. I -- we're not seeing things from our customers yet. That's too early to tell. Certainly, we do have some things that we source out of China. We're keeping our eyes on it and how they may be affected by the list of things that may have a tariff. But I think it's too early to tell because we really don't know what's on and what's not quite yet, so too early to tell. We're keeping our eyes on it. Our goal will be if we do see some things that may be affected into the future, our goal is to do our best to re-source or find efficiencies to offset. And I think we've done a fairly good job of that over the years. 
Hamzah Mazari: Great. Last question and I'll turn it over. Just any thoughts on how much of your marketplace is self-operated on the uniform side? And any change you're seeing in terms of outsourcing trends? Has that been pretty consistent? Any thoughts there? Appreciate it. 
J. Hansen: We haven't -- we talked a lot about the no programmer new business. So that is new customers that weren't in a uniform rental program previously. And we haven't seen a change. We're still having success in finding new businesses to put into uniform rental programs, so not much change in our third quarter relative to the previous several quarters. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We'll go to Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer. 
Scott Schneeberger: Two questions. First one, could you comment on sales force productivity? And obviously, you're progressing nicely through your integration. Could you just talk to some of the developments you've had there and what's left to go and how it's working? 
J. Hansen: We're seeing some encouraging signs, Scott. Our productivity has improved sequentially through this fiscal year, and that's with quite a few more salespeople certainly than a year ago as we brought on the G&K sales team. So we're seeing some encouraging productivity signs, but certainly, we have a ways to go. We still have productivity improvements to get, and we're confident that those will come over the course of the fourth quarter and fiscal '19. 
Scott Schneeberger: Great. I appreciate it. Then my follow-up is on CapEx. If my numbers are right, it looks like the guidance reduced by maybe $15 million or $20 million this year. If you could please correct me on that and let me know. And where is that coming from? Is that a pushout? Is there anything changing with SAP? Or if you could tell us where -- if there is a change, where it is occurring? 
J. Hansen: Yes, I think it's -- more than anything, it's timing. We do have a lot going on in terms of the G&K integration, the SAP implementation. And some projects just tend to get pushed a little bit as we move through those integrations market by market. So I would just call it timing more than anything. 
Operator: Our next question will come from Judah Sokel with JPMorgan. 
Judah Sokel: I was wondering if you can give us an update on the 4 buckets that you've talked about in the past of cost synergies, which we had talked about, $130 million to $140 million. Where -- how are we progressing on each of those? 
J. Hansen: So the -- let me start with the $15 million that we talked about in the third quarter. About half is G&A, and the other half would be in the gross margin. So from a G&A perspective, you probably saw in our third quarter that we're making some nice progress in terms of leveraging and getting that SG&A down from post-acquisition levels. So we're making some nice progress, and we have more to do. So for example, we still have an IT presence from the legacy G&K team as we continue to roll off of that system. And so there will be some additional things to come, but we've made some really nice progress. The other bucket that we talked about are our production bucket. That is the cost of running our facilities. And as you can imagine, we're in the midst of closing a number of facilities and converting. And so while we have set up a lot of those synergies, there is some inefficiency that's going on right now in our third quarter, a little bit in our second quarter, certainly a little bit more in our fourth quarter as we do the things necessary to achieve those. So for example, we're doing a pretty good job of getting those locations closed and eliminating some duplicate labor and other costs. And we'll get more efficient as we move away from the integration market by market. But the production has come along very well, and we still expect the same kind of results that we put out a year ago. From a service perspective, I haven't done much of that heavy lifting yet. That -- as we've talked about in the past, we need to get on the same systems in markets before we can really start to get into route optimization. We've started some of that in some markets. We'll continue to do that in our fourth quarter but likely, even more heavy lifting in the first half of fiscal '19. But indications are we still feel good about capturing those synergies that we talked about. And the last bucket was the sourcing bucket, and we are making progress on that area as well. As you probably know, it takes longer to recognize that because we may be able to get new sourcing and new pricing but it takes a little while to purchase it, [ sew ] it out, get it into our distribution center and get it into in-service inventory and then it starts amortizing, right. So we are making the -- some really nice progress there. It just takes more time to realize it. So all in all, Judah, I feel good about all 4 of those buckets. 
Judah Sokel: Those are really helpful color. And one other question about the 2019 comment that you guys had mentioned that you expect to see acceleration throughout the year. Is that purely a function of the G&K declines moderating and perhaps switching to growth? Or is that in the core legacy Cintas business also you're expecting some sort of pick-up in that business? 
J. Hansen: No, more than anything, it's seeing the G&K business begin to level and then start to grow and more than anything, seeing the productivity improve in our sales team that I mentioned a bit ago. 
Operator: We'll now hear from Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel. 
Shlomo Rosenbaum: Mike, are you seeing a positive impact in the business overall just from tax legislation just from your customers? Maybe any pick-up in hiring or being easier to sell? It's now been approximately 3 months. I was wondering what you're seeing on that side of it. 
J. Hansen: We're -- Shlomo, we're hearing some anecdotal things that the sentiment is good. I would say from the standpoint of impact to the P&L, probably not much yet. You still have to take the time to sell it and get people into uniform or get the mats out there. And as you know, we're kind of a weekly billing business and it takes a little time to accumulate some of that revenue. And so it just takes a little time. So I would say the impact in our third quarter has not been very significant, but sentiment seems to be pretty good. 
Shlomo Rosenbaum: So would you expect that to be a lift in future quarters? 
J. Hansen: I think certainly that if we see our customers spending some of the cash that they are getting from the tax reform, yes, I think that will be a benefit. It's hard to tell how much, but I think that will certainly be a good thing for all of us. 
Shlomo Rosenbaum: Okay, great. And then could you talk a little bit about just what drove some of the sequentially improved results in the other businesses? Is it -- what's going on in fire safety? Anything in particular that's going on you could call out? 
Paul Adler: Shlomo, in fire, nothing in particular to call out. I mean, as we mentioned in kind of our remarks, that is a business that has grown very strongly organically for some time now. And the expectation is typically high single digits, about 10%. So as Mike said, sometimes, you have some puts and takes each quarter and there might be a little bit of a volatility but nothing to call out. So it's a good, strong, growing business. And then the Direct Sale business, they did have a very strong third quarter. They did have some nice wins, nothing to the extent of a Southwest Airlines roll-out that I mentioned in my -- in the comments, but still some nice good wins. And truth be told, last year's third quarter was a little light. So they had some nice, favorable comparisons in Q3. And as we've talked about in the prepared remarks, remember that Direct Sale business will have a very difficult comp due to Southwest rolling out last year. 
Shlomo Rosenbaum: And if you don't mind, just a little housekeeping. What's the pro forma tax rate you're using for the $1.37 EPS number? 
J. Hansen: It's 32% for the quarter. And so based on where we have -- had guided you previously, there's probably about $0.06 of a tax benefit in that $1.37 that is non-U.S. tax reform related. 
Shlomo Rosenbaum: So pro forma tax rate and pretax income, you would use 32% to get down to your -- to the $1.37? 
J. Hansen: Yes. For the quarter only, not year-to-date but for the quarter only. 
Operator: Our next question will come from Andy Wittmann with RW Baird. 
Andrew J. Wittmann: Where will I start? I guess, let's talk about the $40 million payment to your partners. I assume that most of that was in the rental segment, but was there any amount that's notable that we should know for our models that was in the other segment? 
J. Hansen: It was about 2.5% of revenue in each segment, Andy. 
Andrew J. Wittmann: Okay, okay, 2.5% revenue in each segment, perfect. And then maybe just on the guidance, looking at it another way, it seems like -- well, it looks like if you adjust for the tax rate bump, it gives you about $0.25 by our estimates versus what you would've had previously. And yet, there's a pretty good guidance bump add that you've mentioned. I was just wondering -- it sounds like G&K revenue is ahead of plan. Can you maybe talk, Mike, about some of the other factors that helped you get the upside and maybe the significance of them? 
J. Hansen: The good news -- I'll start with there are 2 more workdays and that certainly is beneficial, 2 more workdays than in the third quarter, same as last year though. Year-over-year, it's the same. But sequentially, that will help us. Andy, it's continuing to sell. It is working through the integration activities. We're going to get more leverage as we go into that fourth quarter. And we've seen some really nice things in the SG&A area. So I think it's just a lot of the execution along with some healthy revenue. 
Andrew J. Wittmann: Got it. Maybe my last question is just trying to understand a little bit more detail on the characteristics of your growth in uniform rental. And you guys have answered this question about kind of add-stops, new business versus no programmers and all those things. But one of the questions I wanted to get a sense for you about is specifically on penetration of existing customers. If you were to break up that as a bucket of your gross new sales in the quarter, how significant or how much of the growth rate is based on sales to existing customers in particular, whether it's through cross-sell, upsell and maybe not including pricing? If you could just help us understand how important that is to your growth, that would be helpful. 
J. Hansen: Certainly, Andy, it's important. It's not as big of a driver as new business and really has never been, but it is important to us. And while we haven't gotten specific in terms of magnitude, quantify magnitude, it is certainly second most to the new business effort that we have. So it's an important factor. We think there are lots of opportunities remaining in that area as -- particularly as we continue to penetrate with things like Carhartt and Chef Works garments and with our Signature Series restroom products. So still a lot of opportunity left but it's an important factor. 
Andrew J. Wittmann: Maybe my last, last question. I was wondering -- you've been -- you've commented over the last couple of quarters on the pricing environment. You said it's been always competitive but you're getting some. How would you characterize the price that you realized in the third quarter versus what you've seen in the last few quarters? 
J. Hansen: No change to speak of, remains pretty competitive, but no change from the last several quarters. 
Operator: And at this time, I'd like to turn the floor back over to Mr. Mike Hansen for any additional or closing remarks. 
J. Hansen: Well, thank you very much for joining us tonight. We look forward to talking with you again in our fourth quarter call that will happen in mid-July, and have a good evening. 
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, again, that does conclude today's conference. Thank you all again for your participation. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Cintas Quarterly Earnings Results Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Mr. Mike Hansen, senior VP of Finance and Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead, sir.
Michael Hansen: Good evening, and thank you for joining us tonight. With me is Paul Adler, Cintas' Vice President and Treasurer. I am battling a little bit of a cough tonight, so I'm going to turn it over to Paul to get us through our prepared remarks.
Paul Adler: Thank you, Mike. The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a safe harbor from civil litigation for forward-looking statements. This conference call contains forward-looking statements that reflect the company's current views as to future events and financial performance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those we may discuss. I refer you to the discussion on these points contained in our most recent filings with the SEC. We are pleased to report that revenue for the second quarter, which ended November 30, was $1,606,000,000, an increase of 26.4% over last year's second quarter. The organic revenue growth rate, which adjusts for the impacts of acquisitions and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, was 7.7%. The organic revenue growth rate for the Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment was 7.3%, and the organic growth rate of the First Aid and Safety Services segment was 10.8%.  Operating income for the second quarter was $235 million compared to $200 million in last year's second quarter. Fiscal 2018 second quarter operating income was negatively impacted by $13 million of transaction and integration expenses related to the G&K Services acquisition compared to about $3 million of such expenses in the second quarter of last year. Excluding G&K transaction and integration expenses, operating income increased 21.8%.  Operating income margin, excluding G&K transaction and integration expenses, was 15.5% versus 16% last year. Current year second quarter operating margin was negatively impacted 75 basis points by intangible asset amortization expense resulting from the purchase price accounting of the G&K acquisition.  In addition, current year operating margin was negatively impacted by 25 basis points due to depreciation and implementation costs of our enterprise resource planning system, SAP. Net income and earnings per diluted share, or EPS, from continuing operations for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 were $137 million and $1.24, respectively. EPS was negatively impacted by transaction and integration expenses related to the G&K acquisition of $0.07 and $0.02 in the second quarters of fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017, respectively. Excluding these expenses, EPS was $1.31 versus $1.14 last year, a 14.9% increase. As our Chairman and CEO, Scott Farmer, was quoted in today's press release, the integration of G&K continues to proceed as planned. Our pace of closing duplicate operations increased in the second quarter. We have now closed 50 operations. Also, 47% of G&K locations have been converted to the Cintas operating system. This activity enabled us in the second quarter to realize about $14 million in synergies, almost twice the amount of synergies achieved in the first quarter, which is right in line with our expectations. In addition, significant progress was made in our implementation of SAP, which remains on schedule. A total of 55 operations have been converted from the old operating system to the new SAP system. Our second quarter was one of solid progress on 2 important investments, G&K and SAP. Meanwhile, strong execution on the day-to-day mission of profitable growth continued. The steadfast focus of our employees on helping our customers get Ready for the Workday is evidenced by the strong organic revenue and earnings per share growth rates. As a result of our second quarter results, we are increasing our annual guidance for fiscal 2018. We now expect revenue to be in the range of $6,365,000,000 to $6,430,000,000 and fiscal 2018 EPS from continuing operations to be in the range of $5.39 to $5.46. Our guidance excludes any future G&K transaction and integration expenses. It also assumes a pretax reform effective tax rate range of 31% to 33%. Note that our guidance includes the following assumptions related to the acquired G&K business, revenue of $895 million to $915 million compared to a prior year amount of $965 million; synergies of approximately $50 million to $55 million; and EPS contribution of about $0.17. While the EPS guidance does not include any future G&K transaction and integration expenses, we do expect that these expenses will be incurred in the remainder of fiscal 2018 as we continue to integrate this significant acquisition. We estimate that these expenses will range from $50 million to $60 million for the full fiscal year. I want to comment on the impact to Cintas of U.S. tax reform. There will be significant benefits. As a profitable business with the vast majority of our earnings in the United States, we have historically paid a high tax rate. The reduction in the corporate tax rate will boost Cintas' earnings and increase cash. Also, we expect many of our customers to benefit from tax reform and invest additional amounts of cash to grow their businesses. Healthy and growing customers are good, of course, for our business. Tax reform will enable us to repay debt more quickly and then have additional cash on hand for our priorities, namely, investments, acquisitions, dividends and share repurchases. The signing of the legislation by the President will be an accounting event for Cintas. We will need to revalue deferred tax liabilities.  In addition, the lower corporate tax rate will be applied January 1, resulting in a negative effective tax rate in our third quarter and a blended effective tax rate for the fiscal year. Our EPS guidance is based upon pretax reform effective tax rates of 31% to 33%, because we need more time to understand the new tax laws.  However, we do want to provide you with the results of our preliminary analysis. Under the new tax laws, we expect the effective tax rate for this full fiscal year to be in the range of 8% to 12%. We will incorporate this lower fiscal year '18 rates into our guidance over the next several months. We expect the effective tax rate for fiscal 2019 and thereafter to generally be in the range of 23% to 26%. Please note that our fiscal year 2018 contains the same number of workdays per quarter as fiscal year 2017. The number of workdays by quarter within fiscal year 2018 do differ, however, and are as follows, 66 in Q1, 65 in Q2, 64 in Q3 and 66 in Q4. One less workday in a quarter has a negative impact of approximately 50 basis points on operating margin due to many large expenses, including rental material cost, depreciation expense and amortization expense being determined on a monthly basis instead of on a workday basis. We have two reportable operating segments, Uniform Rental and Facility Services; and First Aid and Safety Services. The remainder of our business is included in All Other. All Other consists of Fire Protection Services and our Uniform Direct Sale business. First Aid and Safety Services and All Other are combined and presented as Other Services on the income statement. Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segments includes the rental and servicing of uniforms, mats and towels and the provision of restroom supplies and other facility products and services. This segment also includes the sale of items from our catalogs to our customers on route. Uniform Rental and Facility Services revenue was $1,308,000,000, an increase of 30.8% compared to last year's second quarter. Excluding the impact of acquisitions and foreign currency exchange rate changes, the organic growth rate was 7.3%. Our Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment gross margin was 44.7% for the second quarter, a decrease of 20 basis points from 44.9% in last year's second quarter. A slight year-over-year margin decline results from the inclusion in this year's second quarter of a lower margin G&K business. In time, the G&K gross margins will improve to Cintas' legacy levels as we further integrate this business and we increasingly realize more of the synergies. For instance, one of the factors resulting in a lower G&K gross margin is that energy expense as a percent of revenue is much higher than the Cintas legacy business. Total segment energy expense as a percent of revenue was 20 basis points greater than in last year's second quarter. Half of the increase was due to G&K. This is the result of the smaller G&K business lacking the route density that the larger Cintas legacy business possesses. The fuel savings from route density, along with the benefit of reducing redundant capacity will drive significant improvements in G&K gross margin. Our First Aid and Safety Services operating segment includes revenue from the sale and servicing of first aid products, safety products and training. This segment's revenue for the second quarter was $139 million, which was 11.5% higher than last year's second quarter. On an organic basis, the growth rate for this segment was 10.8%. This segment's gross margin was 46.9% in the second quarter compared to 46.1% in last year's second quarter, an increase of 80 basis points. While year-over-year improvements to gross margin driven by ZEE acquisition synergies have largely been lapped, we still expect strong gross margin improvements as the business continues to grow. Our Fire Protection Services and Uniform Direct Sale businesses are reported in the All Other category. Uniform Direct Sale business long-term growth rates are generally low single digits and are subject to volatility, such as when we install a multimillion dollar account. Our Fire business, however, continues to grow each year at a strong pace. All Other revenue was $159 million, an increase of 8.9% compared to last year's second quarter. The organic growth rate was 7.8%. All Other gross margin was 42.1% for the second quarter of this fiscal year compared to 40.4% for last year's second quarter, an increase of 170 basis points. Both businesses had healthy increases in gross margin. Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue were 29.1% in the second quarter compared to 28.4% in last year's second quarter. Current year second quarter SG&A was negatively impacted 75 basis points by intangible asset amortization expense resulting from the purchase price accounting of the G&K acquisition.  In addition, current year SG&A was negatively impacted by 25 basis points due to SAP depreciation and implementation costs. The prior year second quarter did not include any depreciation expense from SAP because the project was still in the pilot phase. Our effective tax rate on continuing operations for the second quarter was 33.3% compared to 34.9% for last year's second quarter. This equates to a $0.03 benefit to EPS year-over-year. Note that the effective tax rate can fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter based on tax reserve bills and releases relating to discrete items. As stated earlier, our EPS guidance assumes a pretax reform effective tax rate range of 31% to 33%. Our cash and equivalents balance as of November 30 was $236 million, and we had $22 million of marketable securities as of quarter end. Cash flow from operating activities in the first 6 months of fiscal 2018 was $379 million and free cash flow was $246 million. Capital expenditures for the first half of the fiscal year were $132 million. Our CapEx by operating segment for the 6-month period was as follows, $111 million in Uniform Rental and Facility Services; $13 million in First Aid and Safety; and $8 million in All Other. We expect fiscal year 2018 CapEx to be in the range of $280 million to $300 million. As of November 30, total debt was $2,834,000,000, consisting of $300 million in short-term debt and $2,534,000,000 of long-term debt. At November 30, our leverage was 2.5x debt-to-EBITDA. Subsequent to quarter end on December 1, $300 million of fixed rate debt with a coupon of 6 1/8% matured. This debt was paid with cash on hand and from borrowings under our commercial paper program.  On December 8, we paid a dividend of $1.62 per share, an increase of 21.8% over last year's dividend. We have increased this dividend for 34 consecutive years. It is an important part of our capital allocation strategy and illustrates our enduring commitment to effectively deploying cash to increase shareholder value.  Overall, our cash flow remain strong, and we continue to expect our leverage ratio to decrease to approximately 2.0 to 2.2x debt-to-EBITDA at May 31, 2018. That concludes our prepared remarks. We are happy to answer your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And we'll first go to Toni Kaplan from Morgan Stanley.
Toni Kaplan: I didn't catch if you gave the G&K revenue and growth rate in the prepared remarks?
Michael Hansen: We did not, but the -- it was down about 4.4% year-over-year for the quarter, which is slightly better. You probably saw that Paul had mentioned an increased range. And so it was slightly better than what we expected, and -- but down still about 4.4%.
Toni Kaplan: Okay, that's helpful. And I wanted to ask about -- given Aramark's AmeriPride acquisition, have you seen any changes in the competitive environment yet? I know the deal hasn't closed, but just any -- are you expecting to see any impact from those 2 companies coming together? And basically, yes, just any color on that would be helpful.
Michael Hansen: Well, the deal hasn't closed, as you mentioned. And so I would say, we're -- I would expect that if we do see some impact to the industry, it won't be until after it closes. I would say, today, it's still very competitive. The environment is still very competitive and not much changed, though, from 3 months ago.
Toni Kaplan: Got it. And just lastly, in First Aid, you had another double-digit growth quarter. Can you just give us a little bit of color on how long you expect this pace of growth to hold up? And what you would consider maybe a normalized growth rate in this segment, if you think that double digit is not normalized?
Paul Adler: Well, Toni, we hope it's forever. 
Toni Kaplan: Yes, I'm sure.
Paul Adler: Certainly, the expectations for that business, First Aid, have continued to be high single digits. We still have a lot of opportunity to grow our customer base and with the safety cabinets and other products and services, got OSHA and others drive required in those cabinets. There's still plenty of good organic growth to come.
Operator: And we'll take a question from Manav Patnaik from Barclays.
Manav Patnaik: The first question was, I think you made a comment that the pace of synergies was growing faster than maybe what you expected and, I guess, that's indicated with the $14 million versus $7 million. But broadly, I guess, your guidance for the synergies for this year and for all of G&K, I guess, hasn't really changed. So I was just wondering if there was a disconnect between those 2 comments or how we should think of that?
Michael Hansen: I think Paul's comment was synergies certainly have increased and accelerated in the second quarter, but it is in line with our expectations. We certainly did expect to see that number go up. If you remember after the first quarter, we had talked about a couple dozen locations being consolidated in the first quarter, but many at the end of that first quarter. And so we were able to see the synergies from those as well as some others during the second quarter. And so it is in line with where we expected, but certainly an acceleration of what we saw on the first quarter.
Manav Patnaik: Got it. And then the comment on 47% of the G&K locations moved to Cintas operation platform and so forth. Is it fair to assume that, that 47% were probably the bigger heavy lifting locations and the remaining should be a much smoother integration? Or is that not right?
Michael Hansen: No, it really is based on our timetable geographies and markets. And so it is a combination of both small locations and large locations. Still many to do, and -- but going well.
Manav Patnaik: Okay. And then the last one I had was just on tax reform, I appreciate the color you guys gave. But I was just wondering, what if any, were some of the offsetting pieces from the legislation versus just a reduction in corporate tax rate?
Michael Hansen: When we think about that kind of an ongoing rate of 23% to 26%, there are -- there is a big benefit, obviously, from the drop in the corporate rate. However, couple of things that I might point out. There is something called a Section 199 manufacturing credit that is no longer existing, and that had a small impact on us. There is also the Section 162(m) impact, which is the loss of the deduction for any executive comp over $1 million, that certainly will have an impact. But that's about it. And certainly then for there's the onetime toll charge, if you will, related to the taxing of foreign E&P. But generally speaking, look, we're very excited about the tax reform getting done. We do certainly still need to spend some more time with all of the details. But I would say, over the course of the next couple of months, we'll likely update our guidance to give some more specific thoughts.
Operator: And we'll now go to Andy Wittmann from Baird.
Andrew Wittmann: I guess maybe my first question is on the guidance, it looks like you took the tax rate down, I think it was 34%. The last quarter here was 32%. That's an EPS help right there. Is there an implicit -- as you look at the earnings profile of the business tax reform, is there something that changed in the profitability of the business that you expected in the quarter and the outlook for the balance of the year?
Michael Hansen: Are you saying as it relates to tax reform?
Andrew Wittmann: Well, no, I mean, it looks like, I think, previous guidance for tax rate was 34% now it's 32%, that should be about $0.15 of help, I think, to EPS, all else equal. But the guide range wasn't that much, so I was just wondering what explains the difference?
Michael Hansen: Well, one thing to keep in mind is our third quarter has an additional loss of workday. But no, we think that margins for the second half of the year are still going to be pretty strong. And I wouldn't read a whole lot of detail into that other than the fact that we're kind of pleased with the quarter, and we're set up still to have a very good year in the back half of the year.
Andrew Wittmann: All right. And then I wanted to go over to the G&K for my next one, with a pretty good number of facilities of G&K on the system like you've talked in the past that getting on the system is the prerequisite to revenue synergy. I know you've said pretty consistently that those were going to take longer, but I'm just curious, are you able to start talking about selling some of that stuff, now you've got a number of locations or do they all need to be on before you can get after that?
Michael Hansen: No. When a location gets on, we can start to have training conversations and start to get into that. It's going to take a little bit of time to get the ball rolling and to create an impact. But no, once one location is on, we can start talking more about Cintas products and services. They will be available to that location from a system perspective upon conversion.
Andrew Wittmann: Can we have some contribution, you think, later here in fiscal '18?
Michael Hansen: I'm not expecting anything in fiscal '18. No.
Andrew Wittmann: And then just on the cost synergies, if this quarter was $14 million realized and approximately $7 million in the first quarter. If you just take the run rate of $14 million per quarter from the last 2 quarters, that gets me to $49 million for the year, which is pretty much at the low end of your guidance range for the year. How should we think about those cost synergies? Are you -- does it look like you could exceed the targets that you laid out? Or should we expect some level of deceleration of the cost synergies for the balance of the year?
Michael Hansen: We, I would say, there is a lot of heavy lifting to go still in the back half of the year. Our goal will be to get that synergy number to the high end of that range, certainly. But yes, there is a possibility that we can exceed that. I would say that that's more of a timing thing than a increase to the entire range of 130 to 140. But I think there's an opportunity for that as long as we continue to execute well.
Operator: And our next question comes from Scott Schneeberger from Oppenheimer.
Scott Schneeberger: Guys, just curious, some little items in the quarter. There was talk about the hurricane last quarter. Could you just give us an update, and I believe what you had said last time was it would have an impact on revenue by $10 million to $15 million and EPS 5 to 8. Can you just kind of give us a little bit more clarity? And then I'll follow up with the next one in a second.
Paul Adler: Yes, Scott. That was our estimates at the time. You got that correct. And we said of the $10 million to $15 million, about half of that would be in Q2. Fortunately, we were always in good shape. We had mentioned on the last call that we didn't have much damage to our facilities, and we were able to be up and running. So it was just dependent upon how quickly the customers could get back up and running. But pleasantly to our surprise, they get up and running pretty quickly. And instead of, what, $5 million to $7 million top line impact in the quarter, it was only about $1 million. And then for the remaining 2 quarters, $1 million is probably top line at most. So good news is this turned out to be really a nonevent from the headwind to the top line.
Scott Schneeberger: Okay. And I mean, you guys had a good quarter and revenue guidance went up for the year more than what you did in the outperformance versus at least our estimate in the quarter. I'm guessing, this contributed and was a sizable factor to that, that increased revenue?
Paul Adler: No, I don't know if it was sizable. But yes, I mean, certainly, based upon our last guide, as I said, we expected maybe $5 million to $7 million of headwinds and it was only -- in the second quarter, it was only about $1 million. So yes, $4 million, $5 million of benefits but certainly the top line we see was much more than that.
Michael Hansen: Yes, and I think, Scott, as I mentioned, the G&K revenue was a little bit better than we had expected. And our own -- the legacy organic growth continues to perform well.
Scott Schneeberger: Great. I'm curious just kind of a two-pronger for the last question. The tax reform, you mentioned, the 23% to 26% tax rate in fiscal '18 and thereafter. But I had heard that you will have some deferred tax liabilities being revalued. And I thought I heard that you may even have a negative tax rate in the fiscal third quarter. So that's -- when you speak of the 23% to 26%, it's actually going to be lower for the year in fiscal '18 when that gets factored in the third quarter impact. Is that right?
Michael Hansen: Yes. The range that Paul gave was 8% to 12% for fiscal '18 because of that revaluation of the deferred tax balances. So when you think about the -- if President Trump signs this on January 3, that creates an accounting event for us. We revalue deferred taxes. We have to -- we book the toll charge. And there may be other smaller adjustments that have to be booked, but the impact of the deferred tax reevaluation -- and keep in mind, all those deferred taxes are recorded at a 35% tax rate today and they will go down to 21%. That is a significant benefit or, let's call it, reduction in deferred taxes. And that will create the negative in the third quarter. But thereafter '18, the idea was, look, that's going to be disruption, no question about it at the time in the third quarter. But thereafter, we expect that 23% to 26% as kind of a normalized rate. Now clearly, there are always discrete events that happened like audits and other items that may cause us to move below or above that range at times, but that's kind of what we're thinking in terms of an ongoing rate.
Scott Schneeberger: Got it. That's helpful. Yes, I totally missed the 8% to 12%, so thanks on that. And just the last part of the question, you did alluded to the benefits, obviously, this will have for your customers and for you. Could you kind of talk about a priority thought process of how you may use the excess cash benefit that you'll get from this tax reform event?
Michael Hansen: Well, we're certainly evaluating that, Scott. I would say that when you think about the cash flow that we've generated in the past, our first priority is to invest in our business. And that's investing in our business, in our employees, whom we call partners, but then also in capital expenditures, et cetera. That is always our first priority. The second priority is we will continue to look for M&A opportunities when they make sense at the right value. We will likely continue to look at dividend increases and then share buyback. So I would say that our prioritization hasn't changed much, but certainly, this is the new wrinkle that we're going to need to spend some time on in terms of both short-term and long-term. And we're -- we don't want to make any quick decisions on that. That's an important opportunity and we're going to take the time we need.
Operator: And we'll now go to Andrew Steinerman from JPMorgan.
Andrew Steinerman: What's the implied organic constant currency revenue growth for the total company in the second half of the year? And has that changed from a quarter ago? Or is the dollar revenue increased mostly around G&K doing a little bit better?
Michael Hansen: It's a little bit of both now. Andrew, when we think about organic growth, keep in mind, our third quarter will be the same kind of organic growth calculation that we've been under for the first 2 quarters, and the fourth quarter is going to be impacted by the G&K deal being lapped, right. So we are -- it's just simply a math problem. We are going to see organic growth drop in the fourth quarter. So to answer your question about the guidance, it's a little bit of both. It's a little bit of nice performance in our legacy organic businesses, especially our First Aid and Safety. And it's also a little bit of nice performance in the G&K revenue. I would suggest that we're going to have another quarter of relatively normalized, if you will, organic growth in the third. It's going to come down in the fourth, just simply because we've lapped that and that's the way the math works. We then expect to see as we move in to '19, that organic growth begin to accelerate back to Cintas levels.
Operator: Our next question comes from John Healy from Northcoast Research.
John Healy: I wanted to ask just a philosophical question for you guys about pricing. With the comments that you made about tax reform it's clear that your customer should be in a better spot in '19. I was curious to know if you guys -- if you could remind me, if you do most of your price increases at the calendar level, or just simply when the contract comes up on an annual basis? And I was just trying to think about how you've approached price in the last couple of years, and does what you see in the economy cause you to be more confident and maybe pursue more pricing than maybe you have over the last couple of years?
Michael Hansen: Well, I would say that the pricing environment is very competitive. It remains that way. But as I've said in the last several quarters, it seems to be constructive still. We probably have more price increases during the close of the beginning of our fiscal year, but that's not all customers, but probably a little bit more in that beginning of the fiscal year. In terms of our philosophy, it's a conversation about the value that we're providing to all of our customers. And so it is a customer-by-customer conversation about the wear and tear of the garments, the different products and services that we're providing, the service component, et cetera. And so it's a lot of different things that go into pricing.
John Healy: Makes sense. And I want to ask you a question about kind of investments into the business. When you look at acquisitions, clearly, Aramark's doing a big deal with AmeriPride. When you guys get down to that 2x leverage or so, call it, 6 months from now, do you think that you're capable from a FTC standpoint to pursue acquisitions of that type of size? And do you feel like you're kind of limited in terms of the size of assets that you can pursue post G&K?
Michael Hansen: Well, if we're speaking about specifically the Uniform Rental business, look, we'll take a look at all opportunities that are available to us. And do I think that we'd be able to do a large deal? I think it really would depend on that specific opportunity, and there could be some challenges. Our goal would be to take a look at it and evaluate how we feel about those challenges. And so, John, look, that's a -- to say whether or not we could. I think it just depends on the opportunity, but any big deal will likely come with some challenges.
Operator: Now we will go to Hamzah Mazari from Macquarie.
Mario Cortellacci: This is Mario Cortellacci, I'm filling in for Hamzah. Actually to piggyback off the last question. If there is further consolidation in the space, can we expect better pricing? Or what would that look like?
Michael Hansen: Well, look, I mentioned that the pricing environment is fairly competitive today. It's been that way for many years, maybe a little bit more constructive in the last couple years. But I don't expect that to change. I think it will continue to be very competitive because there are many players both local, regional and national. And there are -- not everyone has to rent uniforms. And so I think there is -- we have to continue to show that we can provide a good value. But I think it's going to continue to be competitive. I don't see it changing much because of the Aramark/AmeriPride deal.
Mario Cortellacci: Okay. And then, I know you've already touched on this in the past as well. But could you frame for us, I guess, how are you thinking about the longer-term benefits of the SAP implementation?
Michael Hansen: Sure. We love that the information that this system will provide to us once we are -- once we have our entire business on. It allows us to much more quickly see opportunities that exist to look at industry specifics and be able to better target prospects, target existing customers for different types of products and services. And so more than anything, the information, we believe, will allow our salespeople and our service people to be more productive and efficient.
Operator: And we'll now go to Gary Bisbee from RBC Capital Markets.
Gary Bisbee: Let me take another -- a different approach to the pricing. This has always been a competitive industry, you've acknowledged that regularly. What is the risk that some of the tax reform savings that the industry will earn gets competed away, think about an after-tax return as their margin or whatever is their focus. Is that -- do you see that as a risk? Is that -- any thoughts on that at this point?
Michael Hansen: I think it's too early to tell, Gary. Certainly, that could throw a little bit of a wrinkle into the way our products and services are priced in the marketplace. We're going to have to keep our eyes on that and see how it plays out. But I think it's a little early, but certainly that we're going to keep our eyes on it. It is something that could add a little bit of a wrinkle.
Gary Bisbee: Okay. All right. And then staying on the tax theme for just one more question. Does -- I realize it's early, but does the outline of the plan have you thinking any differently about your investment plans? I realize you've got a ton of stuff going on and probably the first thing to do is pay down the debt. But as you think out over the next couple of years, would it make you more likely to invest, to raise wages to hire people more quickly to accelerate investment projects? Or not really?
Michael Hansen: Yes, I think, Gary, that all those things are likely on the table. We're going to evaluate, and we are going to -- we, first and foremost, we are long-term operators. And so, we're -- the first thing that we will do is evaluate how best this can make us stronger for the long-term. And there could be some short-term decisions because of that, there could be some longer-term decisions. But I think -- this is -- look, it's a new day, and we're going to have to get busy evaluating how to invest, how to best invest this benefit. But I don't have any answer. It's just -- it's not even signed yet, and we need to spend a little bit more time with it, but it certainly will have an impact.
Gary Bisbee: Fair enough. And then have you put any thought yet to the CapEx ability to immediately deduct CapEx? It would seem to me likely that your cash flow would be -- have a meaningful benefit from that and that's your cash conversion, a percent of net income or however you want to look at it would likely improve at least for the next five years. Is it right to assume most of your CapEx would likely be eligible? Or is it also too soon to have a view on that?
Michael Hansen: I believe that, that certainly will benefit us. Gary, I need to spend a little bit more time on the specifics of those rules. But, yes, I think it certainly could create an improved cash flow because of that immediate expensing over the next 5 years. But I'm -- I -- we need to do a little bit more research on exactly the CapEx that we have that qualifies, but I like it. And I think it's going to be positive for us.
Gary Bisbee: Okay. And then just one non-tax one to close it out for me. Talk about the -- just how the math will work in accelerating organic growth once you lap G&K. What are the key factors that then get the reacceleration back towards the normal Cintas level? Is it that you've been hiring salespeople in their territories? Although, I would think those would overlap with your territories, is it more of the cross-sell impact? Or just that, that business is flattening out at some point and then the rest of the base is growing? Just trying to think through [indiscernible]
Michael Hansen: Yes. Gary, I think it's all three of those. First of all, the revenue itself is going to bottom out, and that -- or that the decrease is going to stop, probably in our fourth quarter. But we have hired. We -- first of all, we brought on many legacy G&K salespeople for the open positions that they had. We have been hiring and training, and we saw some nice improvements in productivity from the first quarter to the second. And we like what we see so far. So -- and as you probably know, Gary, with our business, we sell many small accounts every single week and it takes a little bit of time for all of those small accounts to accumulate over time. And so as we think about fiscal '19, we will enter that fiscal year with a little bit better new business momentum from that block of salespeople. We will have seen the bottom of the trough in terms of the revenue overall. And then lastly, yes, we're going to start to see some benefits of cross-sell and penetration into those customers. I don't believe we'll see any impact in fiscal '18. But fiscal '19, we should start to see some impact. I think the biggest thing is really the new business effort, though, that will get back on track after about a year of those legacy G&K salespeople seeing a reverse momentum because of the announcement of the acquisition and then the retraining, et cetera.
Operator: Our next question comes from David Stratton from Great Lakes Review.
David Stratton: I couldn't tell, I don't know if you said or not, did you give a legacy Cintas gross margin number for the quarter?
Michael Hansen: We did not, David. We have consolidated a number of those operations into the legacy Cintas locations, it becomes very, very difficult to separate what was from a gross margin perspective, what was legacy Cintas versus what was legacy G&K.
David Stratton: Got you. And then, if you would talk for a minute about energy impacts you saw in the quarter and then what you see the rest of the year shaping up like in regard to energy costs and your customers in that field?
Michael Hansen: Well, for the second quarter, we saw total overall energy rate of 2.2% of revenue. I would say for the second half of the year, maybe a slight increase, flattish to slight increase. Did that answer your question?
David Stratton: Yes. And then I guess -- yes. No, that's good.
Paul Adler: David, on the top line, I think you mentioned our customers, too, in that business. And we do watch the rig counts as an indicator of how things are performing and we definitely have seen stabilization in that customer base. And we've talked about that from last quarter to that and we kind of lapped all that. So it's stable, but we haven't seen a lot of growth in the customer base fueling that line of garments, flame resistant type garments.
Operator: And we will now go to Tim Mulrooney from William Blair.
Timothy Mulrooney: Last quarter, you were at $7 million in synergies. Some of the major activities were converting the payroll system into financial system, reducing functions of the former headquarters at G&K and consolidating a few dozen branches. But are there any other major activities this quarter to get you that $14 million synergy figure? Or is this mainly just continuing to benefit from the actions outlined last quarter?
Michael Hansen: Yes. It's primarily those that you just mentioned. So the continued reduction of the corporate G&A and getting almost a full quarter now of many of those savings, it is the benefits of the consolidation of a number of locations. So yes, it is all of those things. As we move forward, the items that are really left are continuing to convert to systems and to look at the sourcing opportunities that are out there because as we've talked in the past, we're still using much legacy G&K inventory, and so we need to burn through that. And once we burn through that, we'll start to then order through the Cintas supply chains. We expect that, that will create some saving opportunities.
Timothy Mulrooney: Okay. You talked about material sourcing, is there perhaps also some room for density saving on the energy side, I mean, you said energy was 2.2% of sales today. I mean, what could that get to, could that get to below 2% at some point?
Michael Hansen: Well, look, a lot of that depends on gas prices of the day. But I think Paul mentioned, if we were -- well, I'll say it this way, for that G&K block of business, that fuel is about 3% of revenue. And so there is an opportunity to pull that down, certainly. And as we have converted the system and we then begin the route optimization process, that allows us to do some rerouting and get those savings. So you are right, Tim. That will start to come over the next several quarters as we complete those kind of integration plans. Could it get below 2% in today's environment? I would say, it's -- I don't think so. I think it probably could come down 10 to 20 basis points as a company. But again, I would think about it from the standpoint of we can get that 3% down to probably something closer to 2% for that block of business.
Timothy Mulrooney: Got it. Okay. And then staying on synergies, maybe just a couple more. Did you say that you closed 50 facilities since the acquisition was closed, Mike?
Michael Hansen: Yes, we did.
Timothy Mulrooney: But I think you were at about 420 locations following the deal closing. Is that -- I mean, just simple math, are you at about 370 today?
Michael Hansen: I haven't looked at that. I believe your math, but I haven't specifically looked at that, but it sounds reasonable.
Timothy Mulrooney: Yes, not important. I was just curious, I guess. And then on the $14 million in synergies today, is that then split pretty evenly between SG&A and the consolidation of facilities? That 50 was a little bit higher than I was expecting. And you still expect that $50 million to $55 million by the end of 2018 to be majority SG&A?
Michael Hansen: For the quarter, yes, Tim, you were correct that it's pretty close to a 50-50 split in terms of SG&A versus gross margin. By the end of the year, I think it's going to start to tilt towards gross margin as we get more and more of the benefits of consolidation of locations and that the system conversion and route optimization. So I think we will start to tilt more heavily towards the gross margin.
Operator: And we'll now go to Sean Egan from KeyBanc Capital Markets.
Sean Egan: Just one quick one for me. I'm just curious if you can talk about any difference in the performance of G&K locations, those 47% on Cintas systems and the balance off in light of the 4.4% revenue decline within the legacy G&K? Just wondering if you're seeing any clear differential yet.
Michael Hansen: No. No, we're not, Sean. I think, the issue is as we move any location, whether it's a legacy Cintas or G&K, there is disruption during that period of implementation -- I'm sorry, of conversion, system conversion. And if you're comparing a converted location to one that hasn't converted, that one that hasn't converted hasn't had any disruption yet. And so we're still so early in that system conversion process that we're seeing, certainly, some impact of the disruption. But nothing -- I would say we're not seeing anything that is material in terms of the separation of performance at this point.
Operator: And we'll take a follow-up question from Andy Wittmann from Baird.
Andrew Wittmann: Great. And I wanted to talk just a little bit more about kind of the top line in both your key businesses. But in rental, Mike, can you comment a little bit on add-stop and the characteristics of the new business that you're bringing in, whether it's tilted to new folks or competitive wins and even a comment on retention? Similar questions really for the First Aid business, I mean, the growth rate is really impressive and I'm just wondering if that's being brought into new customers or is that more of a penetration focus there?
Paul Adler: Yes. Andy, on the add-stops, the add-stops metric is positive, but it's typically positive at this time of the year. Nothing really remarkable in it to speak of. Still the main drivers of growth are new business and penetration. So to answer your question specifically about anything changing, not really. It's still been consistent in terms of retention and pricing as well. So no significant changes there. And then, First Aid, yes, again, we were talking earlier about the expectation of that growing high single digits, and it's still a good mix of brand new customers, who value the service and want us to handle the compliance for them and provide a benefit to their employees, but also some good penetration. We continue to evolve in that business to offer more and more ancillary products and services like that safety cabinets and other things that we can put in there and a lot around safety and training. That's becoming a significant part of the revenue base, whether it's a training on materials handling or training and the safety training on CPR. That becomes -- continuously becomes a significant portion of the overall revenue.
Michael Hansen: Andy, we're about 18 months from a fairly good sized investment in salespeople in that First Aid and Safety business, if you remember, kind of coming out of the ZEE integration process. And we're just -- we're seeing some real nice productivity out of our new sales partners.
Operator: And there are no further questions. I'll turn the conference back over to you, Mike, for any additional or closing remarks.
Michael Hansen: Thank you very much for joining us tonight and season's greetings to all. We'll issue our third quarter earnings in March and we look forward to speaking with you again at that time. Thank you.
Operator: This does conclude our presentation for today. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good day everyone, and welcome to the Cintas Quarterly Earnings Results Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Mike Hansen, Senior Vice President of Finance and Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead.
Mike Hansen: Good evening and thank you for joining us. With me is Paul Adler, Cintas' Vice President and Treasurer. We will discuss our first quarter results for fiscal 2018. After our commentary, we will be happy to answer any questions. The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a Safe Harbor from civil litigation for forward-looking statements. This conference call contains forward-looking statements that reflect the Company's current views as to future events and financial performance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those we may discuss. I refer you to the discussion on these points contained in our most recent filings with the SEC. Before getting into our financial results, I want to take this opportunity to recognize our employees whom we call partners, impacted by the major hurricanes striking Texas, Florida, Puerto Rico, and surrounding areas. Many of our partners suffered significant losses in these natural disasters. Our thoughts and prayers go out to them. In addition, we thank them for their dedication to the company as they continue to tend to the business and needs of our customers despite the impact to their personal lives. Finally, we are grateful to the many Cintas partners who have helped their fellow partners in need via donations of money, clothing, personnel care and time. In true Cintas spirit you were ready and eager to help. We are pleased to report that revenue for the first quarter which ended August 31 was $1.611 billion, an increase of 27.2% over last year's first quarter. The organic growth rate, which adjusts for the impacts of acquisitions and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, was 8.3%. New business wins, penetration of existing customers with more products and services, and customer retention remains strong. The organic growth rate for the Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment was 8.1% and the organic growth rate of the First Aid and Safety Services segment was 11.9%. First quarter gross margin improved 40 basis points to 45.9% from 45.5% last year. This is our 16th consecutive quarter of year-over-year gross margin improvement. We believe that this quarter's increasing gross margin over prior year is particularly noteworthy because it was realized despite the headwind of adding the G&K business at a considerably lower gross margin. The Cintas legacy gross margins continued to expand and the G&K gross margins will too as we realize the acquisition synergies. Operating income for the first quarter of $249 million increased 22.1% from last year's first quarter. Fiscal '18 first quarter operating income was negatively impacted by $4 million of transaction and integration expenses related to the G&K Services acquisition compared to about $3 million of such expenses in the first quarter of last year. Excluding G&K transaction and integration expenses, operating income increased 22.4% to a margin of 15.7% versus 16.3% last year. The 60 basis point decrease in the operating margin is due to an increase in selling and administrative expenses as a percent of revenue. Intangible asset amortization expense increased about 75 basis points over last year's first quarter due to the G&K acquisition, another year-over-year impact is a 20 basis point increase in depreciation expense because of SAP. Net income and earnings per diluted share or EPS from continuing operations for the first quarter of fiscal '18 were $161 million and $1.45, respectively. EPS was negatively impacted by transaction and integration expenses related to the G&K acquisition of $0.03 and $0.02 in the first quarter's of fiscal '18 and fiscal '17, respectively. Excluding these expenses, EPS was $1.48 versus $1.26, a 17.5% increase. As a result of our first quarter results, we are increasing our annual guidance for fiscal 2018. We now expect revenue to be in the range of $6.325 billion to $6.400 billion and fiscal '18 EPS from continuing operations to be in the range of $5.30 to $5.38. Our guidance excludes any future G&K transaction and integration expenses. The guidance does, however, include our preliminary estimates of the negative impact from the hurricanes. Based on early -- our early assessment, we estimate fiscal '18 revenue to be reduced by approximately $10 million to $15 million and EPS to be reduced by about $0.05 to $0.08. These estimates are subject to change as more information becomes available. Again this EPS guidance does not include any future G&K transaction and integration expenses. However, we do expect that these expenses will be incurred in the remainder of fiscal '18 as we continue to integrate the significant acquisition. We estimate that these expenses will range from $50 million to $65 million for the full fiscal year. As our Chairman and CEO Scott Farmer was quoted in today's earnings press release, the integration of G&K continues to proceed as expected. We are pleased with our performance. We remain on track to meet the acquisitions financial and nonfinancial objectives. Our guidance includes the following assumptions related to the acquired G&K business. Revenue to be in the range of $885 million to $905 million compared to a prior year amount run rate of about $965 million. Synergies of approximately $50 million to $55 million and an EPS contribution of $0.15 to $0.17. I will now turn the call over to Paul for additional details.
Paul Adler: Thank you, Mike. First, please note that our fiscal year 2018 contains the same number of work days per quarter as fiscal year 2017. The number of work days by quarter within fiscal year 2018 do differ however and are as follows. 66 in Q1, 65 in Q2, 64 in Q3, and 66 in Q4. One less workday in a quarter had a negative impact of approximately 50 basis points on operating margin due to many large expenses including rental material cost, depreciation expense, and amortization expense being determined on a monthly basis instead of a workday basis. We have two reportable operating segments, Uniform Rental and Facility Services and First Aid and Safety Services. The remainder of our business is included in all other. All other consists of Fire Protection Services and our Uniform Direct Sale business. First Aid and Safety Services and all other are combined and presented as other services on the income statement. The Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segment includes the rental and servicing of uniforms, mats and towels and the provision of restroom supplies and other facility products and services. The segment also includes the sale of items from our catalogues to our customers on route. Uniform Rental and Facility Services revenue was $1.311 billion, an increase of 31.9% compared to last year's first quarter. Excluding the impact of acquisitions and foreign currency exchange rate changes, the organic growth rate was 8.1%. Our Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment gross margin was 46.1% for the first quarter, an increase of 10 basis points from 46.0% in last year's first quarter. As Mike touched upon earlier, there is more to the performance here than meets the eye. Last quarter when we were still able to separate the performance of the G&K business from the legacy Cintas business, we noted that the G&K gross margin was 40.2%. Also when excluding the G&K business, last quarter's legacy Cintas Uniform Rental and Facility Services business gross margin improved 100 basis points. Considering the fact that we have only just begun to recognize synergies from the acquisition, and those synergies realized to date are mostly general and administrative in nature as opposed to benefit in gross margin. Gross margin performance is similar in this first quarter as it was in the previous quarter, meaning excluding the G&K business, there was healthy improvement year-over-year in the gross margin of the legacy Cintas Uniform Rental and Facility Services business. As previously stated, the G&K gross margin will improve to Cintas legacy levels as we realize the synergies from the acquisition. For instance, one of the factors resulting in a currently lower G&K gross margin is that energy expense as a percent of revenue is much higher than the Cintas legacy business. This is the result of the smaller G&K business lacking the route density that the larger Cintas legacy business possesses. The fuel savings from route density along with the benefit of reducing redundant capacity will drive significant improvements in G&K gross margin over time. Our First Aid and Safety Services operating segment includes revenue from the sale and servicing of first aid products, safety products and training. This segment's revenue for the first quarter was $140 million, which was 12.6% higher than last year's first quarter. On an organic basis, the growth rate for the segment was 11.9%. This segment's gross margin was 47.5% in the first quarter compared to 45.8% in last year's first quarter, an increase of 170 basis points. Our margins continue to benefit from the realization of ZEE acquisition synergies, including improved sourcing and the leveraging of existing warehouses. In addition to the strong year-over-year performance, it is exciting to see the improvement of the gross margin percentage from pre-ZEE acquisition levels. In the quarter before the ZEE acquisition, the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2015, the segments gross margin was 46.8%. In the first quarter of fiscal 2018 the margin is 70 basis points higher. This is do not only to the realization of the ZEE acquisition synergies, but also to continued strong execution in both sales and operations that ensures growth in both the top and bottom line. Our Fire Protection Services and Uniform Direct Sale businesses are reported in the all other category. All other revenue was $159 million, an increase of 7.9% compared to last year's first quarter. The organic growth rate was 6.3%. All other gross margin was 42.5% for the first quarter of this fiscal year compared to 42.1% for last year's first quarter, an increase of 40 basis points. The Uniform Direct Sale business by its nature is not the recurring revenue stream that our other businesses are, such as uniform rental and facility services and first aid. Therefore the growth rates are generally low single-digit and are subject to volatility such as when we install a multimillion dollar account. Our fire business, however, continues to grow at a rapid pace. The fire business organic growth rate was just shy of 10% and operating margins expanded. Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue were 30.2% in the first quarter compared to 29.2% in last year's first quarter, about 75 of the 100 basis point increase is attributable to the amortization expense of the intangible assets established and the purchase price accounting of the G&K acquisition. Also SAP expense was up 20 basis points year-over-year. The prior year first quarter do not include any depreciation expense from SAP, because the project was still in the pilot phase. Our effective tax rate on continuing operations for the first quarter was 26.5% compared to 28.2% for last year's first quarter. The effective tax rate can fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter based on tax reserve builds and releases relating to discrete items. We expect the effective tax rate for fiscal 2018 to be about 34%. Our cash and equivalents balance as of August 31 was $191 million and we had $21 million of marketable securities as of quarter end. Cash flow from operating activities in the fiscal 2018 first quarter was $254 million and free cash flow was $191 million. Capital expenditures for the first quarter were approximately $62 million. Our CapEx by operating segment was as follows: $51 million in Uniform Rental and Facility Services, $7 million in First Aid and Safety, and $4 million in all other. We expect fiscal year 2018 CapEx to be in the range of $280 million to $320 million. As of August 31, total debt was $2.841 billion consisting of $307 million in short-term debt and $2.534 billion of long-term debt. In the first quarter of fiscal 2018, $293 million of debt was repaid. At August 31, our leverage was 2.5x debt to EBITDA. We expect our leverage ratio to decrease to approximately 2.0x to 2.2x debt to EBITDA at May 31, 2018. That concludes our prepared remarks. We're happy to answer your question.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And we will take our first question from Gary Bisbee with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Jay Hanna: Hey, guys. This is actually Jay Hanna for Gary today.
Mike Hansen: Hi, Jay.
Jay Hanna: Just a quick question with regard to the G&K integration costs. Should we expect these to fall at the low end of the range given the $4 million seen in this previous quarter, and could you give a little more color on what the cadence should be for the remainder of the year?
Mike Hansen: I'm not ready to say that we should be at the low end of the range. I think we will be in that range. The smaller amount in the first quarter is just simply because there's still a lot of heavy lifting to do as it relates to the integration and I'll give you an example. While we've made some really good progress on reducing the former corporate headquarters, we're not fully out of that headquarter building yet and we’re not able to impair that lease until we're fully out of it. So that's an example of why we've made quite a bit of progress, there will likely be an impairment charge coming still and there we have a number of similar examples. So I would say we're still going to be somewhere in that range certainly given that that it was only about $4 million in the first quarter. There it’s going to pick up and I would say that the back half of the year is going to see the bulk of that.
Jay Hanna: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: We will take our next question from Manav Patnaik with Barclays. Please go ahead.
Manav Patnaik: Yes. Hi. Good evening, guys. If the amount -- the dis-synergy assumption for G&K revenues, it sounds like you lowered that assumption, is that correct and maybe why?
Mike Hansen: Well, we change -- if you're talking about the revenue expectation for the year, we increased that slightly from a range previous of 870 to 900 to 885 to 905. So we did slightly increase the revenue expectation. And I would say for the first quarter we're pretty much right in line where we expected, may be slightly ahead. The first quarter revenue was about $236 million, that was about a 3% decrease from the prior year for that block of business. As you know, we've talked a lot about that continuing to decrease through this year such that it will probably bottom out in the fourth quarter or the first quarter of fiscal '19. And so, while we are seeing the revenue that we expected, we still believe that it's going to continue to decrease as we start to recover from the absence of new business, and that will -- that -- again that decreasing revenue will continue through this fiscal year as evidenced by the guidance that we are giving, 885 to 905.
Manav Patnaik: Got it. And then just -- maybe anecdotally like could you give us some stats in terms of the number of overlapping plant facilities and/or routes and stuff you guys have, and how many of those you’ve consolidated thus far etcetera. Are those fair things to ask for?
Mike Hansen: Well, let me talk a little bit about first quarter integration activities …
Manav Patnaik: Okay.
Mike Hansen: … and that will give you some color. Our first quarter synergies were about $7 million. So that's 7 out of the 50 to 55. The activities that that happened in that first quarter and I’m not going to give you every single one, but generally speaking we converted the payroll system as we talked about on our last call. We converted to the Cintas financial system. We have made progress on reducing the functions located at the former headquarters, and we have also converted or consolidated a few dozen branches into Cintas locations and one processing plant into Cintas locations. So we have had some -- we've had a lot of activity, much of that coming towards the end of the first quarter where we will start to see the synergies from those in the last three quarters of the year.
Manav Patnaik: Okay, got it.
Mike Hansen: I'm not ready to give you any number on how many we expect to eventually consolidate, but maybe I will give you a little bit of color on the integration activities. It's -- this is a -- it's a fairly complex process for us and our partners are doing a great job of executing so far, but maybe I'll give you a couple of details of what goes on. In one of these integration activities it's about a 16-week process, and maybe I'll touch on a couple areas starting with data. We need to -- for that locations information, we need to map every item and every product and service from a former product number in the legacy G&K system to the Cintas system. We need to set up every single G&K legacy customer into the Cintas system, that means everywhere. Everywhere is garment sizes, the number and type of masks that they might have, all other items that they are getting serviced. The pricing related to each customer wear map etcetera, any recent activity we need to bring over to know if we have new hires at a customer, if they are recent terminations or any other changes in the services. And then we got to run parallel on invoicing data and other data to make sure that it has been loaded properly. So there is a lot of data work that needs to be done which -- with each and every one of these. Next area is inventory. For example, we need to take every garment that we had in from the G&K product line and map it or determine what we're going to do with that garment. Are we going to replace it with the Cintas product or are we going to continue to source that G&K product, so we got to map all of those different products and services. We have to re-barcode every garment that's -- that is in service. So every garment that we have today has a barcode on it that indicates customer route number or wearer number. And so the re-barcoding of that, I will just give you a couple of numbers. 170,000 customer locations for legacy G&K with an average of about 10 wearers with 11 shirts and 11 pants, that’s about 37.4 million garments that need to be re-barcoded. So it is quite the effort. And again our team is doing a super job and there are other areas that I could go through as well, but I just want to give you a little bit of a sense of the amount of detail as well as the amount of work that’s included in each and every one of these consolidations. And I think we’ve been doing a great job at that. And I'll finish with the 20 other things that we've spent quite a bit of time on in this first quarter is doing a lot of mapping and creating a bridge from the legacy G&K system to our SAP system. And that is a big project and in fact we converted our first location to SAP yesterday and we're certainly excited to see that happen and as long as that continues to go well, we will be ready to add or convert more and more of those locations that are going to remain open. So we're off to a really good start. We're right in line with where we expected our partners doing a super job of executing and we will provide more detailed quarter-to-quarter as we move forward.
Manav Patnaik: Great. That was lot of good detail. I will get back in the queue.
Operator: And we will take our next question from Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley.
Toni Kaplan: Hey, good afternoon.
Mike Hansen: Hi, Toni.
Toni Kaplan: Could you give a little bit more color on the drivers of the First Aid acceleration and also just the profitability drivers within that segment this quarter as well?
Paul Adler: Yes, Toni. This is Paul. We talked previously about that organic growth rate bottoming out and that was kind of the math associated with that ZEE acquisition. ZEE being a third of the legacy business not growing and yet that legacy business was growing strongly, that kind of blended out that the bottom to about 3.3% organic growth rate. And we expected it to climb out to historic levels, and we're very pleased that it has. 11.9 that's probably little bit higher than we typically run or its probably some easier comps benefiting us. But that's a business that we expect year in and year out to be growing high single-digits. So, in terms of the drivers there's really no silver bullet, no one particular initiative. It's just the continued execution of the sales force and continuing to sell new programs, penetrating the existing accounts. Some of the ZEE customers as well that will be part of that effort. And it's a very scalable business or there is a lot of capacity. So, as we continue to grow that top line, if we can grow it organically in a high single-digit rate, it is going to continue to push those margins forward. I mean, as I mentioned in the script, 170 basis points year-over-year that's outstanding. That is the benefits of those ZEE synergies kicking in, but at the same time growing a 11.9%. There's a lot of incremental profit fall into the bottom line pushing those margins.
Mike Hansen: And Toni just one last comment. The -- we added quite a few sales people in the first quarter of last fiscal year to really help that business kick-start that growth as we’ve then completed the ZEE system conversions etcetera. And we're starting to see that. We’ve seen that productivity improve and as we expected that that kind of that percent to sale is kind of coming back down to where it should be.
Toni Kaplan: Okay, great. And then, we saw an increase in gasoline prices at the end of August. Can you talk about if you’re expecting to see just a headwind from that as you go through the next couple of quarters? Thanks a lot.
Mike Hansen: Well, we saw it come up to about 2.1% of revenue in the first quarter and our expectations is that it will come up just a little bit as we move through the rest of the year.
Toni Kaplan: Thanks a lot.
Paul Adler: Yes, I will add to that, because we’ve been talking a lot about the impact of oil and gas in the top line, that being a headwind. And finally that impact has become negligible. So I think it was 30 basis points of a headwind last quarter in Q4, but in first quarter its zero. And so going forward, it shouldn’t be something we're talking about in terms of impact on the top line. We will be talking about increased energy costs impact on the bottom line. And I would add to that, we continue to watch the rig counts, but they kind of stabilize at times they are picking up, they’re still significantly below prior-year levels and from our standpoint where at oil prices at this level we're not starting to see growth accelerate again and pick up. It doesn't seem to be a tailwind. We expect it to be pretty stable and just flattish from here on out.
Toni Kaplan: That’s great. Thank you.
Operator: And we will take our next question from Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel.
Shlomo Rosenbaum: Hi. Thank you very much for taking my questions. Hey, Mike and Paul, it seems like just in the guidance you -- the step up in guidance, it's very minimal amount is coming from less losses assumed from G&K, and I was wondering if you can just give us a little bit more detail on the things internally in the legacy Cintas that’s making the business. You raised the guidance that much, right from the beginning of the year. Is it just -- maybe you could take some of the units and say, hey, this is having an outsized impact or we are going to see uniform rentals segment see 8% growth for several quarters in a row, or just give us a little bit more color on that.
Mike Hansen: Well, I think we got off to a really nice start and the execution is -- it has been very good. And so certainly it -- you can tell from the guidance increase that it exceeded our expectations by a bit. And Shlomo, I -- there is not really any one particular reason other than I think the economy is stable and conducive for us. It hasn't seen -- haven't seen much of a change and our execution remains pretty good. I think as Paul mentioned, the last two quarters we've seen a bit of an ease of the year-over-year oil and gas impact. And as we move forward from here, you can probably see from our guidance that we don't necessarily expect the 8% to continue, but we still expect some pretty healthy organic growth as we move forward. Part of that reasoning is that that oil and gas year-over-year, let's call it easier comps, go away as we go into the back part of the year. And the other thing is we talked a little bit about the hurricane impact, and while it could've been a lot worse, it's still going to be about an impact of a headwind of about 30 basis points for the remaining nine months of the year. So when we think about where we are today, yes, we did get off to a pretty good start, a little bit better than we expected. The oil and gas year-over-year comp was a little bit easier as we move into the final three, a little bit tougher oil and gas comps as well as the hurricane impact.
Shlomo Rosenbaum: Okay, great. Thank you.
Operator: And we will take our next question from Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan.
Andrew Steinerman: Hi. I did hear you mentioned something on M&A amortization in terms of a number I think, but you just went too fast for me in the prepared remarks. Could you just tell us what the G&K M&A amortization is in the first quarter and what it is in the guide for fiscal year 2018?
Mike Hansen: It is -- to the total company its about 75 basis points, to the rental segment it's 95 basis points. There -- Andrew, there is some part of that that is Canadian that could be affected by the exchange rate, but generally speaking, we expect that to be consistent for the remaining three quarters of this year.
Andrew Steinerman: So those were the numbers for first quarter? In basis points you expect similar basis points for the rest of the year, right?
Mike Hansen: Well, let me restate that, Andrew. I expect roughly a similar dollar amount for each of the three quarters. We do have one less workday in the second quarter and two less in the third quarter compared to the first, so the dollar amount I don't expect to change at all, but the percent of sale may tweak a little bit because of same dollar amount lower workday sales. For the full-year, it's roughly $50 million.
Andrew Steinerman: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: We will take our next question from Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer.
Scott Schneeberger: Thanks. Good afternoon. With regard to the hurricane, could you speak a little bit to the cadence through the year? Is that all going to be impacted in the fiscal second quarter or would you expect more of a steady through the end of the year? And just a little discussion, too as a follow on, is it all handled through insurance, just the way it works on the cost side. Thanks.
Mike Hansen: Yes, we expect about half of that impact revenue wise to be in the second quarter, and then the remaining half to be in the third and the fourth. So there are some customers that were out of service for some period, short period of time. We've been able to pick it back up. There are others that that we don't expect to come back at all unfortunately. So heavy in the second quarter, the remaining half in the third and the fourth. We were fortunate that we did not have much in the way of property damage at all and I don't expect that we will have much in the way of a business interruption insurance claim, but we may have a claim relative to our inability to see customers. But we're still going through all of those details.
Scott Schneeberger: Okay. Thanks for that. And then, just shifting gears a little bit, could you provide an update with regard to SAP progression? Just thoughts on how that’s going and anything financial on cadence that’s worth calling out? Thanks.
Mike Hansen: Well, the SAP is going very well. We're very pleased with it. We talked a lot over the course of the last particularly six months that injecting G&K into this SAP rollout mix is going to be something that we will be taking a heavy look at and figuring out how we want to do that. And so we spent a lot of time this summer creating that bridge as I mentioned before from the legacy G&K system to our SAP system, and that's been an important step for us to be able to move forward. So we have not converted quite as many Cintas legacy locations this summer as we originally planned because we want to be able to get G&K going. The G&K legacy locations going and be able to do waves of both as we move forward. And we feel really good about the ability to do that, but as I've mentioned previously, we do expect that that rollout will go into our fiscal '20 year.
Scott Schneeberger: Great. Thanks for that and good job.
Mike Hansen: Thank you.
Operator: We will take our next question from Hamzah Mazari with Macquarie. Please go ahead.
Unidentified Analyst: Hi, guys. This is Mario filling in for Hamzah. Just wanted to see if you can give us a sense of whether a slowdown in the employment trends can be offset by greater cross-selling or how much of a fact are employment trends today to your business since its much more diversified versus your historical model? Said another way, can you sustain mid to high single-digit growth in a slowing employment backdrop?
Mike Hansen: Well, we think -- Mario, in the last seven years or so we've grown several multiples above employment growth in GDP. And the reason is because we've been able to have a very good and healthy new business effort where two thirds of our new business comes from what we call no programmers. In other words, those businesses that don't have uniform rental programs. And so in other words, we're able to get new businesses into our products and services even if they are not additive to employment. And that's been an important factor for us over the last seven years coming out of the great recession. In addition to that new business effort we've been able to penetrate existing customers as we have continued to come up with innovative products and services and so that has been an important aspect. So as we look ahead, we do believe that we can continue to grow even with lessening employment because we've -- that's what we've done for the last seven years or so. Now, Mario, look the more jobs that get added the better. We were certainly all for it and that that will only have a positive impact on us. But if we see employment trends pullback just a little bit, we have been in that environment during the last seven years and we've been able to grow nicely. So we are -- we like where we are, we like our product line in our services. They can add value to almost every business in the U.S. We like our execution and our ability to reach those business opportunities, and so we're optimistic.
Unidentified Analyst: Perfect. And just a quick follow-up. How big do you think the First Aid and Fire Protection to be over the long-term and where are we in terms of extracting the ZEE medical synergies?
Mike Hansen: Well, as far as what that addressable market is, we haven't really talked about that publicly. And don't -- quite honestly, don't spend a lot of time. We just -- our goal is to reach more and more new business customers and with a million customers in total and 16 million businesses in the U.S and Canada, we think there's a lot of opportunity to continue to provide value. We look at that First Aid and Safety business, it's a great business because it's -- we sell it under the umbrellas of safety, compliance, and those are two important umbrellas and add a lot of breadth to the offerings that we have and we’ve been able to broaden our product offering. So things like training are big opportunities for us. Continued sales of AEDs, continued sales of safety protection equipment, real nice opportunity. So we think we’ve got a lot of runway there. As it relates to the ZEE synergies, we think we're getting them and I think the gross margin is a great sign of that. We are a third larger than we were pre-ZEE. Our gross margin has exceeded where we were prior to ZEE. And we think that as we continue to grow that SG&A we will likely come down some more to get that overall profit level back into the mid-teen. So we are really excited about that business and the breadth of customers that can add value to.
Unidentified Analyst: Thank you so much. I appreciate the time.
Operator: And we will take our next question from Dan Dolev with Nomura Securities. Please go ahead.
Dan Dolev: Hey, thank you. Great job. Paul, you said GM grew nicely ex G&K. Can you quantify it in the first quarter? I may have missed it, sorry.
Paul Adler: Dan, we haven't quantified it just because of the fact that as we’ve said, we're making some of these integrations now. We’ve had few dozen occurrence, so you're getting the blend of the two businesses. We just know that given that we're so early in the integration and a lot of work to do that -- that we feel comfortable that there is good expansion. But to put a figure on it is not something we're really able to do definitively at this point and going forward.
Dan Dolev: Got it. And if I remember, did you say $0.15 to $0.17 from G&K?
Paul Adler: Yes, for the fiscal [multiple speakers].
Dan Dolev: So it’s the same number as in the prior quarter, even though you’re raising the revenues, it’s just being conservative, I mean, is that what we should understand?
Paul Adler: We do think that the contribution is fairly flat for the year. And so, yes, to answer your question, yes, it is a fairly flat contribution. And the reason is as we’ve talked about that revenue, we expect that revenue to continue to come down as we kind of get through the disruption of the new business effort. And as we see that revenue come down, we're going to have some decremental margin because of that. However, as we move through the year, we're going to create more synergies that will offset that -- more than offset that. But that the combination of that is a fairly flat contribution for the year. As we mentioned, in fiscal '19 we won't -- we do expect that that revenue will start to come back, the sales effort with that block of reps will come back, and so then as the incremental margin start to come as well as then the synergies we will see some nice benefit.
Dan Dolev: And just squeezing in a question on this one, when you say bottom in F 1Q '19, is that a dollar bottom or year-over-year decline in rate that you are referring to on G&K?
Paul Adler: That’s both. It's both. It's a dollar decline and it will -- that will be the largest year-over-year decline percentage wise as well.
Dan Dolev: Got it. So it will be another -- the smallest quarter dollar wise?
Paul Adler: Yes. Now, Dan, I say that without getting out the calculator for workday differential, but generally speaking, yes.
Dan Dolev: Understood. Well, great job. Thank you very much.
Operator: And we will take our next question from David Stratton with Great Lakes Review. Your line is open.
David Stratton: Good evening. Thank you for taking the questions. You previously mentioned your SAP integration on a previous question and how that relates to G&K. I was just wondering what the pace is like for the rest of the year. You had previously mentioned around a $30 million expense in fiscal '18, given that you’ve kind of changed the rollout due to the G&K facilities and your Cintas facilities. How is that looking to shape up for the rest of the year? And is it still that $30 million range?
Paul Adler: Yes, your recollection is correct. We had disclosed that for fiscal '18 our expectation is about $30 million expense for SAP. It was $12 million in fiscal '17. And the reason for the increased amount in '18 is because in what, maybe the fourth quarter of fiscal '17 is when we started depreciating the SAP asset. We were out of the pilot, felt really good about it, using the system, started depreciating it. So there's no change. Even though as you mentioned and as Mike mentioned we put our first G&K operation in SAP, it's just maybe a little shift of, is it a Cintas legacy operation versus a G&K operation, but no matter which operation it is, so to speak, it's still going to be $30 million of expense in this fiscal year. And you know good half of that $30 million is depreciation expense, which is fixed.
David Stratton: Got you. Thank you. And then on the rental side, can you just kind of breakout the impact that you’ve seen from your marketing campaign, ready for the workday, that’s been in place for a while now and just with G&K I would like to hear a little bit more about how that’s going and given the organic growth which is impressive, how much of that is due to that program and where are you seeing the most cross-selling? Is there a product line that you’ve really been seeing benefits from?
Mike Hansen: Well, I think as you probably understand, capturing the exact impact of a marketing program is pretty difficult and maybe a little bit more anecdotal. We like what we're seeing. I'm not ready to put an exact percentage or dollar amount on it, but we do like what we seeing and we do think that it has enhanced our organic growth to some extent. As you can see over the course of the last three quarters, we've had a nice organic growth in rental and I think an accelerating growth in the First Aid. Again, some of that we’ve talked about being some oil and gas lapping, some easier comps in First Aid, but we do believe in that campaign. We do think that it has reached many prospects and customers. We have a lot of anecdotal positive examples. And so, we will continue with it and we certainly love the tagline Ready for the Workday and again we will continue with that, we will continue with our campaign. We are working to reach and touch as many prospects as we can and as well as current customers. And -- generally speaking, we think it has been a positive influence, not sure I can give you a number though.
David Stratton: I appreciate it. Thank you.
Operator: And we will take our next question from Tim Mulrooney with William Blair.
Timothy Mulrooney: Good afternoon. Congrats on another good quarter.
Mike Hansen: Thank you, Tim.
Timothy Mulrooney: So a couple of housekeeping questions. The tax rate, you said you expected 34% for the full-year, which kind of implies higher than 34% for the remaining three quarters given the lower tax rate in the first quarter. I’m getting to about 36.5% for the remaining three quarters. Is that what I was supposed to take away from your comment or should I be modeling 34% for the remaining three quarters?
Mike Hansen: Now, you’re thinking about it correctly, Tim. If you remember going back prior to fiscal '17, so fiscal '16 and beyond, we generally ran with an effective rate of somewhere in the neighborhood of 37%. There was a change in accounting for equity compensation that allowed us to take a deduction for stock option exercises and restricted stock vestings things that we were not able to take in the past. That created a much lower effective tax rate in fiscal '17 and continues in fiscal '18 and we based on the fiscal year of May 31st, we have more vesting of equity compensation and more exercises of options during our first quarter than any other quarter. That's just the way that our grants typically work, and so we will continue to see generally a low rate in the first quarter and something that's closer to that historical 36%, 37% rate in the in the subsequent three quarters.
Timothy Mulrooney: Got it. Thank you. Also -- okay, so now that you’ve pulled G&K into the fold, you obviously have a larger and denser footprint than you did previously, which means better national coverage than you had previously. Does this improve your ability to grow share with National Accounts or was your coverage really sufficient enough previously that this isn't really a major growth opportunity associated with the acquisition?
Mike Hansen: Yes, with the overlap with the G&K markets and our markets was significant and that was a really good thing for the synergy opportunities. But it didn’t really give us many new markets, and so the footprint that we had prior gave us every ability to compete in the national account space and I would say that hasn't changed because of this deal. We still believe that we have the best service level to provide to national accounts, but that hasn't changed with this deal.
Timothy Mulrooney: Okay. I thought maybe that was the case, just had to ask. Maybe one more. On the -- now that you’ve had G&K for a couple more months since your last call, just curious if you have any better insight as to their penetration rates for their ancillary products. Were their mats at 60% penetration like yours are? What about hygiene, some of those other items, curious what the opportunity might be? Thank you.
Mike Hansen: I think that Paul talked a little bit about this last quarter where the penetration on mats is probably not a lot different and that still provides an opportunity for us because we have a wider variety of mat opportunities, and so while they may have one or two mats we think that we have mats for even more situations. So anti-fatigue mats, kitchen type mats, logo mats etcetera. So we got a lot of opportunity with mats even if the penetration is not too far from ours. But the big opportunity that we did talk about was in that restroom hygiene area where G&K was about 3% of -- about 3% of the revenue was there, and ours is quite a bit higher than that. So it provides a real nice penetration opportunity and one that as we continue to integrate and that get on the same platform so we will certainly be looking towards adding that kind of value to those legacy customers.
Operator: And we will take our last question from John Healy with Northcoast Research. Please go ahead.
John Healy: Thanks. Mike, I wanted to ask just margin related question. I think you mentioned that 2Q will have one last billing day as well as 3Q have three last billing days. Historically I think that’s been like a 30 basis point or so impact on op margins. Should we expect similar in 2Q and 3Q this year or does it change much with the acquisition?
Mike Hansen: So just to be clear, we talked that workday differential is sequential not year-over-year. And so sequentially we have one less in Q2 and then down to 64, which is two less in Q3. We've talked about a 50 basis point margin impact, let's call it 40 in gross margin, 10 in SG&A, but about a 50 basis point impact that’s either year-over-year or sequential and I would expect that that does not change because of bringing G&K on. Now there are -- because of the synergy play and the SAP conversion going on and the pace during the second and third quarter, that could have some additional impact. But generally speaking, I would expect that we will still see that 50 basis point margin impact.
John Healy: Fair enough. And then I just wanted to ask as a follow-up question on the storm related activity. Is there any way to talk about just the Houston market itself or just the markets in Florida, maybe as you look at today versus a month ago or two weeks ago relative to when the storms happened. What the routes are doing in terms of kind of the normalized level of business? Are they at a 40% throughput as compared to normal levels or 60% or just some color in terms of what the routes are doing today versus what they had been doing?
Mike Hansen: Well, yes, it -- certainly early on it was fairly low, but I would say today we're back in the -- cash probably 85% to 95% range in those I would say in those territories without getting into each individual market. I would say those territories we're -- we've seen a kind of a remarkable recovery given the impact we could have seen. And so we're certainly thankful that we've seen the business come back to pretty decent levels and that's why you see only a $10 million to $15 million impact.
John Healy: Great. Thank you guys and congrats.
Mike Hansen: Thank you.
Operator: And that does conclude our question-and-answer session for today. I’d like to turn the conference back over to our speakers for any additional or closing remarks.
Mike Hansen: Well, thank you for joining us tonight. We will issue our second quarter earnings in December and we look forward to speaking with you again at that time.
Operator: And once again that does conclude today’s presentation. We thank you all for your participation and you may now disconnect.

Operator: Good day everyone, and welcome to the Cintas Quarterly Earnings Results Call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Mike Hansen, Senior Vice President of Finance and Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead, sir.
Mike Hansen: Thank you and good evening. With me tonight is Paul Adler, Cintas' Vice President and Treasurer. We will discuss our fourth quarter results for fiscal 2017. After our commentary, we will be happy to answer any questions. The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a Safe Harbor from civil litigation for forward-looking statements. This conference call contains forward-looking statements that reflect the Company's current views as to future events and financial performance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those we may discuss. I refer you to the discussion on these points contained in our most recent filings with the SEC. We are pleased to report that revenue for the fourth quarter, which ended May 31st was $1.530 billion, an increase of 23.1% over last year's fourth quarter. The organic growth rate, which adjusts for the impacts of acquisitions and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations was 8.1%. New business wins; penetration of existing customers with more products and services and customer retention remains strong. The organic growth for the uniform rental and facility services segment 8%. And the organic growth rate of the first aid and safety services segment was 9.2%. Fourth quarter gross margin improved to 44.4% from 43.9% last year. This is our 15th consecutive quarter of year-over-year gross margin improvement. Operating income for the fourth quarter of $177.3 million decreased 11.2% from last year's fourth quarter. Fiscal 2017 fourth quarter operating income was negatively impacted by $63.7 million of transaction and integration expenses related to the G&K Services acquisition. Excluding G&K results and acquisition charges as well as a benefit from a change in the accounting for equity compensation as required by a recent accounting standard, our operating income margin was 16.4% versus 16.1% last year, an improvement of 30 basis points. Net income and earnings per diluted share or EPS from continuing operations for the fourth quarter of fiscal '17 were $82.2 million and $0.75 respectively. Fiscal '17 fourth quarter EPS included a positive impact of $0.02 from the change in the accounting for equity compensation and $0.05 from the G&K business. Fiscal '17 fourth quarter EPS included a negative impact of $0.50 from transaction and integration expenses and certain incremental nonrecurring bank fees included in the interest expense related to the G&K acquaint. Excluding these items, EPS was $1.18 versus $1.06 last year and 11% increase over last year's fourth quarter. Our fiscal 2017 results added to our record of success. We have now grown revenue and profit 46 of the past 48 years, with the only exception being the great recession years. For the seventh consecutive year, organic growth was in the mid-to-high single digits. We continue to grow by multiples in excess of both gross domestic product and employment. For the seventh consecutive year, we grew EPS double digits excluding the G&K results and acquisition related items as well as the benefit from ASU 2016-09. And we increased the annual dividend for the 33rd consecutive year. For Cintas the past is indicative of the future because of the constant we share, which is our culture. Our culture is part of our strategy and drives our meaningful performance. We value honesty and integrity, competitive urgency, and challenging the status quo in a positive manner. Profitable growth is in our DNA. The opportunities for us to seize are significant. Retail inspired garments, health care scrub rental, and branded rental garments like Carhartt, our recent investments in the product line which have a long runway. Our first aid and safety business has a run rate of more than $500 million and yet we just recently completed our national footprint. National account opportunities also remain. And despite acquiring a significant competitor, new business wins were up significantly over last year. Also our fire services business is only about 70 of the top 100 largest markets in North America. We continue to evolve as a business services company helping over a million customers get ready for the workday. With an array of products and services including dust mask, hygiene products, first aid products and services, and fire protection services, we have a product or service for every business in North America. Our opportunity for continued growth is the 16 million businesses we currently don't do business with. Not only the opportunity is significant to expand market share, but we have huge potential to grow revenue and profit by penetrating our existing customer base. Within our uniform wearing customer base, our penetration rates of other products and services with the exception of entrance mats are less than 20% and less than 10% of our customers do business with two or more of our business units. We've added sales reps specifically focused on penetrating existing customers. They're supported by a national branding campaign whose purpose is to educate on all that we can do for businesses so they can concentrate on their core competencies. Cintas is a business that was built to last and that building doesn't stop. Our focus on the long term means that we make the needed investments. Our investment in an enterprise resource planning system is a significant one. The implementation of SAP will continue into fiscal year 2020 due to the additional operations from the G&K acquisition. Once completed, SAP will produce cost savings and will better equip us to cross sell. We will be a stronger company with this new technology. And finally, we are excited about our recent acquisition of G&K. Preliminary results are very encouraging. We are on track to meet our financial and nonfinancial objectives and look forward to the many opportunities G&K provides. The synergies are compelling and result from the significant overlap in operations. Route density will also improve. We can spend more time helping customers solve their problems. We will have more time to sell into the accounts. The cost synergies alone will improve G&K operating margins to about 25% in four years. So in sum, our record of success is a lengthy one. The past has been great, but the future too is very bright. So looking ahead to 2018, we expect revenue to be in the range of $6.27 billion to $6.36 billion and fiscal '18 EPS from continuing operations to be in the range of $5.15 to $5.25. Our guidance includes the following assumptions related to the acquired G&K business. No transaction and integration expenses. Revenue of $870 million to $900 million compared to a prior year run rate of $965 million. Synergies of approximately $50 million to $55 million. Purchase price amortization expense related to intangible assets of $50 million. Interest expense on G&K acquisition debt of about $65 million and an EPS contribution of $0.15 to $0.17. Again this EPS guidance does not include any G&K transaction and integration expenses. However, we do expect to incur these expenses in fiscal '18 as we continue to integrate the acquisition. We estimate that these expenses will range from $50 million to $65 million. Before I turn the call over to Paul, I want to discuss the G&K revenue guidance, we've discussed this over the course of the last year, but want to be clear. Obviously the two most significant components of revenue growth rate are new business and lost business. The legacy G&K operations just like Cintas operations will continue to have loss business in the normal course as contracts come up for renewal. The G&K loss business may be slightly higher than normal due to the disruption of the integration, but not significantly so. The new business component from the legacy G&K sales reps though will significantly decrease for a temporary period. We are in a process of filling open positions and training all new reps on how to sell using the Cintas processes, how to sell Cintas products and services and to use the Cintas systems. As a result, the new business typically generated to offset the normal loss business will temporarily be reduced until the sales reps get back to their territories and begin to ramp productivity to normal levels. The result is that legacy G&K revenue will decline in fiscal '18. This was expected and we modeled the deal based upon this reality. So now I'll turn the call over to Paul.
Paul Adler: Thank you, Mike. First, please note that our fiscal year 2017 continued one less work day than in fiscal year 2016. It was the third quarter that had one less day than the prior year quarter. One less workday negatively impacted fiscal 2017 total revenue growth by about 40 basis points and operating margin by approximately 10 to 15 basis points in comparison to fiscal 2016. Looking ahead to fiscal '18, there will be no differences in workdays as fiscal '18 contains the same number of work days per quarter as fiscal '17. We have two reportable operating segments, uniform rental and facility services, and first date and safety services. The remainder of our business is included in all other. All other consist of fire protection services and our direct sale business. First aid and safety services and all other are combined and presented as other services on the income statement. The uniform rental and facility services operating segment includes the rental and servicing of uniforms, mats and towels, and the provision of restroom supplies and other facility products and services. The segment also includes the sale of items from our catalogues to our customers on route. Uniform rental and facility services revenue was $1.220 billion, an increase of 27.1% compared to last year's fourth quarter. Excluding the impact of acquisitions and foreign currency exchange rate changes, the organic growth rate was 8%. Our uniform rental and facility services segment gross margin was 44.6% for the fourth quarter, an increase of 20 basis points from 44.4% in last year's fourth quarter. Current year fourth quarter gross margin of course included the margin on the acquired G&K business, which was 40.2% for the fourth quarter. Excluding the acquired G&K business, the Cintas legacy uniform rental and facility services business gross margin improved 100 basis points from 44.4% to 45.4%. The G&K gross margin will improve to Cintas legacy levels as we realize the synergies from the acquisition. For instance, one of the factors resulting in a currently lower G&K gross margin is that energy expense as a percent of revenue is 80 basis points higher than the Cintas legacy business. This is the result of the smaller G&K business lacking the route density that the larger Cintas legacy business possesses. The fuel savings from route density along with the benefit of reducing redundant capacity will drive significant improvements in G&K gross margin. Our first aid and safety services operating segment includes revenue from the sale and servicing of first aid products, safety products and training. This segment's revenue for the fourth quarter was $134 million, which was 9.4% higher than last year's fourth quarter. On an organic basis, the growth rate for the segment was 9.2%. I want to take some time to revisit the impact of the ZEE Medical business on this segment's organic growth rate. We acquired ZEE in our first quarter of fiscal 2016. ZEE was a significant acquisition, increasing the total first aid business by about one-third. In our fiscal 2017 second quarter, 15 months after the acquisition, this segment's organic growth rate was less than the typical high-single digits. This lower organic growth rate was due to two main reasons. First, not only was the acquired ZEE business significant in size, but it was also not growing. The ZEE Medical pre-acquisition had no sales force. Second, our focus in the first year of an acquisition is to secure the customer base and earn the trust of the acquired customers through outstanding service. On our second quarter earnings call of this fiscal year, we disclosed that we believe that the first aid segment's organic growth rate hit the bottom and the segment was positioned for improving organic growth rates. We added sales reps to grow the ZEE customer base with our broad range of products and services. And meanwhile, the legacy Cintas first aid and safety business continued to grow at a strong pace. As we expected, our organic growth rate did climb from the bottom, increasing from 3.3% in the second quarter to 5.5% in the third quarter and now 9.2% in the fourth quarter. Thus the decline in the organic growth rate was expected due to the weight of the acquired business and it was temporary. The segment has returned to its customary organic growth rates in the high single digits and on a significantly larger revenue base. This segment's gross margin was 44.5% in the fourth quarter compared to 42.9% in last year's fourth quarter, an increase of 160 basis points. Our margins continue to benefit from the realization of ZEE acquisition synergies, including improved sourcing and the leveraging of the existing warehouses. Our fire protection services and direct sale businesses are reported in the all other category. All other revenue was $175 million, an increase of 9.2% compared to last year's fourth quarter. The organic growth rate was 8.3%. All other gross margin was 42.8% for the fourth quarter of this fiscal year compared to 42% for last year's four quarter. The direct sale business by its nature is not the recurring revenue stream that our other businesses are. Therefore the growth rates are generally low-single digits and are subject to volatility such as when we install a multi-million dollar account. We installed some large accounts in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 driving double-digit organic growth in this business. One of these accounts was Southwest Airlines. Majority of the product was shipped and recognized as revenue at the end of fiscal 2017 as opposed to early fiscal 2018 as originally expected. On July 11 2017, we sold a business that was not a good strategic fit. The business was reported as discontinued operations for the periods ended May 31st 2017 and 2016. Revenue and EPS for the sold business were about $26 million and $0.01 respectively in Q4 of fiscal 2017 and $28 million and $0.02 respectively in Q4 of fiscal 2016. Revenue and EPS for the business were about $105 million and $0.07 respectively for the full fiscal year of 2017 and $110 million and $0.07 respectively for the full fiscal year of 2016. These amounts are important to remember as you consider our fiscal 2018 guidance. Proceeds from the sale, net of taxes paid will be approximately $85 million. Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue were 28.6% in the fourth quarter compared to 27.9% in last year's fourth quarter. 60 of the 70 basis points is attributable to the amortization expense of the intangible assets established in the purchase price accounting of the G&K acquisition. Our effective tax rate on continuing operations for the fourth quarter was 37.8% compared to 37.2% for last year's fourth quarter. The effective tax rate can fluctuate from quarter to quarter based on tax reserve build and releases relating to discrete items. We expect the effective tax rate for fiscal 2018 to be about 34%. Our cash equivalents balance as of May 31 was $169 million and we had $22 million of marketable securities as of quarter end. Cash flow from operating activities on the fiscal 2017 fourth quarter was $280 million dollars and free cash flow was $225 million. Capital expenditures for the fourth quarter were approximately $55 million. Our CapEx by operating segment was as follows; $45 million in uniform rental and facility services, $7 million in first aid and safety, and $3 million in all other. We expect fiscal year 2018 CapEx be in the range of $280 million to $320 million. As of May 31st total debt was about $3.133 billion consisting of $363 million in short-term debt and $2.770 billion of long-term debt. Our leverage at May 31st was 2.8 times debt to EBITDA. Subsequent to May 31, we repaid $50 million of the term loan. We expect our leverage ratio to decrease to approximately 2.3 debt to EBITDA at May 31st 2018. With $300 million of senior notes maturing in December that we will not refinance, $200 million of term loan and commercial paper, we have structured our debt to help us achieve our goal of reducing leverage to 2.0 times debt to EBITDA. Regarding SAP, since last quarter's earnings call, more locations have been converted to the system. As of the end of this month, we will have converted about 30 locations. We continue to be pleased with the conversion efforts and the capabilities of the new system. Due to the acquisition of G&K, we are adjusting our SAP implementation plan as necessary. Certain G&K acquisition locations will also be converted to SAP. And therefore because of this additional work we expect the implementation to extend through fiscal 2020. The good news is that we can leverage the system over an even larger organization because the SAP hardware and software costs will not increase. They are sunk costs. We expect that fiscal 2018 SAP expenses will amount to approximately $30 million. This compares to about $12 million in fiscal 2017. That concludes our prepared remarks, we are happy to answer your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Manav Patnaik with Barclays. Please go ahead.
Manav Patnaik: Thank you good evening gentlemen. First question for you is just on the divestiture, maybe just a little bit more color on which part of the old business that was in and just why that was done?
Paul Adler: Manav, this is Paul. That business as you can tell from the numbers that we quoted was small in the scheme of things. It was really the combination of a couple of acquisitions that we had made years ago. It was an emergency services type business that provided emergency like plumbing and electrical work security door work, commercial cleaning, services of that nature. The difference was that that work though was performed by sub-contractors and so it's a model we kind of experimented with, but ultimately we decided that we wanted to self-perform service as part of our differentiation from our competition. And so therefore it was not a good strategic fit for us.
Manav Patnaik: And would that revenue fall into the all other line, is that where that would have fit?
Paul Adler: Yes. Primarily in the previous periods, it was in the all other bucket.
Mike Hansen: There was a small piece in the rental segment, but mostly in all other.
Manav Patnaik: And then just on the synergy side, you've laid out the cost synergies for the year and you've given us the guidance on this before, maybe just on the revenue synergies, any sense on when we should start expecting more color on that and any examples of how we should think of the revenue opportunity here?
Mike Hansen: Our first goal is to, as Paul talked about kind of on board our new customers, make sure that they understand our services and we expect that the primary integration activities will happen in the first two years. I think once we are then on the same systems and they are all of those locations, those new locations are trained on our products and services, I think will then start to see the opportunities. So my expectation would be that's a 2020 type of a conversation.
Manav Patnaik: Sorry, just last one, just to clarify. You said most of these synergies in the first two years, is that different from what you said before in terms of getting 130 to 140 over three to four years?
Mike Hansen: Manav, I said the most of the integration activities would occur in the first two years, that is different from the recognition of the synergies. So let me maybe talk a little bit about the synergies real quickly. We spent the fourth quarter really confirming our assumptions with our integration plan. And the good news is we did not see anything that changed our mind about our opportunity. No unforeseen issues, we still expect that it we'll achieve $130 million to $140 million in synergies. So that's I think that was one step and that's a good start for us. We didn't do many integration activities in the fourth quarter because of the confirming and really spending time communicating with our new partners and our new customers. However we've gotten pretty busy in June and July. And in June, we did convert the G&K payroll to our payroll system that's a big first step and that went very well. We have converted to the Cintas financial system that's another big step that went well and we've gone through the first few waves of branch consolidations and those have gone well. And so I think we're off to a good start. No surprises as of yet and we really like what we've seen so far. We mentioned that the year one synergies are $50 million to $55 million and let me step back and say, we did announce that we were closing the corporate headquarters and that closure is proceeding. And so certainly the year one synergies are certainly coming some from the corporate closure and other G&A activities, probably more than half of those first year synergies. And the rest are from the integration activities of the integration of locations. Again, we think that most of those integration activities are going to happen in the first two years. The synergy recognition though generally will happen in the 12 months following that integration activity. So in year one we're going to see 50 to 55, in year two, I think we'll see another meaningful increase in synergies, and in year three, we'll see the annualizing of the year two synergy. I'm sorry the year two integration activities. We'll also start to see some sourcing benefits in that third year and we expect to fully realize the 130 to 140 in year four. So that's a little bit of the cadence of the synergy recognition and let's just - it's a little bit of a nuance but the integration activities are a little bit different than the synergy recognition.
Operator: We'll now take our next question from Andrew Wittmann with Robert W. Baird.
Andrew Wittmann: I wanted to build on that last one and to see if I could drill in a little bit more. So that you've got the synergy plan and integration plan pretty well mapped out for this year. I was wondering Mike, if you just give us a little bit of inside as what do you think you'll be ending the fiscal year at for like a run rate, just given the visibility that you have so far?
Mike Hansen: And are you saying a synergy run rate?
Andrew Wittmann: Yeah. You're going to recognize a 50 here and I was just wondering at the end of the year what do you think the annualized run rate will be at the end of the fiscal year?
Mike Hansen: I would - I'm hesitate to provide that because I want to see a little bit more, but I think it will probably be a run rate to about half of our total synergy number. And we'll start to see as we then get more integration activities, we'll start to get pretty close on a run rate perspective by the end of that second year. But I'm a little hesitant to give you a specific number because I want to see a little bit more of the waves happen.
Andrew Wittmann: Yeah that's fair. I want to drill into the guidance a little bit and just make sure that my understanding matches your understanding of it. In particular on the organic growth implication there, obviously you've got some moving pieces with not only G&K, but this disposition as well. I calculate something at seven or a little bit north of seven kind of being the organic growth rate implied in your guidance. Do you get to the math and can you help us understand maybe how that breaks down by segment?
Mike Hansen: Andy, I get a little bit less than that. Our last few years we've been in the kind of the 5% to 6.5% range and that's about where we are this year as well. I'm not going to get into that by segment, but I would say, we're in the same range we've been the last few years in terms of our opening guidance.
Andrew Wittmann: Maybe my final question was been on the margins. And I think if you did - if you give the numbers for rental segments, gross margins like-for-like or legacy Cintas, up 100 basis points. I was wondering if you could just give us a little bit of help on breaking that down, where you got that and how those puts and takes are trending now as we move forward here into the new year.
Mike Hansen: I think that revenue, I'm sorry, the gross margin improvement is building on the same thing that we've seen over the course of the last few years. And that is continued leveraging of our infrastructure, penetrating existing customers, selling revenue that is not processed in our laundry facilities such that we get more revenue dollars out of our existing capacity. I would say those are the keys to that gross margin improvement. And we think that with the improving G&K gross margins over the course of certainly the next couple years, we think we still have some good run rate there.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Mario Cortellacci with Macquarie.
Mario Cortellacci: Could you give us a sense of how much of your business is levered to employment trends or job figures versus history? It appears the business is a little more diverse, both within the uniform and also first aid and fire safety. Wondered if you could give us a little color?
Mike Hansen: Maybe I'll say that this way. Our revenue is roughly half uniform and then I'll move maybe into our rental segment, about half of the rental segment is non-uniform, so facility services made up of entrance mats, hygiene products, chemical cleaning solutions et cetera. So, today compared to let's call it ten years ago, the percentage of uniform revenue is certainly lower than then, it was probably closer to the 60%, 70% range back then. The other thing I would say is, is we have worked hard not just to create solutions that are non-uniform, but also within our uniform programs we worked hard to create innovative products retail and inspire products, garments solution based products that can reach new and different customers even in a time when there is not employment growth. So in other words we think there is a large unserved opportunity out there and we have products and services I would say today that are better able to capture that unserved market than maybe ten years ago. And so when we look back over the last seven years or so, and I think we talked about our revenue growth being multiples of GDP and employment. A lot of it is because of the innovative garments that people want to wear. As well as then the non-garment solutions that we've created that really can create value for every type of business in America. So we feel good about that little bit of that decoupling from the employment that may be ride us a little bit closer ten years ago.
Operator: Thank you. We'll now take our next question from Gary Bisbee with RBC Capital Markets.
Gary Bisbee: Hi guys, congratulations on closing the deal and it sounds like you're off to a real good start. I guess the first question I have you showed another quarter of sequential acceleration in the rental's organic revenue growth. What do you attribute that to - last quarter, you said that one of the factors that's been changing is you're doing great job on retention. Is that still it and I wanted to ask directly, how much business have you taken from G&K in this interim period from when you announced the deal to closing it, because it seems no one else in the industry is seeing acceleration, you are and there's a falling off. So I wonder if it's just the transfer from acquired to organic a piece of that?
Mike Hansen: It is not a piece of that, so we would not - when we convert revenue from, let's call it, that legacy system to our system, that certainly is not organic growth to us. So why the acceleration in organic growth? I think it is because we continue to execute at very high levels, I think we got a little bit of benefit in this fourth quarter, not I think - I know we got a little bit of benefit in the fourth quarter from a bit of a bounce back in - or a lessening of the negative in the oil and gas area. Last year, when we talked about fourth quarter performance, we had said that the headwind in oil and gas was about 100 basis points. This year, we would have said, I think in the third quarter, we said 60 basis point headwind. We would say it's probably more like 30. And so the year-over-year comps in the oil and gas are starting to be beneficial. That won't last forever, but starting to be beneficial. So I think we got a little bit of bounce from that. But most of it is, you know, we continue to execute well. Our reps are very productive and customer retention remains good.
Gary Bisbee: Yeah. And I did mean to imply, you were doing something funky with the accounting. I just wondered if your sales people were targeting G&K customers and if you have a sense for if you won business, where people switched to you rather than dealing with whatever happened there, maybe you just don't have a sense for it, but?
Mike Hansen: Well, I mean, if you're talking post acquisition, we certainly wouldn't go and -
Gary Bisbee: I am talking from when you announced the deal in August until you closed, right, there is this period we said their sales productivity fell off, your revenue accelerated. And so I just wondered if you had any sense if your reps were going to those customers and saying, “Hey, you're going to be with us sooner or later, do you want to switch now and have some certainty around pricing coverage, you know, et cetera?”
Mike Hansen: I apologize, I didn't catch that you had mentioned since the signing. I don't think that's - I don't think that's any part of the organic growth.
Gary Bisbee: Okay. Fair enough. And then just is there any of their revenue going into the other line, did they have some uniform sales or is it pretty much all in rental?
Mike Hansen: Correct. It's all in the rental segment. Yes. But there was a very, very small piece in the first aid business, I mean we're talking about 1 million - a couple of million dollars annualized, but aside from that, it's all rental.
Gary Bisbee: And then just one last one for me, you have historically, in the fourth quarter, given a sense of the mix by product categories. Is that something you're willing to share this year? Thank you.
Paul Adler: Yes. Gary, we have that for you. I can give you Cintas legacy business and the G&K business separately, just so you all for the first time, have a little bit of an idea of that mix. Going forward, it'll be very difficult, if near impossible, to separate the two as we continue to integrate. But for now, I can tell you that the Cintas legacy uniform rental business, about 49% of the revenue and I'm referring to the segment, not to the consolidated entity. So in looking at the uniform segment, 49% is garments. Dust control is 18%. Hygiene, which is restrooms, cleaning services, chemical services, that was 17% of revenue. Shop towels were 4%. Linen was 8% and catalog sales were 4%. And then in comparison, for G&K, their uniform rental mix. The garments are 55% of total revenue. Dust is 15%. Hygiene is 3%. Shop towels are 9%, and let's see, linen is 14% and catalog sales were 4%. So it really highlights what we had talked about previously that this is a business that doesn't have as broad of an offering as we do and so some good opportunities for us. In the future, you can see that hygiene line is much smaller as a percent of the total than it is for us.
Operator: Thank you. We'll now take our next question from Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.
Scott Schneeberger: Following up on Gary's question with regard to recent trends in organic, you guys were talking about Southwest and some other large, a large new business that came through, the way I interpreted it was in the fiscal fourth quarter that you thought might have come in the first half of fiscal '18. Could you just elaborate what type of impact that will have near term, you've given the full year guide, so I think we have that understood, but maybe some near term consideration for that, if impactful.
Mike Hansen: Yes, Scott. We did roll the bulk of that program out in the fourth quarter. There is a very minimal roll out amount in the first quarter and then it - then it - as with these kind of programs, you get into a maintenance mode after that and so we would expect probably a little bit of benefit, a couple of million dollars in the first quarter and then tailing off into a maintenance mode after that. This was one that was - it was scheduled for right around the end of our fiscal year and so for the - for fiscal '17, as we were thinking about this a year ago and even six months ago, it was just - it was so close as to where it would fall and it happened to fall into the fourth quarter and our team did a real nice job of getting that to the customer.
Scott Schneeberger: You mentioned SAP, 30 million impact in fiscal '18, but that it would persist on to '20, you may not want to give further guidance on '19 and '20, but just trying to get a feel or if you could refresh how you're thinking about a total spend over the period, the long term period.
Mike Hansen: We - as Paul said, about $30 million in fiscal '18, about half of that is recurring and half non-recurring. And we would expect that that will go into fiscal '19 and then - and that will certainly be reduced - the non-recurring will be reduced in fiscal '20. We don't expect that implementation to take the entire fiscal '20 year, but it will go into '20. So we would expect something of the same in '19 and non-recurring less in '20.
Operator: Thank you. We'll now take our next question from Joe Box with KeyBanc Capital Markets.
Joe Box: So no mention on the route consolidation piece, I'm just curious is that a process that happens only when you guys consolidate facilities or can it be separate. And then when that route consolidation does happen, what's been your experience with the level of disruption you might have with your customers, relative to maybe the benefits you might see.
Mike Hansen: So you're right, we didn't - we really didn't speak a whole lot to the, let's call it, the prioritization of the synergy buckets. And so maybe I'll touch on that a bit. And so I'm speaking of the 130 to 140 now, we would expect that the largest bucket is the G&A stream. It's the elimination of redundant, corporate processes as well as some location G&A expenses. The second largest would be - the second largest bucket would be that production facilities. So the combination of locations, the elimination of redundant capacity is certainly a fairly good sized opportunity for us. We think that third bucket will be the sourcing piece and while that is one of the longer timeframes of this process, we think that's a good opportunity. We think that from a routing perspective, there certainly is the fuel benefits that Paul talked about from combining the route forces and creating much more density. But we're hesitant to say that there will be a lot of route consolidation. We definitely need capacity on our routes to make sure that we have the time to meet with our customers, the time to build relationships, to make the service calls that we need to make. And so we see that as certainly a route optimization opportunity, but we don't see that as one of the bigger, a consolidation being one of the bigger opportunities there because we like the capacity. We're general - for the last probably seven years, we've been adding routes every single year. And the last thing we want to do is cut routes only to add them again. So it's really more about route optimization. And now as it relates to the timing of that, an integration generally will mean the system is first. We have to get on the same system, so that our different operations can speak to each other. And once we get on the same system, then the route optimization can happen. So, it's usually following the location consolidation or system integration.
Joe Box: I guess, do you have the ability to bring a lot of G&K's route into your existing facilities or vice versa? Or you could pass the constraint maybe at the plant level and I guess ultimately, I'm trying to understand how much can be pulled and what the consolidation opportunity could be among the different plants, because obviously there's a lot of overlap.
Mike Hansen: I'm not going to get into a specific number, but I was - let me be clear. I was speaking of route opportunities there, not production facility and location opportunities. We think there is quite a bit of opportunity. That was that second largest bucket that I mentioned. So in other words, the servicing of the routes, we certainly think there are consolidation opportunities in many markets and that certainly is one that is a big part of our integration plan. I'm not going to get into location numbers, but that certainly is the second largest opportunity within that overall synergy play.
Operator: Thank you. We'll now take our next question from John Healy with Northcoast Research. Please go ahead.
John Healy: Thank you. Mike, I wanted to ask a question based on the prepared remarks. I think, you made a comment that over the next four years, you would see G&K operating margin at 25%. Did I catch that right and if that is the case, maybe you can provide some perspective on where you could potentially see Cintas or what I would say real Cintas operating margins, maybe potentially over the next four years or so?
Mike Hansen: You did hear correctly, John and so if we think about that G&K block of business, that had been at about a 12.5% operating margin. The synergies of 130 to 140, it gets you to 25 or better percent of that block of revenue. So that's what I mean by that 25% operating margin for that block of business. Now, obviously, that block of business is - we're in the process of fully integrating that into this Cintas block of business. And so we will lose the specific reporting of that. But, if we add that kind of volume with that kind of incremental margin, I certainly see that, I want to say that alone is 100 basis point improvement in overall operating margins. And I think that we have room to grow still in all of our businesses as well. So I think there is still opportunity in rental to drive higher. There certainly is opportunity in first aid and safety and the all other still has opportunity to grow. So without giving you a number, I think all of our businesses have opportunities to grow and the incremental margin from the G&K block of business certainly will be a big part of that.
John Healy: And I wanted to ask, I might have missed it, but did you guys give CapEx guidance for 2018 and is there any thought about what CapEx could be, maybe as a percentage of revenue or kind of longer term, once the businesses are completely married together and running smoothly? And then lastly, just on tax rate, I thought you said 34%, so a little bit lower than what you guys have seen in the last couple of years and I was just wondering if that's kind of a new kind of run rate for you guys.
Paul Adler: Yeah. John, the tax rate is lower because of that change in accounting standard on equity stock compensation. So it muddied kind of our results this year and that's why we're - that's one of the columns and the tables in the earnings release to try to get that out, so you can see an apples-to-apples comparison, but because of that standard, we do believe the effective tax rate will be lower than the typical 37% that it had been. So - and that's why we've guided that way. In terms of CapEx, we did guide - I thought it was in the script 280 million to about 320 million for fiscal '18. And, I think what is a percent of revenue, we've typically been in that 4.5% of revenue area. It's been higher from time to time in the past few years especially with the SAP spend of what, 140 million over the last three years. But I think that that's probably a good metric now to use going forward as a percent of revenue.
Operator: Thank you. We'll now take our next question from Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley.
Toni Kaplan: Can you provide an update on what you're seeing in the pricing environment, both in terms of existing business and new business wins. We heard from one of your primary competitors in the quarter that they were seeing some increased competitive pressure on pricing. So just wondering if you're seeing any of that as well.
Mike Hansen: I would say, Toni that the pricing environment hasn't changed a whole lot. It's still fairly constructive and it doesn't feel much different than it has for the last year or so. And I would say that that would mean that it's always competitive and it remains competitive, but I wouldn't say it's been any more so in the last quarter than prior to that.
Toni Kaplan: Got it. And then on de-levering, you mentioned you want to get to two times that EBITDA, just to clarify is that gross or net and then just on M&A, should we expect that you'll continue to do tuck-ins as you integrate G&K or would you sort of wait until the integration is over.
Mike Hansen: So the leverage question, generally, that's gross because some of the cash that we have on our balance sheet is outside of the US and can't really be used to pay down and some is in restricted. For example, letters of credit type things. So it is gross and we expect that certainly to come down nicely in fiscal '18. As it relates to acquisitions, yes, I would say that we like tuck-in acquisitions. We like them in our rental business and our first aid and safety business and in our fire business. And I would expect that once we get to that leverage level that we've guided towards, that two times range, that will become, I would say, active like we have been in the past.
Operator: We will now take our next question from Dan Dolev with Nomura.
Dan Dolev: Can you discuss the level of new business in the core Cintas rental that you're expecting for the next year? I think you discussed it for the G&K part and you discussed the lost business for both, but can you discuss it for the core - the new business for the core. Thanks.
Mike Hansen: Sure. We would expect growth in that new business. Certainly, that is the - that's the driving force behind our organic growth. We want to make sure we are signing up new customers, because that certainly helps with future penetration opportunities. We expect it to be strong and we expect it to grow over 2017 levels.
Dan Dolev: Did you expect it to be in line in terms of the magnitude, in line with the 2017 rate or higher or lower?
Mike Hansen: Yes. I would say yes, because the implied growth rate from our guidance that we talked about is pretty much in line with the last couple of years opening guidance and so, yeah, so that would be in line.
Dan Dolev: And the 5% to 6% rental or implied rental growth guidance, is it just conservatism?
Mike Hansen: No. We think it's a reasonable rate. It's where we've been the last couple of years and we certainly would like to do better than that, but I think as we look to the next year, we'll lap the energy - the easier comps from energy. As we sit here today, I would say that I feel - while the economy is constructive, I would say it's maybe not quite as so as it was six months ago. So what we feel good about the guidance and look if we do see the economy do better, if we start to see some - even some better penetration rates, we can certainly do better, but we think it's a good starting point.
Operator: Thank you. We'll now take our next question from Tim Mulrooney with William Blair.
Tim Mulrooney: Yeah. I'm just trying to get a sense for what your Uniform Rental gross margin could be in a couple of years. Can you point to any historical examples of when you increased your route density from an acquisition, how that impacted your gross margin? Was there any material structural lift when you acquired Omni or Unitog, for example? And if so, how long did that take to manifest?
Mike Hansen: I don't have anything from those two acquisitions right in front of me. Keep in mind those were 15 and 17 years ago, but I think as we think about today, given the synergy cadence that I kind of mapped out a few minutes ago, it certainly would imply that the G&K gross margin of 40 will improve. And I would expect that that improvement will be over and above where current Cintas levels are today. So while I'm not ready to give you a specific number, that certainly will be accretive to the overall gross margin of the rental segment. And I think we should see some nice movement in the next couple years as we complete the integration and recognize those synergies from the consolidation.
Tim Mulrooney: No, that's very helpful. And given the - we're running up against 5:00 here. I'll just throw one more out there. For a long time now, you guys have talked about 60% of new customer growth coming from no programmers. And the question I often get is where are these new customers coming from? Can you give us a few examples of new industries or verticals that you're entering or maybe in the early stages of penetration that maybe you weren't in 5 to 10 years ago? Uniform Rental has been around for a long time, obviously, and I'm just trying to get a better idea of where you're getting this very solid growth, where that's coming from. Thank you.
Paul Adler: Yes. You're right, Tim. We've talked about of our new business dollars, about 60% of them are coming from no programmers, those customers that don't have a rental program and yeah, I mean, there are a few buckets that we can talk about, the first is scrub rental. We've talked about that in the past. Scrubs was largely a direct sale, commodity and we work to change it into a rental program with a service element to help hospitals and other health care institutions control their inventory through those dispensing units, but that's something we've really gotten into in earnest in the last five years. It's a huge market and it's a market that we're in the very early innings of penetrating. And so we're getting some good wins, but we have a long way to go in that sector. Another good industry for us, the sector for us for no programmers is in the trades areas, that Carhartt product line that we've talked about, that rugged look. Those are garments that really appeal to people that work in the utility industries or plumbers, electricians, anyone in trades and we've had a lot of traction with that product. So - and then just in general, it's really the recognition that, I think Mike mentioned this earlier, we have to gravitate in the product line to where the employment is. We've done a very good job of that by creating these garments, some are branded, but also creating garments that are more retail inspired, polos and microbial shirts, et cetera that we can get into industries that are customer facing like resorts, theme parks, et cetera. And so, yeah, a lot of opportunity, that just kind of gives you an idea of some of those no programmers that are out there.
Mike Hansen: And Paul touched on garments and I would say another difference is, over the course of probably the last five to seven years, we've - because of the breadth of our product line, we lead with facility services much more than we did maybe ten years ago. And so we are able with our facility services, I think, we talked about this earlier, we can add value to almost every kind of business there is, because almost every business has doors that can use entrance mats, have restrooms that can use our rest room and hygiene products. Many of them have employees that can use our first aid and safety services. Almost all of them have fire protection needs and so we're able to lead with non-uniform rental opportunities and solutions much more than we did ten years ago and that has certainly helped us as well.
Operator: Thank you. We'll now take our next question from Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel.
Shlomo Rosenbaum: I just want to probe a little bit more about the component of the moving parts of attrition versus new business in terms of your calculation that G&K's revenue would decline 7% to 10%. What's a normal attrition rate for that business and can you just discuss that a little bit in what you might be doing to just try and offset some of that. Generally, I think you guys are very customer focused and I would expect you to be even more so in a situation like this.
Mike Hansen: Sure. So you've heard us probably talk about our customer retention being in the mid-90% range. And G&K ran a big - ran a good business and they were in the - their customer retention was in the low 90% range and so when we think about that, let's call it, 7-ish lost business factor, that's not unusual for our industry and the difference as I spoke to in the prepared remarks, the difference is we'll continue to see that and we're certainly doing our best to build relationships with our customers. But that happens and typically a business will replace that with the new business efforts and there will be a temporary disruption to that replacement as we train our reps and get them productive.
Shlomo Rosenbaum: And how long does it take you to train those reps, because what you're also doing is you're not taking unskilled reps, you're taking reps that have been doing things in a certain way and I guess you're improving upon it, but you're not taking someone - very often, you're not taking someone green.
Mike Hansen: We're not, but that doesn't mean that they train and they're up to - they're up to normalized productivity levels as soon as they're finished training. It's a process and while the training, the specific training, maybe over the course of a month or so, the ramp up in productivity takes a bit of time and then in our business Shlomo, I'm sure you understand this, the weekly sales are not huge businesses. This is a momentum kind of a business and our new sales partners are going to go from not selling much at all to ramping up to $100 to $200 in revenue per week. And so it's a - that ramp up takes some time to make an impact on the overall revenue of the company. And so as we think about the - that replacing, we certainly are going to see an impact to our fourth quarter growth rates of fiscal '18 and now continue into probably the first half of fiscal '19.
Shlomo Rosenbaum: Are you talking about the impact you're talking about where it's going to start to accelerate?
Mike Hansen: I'm talking about - when I talk about the impact, I'm talking about the fact that you're going to see some deceleration in our growth rate in that fourth quarter of fiscal '18 and into the first half of fiscal '19. So if you think about it, I mentioned that the revenue run rate of G&K is about 960 right now for our fourth quarter, right. We're guiding to 870 to 900 for the year. So clearly, our fourth quarter is going to have a less revenue for that block of business and that's going to impact growth. And that impact is going to happen for probably the first half of the year and then we'll start to see that acceleration come back.
Shlomo Rosenbaum: Just to be clear, you're talking about fiscal year '18 where you're going to see the impact or fiscal year '19 where you're going to see the slowdown?
Mike Hansen: Fourth quarter of '18 and first half of '19.
Shlomo Rosenbaum: So the training will come at that point in time after you've upgraded the systems?
Mike Hansen: No. The training is happening right now. The training is happening right now. It's just that again when we go through this period of time where this selling resource isn't bringing in much new business, it takes a little bit of time to recover from that.
Operator: Thank you. And we'll now take our final question from Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan.
Judah Sokel: It's actually Judah on for Andrew. Just a very quick question here at the end. I wanted to clarify the clean EPS number in the quarter. We called out $1.18 for legacy Cintas, and there was also $0.05 of contribution from G&K. So I think it's pretty clear that would imply a $1.23 if you include G&K together. But I wanted to confirm that the G&K results include that $9.5 million of amortization or $0.05 of EPS. So if you fully included G&K, I'm calculating an adjusted EPS of really $1.28. Is that the right way to think about it, adding back the amortization?
Mike Hansen: Well, you are correct in saying that certainly the $1.18 plus the $0.05 get you to $1.23 as a clean number. Yes. The amortization was $9.6 million in the quarter, which is roughly $0.03. So if you want to add that back, yes, that would get you to $1.28. And you'll notice when we convert to our guidance for fiscal '18 and show a comparison of fiscal '17, you'll notice that we show a baseline of 4.77 [ph]. And so just to be clear, that is then the Cintas legacy plus the G&K operating results plus the ASU impact on the full year that gets you to the 4.77. Is that clear, Judah?
Judah Sokel: Yeah. That is.
Operator: Thank you. And that does conclude today's question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back over to our speakers for any additional or closing remarks.
Mike Hansen: Well, thank you, again for joining us tonight. We look forward to talking to you as we complete our first quarter and have our conference call in September. Good night.
Operator: Thank you. That does conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation and you may now disconnect.

===== 2017 Q3  (2017-03-22 17:00:00) =====
Executives: Mike Hansen - VP, Finance and CFO Paul Adler - VP and Treasurer
Analysts: Hamzah Mazari - Macquarie Capital Jay Hanna - RBC Capital Markets Joe Box - KeyBanc Andrew Steinerman - JPMorgan Minaz Putnik - Barclays Adrian Paz - Piper Jaffray Justin Hauke - Robert W. Baird Jeff Goldstein - Morgan Stanley
Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Cintas Quarterly Earnings Results Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Mike Hansen, Vice President of Finance and Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead, sir.
Mike Hansen: Thank you and good evening. With me is Paul Adler, Cintas' Vice President and Treasurer. We will discuss our third quarter results for fiscal 2017. After our commentary, we will be happy to answer any questions. The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a Safe Harbor from civil litigation for forward-looking statements. This conference call contains forward-looking statements that reflect the Company's current views as to future events and financial performance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those we may discuss. I refer you to the discussion on these points contained in our most recent filings with the SEC. We are pleased to report that revenue for the third quarter, which ended February 28th was $1.281 billion, an increase of 5.3% over last year's third quarter. The organic growth rate, which adjusts for the impacts of acquisitions, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and differences in the number of work days was 6.5%. New business wins; penetration of existing customers with more products and services and customer retention remains strong. Organic growth for the Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment accelerated to a rate of 7.3%. Third quarter gross margin improved to 44.2% from 43.1% last year. As Cintas Chairman and CEO, Scott Farmer stated in this afternoon's press release, this is our 14th consecutive quarter of year-over-year gross margin improvement. This and our industry leading revenue growth are indicative of a healthy company, with significant opportunities ahead. We thank our employees whom we call partners for best in class execution and results. Gross margin of the Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment improved to 45%, an increase of 100 basis points, compared to last year's third quarter. The First Aid and Safety segment gross margin improved to 44.8%, a year-over-year increase of 260 basis points, due to the realization of synergies from the acquisition of ZEE Medical in fiscal 2016. Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue were 28.3% in the third quarter, compared to 27.3% in last year's third quarter. 50 basis points of the increase was the result of a difficult comparison due to favorable workers' comp experience in the prior year's third quarter. In addition, labor and related expenses increased as a percentage of revenue as we continue to prepare for the acquisition of G&K Services. Operating income for the third quarter of $195 million increased 0.9% from last year's third quarter. Operating income margin was 15.2%, compared to 15.9% in last year's third quarter. Third quarter operating income included $9 million or 0.7% of third quarter revenue of transaction expenses related to the previously announced agreement to acquire G&K. Excluding this G&K transaction related expense, our operating income margin was 15.9%. We're pleased with our incremental profit margins. Note that our third quarter had one less work day than last year. That's had negative impact of approximately 40 to 50 basis points on this year's operating margin due to many large expenses, including rental material cost, depreciation and amortization being determined on a monthly basis instead of a work day basis. In addition, as Paul will soon discuss in greater detail, energy had a negative impact on this year's third quarter operating margin of 50 basis points. So, to put it in perspective, excluding G&K transaction expenses, operating margin was same as last year's third quarter, despite about 100 basis points of headwinds from one less work day in energy. Net income and earnings per diluted share from continuing operations for the third quarter were $119 million, and $1.08 respectively. This quarter's EPS, included a positive $0.03 impact from a change in the accounting for equity compensation, as required under ASU 2016-09. Remember that this benefit shows up in the way of the lower effective tax rate, offset by higher equity compensation expense and share counts. We also had a $0.06 negative impact from expenses related to the G&K transaction, such as legal and professional expenses associated with the regulatory review. Exclusive of these items, EPS was $1.11. Yesterday, we closed on the acquisition of G&K. First and most importantly, I want to welcome our new partners from G&K. We look forward to getting to know you better and we remain very excited about this opportunity. As we have discussed, we continue to expect annual synergies in the range of $130 million to $140 million in the full year following the acquisition. We will now begin the process of integrating the two companies together. As Scott Farmer indicated in today's press release, we have pulled our revenue and EPS guidance for the remainder of the fiscal year ended May 31, 2017, because we need to complete the purchase accounting process and confirm our assumption used in estimating non-recurring costs. For example, in an acquisition of this size, we are required to use a third party to value our intangibles. There can be a fairly wide range of outcomes in this type of analysis, and we won't know that outcome until the third party completes its process. Another example is that we need to record all G&K fixed assets and inventory as fair value. Much of this work is performed by a third-party firm. Again, we will not know these values until the process is completed. In the absence of this information, providing a meaningful guidance range for our fourth fiscal quarter is not possible at this time. Paul will soon provide additional details of the quarter. Before I turn the call over to Paul though, I wanted to add that we are very pleased with our third quarter results. Excluding the impact of the G&K acquisition that will come in our fourth quarter, our third quarter results keep us on pace to attain the annual guidance previously provided, and to achieve a seventh consecutive year of organic growth in the mid to high single digits with double digit growth in EPS. I’ll now turn the call over to Paul.
Paul Adler: Thank you, Mike. First please note that our fiscal year 2017 contains one less work day than fiscal year 2016. As Mike stated, it was this quarter, the third quarter of fiscal 2017 that had one less day in the prior year quarter. One less day will negatively impact fiscal 2017 total revenue growth by about 40 to 50 basis points, and operating margin by approximately 10 to 15 basis points in comparison to fiscal 2016. The negative impact on the fiscal 2017 third quarter was about 40 to 50 basis points of revenue growth and about 40 to 50 basis points of operating margin. Our fiscal fourth quarter contained 66 work days, the same number in the prior year fourth quarter. We have two reportable operating segments, Uniform Rental and Facility Services and First Aid and Safety Services. The remainder of our business is included in All Other. All other consist primarily of fire protection services and our direct sale business. First Aid and Safety Services, and All Other are combined and presented as Other Services on the income statement. Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segments includes the rental and servicing of uniforms, mats and towels, and the provision of restroom supplies and other facility products and services. The segment also includes the sale of items from our catalogs to our customers on route. Uniform Rental and Facility Services revenue was $993 million, an increase of 6.1% compared to last year’s third quarter. Excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes, acquisitions and work day differences, the organic growth rate was 7.3%, compared to 6.5% last quarter. We continue to see the impact of weakness in the oil, gas and coal industry. However, as we predicted on last quarter’s earnings call, the impact has lessened. We estimate that the resulting decrease in revenue from affected customers lowered our organic growth rate by about 60 basis points in the third quarter. This compares to about a 75-basis point headwind in the previous quarter. Our Uniform Rental and Facilities Services segment gross margin was 45.0% for the third quarter, an increase of 100 basis points from 44.0% in last year’s third quarter. Energy related costs were about 20 basis points higher than in last year’s third quarter. In addition, job losses in oil, gas and coal negatively impacted this segment’s current year third quarter operating margin by about 30 basis points. So, on a net basis, the low price of oil had a negative impact on our Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating margin of 50 basis points. Keep in mind that margins were also negatively impacted by one less day of revenue. Therefore, gross margin expansion of 100 basis points was achieved despite about 100 basis points of headwind from one less work day and energy. Our First Aid and Safety Services operating segment includes revenue from the sale and servicing of First Aid products, Safety Products, and Training. This segment’s revenue for the third quarter was $124 million, which was 4.4% higher than last year’s third quarter. On an organic basis, the growth rate for the segment was 5.5%. Last quarter, we disclosed that we believe that the First Aid segment organic growth rate hit the bottom and the segment was positioned for improving organic growth rates. Acceleration in the organic growth rate from 3.3% in the second quarter to 5.5% this quarter was expected. Route consolidation and optimization have been completed. We previously disclosed that we added sales reps in our first quarter. ZEE Medical did not have a dedicated sales force as the business previously relied only upon SSRs to grow the business. The added sales reps will help us grow the acquired customer base through penetration with our broad range of products and services. We expect improving organic growth rates through the remainder of this fiscal year. This segment’s gross margin was 44.8% in the third quarter, compared to 42.2% in last year’s third quarter, an increase of 260 basis points. Our margins continue to benefit from the realization of acquisition synergies, including improved sourcing and the leveraging of existing warehouses. Our year-to-date gross margin dollars are up 51% over two years ago, and up 18% over last year. Our year-to-date gross margin percentage is almost back to pre-ZEE levels and our revenue of course is significantly greater. Our Fire Protection Services and Direct Sale businesses are reported in the All Other category. All Other revenue was $163 million, an increase of 1.9% compared to last year's third quarter. The organic growth rate was 2.4%. All Other gross margin was 39.1% for the third quarter of this fiscal year, compared to 38.9% for last year's third quarter. The direct sale business by its nature is not the recurring revenue stream that our other businesses are such as Uniform Rental and Facility Services and First Aid. Therefore, the growth rates are generally low and are subject to volatility, such as when we install a multi-million-dollar account. Our Fire business however continues to grow at a consistently rapid pace. The fire business organic growth rate was just short of 10%.  As Mike stated earlier, selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue were 28.3% in the third quarter compared to 27.3% in last year's third quarter. 50 basis points of the increase was the result of the difficult comparison due to favorable workers' compensation experience in the prior year third quarter. We're self-insured, which can result in some volatility from time-to-time. In addition, labor and related expenses increased as a percentage of revenue, as we continued to prepare for the acquisition of G&K. Finally, this year's third quarter includes SAP expenses amounting to about 20 basis points of revenue. Regarding SAP, since last quarter's earnings call more locations have been converted. We continue to be pleased with the conversion efforts and the capabilities of the new system. Due to the acquisition of G&K, we are planning and adjusting our SAP implementation plan as necessary.  Our effective tax rate on continuing operations for the third quarter was 34.5%, compared to 33.8% for last year's third quarter. This year's third quarter rate is lower than historical rates due to the adoption of ASU 2016-09 on stock compensation. Note that last year's third quarter effective tax rate benefited from the closing of a federal tax audit with favorable results. Our cash balances as of February 28, were $147 million, and we had no marketable securities as of quarter end. Cash flow from investing, or rather cash flow from operating activities in the current year quarter was $182 million, and free cash flow was about $119 million. Uses of cash in the third quarter included CapEx and payments of our regular annual dividend.  Capital expenditures for the third quarter were about $63 million. Our CapEx by operating segment was as follows. $55 million in Uniform Rental and Facility Services, $5 million in First Aid and Safety and $3 million in All Other. As of February 28, total debt was about $1.1 billion, consisting of $399 million in short term debt and $745 million of long-term debt. Subsequent to quarter end, debt increased about $2.3 billion to fund the acquisition of G&K. Sources of acquisition funds included the following; $100 million of G&K senior notes, $50 million of additional existing Cintas senior notes due in 2022, $1 billion of senior notes due in 2027, $650 million of senior notes due in 2022, a new term loan of $250 million and commercial paper of about $250 million. With this additional debt, we estimate that our leverage has increased to about 3.1 times debt to EBITDA. Our goal is to reduce our leverage to 2 times debt to EBITDA within three years. With $300 million of senior notes maturing in December that we will not refinance; $250 million of term loan and $250 million of commercial paper, we have structured our debt appropriately to achieve the goal. That concludes our prepared remarks. We're happy to answer your questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Hamzah Mazari with Macquarie Capital. Please go ahead.
Hamzah Mazari: The first question is just on customer attrition. Are you guys baking in any customer attrition post the G&K deal? Obviously, that's closed now. And any thoughts on the Uniform market potentially getting incrementally more competitive, as you work to integrate that deal?
Mike Hansen: Well, Hamzah, I would say that the industry is always very competitive and it will continue to be so. As it relates to the customer attrition or retention, I don't know that I expect much of a difference there, but let me speak a little bit towards revenue; our thoughts on revenue in general. So, when we think about the Cintas business as we move forward, we have no expectations for change. We continue to expect growth in that mid-to-high single-digits. When we think about the G&K revenue though, you can think about it in terms of there's a new business component, there is the kind of customer penetration, and there's a lost business or attrition component, in the normal course of doing business. And as we move forward, we're going to continue to have that customer attrition that we've seen in -- that G&K has seen historically, and that we'll likely see continue into the future. There will likely be a little bit of an increase due to disruption of the integration, but generally speaking I would say not a lot of change. The difference though will be the new business component. So as you can kind of think about new business and the G&K sales team over the course of the last seven months, they have been trying to sell in an environment where selling a five-year contract under kind of an uncertain future is, as you could imagine is quite difficult. So the new business component certainly has been pressured quite a bit over the last seven months. As we move into now the post-closing process, that momentum carries into our post-closing process. In addition, as we think about their sales people, you can imagine that the difficulty in selling new business and contractual new business in the environment resulted in some attrition. And so as we move forward, we will need to hire new people to replace some of those sales people, but also train all of their sales people as we move forward. So training them on selling our products and services, training them on our systems, using our processes et cetera and there certainly will be a productivity -- a negative productivity impact. So as we look forward, we will continue to probably see the normal customer attrition that the business has seen, maybe a little bit higher. But we will also see some significant pressures on the new business. And so as we think about that moving forward, our experience has been for years and years that we will see some pressure to the point where we may see revenue come down in the 5% to 10% range over the course of the next year or so.
Hamzah Mazari: That’s extremely helpful. And just a follow up question. Are there any divestitures build into your cost synergy target number of 130 to 140 or is that something you are working through right now?
Mike Hansen: There were no divestitures baked into that assumption.
Operator: Our next question comes from Gary Bissey with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Jay Hanna: Hi, this is actually Jay Hanna on for Garry today. I was wondering if you guys could give a little more detailed look at what the pace of those cost synergies will be? And maybe a more detailed timeline for the full integration of G&K within Cintas as well?
Mike Hansen: Well, as you probably have seen, we talked about $130 million to $140 million in annual synergies, fully realized in year four. We have also talked about this being fully accretive or accretive in our second full year. That would be our fiscal '19. As we move forward, we certainly have had a lot of assumptions about those synergies, but I will tell you over the course of the last seven months, one thing that I need to make sure is clear, is we have been operating as two separate companies, and that was a requirement, so that we were not jumping ahead of the regulatory process. And I tell you that because we are just now -- we just closed yesterday. We are just now getting into the confirming of our assumptions, and we need to do that before we can provide more timing, more specific timing on the synergies. But we do feel like we will be accretive in year two, and in year one we are going to have some onetime expenses that are non-recurring in nature; things like rebranding, asset impairments, severance, lease breakage type thing and we're going to be going to work over the course of the next several months, really confirming what those amounts will be. Once we do that, once we confirm our assumptions for the integration plan, we'll have a better idea of what fiscal '18 will look like and our expectation would be we certainly share that in July. But having said all of that, we certainly do think that there will be synergies in year one. We’re just not ready to provide any specific numbers.
Jay Hanna: Great. And then excluding the acquisition and following in this quarter, you spoke to it a little bit earlier. But do you think full year ’17 guidance, would it remain the same or possibly increase following third quarter?
Mike Hansen: I would say that we would likely have either left them the same or possibly narrowed by bringing the bottoms up a little bit. So third quarter, we are very pleased with the third quarter. I think we’ve got some nice momentum and execution going on in the business and we are poised to have a good fourth quarter.
Operator: And we’ll take our next question from Joe Box with KeyBanc. Please go ahead.
Joe Box: Yes. Hey guys. So I was hoping to dig into the 80 basis points sequential pick-up in organic growth for Uniform. Looks like there was about 15 basis points sequential tailwind from less oil and gas drag. So can you maybe put a little bit more color on the non-oil and gas improvement, really just aside from calling out ancillary products and better customer retention?
Paul Adler: Yes. Joe, it’s Paul. You are right, the 15 basis points is part of the math. I would say in addition to that, we had a very good strong quarter from a new business perspective, especially as it related to garments. And so not only do you benefit from the new business in terms of that additional recurring revenue, that you will receive from the garments going forward over these five-year agreements, but we have new business installed related to garments. You also have some good revenue in terms of peripheral charges, incentive fees and emblem costs. So that definitely helped as well. But really outside of that Joe, there was nothing extraordinary. It’s just the continuation of execution that the game plan, quality service, retention remained strong, a very strong organic revenue growth quarter, something we’re proud of, given all the excitement of the pending acquisition. But just continuation of what we’ve done the last six years of growing top-line and that 5% to 7% organically, and again proud of those growth rates compared to the competition, which has been posting much, much smaller organic growth rates.
Joe Box: I appreciate it Paul. And then just a question on guidance. I guess, I’m just curious, why not provide a non-cash goal post here. So purchase accounting is really kind of the biggest unknown. And then I guess just from an expectation standpoint, should we think about maybe an inter-quarter 8-K with guidance, once you guys get the third-party valuations done or should we be thinking about this as being maybe a more 4Q call type item?
Mike Hansen: As a relates to why not provide some sort of guidance, whether it’s cash or something else. Joe, we’re going to get busy right away and we’re going to get busy on the integration items. And as we do that, the businesses blur. It’s not like we’re going to go through the next two and slightly over two months and have two distinct businesses still by the end. They are going to get blurred, because we’re bringing them together and we’re going to be doing quite a bit of integration work. And it just -- it becomes very, very difficult to keep those pieces separate. And because of that we're not -- I don’t like the idea of trying to dissect that. If we do come up with the purchase accounting results during the quarter and we feel that we're in a position to provide them, you may see us do that, but our first goal is to really understand it and get it right and then provide.
Joe Box: Understood, and I do appreciate that the lines will get blurred here, but I assume that the fiscal year 4Q revenue guidance for standalone Cintas probably is still generally intact. Is that fair?
Mike Hansen: As we've talked about, yes. We think that's fair and it probably -- we would probably have narrowed it by bringing the bottom up. We feel good about the fourth quarter and the third quarter I think is very indicative of the second half of the year that we expected to have. So yes, the answer to your question is yes. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Our next question comes from Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan.
Andrew Steinerman: Hi, would you be willing to talk how long you think the amortization period will be. And in year one if it wasn't for the amortization, would the merger be accretive?
Mike Hansen: The amortization period will be 10 years most likely. We expect that to be in the range of about 3% to 4% of the deal value. And would it be accretive without that? I think yes. I think the answer Andrew is yes, that you can kind a think about that as a what, $66 million to $88 million annual number. It will be fairly a large non-cash number. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Minaz Putnik with Barclays. 
Minaz Putnik : Thank you, good evening gentlemen, and firstly congratulations on getting the deal done. So I appreciate -- I think why you I guess retracted the guidance to '17. And just to your point on calling out that amortization as a non-cash number in Q4. Going forward when you guys do initiate '18 guidance, will you be -- if not giving sort of the cash EPS number at least call out all these non-cash charges pretty clearly for us to calculate that?
Mike Hansen: That will be our goal yes. We will likely provide GAAP guidance but we will -- our goal will be to give you some of these large items to give you a sense of what the performance detail will look like.
Minaz Putnik: Okay that would be very helpful. And then just on the organic performance, another strong quarter obviously. Just like how you describe the three components for G&K in terms of new business penetration and retention, or attrition, can you just help lay that out in terms of where the growth is coming for Cintas standalone right now?
Paul Adler: Definitely new businesses continue to be the strongest driver of the growth. As we've said it, new business in terms of new customers; we're still selling that 60/40 split of 60% of the new business wins, our new programmers versus the 40% taking market share. So that's been very consistent through this year and really in the near past as well. New business also includes the penetration of our existing customers. That is certainly part of our vision and that continues at a very good pace. A lot of the hygiene products that we've talked about in the past, our Sanis signature series, new offering in the last couple of years, that's really helped us with penetration. Retention has been roughly 95%. So still strong, no significant change in that. So, really no significant movement in any of the key component of organic growth drivers.
Minaz Putnik: And that 40% share gain you talked about, does that typically end up being from the smaller regional players or do they -- or is it a broad mix with the national players as well?
Mike Hansen: No, it's a broad mix of wins versus small, medium, large competitors.
Operator: Our next question comes from George Tong with Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.
Adrian Paz: Hi this is Adrian Paz calling for George. I just have question on the G&K transaction. Can you provide -- on the synergies, can you provide the breakdown of what's going to be revenue synergies versus what's going to be synergies?
Mike Hansen: We have not included any revenue synergies in that $130 million to $140 million. Those are cost synergies and they come in four primary buckets and in no particular order. We think of them in terms of material cost. So, a sourcing benefit. We think of them in terms of production improvements. So, the more efficient use of capacity. We think of them in terms of the route density allowing us to use less fuel because of more dense routes. And then we think about it in terms of overhead and the reduction of duplicate overhead. Did not include any revenue synergies in that amount. And one of the reasons we didn’t is because we need to get through the integration work. We need to get them on to our systems. We need to optimize the routes and we need to have our new G&K partners really trained and comfortable in selling our product line, and that takes a little bit of time.
Adrian Paz: And on the -- so with the SAP implementation, do you expect your cost savings from the SAP platform to be bigger within the G&K transaction or are your estimates since then?
Mike Hansen: We do expect the benefit to be bigger. We are -- first of all the additional revenue certainly provides better leverage over the system. But certainly, operating on one system in total certainly will create additional benefits for us. And the better visibility into all of our new customers will certainly help us in terms of identifying cross seller penetration opportunities, identifying where certain industries we are -- customers in certain industries where we believe we have got a good product mix to provide value, but certain customers in that industry don’t have some of those. We think there is a lot of opportunity, and certainly by adding the G&K volume, that certainly helps it out.
Paul Adler: And to add to that. More benefits and then really not a lot of significant additional costs; that's the beauty of the acquisition. Just another positive is that we get to leverage G&K over that existing $140 million spend. So, we'll have some have additional licensing costs, nominal amount but the capital investment is not going to increase.
Adrian Paz: And if I could just ask one more, on the non-programming market or the no-programmer market, how do you think about that market and how much growth you believe is available there and do those declines have the margin profile as your existing clients?
Mike Hansen: We think there is a lot of runway there. As Paul said about two thirds of our new business comes from that no-programmer segment, and it's been that way for a long time. The -- we have talked a little bit about what that no-programmer may look like. It could be outdoor trades, people that are now renting our Carhartt products. It could be culinary people now renting our Chef Works product, it could be healthcare workers now renting our scrub rental programs. There are lots of opportunities there and there will continue to be. The margin profile is I would say is not significantly different from any other type of account, but certainly we know that with all of our customers the more penetration that we can take -- that we can have, the product and services that we can add to them, the more valuable those stocks become. Usually the lesser the probability that they leave us because we are more fully penetrated. So once we sell any account, penetration becomes really important afterwards.
Operator: And our next question comes from Justin Hauke with Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead.
Justin Hauke: I just wanted to talk a little bit more about maybe how does think about revenue synergies, and I guess the reason why I ask is obviously you guys have been very successful in broadening out services that you offered. You are acquiring 170,000 customers here. Is there a difference, and maybe you can give us the number of average services you sell to your current customers and how that compared to G&K; so we can kind of think about what the incremental opportunity to sell into that base is? And I guess related to that also would be, is there any material difference in the 95% retention rate that you have and the retention rate that maybe you are acquiring here?
Mike Hansen: I would -- so first of all, I don’t know the penetration of G&K. Again, we haven’t had visibility and insight until really starting today, and we’ll start to learn that more and more. So it’s hard for me to try to estimate what any revenue penetration might be. We have told -- we have talked a lot about, if you think about our Uniform Rental customers for example, the highest penetrated item is our mats, entrance mats. And I would say about 60% of our Uniform Rental customers have entrance mats. That doesn’t mean they have as many as we believe that they should we have, but it means they have at least some presence in the entrance mat. In addition to that, all of our other products are less than 20% penetrated. So we have a lot of runway on our own and I would suspect that G&K’s profile is from a Uniform Rental and match, is probably not a lot different than ours, although that is purely a guess. And I would say that the broader line for us likely in the hygiene and the chemical cleaning First Aid and Safety Fire Protection, those become nice opportunities. I don’t have any kind of information as far as qualifying that, because we just don’t know enough about those customers. And an example would be, I want to see, or we would want to see the profile of the G&K customers. And that’s when we start to analyze or look for the opportunities in terms of what are the products and services we can provide to that. So we need some time to be able to do that. As it relates to your second question of retention, again don’t have specifics on that, but I would say that they are probably not two different from ours. Although, I would suggest that because our growth rate is so much higher than the industry in general, that our retention is likely a little bit better.
Justin Hauke: Okay, great. No, I understand it’s still early. So that’s fair, and we’ll look forward to learning more about it, as you learn more about it. I guess just two more mechanical questions into modeling purposes. First, are you planning on reporting all of G&K in the rental segment or should we think that some of it goes in the other business? And how much of it would go there? And then second, the SAP cost that you previously outlined, the 40 million to 45 million for 2018, how should we think about that number, now that you’re bringing in G&K? Is that still the right number or does it have to be larger than that?
Mike Hansen: So your first question is, yes. I would say almost all of that revenue and operating income would fall into the rental segment. As it relates to the second question, we will give some thoughts on SAP, when we provide our guidance in July. But I would suggest that it’s going to be lower than 40 to 45 for -- probably because, we’ve seen that we’ve been a little bit more efficient this year than we expected. And the additional -- any additional costs related to an integration of G&K will come in the way of length and integration or implementation process. So I wouldn't expect that it drives up our costs in fiscal '18. I would just -- I think we talked a little bit about it drives the implementation process into fiscal '19. So we'll see a little bit of -- a little bit more expense in '19 than we initially expected, because of the duration with G&K. But again, the process has been going well and we've been spending less than we expected, and I would expect that results in lower numbers for '18. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Our next question comes from Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. 
Jeff Goldstein: Hey this is actually Jeff Goldstein on for Toni. I wanted to piggyback a little bit on an earlier question. One of your primary competitors called out industry weakness in the most recently completed quarter. Can you just comment on what you're seeing in the marketplace, why you think you continue to have more; and if you've seen any type of irrational behavior among competitors, maybe in anticipation of your merger with G&K.
Mike Hansen: I would say from a -- what are we seeing differently. From an economic standpoint, I would say that our third quarter from an economy standpoint didn't really feel any different than our first two quarters of this fiscal year, other than there has been a lot of sentiment about maybe the new administration being a little bit more pro-business et cetera. But I would say I'm not sure that's translated much into what we've seen on the street. Having said that it's been a constructive environment, and with the exception of the oil and gas vertical, which we've in fact seen get a little bit better, we haven't seen much of a change one way or the other. And because of that, as you've seen, we've continued to execute well and continued at maybe organic growth levels of the first half of the year and in fact even a little bit better. And I think that is simply as Paul mentioned good execution, good new business productivity. Our sales people are doing a great job.  As it relates to your second question of are we seeing any irrational behavior, I would just say that it's always very competitive. Once we get into the to talk more of our G&K partners, we may find that it's -- it was a probably a little bit more aggressive on G&K customers. But we certainly know when an acquisition is announced the competition gets very aggressive around the acquired customers. And I would say that's kind part for the course.
Jeff Goldstein: Okay. And then can you just provide a little more color on the sequential decline in First Aid margins and what the big driver of that beyond just the one fewer workday? And then just longer term, do you think the First Aid segment could ever close the margin gap with rental or do you see kind of structural differences in those businesses of that.
Paul Adler: Yes Jeff, First Aid we were pleased with the results overall. As we talked about in the prepared remarks, we felt like last quarter that we had hit a bottom, and that became reality and then we expect those organic growth rates to continue to climb. That business should grow in the high single-digits. That's what it grew coming into ZEE, and that's what we expect going forward. In terms of the margins though, we're -- the gross margins continue to improve. We mentioned in the prepared remarks, how much the dollars are up over couple of years, 50 some odd percent, 18% year-over-year increase in gross margin dollars. The incremental gross margins have been very strong. Last year they were in the 30% range. This year last two quarters they were 100%. So gross margins are moving along as we expected, as we continue to realize those synergies. SG&A we do have a little bit of heavier investment in the selling part of that component. As we mentioned in our first quarter we invested in the sales force to be able to grow that acquired big block of ZEE business. And they've only been there what, a quarter or two at most. They'll continue to become more productive; they'll grow that top line, we'll get that leverage and so we are optimistic about not only the top line growth but the margin improvement going forward.
Mike Hansen: I think Jeff, as Paul mentioned, we've made an investment in our sales team there. ZEE did not have a sales team and so we've -- as we came out of the system conversion, it was time to start really selling in a little bit more -- well, in higher volumes and that's what we did. We invested to be able to do that. Do we have the confidence that those margins can get into those mid to high teens? We certainly do and if you go back to our fiscal '15 results, we were at about 13.8 for the year of fiscal '15, but the last three quarters all exceeded 14%. And with the addition of the ZEE business, that certainly is going to benefit us long term and we really like the business. It's doing exactly what we would expect that it should do, and those margins will continue to improve.
Operator: It appears there are no further questions at this time. Mr. Hansen I'd like to turn the conference back over to you for any additional or closing remarks.
Mike Hansen: Well thank you for joining us tonight. We'll issue our fourth quarter earnings in mid-July and we look forward to speaking with you again at that time. Good night.
Operator: And that does conclude today's presentation. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Cintas Quarterly Earnings Results Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Mike Hansen, Vice President of Finance and Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead, sir.
Mike Hansen: Good evening and thank you for joining us tonight. With me is Paul Adler, Cintas' Vice President and Treasurer. We will discuss our second quarter results for fiscal 2017. After our commentary, we will be happy to answer any questions. The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a Safe Harbor from civil litigation for forward-looking statements. This conference call contains forward-looking statements that reflect the company's current views as to future events and financial performance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ materially from those we may discuss. I refer you to the discussion on these points contained in our most recent filings with the SEC. We are pleased to report that revenue for the second quarter which ended November 30 was $1.297 billion, an increase of 6.4% over last year's second quarter. The organic growth rate which adjusts for the impacts of acquisitions and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations was 5.7%. Organic growth for the Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment accelerated to a rate of 6.5% from 5.9% in our first quarter. Second quarter gross margin improved to 44.1% from 43.3% last year. Scott Farmer, Cintas' Chairman and Chief Executive Officer stated in today's press release that this is our 13th consecutive quarter of year-over-year gross margin improvement. As Scott mentioned this accomplishment plus our industry leading organic sales growth is a great reflection of the significant opportunities we have ahead of us and of the great execution of our employees whom we call partners. Gross margin of the Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment improved to 44.7%, an increase of 80 basis points compared to last year's second quarter. The First Aid and Safety segment gross margin improved to 46.1% representing both the year-over-year and the sequential increase of 290 and 30 basis points respectively, due to the realization of synergies from the acquisition of ZEE Medical in fiscal 2016. Operating income for the second quarter of fiscal 2017 of $203 million increased 1.3% from last year's second quarter. Operating income margin was 15.6% compared to 16.4% in last year's second quarter. Second quarter operating income included $3.3 million or 0.3% of second quarter revenue of transaction expenses related to the previously announced agreement to acquire G&K Services. Net income from continuing operations for the second quarter was $123 million compared to $115 million in last year's second quarter. Earnings per diluted share or EPS from continuing operations for the second quarter were $1.13 which included a negative $0.02 impact from G&K transaction expenses, compared to $1.03 in last year's second quarter. Second quarter net income and EPS from continuing operations increased 6.9% and 9.7% respectively compared to last year's second quarter. Excluding the negative impact of the G&K acquisition expenses net income and EPS from continuing operations increased 8.8% and 11.7% respectively compared to last year's second quarter, and net income margin from continuing operations improved to 9.7% compared to 9.5% in last year's second quarter. We're updating our annual guidance, we expect fiscal 2017 revenue to be in the range of $5.180 billion to $5.225 billion, and fiscal 2017 EPS from continuing operations to be in the range of $4.57 to $4.65. This guidance includes the benefit from our adoption of accounting standards update 2016-09 entitled improvements to employees share based payment accounting, and the impact of one less workday in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016. This guidance also includes second quarter year-to-date G&K transaction Expenses, but does not include any future G&K transaction expenses. Please refer to the table in today's press release for more information.  As Scott Farmer was recorded [ph] in today's press release, we are pleased with our second quarter results. They've put us in a solid position to again achieve record revenue and to grow our EPS double digits for the seventh consecutive year. We thank our partners for striving to exceed expectations and in doing so delivering best in class results. Before I turn the call over to Paul, I'd like to provide a brief update on our acquisition of G&K. We are excited about this opportunity and the long-term value creation for Cintas, its employee partners and its shareholders. When we announced the transaction in August, we indicated that the merger was subject to approval by G&K shareholders, regulatory clearances in both the U.S. and Canada and other customary closing conditions. The merger was approved by G&K shareholders in November. We continue to work toward obtaining regulatory clearance and completing the other closing conditions. We remain optimistic that the deal will close no later than the end of the second calendar quarter of 2017. In order to avoid creating speculation, we will not be providing any additional commentary on this process. We will update the market going forward as appropriate. I will now turn the call over to Paul for additional information.
Paul Adler: Thank you, Mike. First, please note that our fiscal year 2017 contains one less workday than in fiscal year 2016. It is the third quarter of fiscal 2017 that has one less day than the prior year quarter. We estimate that this will negatively impact fiscal 2017 total revenue growth by about 40 to 50 basis points and operating margin by approximately 10 to 15 basis points in comparison to fiscal 2016. For those of you modeling our results by quarter please keep this in mind. Our third quarter is generally not as strong as the fourth quarter due to reasons including the resetting of payroll taxes, and this year it will also be negatively impacted by one less day of revenue. In addition energy comps will be very difficult in our third quarter as gasoline and diesel prices were at their lowest levels in last year's third quarter. And finally we will spend more on the branding campaign in the third quarter than in the fourth quarter.  As Mike stated, total revenue increased organically by 5.7% in the second quarter. Driven largely by new business wins, penetration of existing customers with more products and services, and strong customer retention. Total company gross margin was 44.1% for the second quarter of this fiscal year, compared to 43.3% last year, an improvement of 80 basis points. We have two reportable operating segments, Uniform Rental and Facility Services, and First Aid and Safety Services. The remainder of our business is included in All Other. All Other consists primarily of Fire Protection Services and our Direct Sale business. First Aid and Safety Services and All Other are combined and presented as Other Services on the income statement. Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segment included the rental and servicing of uniforms, mats and towels, and the provision of restroom supplies and other facility products and services. The segment also includes the sale of items from our catalogs to our customers on route. Uniform Rental and Facility Services revenue was a little over $1 billion, an increase of 7.2% compared to last year's second quarter. Excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes and acquisitions. The organic growth rate was 6.5%. We continue to see the impacts of weakness in the oil, gas and coal industries, however, we believe that we have hit the bottom. We estimate that the resulting decrease in revenue from affected customers lowered our organic growth rate by about 75 basis points in the second quarter. This compares to about 110 basis point impact in the previous quarter. Our Uniform Rental and Facilities Services segment gross margin was 44.7% for the second quarter, an increase of 80 basis points from 43.9% in last year’s second quarter. Energy related costs were 10 basis points lower than in last year's second quarter. However, job losses previously mentioned in oil, gas and coal negatively impacted this segment's current year second quarter operating margin by about 40 basis points. So, on a net basis, the low price of oil had a negative impact on our Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating margin of 30 basis points because the benefit of lower prices at the pump for our fleet of trucks was more than offset by the negative impact to operating margin resulting from weakness in our oil, gas and coal customers. Our First Aid and Safety Services operating segment includes revenue from the sale and servicing of First Aid products, Safety Products, and Training. This segment's revenue for the second quarter was $125 million, which was about 4% higher than last year's second quarter. On an organic basis, the growth rate for the segment was 3.3%. The reduction in overall segment organic growth is due to the continued assimilation of the ZEE Medical business. Route consolidation and optimization continued in the second quarter as expected. However, in examining the monthly organic growth rates of the second quarter, we believe that we saw the bottom followed by an upswing in the growth rates in the final months of the quarter. We previously disclosed that we added sales reps in our first quarter. ZEE Medical did not have a dedicated sales force as the business previously relayed only upon SSRs to grow the business. The added sales reps were help us grow the acquired customer base by penetrating with our broad range of products and services. As a result of this investments in addition to a bottoming of growth rates in the second quarter, we expect improving organic growth rates through the remainder of this fiscal year. This segment's gross margin was 46.1% in the second quarter compared to 43.2% in last year's second quarter, an increase of 290 basis points. Also, we are pleased to note that gross margin improved again on a sequential basis, this time by 30 basis points. Our margins are benefiting from the realization of acquisition synergies, including improved sourcing and the leveraging of existing warehouses. We have about 16 months of results since the ZEE acquisition. There is more work to be done and exciting opportunities ahead. However, we are very pleased with progress and performance to date. Large acquisitions have a short term impact to growth rates as we on board and good will the acquired customers and train the SSRs on our products, services and processes. This is typical, and we know that growth rates will soon improve. In the interim we have made significant strides in expanding gross margin. Our year-to-date gross margin dollars are up 53% over two years ago and up 22% over last year. Our year-to-date gross margin percentage is almost back to pre-ZEE levels and our revenue of course is significantly greater.  Our Fire Protection Services and Direct Sale businesses are reported in the All Other category. All Other revenue was $167 million, an increase of 3.5% compared to last year's second quarter. Organic growth rate was 2.8%. All Other gross margin was 38.5% for the second quarter of this fiscal year compared to 39.6% for last year's second quarter. As we have mentioned previously the Direct Sale business by its nature is not the recurring revenue stream that our other businesses are, such as Uniform Rental and Facilities Services and First Aid. Therefore the growth rates are generally low and are subject to volatility, such as when we install a multi-million dollar account. Our Fire business however continues to grow at a rapid pace, the Fire business organic growth rate was a little over 10% and operating margin expanded. Regarding selling and general and administrative expenses, total company SG&A was 28.2% as a percentage of second quarter revenue compared to a total company SG&A in last year's second quarter of 26.8%. The increase was the result of strategic investments, as well as the 70 basis point increase in employee medical expenses. The strategic investments include a new enterprise resource planning system, the national branding campaign ready for the work day and sales resources to grow recently acquired customers and our First Aid and Safety segments.  Regarding the increase in medical expenses, note that we’re self-insured and we had a handful of atypical very expensive claims in the quarter. I mentioned that SG&A was impacted by our investments in an enterprise resource planning system, namely SAP. SAP amounted to about 20 basis points of expenses related to the piloted operations. We continue to be pleased with the conversion efforts and the capabilities of the new system. Since last quarter’s earnings call, more locations have been included in the pilots, also with the upcoming acquisition of G&K we’re planning and adjusting our SAP implementation plan as necessary.  Our internal SAP resources are involved in this effort, as a result we expect SAP expenses in fiscal 2017 to be less and estimate a range of $20 million to $25 million. As of November 30, short term debt was comprised of commercial paper in the amount of $66 million. We expect this amount to be temporally higher as of the end of the third quarter due to payment of our regular dividend. On December 2, we paid an annual dividend of $1.33 per share, an increase of 26.7% over last year’s annual dividend. We’ve increased this dividend for 33 consecutive years, which is every year since we went public in 1983. The annual dividend is an important part of our capital allocation strategy and illustrates our enduring commitment to effectively deploying cash to increase shareholder value. During the third quarter of fiscal 2016, we entered into an interest rate lock agreement with a notational value of $550 million for our forecasted debt issuance, in anticipation of debt issuance for the closing of the G&K acquisition and to protect same cost from rising interest rates. We recent entered into interest rate lock agreements with a notional value of $950 million. Our effective tax rate on continuing operations for the second quarter was 34.9% compared to 37.4% for last year's second quarter. The decrease in the effective tax rate year-over-year is attributable to both the favorable settlement of a prior year federal tax audit and the adoption of ASU 2016-09 on stock compensation. We expect the annual effective tax rate for continuing operations for fiscal 2017 to be about 34.7%. Our cash balance as of November 30 was $143 million and we had no marketable securities as of quarter end. Cash and marketable securities decreased about $20 million from the balances of August 31st. Cash flow from operating activities as of November 30 year-to-date increased 14% from the prior year period. Uses of cash in the second quarter included CapEx and repayments of debt. Capital expenditures for the second quarter were about $76 million our CapEx by operating segment was as follows, $66 million in Uniform Rental and Facility Services, $6 million in First Aid and Safety and $4 million in All Other. We expect CapEx for fiscal 2017 to be in the range of $290 million to $310 million. This range includes about $40 million of CapEx related to our SAP implementation. Finally, in the second quarter we received a payment from the buyer of our investment in Shredit, proceeds were about $26 million and recorded in the investing section of the cash flow statement. That concludes our prepared remark. We are happy to answer your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We do have our first question from Minaz Putnik with Barclays Capital.
Minaz Putnik: Good evening gentlemen, thanks for the call, first question is just around the acceleration in the Uniform Rentals business, maybe just a little bit more color related -- was it broad based, was it a couple of -- was it selling more mat and towels, anything there, how sustainable do you think that is?
Mike Hansen: Well we saw our organic growth from the first quarter this second quarter accelerated about 60 basis points as Paul said about 35 basis points was because of the lessening oil and gas customer impact and so I guess I would say you know we've seen quite steady performance except for that vertical for some time now and I would say that that is sustainable as we move forward in this economic type of environment, if we see the economy change one way or the other we may see some change, but we feel very good about our execution and that's kind of where we've been, that's where our results have been for a number of quarters except for that one vertical.
Minaz Putnik: And I think Paul has said that you think oil and gas is at the bottom, 75 base impact in 2Q, how should we think of that impact in the quarter lessening going forward like is 35 basis points the right number like you saw this quarter?
Paul Adler: Yes Minaz, this is Paul. We estimate that that headwind that went from 110 to 75 will continue to step down in Q3 and Q4 such that you know for the full year the headwind would probably be in the 75 to 85 basis point range for the full year.
Minaz Putnik: And then just on First Aid and Safety, your comments on improving growth rate for the remainder fiscal year, again just some color on -- from 3.3 how do we step it up? I know you talked about monthly it was better, I was wondering if you could maybe put some numbers on those monthly rates, or any color on how we should model that?
Mike Hansen: Paul mentioned that we saw some acceleration through the quarter, in the last month of the quarter we were about 4.5 and I would expect to see step up from there in the third and then little bit more step up in the fourth. We're not ready to give particular guidance, but we expect that to return to that high single-digit low double-digits overtime, and we certainly expect to make progress on that in the back half of the year.
Operator: Our next question comes from Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley.
Toni Kaplan: SG&A was a little bit higher than we had expected in the quarter even adjusting for the transaction expenses and you called out SAP in the national branding campaign and medical expenses as been big drivers there, SAP you're going to keep investing in this year, but just when we think about the other two would you expect those to come down at all, or would you expect sort of double-digit SG&A expense growth for the rest of '17 as well?
Mike Hansen: I would say this, first of all Paul called out medical and certainly medical was a spike of 70 basis points this quarter, again as he said, we had some -- we had a combination of a handful of high dollar claims that hit us this quarter. We don't see that as a trend going forward. As it relates to the other items that Paul pointed out in terms of -- let me speak to SAP for a second, we certainly have guided for more SAP expense in the back half of the year, as we kind of move out of the pilot and into the full implementation. The spend that we have talked about tonight $20 million to $25 million, you can imagine the bulk of that is in the second half of the year. But it is lower because we're starting to combine a little bit the SAP and the G&K system conversion and so we're going to make sure that we've a coordinated effort to move forward in the right way with both of those projects. If you kind of think about the first half of the year, the first quarter we were up about 70 basis points over last year. Second quarter without that medical spike we're up 70 basis points and we will continue to invest in SAP in preparation for the G&K closing. And we'll have some of that ready for the workday. So, yes, Toni, we will see some heightened SG&A as we continue to prepare for these two large projects. We want to make sure that we are providing the right resources for each of them.
Toni Kaplan: Can you talk about how you're anticipating the impact from the new administration will be, whether it's on taxes, labor growth, wages or anything else that you think will be especially impactful to your business.
Mike Hansen: Certainly we've seen a lot of positive sentiment and at this point in time it's just sentiment and so we've got ways to go before we see anything impactful, but having said that, look if we see lower corporate income tax rates that will be certainly beneficial for us because we're mostly a U.S. based company. If we see a repatriation opportunity certainly that's not significant for us, but if we see a lot of cash coming back and flowing into the economy that's going to be good for our customers and ultimately good for us. And then if we see some infrastructure spend that's going to be good for construction, for equipment and certainly that's going to benefit our customers and eventually benefit us. But I would say again Toni, we are a ways away from seeing anything yet and I -- as we think about our year, we are not including any benefits from changes from the new administration, we absolutely like how our year is going so far, we've got a very good organic growth rate, we've seen Rental continue to be strong First Aid is going to continue to be strong in the second half of the year. We've seen some really nice gross margins and gross margin improvements, so we feel like we've got a very healthy business that's executing very well and boy if we get some help in the back half of the year from changes from the new administration that will be even better. 
Toni Kaplan: Okay, thanks for the answers, and happy holidays.
Operator: Our next question comes from Nate Brochmann with William Blair. 
Nate Brochmann : So I wanted to ask a couple of things. One, obviously over the last five years you've really kind of changed the direction of the company in terms of developing new end markets and new services and what not. Could you talk a little bit about how the culture has evolved along with that in terms of supporting those new entrepreneurial efforts? And also two, just kind of looking forward, where do you think the next milestones are over the next three to five years post integration at G&K and the SAP in terms of some of the ongoing efforts to continue those various growth drivers.
Mike Hansen: Well you're right Nate. I think today and over the last five years, we've been a more innovative company than maybe 10 and 15 years ago. I think, if you go back kind of prior to the last cycle. We were kind of building the footprints still, we we're adding sales reps and we were getting a lot of growth in that manner. And as we fully build out that footprint, and as we got into the great recession, we started certainly to recognize that we can't wait for employment to come back and we have to be more innovative and we have to create products and services that our customers really value and want to use, we've got to create garments that our customers want to wear, not just have to wear. I think we've done a great job of that. And we’ve got some active channels of feedback from our customers, from our service sales reps, we’ve got an active R&D program, we are looking for vendors to partner with like Carhartt. And so we -- there is no doubt we kind of changed from a company 10 and 15 years ago where we were building a footprint to a company that really looking for more and unique ways of serving businesses. So as we move forward then, we’ve got some exciting thing ahead obviously and that is the SAP and the G&K integrations. And as we move forward from there, I think there still are many opportunities to create products and services that pull even more types of customers into our customer base and to provide them with broader products and services. So we’re going to continue to look for those kinds of opportunities. And Nate, I would say one of the biggest assets that we’ve got certainly the biggest assets are our people and our culture, but really when you think about it, one of the biggest assets we have got is a great infrastructure to provide services close to a million businesses and we’ve got that infrastructure that can reach many more businesses as well. And so we are a nice avenue for many vendors to provide products and services. And I think that’s something that we can continue to take advantage of as we move forward.
Nate Brochmann: Thanks, that’s very helpful for the insight. And just one little bit of quick clarification, last question but, talking about the encouraging sentiment, I mean clearly we feel that throughout the market in terms of the economy and some of the larger corporations out there, when you say positive sentiment, are you referring to just kind of that nuance, are you hearing that out of your customers as well in terms of kind of maybe some of that individual positive sentiment percolating up a little bit from your sales force?
Mike Hansen: Well, I think -- I would say more of it is coming from just kind of the general economic discussions, the rally in the stock market, the rise in the interest rate environment. I would say more of it is coming from that. When we think about the business, our specific business, in the second quarter, I would say if you kind of push aside a lot of this sentiment and noise, the economic environment for us in the second quarter didn’t feel a whole lot different than its felt in last few quarters with the exception of that oil and gas vertical, not deteriorating anymore and maybe stabilizing a little bit. But generally speaking I would say the economic environment doesn’t feel a whole lot different today than it has over the last few quarters.
Nate Brochmann: Fair enough. Thank you very much for the time. Appreciated.
Operator: Our next question comes from Andrew Steinerman with JP Morgan.
Andrew Steinerman: You presented the way you have your fiscal year 2017 EPS guide little bit differently in the second quarter press release and the first quarter press release, I just wanted to make sure, I was getting the math correct here, I believe that Cintas lowered the range of the 2017 EPS -- range of EPS before the accounting benefit and before the G&K transaction cost by $0.03, I could calculate, why I think it’s $0.03, but I was just wondering is that the way you see the difference between the range before today and the range after today, when looking at EPS before counting benefit and before G&K costs?
Mike Hansen: And just to make sure, did you say lowered by $0.03?
Andrew Steinerman: EPS, yes I think you lowered the range by $0.03.
Mike Hansen: That’s not the way I see it. So when we think about the -- and by the way we added the table because it is a little bit -- there are some moving parts and we wanted to make sure that we were as clear as we could be about it. So when I think about the first quarter, our range overall was 455 to 463, and that included a negative $0.02 from G&K in the first quarter and at that time, we had told you, we thought that ASU impact was $0.07, would be $0.07 for the year. That kind of gets us to 450 to 458, compared to tonight’s range or today’s range of 451 to 459. So I would see it as, I mean it’s really about the same but a penny higher.
Operator: Our next question comes from Hamzah Mazari with Macquarie Capital. 
Hamzah Mazari : Mike just wondering, on your next financing cost, you spoke about locking in financing and interest rate, certain interest rate. Could you give us a sense of how we should think about pro forma and that financing cost and would that be an offset to your 130 million to 140 million synergy number you’ve put out there for G&K?
Mike Hansen: So back at August, when we announced the transaction, we had talked about a, roughly a 4% rate and I would expect that we’ll be a little bit better than that. We have locked some of the rates, but not all of them. So there will still be some movement, but I would expect that we may be a little bit better than that.
Hamzah Mazari : Okay and just last question, with the newer administration if there is a higher tariff on overseas sourcing, does that impact you guys at all or is that not material, and any color there would be great? Thank you.
Mike Hansen: Well, we certainly have an active global supply chain and we source from all over the world and we do our best to take advantage of existing trade agreements. I would say if the new administration pulled back on existing trade agreements or made changes to existing trade agreements, there could be some impact and we’ll do our best to work around that. So for example we have production in Haiti and we take advantage of the trade agreements with Haiti, we have some NAFTA benefits and if those go away then we’ll certainly have to determine how to adjust. Having said that, when you think about the cost of materials for us, in specifically garments, let’s keep in mind rental revenue is about 50% of the Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment. When you think about the cost of rentals we have the material cost, the production cost and the service cost, and so the material cost is certainly not the majority of that. When you think about then the material cost, the biggest cost in there is labor and so we'll work to see how can we manage that labor input as best we can. And so I guess what I am telling you is, it's a large part of our cost structure but it's not, it’s not significant and it happens over a long period of time. So for example we have to go source it, then we bring it into our distribution center where is stays for a turn, then it gets shipped to our rental locations where we put it into service and we amortize it over 18 months. So it takes quite a while to see the full impact of changes to our sourcing, and while we're going through that long supply chain timeframe we would be working towards improving our sourcing capability. So we're keeping our eyes on it, no question about it, and we'll react appropriately.
Operator: Next question comes from Andy Whitman with Robert W. Baird.
Andy Whitman: Great so, hi guys I wanted to just -- a little bit more on the guidance question, I agree with you it’s a I guess a penny raise, if you go a step further I guess you cut the SAP investment this year by about $5 million, that's $0.03 the other way, but then Healthcare looks like a surprise that was about a $0.04 hit in the positive direction if you add it back. So I guess those if you just assume SAP and Healthcare then you kind of, you’re still back to the kind of flat to maybe a penny pick up, would you agree with that Mike.
Mike Hansen: Yes, I would say its right around there Andy. You know when we think about our guidance for the second half of the year we think about, look we feel very good about the revenue, we feel very-very good about the gross margin, we have a healthy business and its executing well. We also have two very large and important projects ahead in SAP and in G&K, and we're going to make sure that we are investing in the right way to make sure that we implement those in the best way that we can. And so as I mentioned to Tony a little bit ago, we will continue to see some elevated SG&A because we're going to make sure we're ready for both of those projects and all of that's incorporated into that guidance.
Andy Whitman: You know and you brought up the two big programs that you're running. It sounds like, you didn't say it this way, but sounds like you're moderating some of the spend this year on SAP because there's going to be a whole lot more work next year when G&K gets done. Would you agree with that? And then I guess the question is, is there an implication about the spending on SAP I think last quarter you said it was going to be $40 or $45 million that was cumulative not incremental to this year's number but $40 million to $45 million cumulative, do you still like that number as you look into 2018 or does that one move as well as you look at the G&K integration next year?
Mike Hansen: I would say that it's getting a little bit combined with -- those two projects are getting fairly connected, and while we're not ready to say that that 40 to 45 is going to be different, we're going to have to continue to work on these as a coordinated effort. And so we may come and say, look when you combine the Cintas legacy effort along with the G&K, we may change the amount of spend, but I'm not ready to say that we will yet. I guess maybe one way to look at it from just a systems spend, is to say, we had originally looked at that SAP integration for ourselves as being the second half of fiscal '17 and then all of fiscal '18. And I think Paul and I have said over last couple of calls, as we insert G&K into that, it's likely going to go into fiscal '19, and we still believe that. And so there's probably going to be the same effort in fiscal '18 but just a little bit more effort in fiscal '19. That additional effort is incorporated into our thoughts on the G&K deal, and as you know we've talked about one of the longer polls in that in the synergy effort with G&K as that system conversion. And so we're going to be continuing to work on it, I'm not ready to change from the 40 to 45. But I think it will go into '19, just because we've got more locations. Does that answer your question?
Andy Whitman: Yes, I think that does, it gives it a character of how you are thinking about it and thank you for that. I guess maybe the last question that I have then is stepping back and just looking at the fundamentals of the marketplace, I would like to hear some of your commentary on the AdStop [ph] trends that you're seeing in the marketplace, as well as any comments that you can give us on the overall level of competition as it relates to the pricing trend, recognizing that they're always competitive, but maybe they’re less or more competitive today? That would helpful to give us some context of some of the drivers into that acceleration into organic growth.
Paul Adler: The AdStops, the metric was positive this quarter, but it's typically positive. We get some benefit from seasonal items like jackets and some extra mats coming into the late fall into the early winter. The only thing noteworthy in AdStops was that the flame resistant garments FRC, that was more positive and that helps us support our conclusions that we think we have seen the bottom of that weakness in oil, gas and coal. Outside of that nothing noteworthy in AdStops, and in terms of pricing no change, it’s still very competitive but nothing significant to speak off.
Operator: Next we've George Tong with Piper Jaffray.
George Tong: You indicated the bulk of your SAP spending this year will be in the back half, can you share how you're thinking about the timing of investments between 3Q and 4Q this year?
Mike Hansen: I would say that there is going to be a little bit more in the fourth quarter than in the third quarter as we really get into the ramp up and -- so, I would say if you think about that remaining, I guess it's about 15 to 20 in the back half of the year, a little bit more of it is going to come in the fourth quarter.
George Tong: Got it, and then secondly, can you discuss how much additional investment you need to make in the sales force to support accelerating revenue growth in ZEE Medical?
Mike Hansen: Well we've already made that investment, we made it in -- primarily in the first quarter and so you are seeing that in those First Aid and Safety numbers that they are that investment that we made in the first quarter is now starting to become more productive and I don’t expect to see any additional investments other than kind of the routine.
George Tong: Go it. And then lastly as it relates to your medical claims costs. You saw some elevated atypical medical claims in the quarter. Can you maybe elaborate on why you believe the claims are atypical and then from an actuarial perspective if you'll need to accrue claims costs at a higher rate in future quarters?
Paul Adler: The typical claims were just simply certain claims that were very high dollar because of the specific situation of the person. Because we don’t expect a continued spike of this high dollar claims we generally don’t need to necessarily include that in our IB&R [ph] going forward.
George Tong: Got it, thank you.
Operator: Next we have Joe Box with KeyBanc.
Joe Box: So, obviously there is lot of commentary around why the organic rate in Uniform stepped up sequentially. But I was actually hoping that maybe you could deconstruct where the 6.5% organic growth is actually coming from. Maybe just give us the sort of commentary or directional feel on how much of that might have been price, how much of that might have been volume and then just anything maybe you can tell us about the Uniform specific growth rate versus the ancillary?
Paul Adler: Well Joe, we don’t usually get into the specific details. I can tell you, new business remains strong and we feel very good about reaching that new customer base through what we call no programmers or new customers that haven’t had a Uniform Rental program. New business remains strong penetration remains strong with things like our signature series hygiene products and services with our entrance mats and I would say that we haven’t seen much of a change in the mix of the revenue growth other than to say that oil and gas at customer base, the stops or the reduction in revenue at those types of customers has subsided a little bit. But aside from that it is continuing to execute the way we have for quite a while now and that is no programmers being very strong, new business efforts in total being strong and continuing to find penetration opportunities. 
Joe Box : Okay, appreciate that. And then we may or may not be coming out of the period of lower diesel costs. Have you guys given any consideration to maybe pushing through a surcharge mechanism to your customers or maybe doing hedging on that front?
Paul Adler: We don’t, that diesel or gas surcharge is not something that we do. And we are buying gas everyday all over the country and a hedging program is very, very difficult, it's not like we’ve got large bulk buys at specific points in time and so no we don’t typically get involved in a hedging program because it's just very, very difficult to do so.
Operator: Our next question is from Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer.
Scott Schneeberger: Could you guys address the branding campaign, maybe I am watching less TV, but I haven't seen as much as that as I did initially. Just curious what's going on and a little rehash of the quantification, past and forward, and also favorable impacts you think you may have seen thus far?
Mike Hansen: Scott, you need to watch a lot more college football. But I mean, the rebranding campaign is going very well. We’re still not far enough along that, we have enough of full body of work to be able to analyze and come back to you with return on our investments. But anecdotally what we are hearing from our partners, the customers, it’s all very positive. In fiscal '16, we spent for the year about 25 basis points on the branding campaign and we expect that to be about the same impact here in fiscal '17. And as I said in the end of prepared remarks we will have a little bit heavier spend in our third quarter than in the fourth quarter.
Scott Schneeberger: Thanks. And then with regard to the new sales folks at ZEE, you answered a prior question saying that the spend is done, the initial change and now I guess you have -- I guess I’m curious see how much of that is variable, might we see that pick up or will it be commiserate with production and you’re obviously only giving guides to the fiscal yearend, I believe you said something like progressive improvement in each of the next two quarters, but based on Anniversarying if we look at the full calendar '17, we should see that continue to trend up in the back half of the calendar year and ideally thereafter, is that a fair assessment?
Paul Adler: Yes, yes, it is. We made a larger than typical investment in the first quarter, those partners are now starting to become productive. But we will continue to add selling resources just like we always do. So it's going to be more routine over the course of the next year or so, and -- but yes, to your question. Not only do we see or we expect some improvements sequentially in the back half of this year, I would suggest that’s going to continue in the first half of next fiscal year as well.
Operator: Our next question comes from John Healy with Northcoast Research.
John Healy: I wanted to ask just a little bit more on explanation on the ZEE Medical business and some of the deterioration in the First Aid and Safety organic growth, could you help us understand kind of what was going on with the sales force and it is now simply that Cintas sales people were trying to go in and retain the business and weren't focused on kind of growing and selling because we’ve seen the organic growth come down for about three or four quarters in that business, I’m just trying to understand, kind of the mechanics of what happened in the field?
Mike Hansen: Sure, so we -- lets go back to, we made that deal in August of 2015 and the first thing that we needed to do was get that business on to our systems. When we’re operating on their system, it hard for us to go and hire a sales rap, and put them on to their system because that would require them to sell ZEE Legacy product. And as you can imagine one of the things that we try to do is start to work our way out of the ZEE products and start to work into the Cintas products. This in ZEE’s case they didn’t have sales people, they have their drivers, their service sales raps or as we call them SSR’s, they had their SSR’s do the selling. And they didn’t have a dedicated sales force, so as we brought them on the first thing we needed to do was convert them on to our system. That as we’ve talked about took us really through the entire fiscal 2016 year and so as we are doing that conversation on to our system then we have to make sure that we train those SSR’s on our products and services. And then we do what we’ve talked about is a route optimization and that route optimization then takes those ZEE Legacy route, now that they’re on our system and now we look at the whole market and we reroute the market. And that puts us in a position then to most efficiently serve the customer, and that’s when we really like to then start to see the sales people start to drive revenue. And so in this case, in the case of ZEE, we didn’t invest in sales people early on, because it would have required us to sell for some period of time, the ZEE product and that was something we were trying to work our way out of. So it was something that we expected and now that we are through the system integration, we are through almost all of the route optimization. We’re ready to really begin aggressively selling and we should see that organic growth improve.
John Healy: That’s helpful, and Mike to just kind of along the same lines, when you think about the G&K acquisition, obviously they have sales people and I guess we call it SSRs as well. Is it reasonable to think that you might see organic in the laundry business, macro conditions stable, maybe do the same thing as you go through a digestion period or do you not typically see that same thing when you do it fairly good sized Uniform deal?
Mike Hansen: With every deal that we do, we will expect to see some revenue reduction in the legacy business and that’s true for every acquisition that we’ve made and that is because a combination of things such as, there is some disruption certainly and that disruption sometimes creates the customer -- or creates the environment for the customer to look at other providers. But in addition to that, it’s hard to sell; it’s hard to come out of the gate selling a lot of new business, because we need to train the legacy people, the SSRs and the sales people how to sell Cintas' products, how to sell using our policies, our procedures and our tools. And so there is a natural reduction in new business sales shortly after the closing of the transaction, while we are doing training and integration. And as we get through that training and integration period we then start to expect that those resources, those legacy resources will become more and more productive. So it is just natural that we will see some pressure on sales growth in our rental business post-closing of that transaction, but the really good news is as Paul mentioned in his prepared remarks going back to Z for a second. Our gross margin dollars are up 56% over pre-acquisition dollars, and so while there is some pressure on the topline we are really creating synergy opportunities and really creating cash flow because of the synergies we're able to create.
John Healy: Thank you, and just one final question, when you look at the acquisition of G&K, I know you guys had put out the 140 -- 130 million to 140 million cost savings number, but I believe that's before any sort of revaluing of the inventory and amortization of the merchandize, is there a way to think about how much of the synergies would be leaked away because of that?
Mike Hansen: You know I'm not quite sure I understand the question and I would just say John, that I think we're still very comfortable with the 130 to 140. There is some work that remains to be done in an acquisition of this size, all that purchase price accounting is performed by an independent party and so there could be some movements there, but at this point in time I think we understand the economics well enough that we're still comfortable with that 130 to 140. So nothing related to your question that causes us pause at this point in time.
John Healy: Right, but is that 130-140 before or after any purchase accounting associated with the merchandize that's been fully amortized that's still in the field that would get revalued higher and put on your balance sheet once the deal closes.
Paul Adler: It includes our understanding our estimates based upon experience of doing deals as to what we believe that purchase price accounting to be. But as I said [multiple speakers]. Yes, we reflected it to the best of our knowledge, but as I said we don't determine that ultimately, we'll have an independent accounting firm come in and sign off on that.
Operator: And next up we have Gary Bissey with RBC Capital Markets.
Gary Bissey: Hey guys, just a couple of quick ones, I know it's getting late here. The -- what is the cost of the swaps or the interest rate activity you did between now and actually you getting the financing to closing the deal, should we think that interest expense changes because of these things you are doing how to prepare for taking on that debt or is that not going to be material?
Mike Hansen: Generally there is not a cost and there is a true up at the time that we would do the financing. So, the answer to your question briefly we won't expect any change in our interest expenses.
Gary Bissey: And then on the third quarter headwinds that you mentioned I just wanted to ask about those quickly. So the one less workday, we know the SAP have been very clear about that, the branding spend you said similar for the year, but in the second quarter, it was up year-over-year, so I guess the mix of timing within the year, it's the third quarter or is that on a year-over-year basis the branding spend likely to be more and is that something that'll be a drag on margins?
Mike Hansen: Year-over-year, I think probably the third quarter is probably similar. The fourth quarter would probably be a little bit better year-over-year. But when you're thinking about our Q3 and Q4 there is still more in that Q3 then in the Q4 of fiscal '17.
Gary Bissey: And then just last one on that, the energy comps, can you give us a sense how much do you think that changes from this quarter you just reported in terms of energy costs, fuel costs?
Paul Adler: I think if you kind of view an annualizing of that 75 to 85 basis points for the year, I think that gets us down in the fourth quarter to probably something in the way of 40 to 50 basis points of drag.
Gary Bissey: I'm sorry, I was just asking about the fuel costs. I think you said that gasoline and diesel prices were the low was the third quarter a year ago. So, [multiple speakers] materially different sequentially, February versus the November you’ve just reported?
Mike Hansen: I don't have the data with me by quarter, but I can tell you this, because we've already given you -- our Q1 energy was about 1.9% of revenue, Q2 was 2%. We think we'll end '17 in like the 2% to 2.2% range. So, we're expecting prices at the pump to rise. That compares to about 2% for fiscal '16.
Paul Adler: But all in the second half of the year for us was about 1.8%. So, you can see we're guiding a little bit of an increase.
Operator: And our final question comes from Dan Dolev with Instinet.
Dan Dolev: Can you just give me a sense of the incrementals on rental on the gross margin side? I feel like it was -- the second quarter kind of broke a little bit of a trend, you were running at 63%, its maybe like in the 56% range, what should we expect sort of looking at third quarter and fourth quarter in terms of gross margin incremental in rental?
Mike Hansen: I would say this Dan last -- for fiscal '16 our incremental gross margin in rental was about 58% for the year. In the second quarter it was about 56% last year. It was almost the exact same this year in the second quarter. And if you look at our incremental gross margins for the year, it's something in the way of just under 60. So I think we're continuing to have the performance that we've seen over the last year or so. Going into the second half of this year the only thing that I would say is we will be a little bit more aggressive in making sure that open positions in our rental business are filled, so that when we are ready to close the G&K transaction we're not trying to both fill our open positions and perform integration. We want to make sure that we are fully staffed as much as possible and so that's the only think I would say, it may put a little bit of pressure on that second half of the year, but generally speaking we think they will be healthy.
Dan Dolev: That pressure versus the second quarter or pressure versus kind of the --?
Mike Hansen: Pressure versus what we saw in the second half of last year I guess or relative to this 60% -ish.
Dan Dolev: Got it, and what about the other incrementals, they was actually much healthier in First Aid, any trend to be called here?
Mike Hansen: I would say that I'm not ready to give you a specific number. We've seen some really nice improvement over the last two quarters, and we expect to get back to and exceed pre-ZEE gross margins and as we grow the revenue I think we’ll make progress on that, but I'm not ready to just call it out specifically yet.
Dan Dolev: Got it, thanks so much. Happy holidays.
Operator: And that does conclude our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the call back over to Mike Hansen for any closing comments.
Mike Hansen: Well, thank you for joining us tonight. And we wish you all a wonderful holiday season. We will issue our third quarter earnings in the latter half of March. And we look forward to speaking with you again at that time. Thank you.
Operator: Once again that does conclude today's call. We appreciate your participation.

===== 2017 Q1  (2016-09-27 17:00:00) =====
Executives: Mike Hansen - VP of Finance and Chief Financial Officer Paul Adler - VP and Treasurer
Analysts: Toni Kaplan - Morgan Stanley Jay Hanna - RBC Capital Markets  Greg Bardi - Barclays Capital  Hamzah Mazari - Macquarie Research Equities  Dan Dolev - Nomura Nate Brochmann - William Blair George Tong - Piper Jaffray Sara Gubins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch John Healy - Northcoast Research  Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer
Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Cintas Quarterly Earnings Results Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Mike Hansen, Senior Vice President of Finance and Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead, sir.
Mike Hansen: Thank you for joining us. With me is Paul Adler, Cintas' Vice President and Treasurer. We will discuss our first quarter results for fiscal 2017. After our commentary, we will be happy to answer any questions. The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a Safe Harbor from civil litigation for forward-looking statements. This conference call contains forward-looking statements that reflect the company's current views as to future events and financial performance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ materially from those we may discuss. I refer you to the discussion on these points contained in our most recent filings with the SEC. We are pleased to report first quarter revenue of $1.294 billion, an increase of 7.9% from the prior year first quarter. Organic revenue growth, which adjusts for the impact of acquisitions and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations was 5.7%. First quarter operating income was $207 million, an increase of 11.6% over last year's first quarter. Operating margin improved to 16% of revenue, compared to an operating margin of 15.5% in the prior fiscal year. The Uniform Rental and Facilities Services segment led the way with an operating margin of 18.5%, a 90 basis point expansion from the prior year.  Net income from continuing operations for the first quarter of fiscal 2017 was $138 million compared to $106 million in the prior year, an increase of 30%. Net income from continuing operations as a percent of revenue was 10.7% compared to 8.9% of revenue in last fiscal year's first quarter. Earnings per diluted share or EPS, from continuing operations for the first quarter were $1.26 versus to $0.93 for the first quarter of last year. First quarter EPS from continuing operations increased 35.5% over the prior year. During the first quarter of fiscal 2017, Accounting Standards Update 2016-09 entitled Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting was adopted. Under ASU 2016-09, excess tax benefits and deficiencies associated with employee share-based payments are no longer recognized as additional paid-in capital on the balance sheet but instead recognized directly to income tax expense or benefit in the income statement in the reporting period in which they occur. Other financial statement items impacted include share-based compensation expense and the computation of fully diluted shares outstanding. The first quarter of fiscal 2017 net benefit to EPS from the adoption of ASU 2016-09 was $0.14, consisting of a reduction of income tax expense of $0.16 partially offset by a $0.01 negative impact from additional employee share-based compensation expense reducing operating income and a $0.01 negative impact from an increase in the number of diluted shares outstanding.  Also note that our first quarter of fiscal 2017 operating income includes almost $3 million of transaction expenses related to our recently announced agreement to acquire G&K Services. The impact of adopting ASU 2016-09 and the G&K transaction expenses make year-over-year comparison somewhat challenging. So I want to provide some figures to help you better understand first quarter performance. Excluding these impacts, operating margin for the first quarter of fiscal 2017 was 16.3%, an increase of 80 basis points from the prior year period. Net income from continuing operations was $125 million and EPS was $1.14. The increase in net income and EPS over prior year periods excluding the impacts of ASU 2016-09 and G&K transaction costs was 17.7% and 22.6% respectively.  As our CEO Scott Farmer stated in today's earnings release, this strong start to the fiscal year positions us for another year of record breaking results. As a result of our first quarter results, we are updating our annual guidance. We expect fiscal 2017 revenue to be in the range of $5.160 billion to $5.225 billion and fiscal 2017 EPS from continuing operations to be in the range of $4.55 to $4.63. This guidance does not include any potential deterioration in the U.S. economy, future share buybacks, or any future financial impact from our acquisition of G&K, including any transaction expenses. It does include the impact of one less workday in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016. It also assumes a negative impact in the remaining quarters of fiscal 2017 from the adoption of ASU 2016-09 such that we expect to end fiscal 2017 with an estimated net benefit to EPS of $0.07. Again, please note that the net benefit to EPS from ASU 2016-09 in the first quarter of $0.14 is expected to be only a $0.07 benefit for the full year as the impacts are negative in the second, third and fourth quarters of the year.  Before I turn the call over to Paul, I'd like to provide a brief update on our acquisition of G&K. We remain excited about this opportunity and a long-term value creation for Cintas, its employee partners and its shareholders. When we announced the transaction in August, we indicated that the merger was subject to approval by G&K shareholders, regulatory clearances in both the US and Canada and other customary closing conditions. We and G&K have begun the process for satisfying these closing conditions. And at this stage, we don't expect the closing timeline to change materially from what we previously disclosed. In order to avoid creating speculation, we will not be providing any additional commentary on the process. We will however update the market as appropriate.  I will now turn the call over to Paul for additional information. 
Paul Adler: Thank you, Mike. First, please note that our fiscal year 2017 contains one less workday than in fiscal year 2016. It is the third quarter of fiscal 2017 that has one less day than the prior year quarter. We estimate that this will negatively impact fiscal 2017 total revenue growth by about 40 to 50 basis points and operating margin by approximately 10 to 15 basis points in comparison to fiscal 2016. As Mike stated, total revenue increased organically by 5.7% in the first quarter. This solid growth rate continuous to be driven largely by new business wins, penetration of existing customers with more products and services, and strong customer retention. Total company gross margin was 45.1% for the first quarter of this fiscal year, compared to 43.7% last year.  We have two reportable operating segments, Uniform Rental and Facility Services, and First Aid and Safety Services. The remainder of our business is included in All Other. All Other consists primarily of Fire Protection Services and our Direct Sale business. First Aid and Safety Services and All Other are combined and presented as Other Services on the income statement. Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segment included the rental and servicing of uniforms, mats and towels, and the provision of restroom supplies and other facility products and services. The segment also includes the sale of items from our catalogs to our customers on route. Uniform Rental and Facility Services revenue was $1 billion, an increase of 6.5% compared to last year's first quarter. Excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes and acquisitions, organic growth was 5.9%.  We continued to see the impact of headcount reductions in the oil, gas and coal industries. We estimate that the resulting decrease in revenue from affected customers lowered our organic growth rate by about 110 basis points in the first quarter. Our Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment gross margin was 45.9% for the first quarter, an increase of 120 basis points from 44.7% in last year's first quarter.  Energy related costs were 30 basis points lower than in last year's first quarter. However, job losses previously mentioned in oil, gas and coal negatively impacted this segment's current year first quarter operating margin by about 55 basis points. So, on a net basis, the low price of oil had a negative impact on our Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating margin of 25 basis points because the benefit of lower prices at the pump for our fleet of trucks was more than offset by the negative impact to operating margin resulting from headcount reductions in our oil, gas and coal customers. Our First Aid and Safety Services operating segment includes revenue from the sale and servicing of First Aid products, Safety Products, and Training. This segment's revenue for the first quarter was $125 million, which was 25% higher than last year's first quarter. Total growth benefited from the ZEE Medical acquisition. On an organic basis, growth for this segment was 5.4%. Our legacy First Aid business continuous to grow strongly. The reduction in overall segment organic growth is due to the continued assimilation of the ZEE Medical business. Route consolidation and optimization continued in the first quarter as expected. These efforts had a short-term impact to growth rates as we onboard and goodwill the acquired customers and train the SSRs on our products, services and processes. Our integration gain plan remains on track and we expect to end this fiscal year with stronger growth rates. This segment's gross margin was 45.8% in the first quarter compared to 42.3% in the prior year period, an increase of 350 basis points. Also, we are pleased to note that gross margin improved on a sequential basis by 290 basis points. Our margins benefiting from improved sourcing and from the leveraging of existing warehouses which are among the synergies we anticipate at realizing.  Finally, now that we are nearing completion of consolidation and route optimization, we've added sales reps. ZEE Medical have a dedicated sales force as the business previously relied only upon SSRs to grow the business. The added sales reps will help us grow the acquired customer base by penetrating with our broad range of products and services.  Our Fire Protection Services and Direct Sale businesses are reported in the All Other category. All Other revenue was $170 million, an increase of 5.4% compared to last year's first quarter. Organic growth was 5.2%. All Other gross margin was 45.1% for the first quarter, an increase of 150 basis points from 38.6% in last year's first quarter.  Regarding selling and general and administrative expenses, total company SG&A was 28.9% as a percentage of first quarter revenue compared to a total company SG&A in last year's first quarter of 28.2%. Of the 70 basis point increase in SG&A year-over-year about 10 basis points is due to additional employee share based compensation expense resulting from the adoption of ASU 2016-09. Another 10 basis points consist of SAP cost related to the piloted operations. In addition, Medical expenses as a percentage of revenue were 20 basis points higher in this year's first quarter. Finally, SG&A was impacted by the investment in First Aid sales reps previously mentioned.  On June 1st, $250 million of debt, with a coupon of 2.85%, matured. We refinanced this debt in the form of commercial paper. By staying short in commercial paper, we were able to reduce interest expense in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 by about $2 million, and avoid a headwind that would result from financing with long-term debt. Our effective tax rate on continuing operations for the first quarter was 28.4% compared to 37.2% for last year's first quarter. The decrease in the effective tax rate year-over-year is attributable to adoption of ASU 2016-09. However, as Mike stated earlier, we estimate a negative impact to EPS in the remaining quarters of fiscal 2017 from this accounting standard. We expect the annual effective tax rate for fiscal 2017 to be about 34.7%.  Our cash and marketable securities were $163 million as of August 31st, a decrease of $46 million from the balances of May 31st. Cash flow from operating activities increased 10% from the prior year period and when excluding last year's positive impact from document management transactions, it increased 13%. Uses of cash in the quarter included CapEx and repayment of debt.  Capital expenditures for the first quarter was $78 million. Our CapEx by operating segment was as follows, $67 million in Uniform Rental and Facility Services, $8 million in First Aid and Safety, and $3 million in All Other. We expect CapEx for fiscal 2017 to be in the range of $280 million to $320 million. This range includes about $40 million of CapEx related to our SAP implementation. Regarding SAP, we continue with our pilot process which is progressed as expected. We believe that we will begin depreciating the project around December. Our fiscal year 2017 will include about a half a year of depreciation. It will also include about half a year of system maintenance costs. The conversion of our hundreds of operations to SAP has begun and will extend through fiscal 2018. Training costs, which are expensed when incurred as opposed to amortize over time, will exist in both fiscal 2017 and 2018. As is customary in such a conversion, we expect to have other additional costs in 2017 and 2018 as a result of inefficiencies until the old system is completely off-line. We are pleased with conversion and based upon our experience to date, we are updating our SAP impact to guidance. We now estimate that the investment in SAP will result in about $25 million to $30 million of expense in fiscal 2017 and $40 million to $45 million of expense in fiscal 2018. The estimated fiscal 2017 expenses are included in our 2017 guidance. That concludes our prepared remarks. Before opening it up for questions I'd like to reiterate Mike's earlier statements about the G&K acquisition process. In order to avoid speculation, we will not provide any additional commentary on that process. We will update the market however as appropriate.  And with that we are happy to answer your questions. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We will hear first from Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley. 
Toni Kaplan : Hi, good afternoon. It looks like you are raising your guidance by about $0.19 at the midpoint, and you mentioned the $0.07 benefit from the tax change. Could you just give a little bit of color on the main drivers behind the rest of the increase? Is it more margin driven? I saw uniform margins were extremely strong this quarter, so just wanted to get a little color on that -- the remainder of the increase in guidance?
Mike Hansen : Sure. So there are a couple pieces. First of all as you indicated the ASU 2016-09 is about $0.07. That is again not simply a tax change but a guidance -- FASB guidance change that affects stock comp, shares and taxes. So about $0.07 is from there. Our share count is a little bit lower than we anticipated and Paul maybe you can give the share count that we are going to model. 
Paul Adler: Yes. We are modeling a 108 million diluted weighted average shares outstanding. 
Mike Hansen : And so keeping in mind that you will have to take into account participating securities when you calculate EPS but that's a little bit lower than we expected. So that has some impact. There is a little bit of an impact when we think about SAP. And then there is certainly margins got off to a good start and then we are very pleased with that first quarter performance. So those are a little bit of different pieces. 
Toni Kaplan : Okay, fantastic. And then I know you mentioned you don't want to talk about the G&K process, so if you don't want to answer this that's fine, but just wanted to ask in terms of -- assuming the deal were to close, how high would you expect sort of retention of G&K's workforce in light of the integration? Do you have specific retention targets for the workforce and/or for their revenue? If that's a little too close to the process, I understand.
Mike Hansen : Well, we certainly have some thoughts on synergies that we gave when we announced the transaction. This is a fairly large merger for us and we talked about a couple of the benefits being that in certain markets we need capacity. And G&K has some capacity that we certainly can take advantage of that may allow us to defer some building of plants. We also look forward to the -- when we incorporate their route structure into ours, we expect improved route density. So improvements in terms of the fuel usage and certainly less time driving from customer to customer. In order to those things, we need a lot of people from G&K. And so while I don't have any specific numbers to shares, we won't be able to get into that level of detail until we close the transaction. We certainly anticipate that many of those employees of G&K will come over to become Cintas partners. 
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Gary Bisbee with RBC Capital Markets. 
Jay Hanna: Hi, this is Jay Hanna on the line for Gary today. Regarding gross margins, they seemed to expand pretty dramatically across all the segments, particularly within first aid? Could you just explain what some of the main contributors were to this expansion?
Paul Adler : Yes. I mean at first stage Jay as we noted in the script, we are excited to finally see some of the synergies that we banked on. They come from many different areas. For example, one is insourcing. Our ability to source the various products is much better with our scale than with ZEE. We expected to be able to have better ability to purchase and we are seeing those benefits in cost of goods which translate into that gross margin. We also are seeing benefits from distribution. They had five distribution centers. We've closed almost all of them. And so we are leveraging our fixed cost structure, our distribution supply chain for that. And other example was we mentioned warehousing in the script which is the location, physical operation that we run the routes of. As we had talked about previously with our scale even though this is a sizeable acquisition for the First Aid segment, it was largely a tuck in and by tucking this business in to those existing locations we were starting to realize those synergies. And that's really what's pushing those margins forward as I said we expected. 
Jay Hanna: Great. And then lastly, G&K released a proxy couple of weeks ago which included some of their internal forecasts which included sales growth at 6% plus, and EBITDA growth in the low double-digits. Would you be willing to comment on these? Are they similar to your expectations going forward?
Mike Hansen : We don't have any comments on those. Those were G&K numbers and we'll let their proxies speak for itself. 
Operator: And we will go to Manav Patnaik with Barclays. 
Greg Bardi: This is actually Greg calling on for Manav. I just want to talk a little bit more about the part of the guidance change that isn't the tax change, the SAP and specifically what's driving there. And also kind of curious, if the fact that you're waiting on this G&K deal impacts how you're thinking about hiring for Cintas standalone and if there is any impact there in guidance?
Mike Hansen : So let me make sure I understand the question. What was your first question or your first part of the question was more color on the SAP?
Greg Bardi: No. The question is on the part of the guidance change that isn't related to SAP or the tax. 
Mike Hansen : Okay. Yes, when we think about the guidance that we provided it excludes any impact from G&K. And that would be any benefits, any synergies, any transaction costs et cetera. So the guidance that we are providing is based on Cintas performance. 
Greg Bardi: Okay. I guess my question was more along lines of does that -- has it impacted how you think about hiring I guess new sales force or what have you because you know or you are thinking that G&K will come online. 
Mike Hansen : Well, I'd say Greg that we certainly have thoughts about how the integration will occur once the transaction closes but we need to close the transaction first. 
Greg Bardi: Okay. Fair enough. And then I was hoping for a little more color on the lower growth in First Aid. What are the moving pieces there? Are you exiting less profitable parts of the medical or any color to help us with what's going on there? 
Paul Adler: Yes, Greg. I mean I don't think there is anything much else to add. I mean this is in the scheme of things for that segment. Again, it is a significant chunk of the segment that added one third of the volume. And just think about the math with getting to that 5% organic growth rate two thirds of that business the legacy business it's growing strongly. But the other, the acquired business I mean the focus has been on integration and goodwill and training those SSRs. You have to get the stability in the customer base, establish that foundation that takes time to build those relationships before you can make the emphasis on growth. And so there hasn't been much growth in that acquired business which is as expected but as we mentioned previously we do intend to grow it. And we are implementing, not implementing but we've hired some sales reps, getting them trained because we are at the end of -- near the end of the consolidation, the integration and the optimization process so that these sales reps then would be able to hit the ground running and start penetrating with the other products and services that we have in First Aid that ZEE did not previously have. 
Mike Hansen : Yes, Greg. This is a bit of unique opportunity for us in that I think Paul mentioned in his opening remarks that their drives or SSRs are the -- they were the sellers of that organization. And while we are going through the system integration, it doesn't make a lot of sense to bring on sales people to try to sell product on a different system and then retrain them on our system. And so this is a logical progression and a logical investment for this particular acquisition. 
Operator: Thank you. We will go to new one to Hamzah Mazari with Macquarie Capital. 
Hamzah Mazari: Good afternoon. Thank you. Just had a question around adding dedicated sales reps that you highlighted on ZEE Medical. Should we expect other businesses aside from uniform to have direct sales reps too as those businesses either gain critical mass or is this sort of more differentiated or how should we think about that going forward? 
Mike Hansen : Sure. This is -- you should think about this first aid investment in sales people as a unique example. We are in our other businesses and even in the first aid business; we are generally investing in the business every single quarter. So in other words we are adding routes for growth, we are adding sales people. We are investing in all of our businesses and it happens at generally fairly steady pace. This is a unique example where we are now that we are on the system platform; it makes all kind of sense to add the investment. And we'll start -- our expectation is that we will start to see productivity as we throughout the year. 
Hamzah Mazari: Great. And just a follow up if you could just update us pro forma on your capital structure post G&K and how to think about capital allocation post that deal closing. Thank you. 
Mike Hansen : Yes. Sure. So we are -- our expectation is to pay for that transaction in cash. So in other words we will be borrowing with part short term, part long term borrowings. Our goal is to -- that was certainly get us to leverage levels that are not typical for us. And our goal over the next two to three years is to bring that leverage level back in line with where we've historically been and that is generally at about 2x EBITDA. 
Operator: And we will now go to Dan Dolev from Nomura Securities. 
Dan Dolev: Hey, guys. Hey thanks for taking my questions. If I go back to last year the same time you also raised your revenue guidance quite significantly. I think by about 220 basis points. What should we read into the no increase to the revenue guidance? Thanks. 
Mike Hansen : Last year's first quarter revenue guidance was increased quite a bit because of the ZEE acquisition. We closed that deal on August 1st of last year. And that was the primary reason for the change. 
Dan Dolev: Got it. So there is nothing to be read into that this year.
Mike Hansen : I think our raising of the low end of the guidance today is a bit of reflection that we feel better today than we did 60 days ago about the revenue performance. Generally it is in line with where we expected to be but maybe slightly better. So I don't think there is anything to read into but I would say this Dan we -- let maybe talk a little bit about the economy and thinking in terms of -- it's been -- it remains a challenging environment and I'd -- I think I called it stable without momentum in July and I would say the same thing today. And if you look at the last three quarters of GDP in US, the average is slightly under 1%. The three quarters preceding our first quarter last year that average was 2.3%. And so we've certainly seen a bit more of a challenging environment. But having said that, we are operating a high level we believe and that organic growth of 5.7% in total is a reflection that even in a bit of more challenging environment today than a year ago, we are still growing at pretty good levels. 
Dan Dolev: Understood. And how do you feel about this growth rate throughout the rest of the year? 
Mike Hansen : Well, I think our guidance would suggest that we feel pretty good about it. 
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Nate Brochmann with William Blair.
Nate Brochmann: Hi. Good evening, gentlemen. So just follow up on that little bit Mike if we kind of think about like about add stop metric I would assume that's still somewhat neutral if we exclude the oil and gas folks in terms of that end market. And one if you could comment on that and two when you think about the oil and gas sector are you starting to see the incremental negative decline kind of plateau a little bit so as we think about over the next 12 months that should be a little bit more of stable impact rather than a drag?
Mike Hansen : Yes. Our hope is that we've seen the bottom. I know we've kind of hope that would have been the case for last several quarters but I would suggest that top line impact -- negative impact is somewhere in the 80 basis points to 100 basis points for the fiscal year. That's a little higher than we talked about in July but a little bit better than our first quarter experience. That said, we also talked a little bit about the prices at the pump getting a little bit higher as the years go on. And I would suggest that based on our first quarter experience it might not be as high as we thought it to be originally. So let me talk two things. First of all, yes, the revenue we expect that impact will lessen as we go through the year. From a net standpoint when you think about prices at the pump plus the negative impact of the revenue, I'd suggest that it's about the same as we thought it to be in July. One last point if I go back to Dan's question about revenue for the rest of the year. One thing to keep in mind is in the first quarter we now have lapped that ZEE acquisition. And so now our future growth -- our future revenue growth for the rest of the year will not have the revenue, the acquisition benefit going forward from that ZEE deal. 
Paul Adler: And Nate, answer your question specifically about add stop, so you are correct that in that metric outside of the FRC related to the energy customers there is nothing really noteworthy, the metric is slightly positive but it typically is positive. This time of the year we have some seasonal impacts with schools and other summer type business is coming on in June. It is less positive than a year ago however. 
Nate Brochmann: Okay. That's helpful, I appreciate that. And then in terms of the pricing environment, I mean obviously I know it's always competitive out there and a little bit more competitive on renewals rather than new wins, but anything at all in terms of any changes that you have seen, particularly maybe after or since you've announced the acquisition?
Paul Adler: No. Nate, as you said it's always very competitive, no, nothing remarkable in the environment that indicates any change one way or the other. 
Nate Brochmann: Okay. And then just finally, just one technical question on the ASUs, and not to get too deep into accounting knowledge here, but why, just out of curiosity, why do you get such the big positive benefit in this quarter and then it turns negative the remaining quarters? And then when we look at next year should the comps be about equal? What kind of -- obviously I know the underlying number of employees and how well the bonus pulls do and whatever, I'm sure that would have an impact. But how should we think about that dynamic and why that change?
Mike Hansen : Yes. I think that's a good question, Nate. We will generally see a bigger impact in our first quarter because our restricted shares that we have generally vest in the first quarter, our stock, we have more stock option exercises just for whatever reasons it is the end of our -- it is getting end of the year our fiscal year and into our new fiscal year. So we have more stock option exercises. In this quarter, we also had a nice increase in our stock price. So when that the volatility is created by stock price movement, option exercises, vesting of restricted shares and we generally have more of that in the first quarter, as we move through the rest of the year we generally don't see as many of those exercises and vestings but we still carry the additional stock comp expense and we still carry the additional shares created by this new guidance. 
Nate Brochmann: So essentially then, the expense outweighs the tax benefit in the upcoming quarters, versus the huge tax benefit in the first quarter? Is that essentially the way to think about it?
Mike Hansen : It is. That is our expectation. Now as I said, there are -- we can't control the stock pricing, we can't control when options are exercised necessarily and so there can still be volatility but you are correct in the assumptions that you just stated.
Nate Brochmann: Okay. And just one less cleanup thing just to ask and I think it was something that you had mentioned before. But now with the new rule that is going into place in terms of the overtime and where the thresholds are, I assume that you have kind of thought about that at this point and are pretty comfortable that the impact from that will be fairly minimal, if anything?
Mike Hansen : We have thought about that. And yes we don't see a significant impact to us. 
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We will go to George Tong with Piper Jaffray.
George Tong: Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. Can you discuss any new findings from your due diligence of G&K that either confirm or change your expectations for total synergies that you previously guided to $130 million to $140 million? And any incremental color on how this will split between revenue and cost synergies?
Mike Hansen : George, we don't have any new commentary to add on that process at all. 
George Tong: Okay. And then related to your comment on adding to ZEE Medical sales force, can you elaborate on how much you are adding to the sales force and how much of a lift to revenue performance these additions will drive? 
Mike Hansen : George, we don't like to get into specifics about sales expenses or counts. But we can tell you that our expectations are incorporated into our guidance.
George Tong: Okay, got it. And then lastly, can you discuss how you expect your route efficiency on a standalone Cintas basis to evolve over the next four quarters? 
Mike Hansen : On Cintas standalone basis I would say I think I mentioned a little bit ago that we are constantly investing in the business. And one of those investments is to add routes to allow for continued growth in all of our businesses. And we will continue to do that. And when we add those routes, it creates more density and so that means we are having less windshield time and so there are certainly some incremental benefits every time we add new routes. We also expect that the productivity of our drivers or SSRs will improve over time as we add those routes and have more time to spend with our customers. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Sara Gubins with Bank of America.
Sara Gubins: Yes, hi, thank you. You lowered the cost hit from SAP this year, but you mentioned that the pilot had been going as expected, so I'm wondering, is it that you expect lower cost related to SAP specifically or are you finding cost savings elsewhere to help offset that what you were originally expecting?
Mike Hansen : Yes. I think I heard you properly so if I am missing the question please let me know. But to answer your question, we are finding that we are just simply spending less on the integration so far than are initially expected. It doesn't really have to do with offset; it is more about the specific SAP integration. 
Sara Gubins: Okay, great. And then hopefully you can hear me. Could you comment on expected wage cost and any trends you might be seeing there? 
Mike Hansen : We are seeing in certain specific markets there are more pressures than in others. We operate in many, many markets around the US and Canada. And I'd say that we are not seeing specific themes nationally. But there are certainly are some markets here and there that are more -- that are tighter than others. We deal with those all the time, that's not something that is particularly new. And it's our job to execute and to get the right people at the right places and time. 
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We will go to John Healy with Northcoast Research. 
John Healy: Thank you. Mike, I wanted to ask you a question, just from a top line perspective. I think it's pretty impressive as you continue to put up this kind of organic growth this late into what could arguably be described as late into an economic cycle. Is there anything, when you look at the business that maybe we don't get by just looking at the organic growth rate? Do you see a segment of the marketplace, whether it's healthcare or hospitality or some sort of end market that is just doing something that's exceptional as well as just from a regional performance when you look at the company today? I believe the West Coast had always been a tougher region for all the uniform companies, but is there anything that's driving this growth rate that would surprise us or not be obvious to us?
Mike Hansen : I think it's the things that we talked about in the past, John. And the exciting thing to us is it is not necessarily vertical driven, it is really about the innovative products and services that we've been able to create over the last several number of years. And it's about the great execution by our partners. We believe that we can add value to any business in the US and Canada with our products and services. And we are going about doing that and that is kind of vertical agnostic. We believe every kind of business is a potential customer. And we are targeting them as such. So we want to continue to look for new opportunities to sell our for example our signature series hygiene products. We want to look for new innovative solutions and ways to sell our Carhartt products for our scrub rental programs, for our chemical cleaning solutions. We've got a lot of innovative products and services that we created and they can really add value to lots of different kinds of businesses. And so I think it's that. It's the execution by our partners and it's a great product line. 
John Healy: Got you, and I want ask on the acquisition of G&K. You talked about the $130 million to $140 million in synergies, is that kind of a big picture number? And would you expect the synergies to be less than that post purchase accounting?
Mike Hansen : Well, I'd say that when we announced in August we talked about the $130 million to $140 million in annual synergies. That is looking at their cost structure primarily. And there certainly are things that will let say subtract from that like the interest cost related to the financing like the amortization of intangibles. So that's a bit of a big picture what are the synergies and we would not -- we did not include the interest expense and the intangible amortization as a net against those --. 
John Healy: Was there an assumption for the inventory, the garments in the stock rooms and things like that?
Mike Hansen : Well, we have thoughts on that. We didn't share any in August and I am not ready to do that today. We need to get the deal closed and that when we can dive into more of the details. And really get more specific. 
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We will go to Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer.
Scott Schneeberger: Thanks, good afternoon, guys. A couple clarification questions first. With regard to the SAP number down a little bit, this was asked earlier, but is it going to be pushed out, or is it just the less on integration spend? And why I'm asking is I'm wondering if you're holding things up waiting for the closing of the G&K acquisition, or it's just pure integration savings?
Mike Hansen : I think it's just we are spending less on the integration in the early periods that kind of lead us to think we maybe more efficient over the course of the integration. 
Scott Schneeberger: All right, thanks. And then a real quickie, on the accounting change you mentioned that fiscal first quarter is typically going to be the big one, and obviously it's going to be a headwind in the coming three. In our modeling, should we just equal weight the next three quarters, or is there any seasonality to that we should think about?
Mike Hansen : I think that's a reasonable assumption to equal weight.
Scott Schneeberger: All right, thanks. And then obviously we have the election coming up, so I will be that guy and ask the question, but it sounds like infrastructure is probably going to be strong under either candidate. Thoughts on that and then trade maybe not so much. I'm not sure that would have an impact, but if you could address those two if meaningful or anything else you think are resulting from what you have heard thus far. Thanks.
Mike Hansen : I think it's -- I would say that it's a little unclear for us to get specific on any kind of future benefits. We will certainly operate in whatever environment occurs after the election. And it's too early to tell and too early to try build any kind of specific assumption. 
Operator: Thank you. With no additional questions in the queue, I'll turn things back over to our speakers for any additional or closing remarks. 
Mike Hansen : Well, thank you very much for joining us tonight. We appreciate it. We will issue our second quarter earnings in the end of December. And we look forward to speaking with you again at that time. 
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, again that does conclude today's conference. Thank you all again for your participation.

Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Cintas Quarterly Earnings Results Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Mike Hansen, Vice President of Finance and Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead, sir.
Mike Hansen: Good evening and thank you for joining us. With me is Paul Adler, Cintas Vice President and Treasurer. We will discuss our fourth quarter results for fiscal 2016. After our commentary, we will be happy to answer any questions. The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a Safe Harbor from civil litigation for forward-looking statements. This conference call contains forward-looking statements that reflect the company's current views as to future events and financial performance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ materially from those we may discuss. I refer you to the discussion on these points contained in our most recent filings with the SEC. We are pleased to report fourth quarter revenue of $1.271 billion, an increase of 11.3% from the prior year fourth quarter. Organic revenue growth, which adjusts for the impact of acquisitions, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, and workday differences, was 6.7%. Fourth quarter operating income was $203 million, an increase of 14.2% over last year's fourth quarter. Operating margin improved to 16% of revenue, compared to an operating margin of 15.6% in the prior fiscal year. The Uniform Rental and Facilities Services segment led the way with an operating margin of 17.7%. Net income from continuing operations for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 was $118 million compared to $101 million in the prior year, an increase of 17.3%. Net income from continuing operations as a percent of revenue improved to 9.3% from 8.8% of revenue in last fiscal year's fourth quarter. Earnings per diluted share or EPS, from continuing operations for the fourth quarter were $1.08 compared to $0.86 for the fourth quarter of last year. Fourth quarter EPS from continuing operations increased 25.6% compared to the prior year period. As our CEO Scott Farmer stated in today's earnings release, these achievements are the results of our employees, whom we call partners in being ready for our customers. I'd like to take this opportunity to thank our partners for continuing to generate industry leading results. Our fourth quarter results were a strong finish to an excellent fiscal year, one in which we achieved record revenue and record EPS. We have a diverse customer base with about 70% of our revenue coming from customers and services providing areas of the economy. This has been made possible by our wide range of products and services. As a result of these and other assets, we have grown significantly in excess of US GDP and jobs each year since the Great Recession, and we are the clear leader in our industry, and in more ways than one, including size, growth rates, profit margins, quality, service and innovation. In addition to the success on the top line, we have delivered it on the bottom line. As Scott Farmer stated in today's press release, Cintas has increased EPS by double-digits in six consecutive years. Our research indicates that this feat has been accomplished by less than 5% of S&P 500 companies. Our cash flow and scale allow us to invest in numerous ways. In fiscal 2016, those investments included CapEx to both maintain and grow the business, and strategic investments, like our SAP project, and new Ready for the Workday branding campaign. We made acquisitions in our Rental, First Aid and Fire businesses and we have the capacity to do more. This past year, we paid our regular dividend and it was an increase of 23.5% over the prior-year's dividend. Since we went public in 1983, we've increased the annual dividend every year. Finally, in fiscal 2016, we repurchased shares under our buyback program at an aggregate cost of $759 million, including $276 million in our fourth quarter. Looking ahead to fiscal 2017, we expect revenue to be in the range of $5.150 billion to $5.225 billion, and EPS from continuing operations to be in the range of $4.35 to $4.45. This guidance does not include any potential deterioration in the US economy or future share buybacks. It does include our expectations for our continued SAP system implementation, and the impact of one less workday in fiscal 2017, compared to 2016. We estimate that this one less workday will negatively impact fiscal 2017 total revenue growth by about 40 to 50 basis points and operating income margin by approximately 10 to 15 basis points in comparison to fiscal 2016. I'll now turn the call over to Paul for additional information.
Paul Adler: Thank you, Mike. First, please note that there were 66 workdays in this year's fourth quarter compared to only 65 in last year's fourth quarter. We estimate that this additional day benefited the quarter's operating income margin by 40 to 50 basis points. As Mike stated, total revenue increased organically by 6.7% in the fourth quarter. This solid growth rate was driven largely by new business wins, penetration of existing customers with more products and services, and strong customer retention. About 60% of new business wins continue to come from no-programmers, or customers that have never had a rental program. We are providing no-programmers in healthcare with scrub rental, those in construction and trades with Carhartt-branded workwear, and no-programmers and customer-facing positions like retail, theme parks and transportation, with performance polos and cargo pants. Our broad range of innovative and proprietary products and services enable us to do more for the customer, including uniform and mat rental, hygiene, first aid supplies, CPR and other training, and fire extinguisher testing and recharging, to name a few. And the more we do for the customer, the more they appreciate our quality and service, and the less likely they are to leave us. Total company gross margin was 43.6% for the fourth quarter of this year, compared to 42.6% last year. Total company energy-related expenses, including gas, diesel and natural gas for this year's fourth quarter were 1.8% of revenue, about 40 basis points lower than last year's fourth quarter. Note, however, that we continued to see the impact of headcount reductions in the oil, gas and coal industries. We estimate that the resulting decrease in revenue from customers in these industries lowered our organic growth rate by about 100 basis points in the fourth quarter and reduced our operating margin by about 50 basis points. So, the low fuel prices were not enough to offset the negative impact from our energy customers, and the net impact from energy was a headwind of about 10 basis points. We have two reportable operating segments, Uniform Rental and Facility Services, and First Aid and Safety Services. The remainder of our business is included in All Other. All Other consists primarily of Fire Protection Services and our Direct Sale business. First Aid and Safety Services and All Other are combined and presented as Other Services on the income statement. Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segment included the rental and servicing of uniforms, mats and towels, and the provision of restroom supplies and other facility products and services. The segment also includes the sale of items from our catalogs to our customers on route. Uniform Rental and Facility Services revenue was $965 million, an increase of 8.3% compared to last year's fourth quarter. Excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes, workday differences and acquisitions, organic growth was 6.3%. At this time of the year, we provide revenue mix for this segment. Due to the fact that we changed our segments this fiscal year, I will provide the prior year data for comparability. The revenue mix for the segment for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 and 2015 was as follows. Uniform Rental accounted for approximately 50% of total revenue compared to 51% last year. Dust Control, comprised mainly of entrance mats, accounted for 18% in both years. Hygiene and Other Services, including Restroom Supply, Cleaning Services and Chemical Services, was 14% of total revenue versus 13% last year. Shop towels were unchanged from prior year at 5% of revenue. Linen and Other, which is mainly non-person-specific garments such as aprons and butcher coats was 9% compared to 8% last year, and Catalog Sales were 4% this year versus 5% last year. Our Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment gross margin was 44.3% for the fourth quarter, an increase of 150 basis points from 42.8% in last year's fourth quarter. We estimate that the extra workday in this year's fourth quarter compared to last year benefited operating margin about 40 to 50 basis points, the majority of which falls within gross margin. Energy related costs were 50 basis points lower than in last year's fourth quarter. However, job losses in oil, gas and coal negatively impacted this segment's current year fourth-quarter operating margin by about 50 basis points. So, on a net basis, the low fuel prices did not benefit our Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating margin because they were offset by the headcount reductions impacting our oil, gas and coal customers. Our First Aid and Safety Services operating segment includes revenue from the sale and servicing of First Aid products, Safety Products, and Training. This segment's revenue for the fourth quarter was $123 million, which was 45% higher than last year's fourth quarter. Total growth benefited from the ZEE Medical acquisition. On an organic basis, growth for this segment was 6.9%. This segment's gross margin was 42.9% in the fourth quarter compared to 46.8% in the prior year period. Operating income margin was 10.9% compared to 15.2% in last year's fourth quarter. We did see a 30 basis point sequential improvement in operating margin. The reduction in First Aid organic growth rate and margins is wholly attributable to the impact of the acquired ZEE Medical business. Recall that ZEE was about one-third the size of our existing First Aid business, a significant acquisition to this operating segment. We continue to incur the typical conversion costs, which impact margin from the short term. The assimilation of the business, including route consolidation, is still in process, as expected. In fact, the fourth quarter saw the largest number of ZEE locations being integrated. All of these efforts have a short term impact to growth rates and margins, as is common in an acquisition of this relative magnitude. The completion of the integration will be followed by the realization in full of the synergies. We are on track and continue to be pleased with this acquisition. Regarding selling, and general and administrative expenses, total company SG&A was 27.6% as a percentage of fourth quarter revenue compared to a total company SG&A in last year's fourth quarter of 27.0%. Medical expenses as a percentage of revenue were 20 basis points higher in this year's fourth quarter. Also note that our new national branding campaign impacted SG&A by about 35 basis points. On June 1st, $250 million of debt, with a coupon of 2.85%, matured. We refinanced this debt in the form of commercial paper. By staying short in commercial paper, paying about 70 basis points, we were able to reduce interest expense in fiscal 2017 by about $5 million, and avoid a headwind that would result from financing with long-term debt. Our effective tax rate on continuing operations for the fourth quarter was 37.1% compared to 37.7% for last year's fourth quarter. The effective tax rate can fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter based on tax reserve builds and releases relating to specific discrete items. We expect the effective tax rate for fiscal 2017 to be about 36.7%. That's up slightly from fiscal 2016's 36.4%. Our cash and marketable securities were $210 million as of May 31st, a decrease of $177 million from the balances of February 29th. Uses of cash in the quarter included $278 million for repurchases of Cintas common stock and $57 million to pay some of the taxes due on the gains related to the sale of our Shred-it investment. Regarding the sale of the Shred-it investment, please note that the impacts are accounted for throughout the cash flow statement. The proceeds from the sale of $581 million are recorded as cash provided by investing activities, while the taxes paid on the gain from the sale are recorded as cash used in operating activities. This accounting, while proper per Generally Accepted Accounting Principles has the effect of understating cash provided by operating activities and free cash flow if one does not remember that the taxes paid relate to a non-recurring transaction in which the benefits in the form of cash proceeds are recorded in another section of the cash flow statement. So if we eliminate the impact of the sale of the Shred-it investment from the cash flow statement, cash flow provided by operating activities would be $695 million for fiscal 2016 versus $580 million the prior year, an increase of 19.8%. Capital expenditures for the fourth quarter were about $68 million. Our CapEx by reportable operating segment was as follows, $56 million in Uniform Rental and Facility Services, $9 million in First Aid and Safety, and $3 million in All Other. We expect CapEx for fiscal 2017 to be in the range of $280 million to $320 million. This range includes about $40 million of CapEx related to our SAP implementation. Regarding SAP, as we disclosed last quarter, we expect to begin depreciating the project around December 2016. Our fiscal year 2017 will include about a half a year of depreciation. It will also include about half a year of system maintenance costs. The conversion of our hundreds of operations to SAP will occur during fiscal 2017 and extend through fiscal 2018. Training costs, which are expensed when incurred as opposed to amortized over time, will exist in both fiscal 2017 and 2018. As is customary in such a conversion, we expect to have other additional costs in 2017 and 2018 as a result of inefficiencies until the old system is completely off-line. We estimate that the investment in SAP will result in $30 million to $35 million of expense in fiscal 2017 and $45 million to $50 million of expense in fiscal 2018. The estimated fiscal 2017 expenses are included in our 2017 guidance. We will begin to receive some cost structure benefits in fiscal 2019, but will likely see the power of the system beginning in fiscal 2020 once all operations have had some experience in running it. That concludes our prepared remarks. We are happy to answer your questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Manav Patnaik with Barclays.
Unidentified Analyst: Hi. This is actually Greg calling on for Manav. First off, I was just hoping you could help us bridge to your 2017 revenues between what you would consider organic growth and the FX or M&A impact? And then maybe more specifically, you can talk about how you're thinking about organic growth in 2017 and how it compares to the - I guess, nearly 7% you delivered in 2016?
Mike Hansen: Greg, we don't typically give organic growth because lots of things can happen throughout the year. But I - you can probably see from our guidance where the revenue range is 5% to 6.5%. That's pretty much in line with what we gave in terms of initial guidance last year. Keep in mind that, as I mentioned, we'll get a negative impact of 40 to 50 basis points because of the one less workday. And so I would say that we're not expecting too many changes this year, but we don't give specific organic growth numbers.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay. Fair enough. And then maybe on the energy side, it sounded like the negative net add stops were a little worse than you had expected in the fourth quarter. Maybe you can talk about the moving pieces and how you're thinking about that in 2017 between cost saves and potential further pressure, if we are in a lower for longer oil environment?
Paul Adler: Yes, Greg, it's Paul. Add stops were - they were negative this quarter, but they typically are. There are some seasonal impacts that impact us in the fourth quarter. For example, we have jackets coming off from the winter and being returned to the stock rooms. We have mats that are extra mats that some of the customers were snow and slush, and those are returned as well. So typically, add stops are negative in the fourth quarter, and they are for us this fourth quarter. And then to your point, they are a little more so than typical, because we still are feeling the effects of headcount reductions in our energy customers. In terms of next fiscal year, we can tell you that we still expect to have some headwinds from oil, gas and coal customers. We would expect the headwind to revenue in fiscal '17 to be about 60 basis points, and that's built into our guidance. So that's the top-line impact. On the bottom line, we would expect that to be a headwind then of about 30 basis points of operating margin. The other impact that we believe we will have is just in the fuel costs. Whereas we had a benefit in fiscal '16, we're modeling that the fuel will be a headwind to our cost structure to maybe about 30 basis points.
Unidentified Analyst: A headwind to - on the cost side, higher fuel costs?
Paul Adler: Yes.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay.
Paul Adler: On fiscal '16, on a net benefit - or a net basis rather, in fiscal '16, considering the benefit of fuel and the cost structure and then the negative impact of the headcount reductions, reducing revenue and operating margin, we had like a 10 basis point improvement for fiscal '16. Whereas in fiscal '17, we are expecting it to be more of a 60 basis points headwind. So quite a significant change.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay. That's helpful. Thank you.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Gary Bisbee with RBC Capital Markets.
Gary Bisbee: Hey, guys. Good afternoon.
Mike Hansen: Hi, Gary.
Gary Bisbee: I thought it was an interesting statistic you gave, if I heard it right, that 70% of your revenue you think is from services industry end markets or customers. And can you just help us frame that, I mean, how - what would that have looked like five years ago? Has that been a pretty substantial shift over time or has it been more moderate?
Mike Hansen: I would say in the last five years, probably not too substantial. But over the last, let's call it 15 years, probably much more - and probably even more inverse of that. You know, as jobs over the last couple decades have been off-shored, we have certainly been forced to look for other ways of creating revenue in terms of the uniforms, and that, we've been very successful in the service providing areas. And so, I would say it's different from certainly 15 years ago. It's probably not too different from five years ago. But I would say that it continues - we continue to perform well in those areas. A couple of the different pieces that we would see as better today than maybe five years ago even, and certainly 15, would be healthcare, which, 15 years ago, we probably had a very, very small presence and food service. And in both of those, we've been able to come up with creative solutions, innovative solutions, to get more of an impact in those verticals, and that certainly has helped us.
Gary Bisbee: And when we think about that, is that both a uniform rental story, and then also just penetration of a lot of the other stuff that has broader appeal or is it more the latter than the former?
Mike Hansen: No, that's all of our businesses. And when you think about the Rental segment by itself, there's not a lot of difference in terms of the vertical splits between Uniform Rental and Facility Services. We are providing many of those products to the same customers, and so not a lot of difference there.
Gary Bisbee: Okay. Great. And then if I could just ask one more. Can you give us any more color on how the branding campaign is working? I think we saw - we are seeing commercials, and seen them on the Internet and a few other things. But what has that done? Is that just awareness or are you actually seeing this help you closing the business? Thank you.
Mike Hansen: Well, the branding campaign has continued, and we certainly - our Cintas partners, our employees are very energized and excited about it. And so it's had a positive impact on us certainly from an energy and excited standpoint. But we're too early to begin to measure the impact of it. I think I mentioned last quarter that it would probably be more like the second half of fiscal '17 before we would start to really be able to measure any kind of impact. Keeping in mind, it is a brand awareness campaign. So it is trying to make sure that our customers and our prospects understand and know all of the different things that we can provide to them, all of the different products and services. And we are not specifically targeting any one of them right now. So, again, we're excited about it. It's going well. It's been - the feedback that we get anecdotally has been very good. But I don't expect to be able to give any measurements on it until the back half of fiscal '17.
Gary Bisbee: Sounds good. Thank you.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Nate Brochmann with William Blair.
Nate Brochmann: Hi. Good evening, gentlemen.
Mike Hansen: Hi, Nate.
Paul Adler: Hi, Nate.
Nate Brochmann: So just playing off of Gary's question there a little bit, and I think that's one thing that you guys have really done a great job of in terms of maintaining the sales momentum in somewhat of an underlying sluggish job growth environment. Could you talk a little bit about, as you go back 15 years ago till today, in terms of being able to change the customer buying behavior to kind of except maybe those new rental uniforms that you have going into those newer industries for you? And then, second, how much longer is that tail in terms of opportunity, given the fact that it's been only in the last, you know, call it, five or seven years that we've really made some real inroads there?
Mike Hansen: Well, I think the - from a customer perspective, I think it begins with innovative products. We can't get service industries to just simply change with what we might call legacy uniform rental workwear. We have to be innovative, and we have to create uniform solutions that our customers want to wear. And we think we've been pretty successful in doing that. Paul gave a couple of examples in his narrative a few minutes ago. And so it really starts with innovative products and solutions. And we feel like that's - we've been pretty good at that. That's going to be important to continue to do that as we move forward. As far as how much opportunity is still out there, we feel like there is quite a bit of opportunity. We continue to introduce new products like our Carhartt, like our scrub rental, like our Chef Works products for rental. And it takes a while to get those fully penetrated and fully rolled out. And so there's a lot of runway in just our existing products, and that doesn't include any products that we will continue to invest in and look for.
Nate Brochmann: And I would assume along with that, though, like the word of mouth in terms of people within the industry even talking, that's got to kind of help accelerate that runway a little bit, right?
Mike Hansen: Well, I would say that the more prospecting we do, and the more that we talk about our solutions, yes, the better that can become. And that - from a word of mouth standpoint, that gets around to different decision makers.
Nate Brochmann: Okay. And then second question is, kind of when you originally announced some of the upfront cost-related SAP, I think there might've been a little bit of initial worry about what we can do to offset that. I mean, clearly, with your guidance going into next year, that's pretty strong. I would assume that you have uncovered some offsets to kind of help balance some of those costs, and obviously, you're really great in terms of the gross margin expansion as well. Could you talk about maybe some of those things underneath the covers that you are able to find to offset that, particularly given some of the headwinds you're facing in terms of the lost day and the energy costs, et cetera?
Mike Hansen: Sure. I would say, Nate, that it's not that we've uncovered a lot of different things; it's just that - I'll go through a couple things. We won't have the incremental IT investments that we would typically have, and that's helpful. We expect certainly improved performance out of our First Aid and Safety business, as we lap the acquisition of ZEE. Again, we expect to see improved performance certainly, and we expect to see improved performance out of our Fire business. Those certainly will help. And you are seeing that as part of the guidance. We will certainly get some natural leverage from the growth in our Rental segment and that will help. And then we're also continuing to control our costs and manage our cost structure, and we've been pretty successful at that and we'll continue to be successful at that. So there are a number of different things that go into this and help offset some of the headwinds that we've talked about. But I think - there's nothing - there's no magic silver bullet that we've got that we've all of a sudden uncovered. It's continuing to do what we do.
Nate Brochmann: Great. Thanks for all the extra color. I appreciate it.
Mike Hansen: Okay.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Sara Gubins with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Sara Gubins: Hi, thanks. Just a follow-up on that - at the end of your last comments you said that you're -- overall, you're focused on managing the cost structure. Could you add in a little more detail about where - aside from natural leverage in the business, you are able to do that?
Mike Hansen: Well, aside from investments that we choose to make, our expectation is that we're going to grow our G&A about half as much as revenue each year, and we've been pretty good at that. Again, aside from certain investments that we want to make. And so a lot of it comes from managing that G&A structure. A lot of it comes from an active Six Sigma program where we are constantly looking for small incremental wins to medium size wins. And those Six Sigma process improvements come in our production, in our plants, they come on our routes, they come in all different places. We have a lot of people who are involved in that Six Sigma program looking for small to medium size wins. And that will certainly help as we become more and more efficient in all of our processes.
Sara Gubins: Okay. Thank you. And could you give us an update on the pricing environment? Have you seen any changes there?
Paul Adler: Sara, its Paul. Yes, on the pricing front, we haven't really seen anything in terms of a marketable change. So it's been pretty status quo. It's still competitive in terms of national account programs, but that hasn't changed, and really no difference. So nothing, no worthy or anything significant to pass on to you there.
Sara Gubins: Okay. Great. And then just last question, could you talk about your priorities for capital next year?
Mike Hansen: Well, I - Sara, I would say that those priorities will be the same as they have been for fiscal '16. I talked a little bit about that in our prepared remarks. We're going to continue to invest in the business. We're going to continue to do that through a little bit of the P&L, but also through CapEx. We are certainly going to be looking for acquisition opportunities that create long-term value for us similar to the way we did that in fiscal '16. Our third priority is we will take a look at the dividend, and if history repeats, we will likely increase the dividend this year, because that has been very important to us. And then lastly, if there are - if there is cash remaining, we certainly will put it to work in share buybacks. But we will look at it in that priority order and making sure that we are always looking to strengthen Cintas for the long-term.
Sara Gubins: Thank you.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Jeff Goldstein with Morgan Stanley.
Jeff Goldstein: Hi. I wanted to ask about the All Other segment, where it looks like you had some strong growth in the quarter. First of all, are you able to provide the organic growth for that segment? And then secondly, was growth there driven by any large one-off orders in direct sales or was it more broad-based in nature?
Paul Adler: Yes. I can provide you with the organic growth of All Other, it was 8.5% in the quarter. And that All Other, just as a reminder, includes our Fire business and our Direct Sale business. And that Direct Sale business is typically more of a slower grower in our portfolio, but it had a good quarter. It was a little stronger growth rate. And again, that's direct sale business, can be a little more volatile, so we had some good rollouts of programs in the fourth quarter that helped push growth along and get that organic growth rate up pretty nicely. The Fire business continues to grow nicely as well. We expect about double-digit growth in our Fire business. And so as a result of growing the top line in both of those businesses, we also saw 100 basis points of operating margin expansion in that segment as well.
Jeff Goldstein: Okay. And then I want to ask about cotton prices, which have actually increased pretty significantly recently. Would you expect any type of headwind to your business if we are able to see kind of more of a sustained period of these higher cotton prices?
Mike Hansen: Well, cotton, we would have to see a sustained increase in cotton, and for a while. So let's talk about specifically for our Rental business, you know, when we think about most of our uniforms, they are a polycotton blend or lower percentage of cotton. So that is - that's point number one. Secondly, labor is the biggest component of cost out of our garments, and so the materials are not the majority of the cost involved. Thirdly, there's a supply chain. And so we would have to order the fabric. It would be sown into garments, that - and then shipped to our distribution center. That probably takes somewhere of 8 to 10 weeks. Then there is a turn through the distribution center, and then it gets shipped out our rental locations where it gets generally amortized over some period of time, mostly 18 months. So there is a quite a bit of time before we would see a sustained cotton impact. And even if we did see a sustained cotton impact, because of the percentage of the cost itself, I don't see that - I just don't expect that that would be that noticeable, and it would have to be a real spike for some sustained period of time.
Jeff Goldstein: Okay. That's helpful. And then I just have one last maintenance question. You had said regarding the national advertising campaign that spending on the campaign would likely ramp up again in fiscal '17. Is that still the guidance, and do you have any color on which quarters would likely see most of that spend?
Mike Hansen: It - we expect that our spend will be about the same in fiscal '17 as fiscal '16, which for the year, is about 25 basis points. I would expect that the largest or the impacts would be the greatest in our second and third quarters.
Jeff Goldstein: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Andrew Wittmann with R.W. Baird.
Andrew Wittmann: Great. So, Mike, thanks for the answer previously about some of the offsets that you had to the margins. Given that those headwinds are pretty significant, I was wondering if you could give us a little bit more detail? And in the past, you mentioned that the ZEE integrations that you thought that the segment margins could get back up to their pre-ZEE levels, which I guess is - I don't know, 13-ish-percent for the segment? Is that still the right goal, and what's the timeframe to which you think you can get those ZEE margins? Or to get these significant offsets, are you now eyeing above prior segment margin peaks?
Paul Adler: Andy, its Paul. Yes, as far as ZEE is concerned, I just want to reiterate that we are pleased with that acquisition; everything is on track. We had mentioned previously that we need a full year to get through the integration. And so through May, we're about 75% of the way through. It's not turnkey, it's not standalone, as you know; it's largely a tuck-in. And so when you have a tuck-in, you have a little short-term efforts in order to get those synergies in the long-term. And that's definitely what we are seeing in the First Aid segment is that impact, the integration costs, re-routing, goodwill and customers to make sure nothing falls through in the transition. You can't run as fast as you would like to right out of the gate. But things are on track. We do expect those margins to bounce back. We don't have a timeframe as far as here's the timetable and the quarters and the milestones. But absolutely, we have another quarter of integration in fiscal '17, and we expect to see those margins bounce back. And baked into our guidance for fiscal '17 is improvements in those First Aid and Safety margins, and some stronger growth rates than you saw in the fourth quarter as well.
Mike Hansen: And Andy, I would add to that, from a Fire Protection Services perspective, we continue to grow that business. And we grow it - we've grown it quite nicely in the last year, Paul talked about it growing nicely in the fourth quarter. And we expect continued operating margin improvement in that business as well, as we gain density in a lot of our different markets. And as that business continues to do the same thing that our other businesses do, and that is fine product adjacencies, continue to penetrate existing customers, while adding new storefronts. Our National Account Fire business has been very good over the last year as well. And so there, we expect certainly improvements in the First Aid business, as Paul talked about, but we also expect them in our Fire Protection business, and that certainly will help us in fiscal '17.
Andrew Wittmann: Okay. Thank you for that context. On the capital budget, I think I heard 280 to 320, that compares to $275 ish this year. I'm just curious as - and we know we - I think we had decent SAP spending in fiscal '16. I think I heard you say that there's 40 expected in fiscal '17, but I still think that's a pretty decent increase and I was wondering what you contribute the delta to?
Mike Hansen: Well, we will be adding capacity like we've talked about. I believe we'll have a couple different facilities open here early in this fiscal year. Those were not full newbuilds, but they were capacity increases. And that will give us some help in the first quarter. And then we expect to continue to increase capacity because of our growth, probably closer to the end of the fiscal year or into early fiscal '18. So there's a little bit more capacity spend than we've seen over the last - certainly over the last three to five years, and even a little bit more than we have seen in fiscal '16.
Andrew Wittmann: Okay. Last question, it's been reported that you guys are going to - and you've had the, I think, the Southwest Airlines contract for a while, which, correct me if I'm wrong, it was mostly a direct sale. Last time you guys redressed an airline was I think it was United Airlines, and that was a tangible number that we could see to the P&L. Is the Southwest Airlines on the same order of magnitude in terms of the contribution? And how should we expect the timing of that to flow through? And maybe any comments you would have on the profitability, is that rollout a major program, I think would be fairly short order.
Mike Hansen: That is a - that's a great success for us in terms of gaining the award for that business. That's - of the impactful piece of that is relatively new. It's early, so I'm not ready to provide any timetable and estimates. But we'll certainly talk more about that as we go through the performance of that business. But we're early on. Again, we've got to source the product, and that takes some time. And so those big projects don't happen overnight. And in fact, I think we started working on the United program something like 12 to 15 months in advance of starting to ship. So it is a nice program for us, but it's going to take a little time.
Andrew Wittmann: Okay. So the implication there is if United was 12-plus months, this one might not even have a lot of revenue contribution this year, is that fair to say?
Mike Hansen: I think that's a fair assumption.
Andrew Wittmann: Okay. Great. That's it for me. Thank you very much.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Joe Box with KeyBanc.
Joe Box: Hey. Good evening, guys.
Mike Hansen: Hi, Joe.
Paul Adler: Hi, Joe.
Joe Box: So a couple of questions around the Uniform segment organic growth rate. One, is the growth rate for Uniform versus All Other kind of categories within that Uniform segment, are you still seeing the growth rates kind of trend at a similar rate or are you starting to see them diverge? And two, if I heard you right, it sounded like you highlighted new business wins, better penetration and even retention as kind of the biggest drivers to the entire segment. I'm curious if any of those three things are either accelerating or decelerating?
Mike Hansen: Well, I would say that the fiscal '16, as we've talked a lot about, had an impact on - from our oil, gas and mining customers throughout the year. And that has had a bit of a negative impact on the growth of the Uniform side relative to the whole segment. So it is a little bit - the Uniform Rental side is a little bit lower in terms of the growth than the average. And we've been able to pick that up through the Facility Services, both in new business and in the penetration, and as Paul said, the retention. I would say that from the standpoint of do any one of those three stick out dramatically, I would say no. But I would say that the penetration, we have lots of opportunity left. There is a lot of runway to continue to add value to our existing customers. And we've been very successful at that in fiscal '16, particularly with some of our hygiene products and services like our Signature series, kind of a more front-of-the-house hygiene business. And I think what I am describing kind of shows itself in the numbers that Paul gave, and that is that the Uniform Rental business was 51% of that revenue last year, it's now 50%. The hygiene was 13% last year; it's now 14%. That's what you are seeing. You are seeing some lost oil, gas and mining customers, but it's being offset by some nice penetration and improvements in retention.
Joe Box: Right. Appreciate that. And then maybe switching gears to the SAP side, I know obviously it's very early on the Uniform Rental side. But can you maybe just talk about the number of branches that you've rolled out maybe through mid-July, and some early impressions or challenges that you might have had with that?
Mike Hansen: Well, we just recently started our pilot, and early indications are that we're off to a very good start. However, we're early. I think I talked about this last quarter. Our pilot is effectively starting with one location and really learning a lot. And assuming that goes well, we will move to several others. So that by mid-fiscal year, our expectation would be that we're kind of ready to start rolling out full speed. So right now, we're in that early pilot stage with one location. And, like I said, early indications are it's going pretty well. But again, we're early. And I think we'll have more to say about that more than likely at the end of our first and second quarters.
Joe Box: Got it. And maybe I guess in that same vein, clearly, SAP is going to be a big project for you guys over the next couple of years. Your balance sheet is generally under levered. I'm curious if you guys would be willing to do a sizable deal throughout this SAP process or would you pretty much table any sort of major deal until SAP was completely rolled out?
Mike Hansen: Well, I would tell you that this SAP is a big project, and we've got a lot of resources and attention put to that. But you know, opportunities don't come along every day. And if we had an opportunity, small or large, to add value for the long-term benefits at Cintas, we certainly would take a look at it. And again, at the right value, we would certainly love to do M&A that provides long-term value. That is the same message that we've had for quite a while and that doesn't change during the SAP rollout. It certainly may affect the way we would integrate it. But if we have opportunities that create great value for Cintas, we'll still take a good look at them.
Joe Box: Got it. Thank you, guys.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer.
Scott Schneeberger: Thanks. Good afternoon, guys. From the press release, we know that - and typically, you guys anticipate a fairly flat economy in the forward guidance. Could you speak to how you think about employment, maybe with regard to oil and gas and mining, and then x-ing that out, how you think about it? Thanks.
Mike Hansen: Well, we - from an oil, gas and mining standpoint, we have seen continued deterioration. But I would say today, that rate of deterioration is slowing, certainly relative to 90 days ago. But as Paul mentioned, we still expect to see a negative 60 basis points to the top line. So that tells you that we don't - we won't feel healed in that area in fiscal '17. From the rest of the - let's call it economic picture, I would say that it's still a challenging environment. There's not a lot of momentum to it. But I would call it stable. We haven't seen a lot of change today compared to a quarter ago. And so, I would say we're continuing to operate like we have been. I would say as we look into fiscal 2017, if I were to make a comment about the economy that maybe did feel a little bit different, I would say today compared to, let's call it six months ago, it does feel like there is a bit more uncertainty. When you think about the - we do - we have seen some ups and downs in employment; no doubt about that. We've seen the European issues; we've seen changes from the Department of Labor in terms of minimum wage and overtime that can have a pausing effect on our customers  We've got the election coming up. It does feel like there is a little bit more uncertainty than there was six months ago. And that's likely bleeding into the bottom end of our guidance range.
Scott Schneeberger: All right, thanks. That's helpful. And then you talked kind of piecemeal as we've gone through Q&A with regard to, say, branding and what quarters that may hit more. Could you speak to - I don't know if you mentioned the quarter with the extra or the one less day, but on a quarterly basis, top to bottom, when might we expect some of the ebbs and flows? I guess I'm thinking more on expense and how it will impact the margin. But just how we move through the year, is there anything worth pointing out that will be a big factor, just on the sequential basis as we move through the year? Thanks.
Mike Hansen: Sure. I would say a couple things, Scott. Paul talked about a tax rate of 36.7%. That's a little bit higher than last year, but lower than our - maybe our longer-term. I would expect that we are going to see a slightly lower tax rate in the first quarter, followed by something closer to what we've typically guided toward in that 37% range in the last three quarters. So that's maybe one point. From a Ready for the Workday campaign standpoint, I would say that it is going to - the bulk of it is going to be in the second and third quarters. From an SAP standpoint, we talked earlier about that will be back-end loaded. So we will have some costs in the first half of the year, but we turn on the depreciation and we turn on the licensing expenses in the second half of the year. So we will see a little bit more pressure in that back half from that standpoint. As far as calling things out, I think maybe the other thing that I might call out is the first quarter, as Paul mentioned, would have a little bit heavier, from a First Aid standpoint, ZEE implementation and integration costs. But from a quarter-to-quarter basis, I don't know that I would have much more to share than that.
Paul Adler: Yes, I can't recall, Scott, if we mentioned the third quarter is the quarter with the one less workday.
Scott Schneeberger: Thanks. I think you did last time; I just didn't have it in front. So thanks for repeating it, guys. And that color was very helpful. Appreciate it.
Mike Hansen: Sure.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Adrian Paz with Piper Jaffray. Mr. Paz, your line is open. You may want to – did you press your mute function.
Adrian Paz: Hi, this is Adrian Paz on for George Tong. I just wanted to get a little more code on M&A. I know for a long time, Cintas didn't do any acquisitions. And in recent quarters, we've seen a pretty big - well, yes, in recent quarters, we've seen a pretty big uptick in acquisition activity. I mean, is - are you seeing better valuations out there? And is there any segment that you're targeting growth in through M&A?
Mike Hansen: Well, we - I would say that, as far as M&A goes, it really is opportunistic. So when the opportunities become available, we need to be ready to take advantage of those, and we were opportunistic in fiscal '16, certainly. We would look for acquisitions in our Rental business, in our First Aid and Safety business, in our Fire businesses primarily. We love tuck-in acquisitions. They are very accretive. And we'll continue to look aggressively for those kind of opportunities, provided they are at the right value. We might look for bigger opportunities in any of those businesses, again, as long as they provide long-term value for us, and at the right valuation.
Adrian Paz: Also, can you provide an update on Canadian operations? I know that they had been experiencing some headwinds a few quarters back with the currency. Have those - I guess operations there stabilized, and are they, I guess, resuming growth?
Mike Hansen: Well, I would say that the performance of the business there hasn't necessarily been affected by the currency exchange rate. Our business continues to perform well. But we have seen less volatility in that Canadian exchange rate. I think the negative impact to the top line was 30 basis points. So we're still seeing a little bit of negative. But generally speaking, the business continues to perform well.
Adrian Paz: All right, thank you.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan.
Andrew Steinerman: Hi. Could you just tell us what share count we should use for the first quarter based on the share buyback that was done already? And does your guidance assume any further share buyback?
Paul Adler: Andrew, its Paul. The guidance does not assume any further share buyback. Maybe just to sync up, I don't know if you noticed, but with the earnings release, we have income statement that we enclosed, and there's a supplemental schedule in there that has the computation of diluted EPS. And if you look at that for the 12 months ended May 31st of 2016, you'll see our computation there for the current year where we start off with income from continuing ops; we reduce it. And it's about 1.6% reduction to allocate income to its participating securities. And then we divided that number by 110 million diluted shares outstanding. And so in fiscal '17 for our modeling, we are going to use about that same $110 million or not million dollars, 110 million shares, rather for computation of fiscal '17 EPS.
Andrew Steinerman: Perfect.
Paul Adler: So model your '17 number, reduce it for the income to the participating securities, and look at 110 million shares.
Andrew Steinerman: Thank you.
Operator: And we'll take our final question from Dan Dolev with Nomura.
Dan Dolev: Hey, thanks for taking my questions. I know you don't guide to margin growth, but if I think through the $30 million to $35 million of incremental SAP expense, and I think about what the implied operating margin growth is this year, say, at the midpoint maybe down 40 basis points, if I add back the SAP, I'm looking at maybe 20-ish. That's still a step-down from what you did last year, even at the midpoint. Is that just conservatism or could you maybe help me bridge through how should we think about that? Thanks.
Mike Hansen: Well, our total incremental margins for fiscal '16 for the company was - were about 20%. Rental, it was certainly higher. Rental was more like 28%. We have talked about, historically, that that incremental margin, we want that incremental margin to be in the 20% to 30% range. If we're higher than that for sustained periods of time, we worry that we're not investing enough. And I would tell you that, as we look into '17, excluding the SAP impact, we're about in that same range; maybe a little bit on the lower side because of the negative oil and gas impact, because of the negative workday impact. But generally speaking, we think there are good incremental margins. And at the top end of the guidance, even with the SAP impact, even with the oil and gas, even with the extra workday, there is a slight operating margin improvement.
Dan Dolev: Got it. And I remember last time you said you won't be sitting idly watching the $30 million to $35 million flow down to the bottom line. How do you feel about those today, four months later?
Mike Hansen: Well, I would like to think that the guidance that we have provided is an indication that that's exactly what we have done. And that is not sit around idly waiting for $30 million to $35 million to hit. But instead, we are continuing to run the business, execute very, very well, improve where we can, and come up with very good results. And we feel good about the business. I think that guidance would tell you that we feel good going into fiscal '17, and our partners still are executing at very, very high levels.
Dan Dolev: Excellent. Thank you very much.
Mike Hansen: You're welcome.
Operator: That will conclude the question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn it back to today's speakers for any additional or closing remarks.
Mike Hansen: Well, thank you for joining us tonight. We will issue our first quarter earnings in the end of September, and we look forward to speaking with you again at that time. Thank you.
Operator: That does conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation. And you may now disconnect.

===== 2016 Q3  (2016-03-22 17:00:00) =====
Executives: Mike Hansen - Vice President of Finance and Chief Financial Officer Paul Adler - Vice President and Treasurer
Analysts: Joe Box - KeyBanc Capital Markets Nate Brochmann - William Blair Denny Galindo - Morgan Stanley Sara Gubins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Justin Hauke - Robert W. Baird John Healy - Northcoast Research Adrian Paz - Piper Jaffray Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer Gary Bisbee - RBC Capital Markets
Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Cintas Quarterly Earnings Results Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Mike Hansen, Vice President of Finance and Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead, sir.
Mike Hansen: Good evening and thank you for joining us. With me is Paul Adler, Cintas' Vice President and Treasurer. We will discuss our third quarter results for fiscal 2016. After our commentary, we'll be happy to answer any questions. The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a Safe Harbor from civil litigation for forward-looking statements. This conference call contains forward-looking statements that reflect the company's current views as to future events and financial performance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those we may discuss. I refer you to the discussion on these points contained in our most recent filings with the SEC. We're pleased to report third quarter revenue of $1,216 billion, an increase of 9.7% from the prior year's third quarter. Organic revenue growth which adjusts for the impact of acquisitions and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations was 6.8%. Organic growth for the Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segment was 6.1% and the First Aid and Safety Services organic growth was 11.9%. Third quarter operating income was $193 million, an increase of 11.1% over last year's third quarter. Operating margin improved to 15.9% of revenue compared to an operating margin of 15.7% in the prior year period. The Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment led the way with a margin of 17.9%. Net income from continuing operations for the third quarter of fiscal 2016 was $117 million compared to $100 million in the prior year period, an increase of 16.9%. Net income from continuing operations as a percent of revenue improved to 9.6% from 9.0% of revenue in last fiscal year's third quarter. Earnings per diluted share or EPS from continuing operations for the third quarter were $1.05 compared to $0.85 from the third quarter of last year. Third quarter EPS from continuing operations increased 23.5% compared to the prior-year period. As a result of a third quarter results, we are updating our annual guidance. We expect fiscal 2016 revenue to be in the range of $4,860 billion to $4,890 billion, and fiscal 2016 EPS from continuing operations to be in the range of $3.98 to $4.03. This guidance does not include any potential deterioration in the US economy or additional share buybacks. The EPS guidance is detailed in the table within today's press release. Since the beginning of fiscal year 2016, Cintas repurchased about 5.7 million shares under our buyback program at an aggregate cost of about $483 million, including $100 million of repurchases in the third quarter. The company still has $280 million available under the current Board of Directors stock repurchase authorization. Before Paul provides more details of company financial performance, I want to take the opportunity to thank our employees, whom we call partners, for an outstanding job. We are proud of our strong financial results. We expect fiscal 2016 to be our sixth consecutive year of double-digit increases in EPS. Our organic growth rates are well in excess of the growth rates in US gross domestic product and employment, and we continue to both sell new accounts and add value to existing customers by addressing their specific business needs. We have distinct competitive advantages. Our corporate culture which guides and drives everything that we do. Our innovative and expansive product line that is comprised of many proprietary products that cannot be offered by our competition. And an unmatched scale that provides unique leveraging opportunities, global sourcing capabilities and the best and broadest service structure in North America. These competitive advantages have led to our history of strong financial results and have made us the clear leader in our industry. We are significantly larger than our competitors. We are growing faster and our margins are better. These strong financial results, our unmatched scale and our focus on the long-term, allow us to invest in ways not possible for our competitors. We are continuously engaged in the research and development of new products and services. This is evident in the breadth of the product and service offerings compared to others in the industry. We are able to embark on a national branding campaign visible on television. Our new tagline, Ready for the Workday, speaks to the value we provide our customers in helping them prepare for their workdays. This campaign is resulting in greater brand awareness to assist with cross selling efforts. It’s also energizing our partners who are now even more ready for our customers. And we are able to make transformative investments, such as our conversion to the SAP system. I'll discuss the status of the SAP project in a few minutes, after Paul provides more third quarter details. But these investments will continue to strengthen our industry leading position and ensure that we continue into the future helping many, many businesses get Ready for the Workday. I'll now turn the call over to Paul for additional information.
Paul Adler: Thank you, Mike. First please note that there were 65 workdays in this year's third quarter, the same number of days as last year's third quarter. However, this year's fourth quarter will have 66 workdays compared to only 65 in last year's fourth quarter. In total, fiscal year 2016 will have 262 workdays, 2 more than in fiscal 2015. Finally, note that our next fiscal year of 2017 will have one less day than this year. We estimate that this one less day will negatively impact fiscal 2017 total revenue growth by about 40 to 50 basis points in comparison to fiscal 2016. As Mike stated, total revenue increased organically by 6.8% in the third quarter. This solid growth rate was driven largely by new business wins, penetration of existing customers with more products and services and strong customer retention. Total company gross margin was 43.1% for the third quarter of this year compared to 42.9% last year. Total company energy-related expenses, including gas, diesel, and natural gas for this year's third quarter were 1.8% of revenue, about 50 basis points lower than last year's third quarter. Note however, that we continued to see the impact of headcount reduction in the oil, gas and coal industries. We estimate that the resulting decrease in revenue from customers in these industries lowered our organic growth rate by about 80 basis points in the third quarter and reduced our operating margin by about 40 basis points. So on a net basis, the low fuel prices benefited our operating margin by about 10 basis points. Recall that effective June 1st of this year, we have three reportable operating segments: Uniform Rental and Facility Services, First Aid and Safety Services, and all other. All other consists primarily of fire protection services and our direct sale business division. First Aid and Safety Services and all other are combined and presented as other services on the income statement. Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segment includes the rental and servicing of uniforms, mats and towels, and the provision of restroom supplies and other facility products and services. The segment also includes the sale of items from our catalogs to our customers on route. Uniform Rental and Facility Services revenue was $936 million, an increase of 6.0% compared to last year's third quarter. Excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes and acquisitions, organic growth was 6.1%. Our Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment gross margin was 44.0% for the third quarter, an increase of 70 basis points from 43.3% in last year's third quarter. Energy-related costs were 50 basis points lower than in last year's third quarter. We estimate that job losses in oil, gas and coal negatively impacted this segment's current year third quarter operating margin by about 40 basis points. So on a net basis, the low fuel prices benefited our Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating margin by about 10 basis points. Our First Aid and Safety Services operating segment includes revenue from the sale and servicing of first aid products, safety products and training. This segment's revenue for the third quarter was $119 [ph] million, which was 50% higher than last year's third quarter. Total growth benefited from the ZEE Medical acquisition. On an organic basis, growth for the segment was 11.9%. This segment's gross margin was 42.2% in the third quarter, compared to 47.3% in the prior year period. Operating income margin was 10.6% compared to 14.2% in last year's third quarter. The reduction in margins is wholly attributable to the impact of the recently acquired ZEE Medical business. We are in the integration phase and incurring the typical conversion costs. The assimilation of the business, including route consolidation is in process. The completion of which is integral to the realization of synergies. We are excited about the benefits and opportunities that will result upon completion of the integration in about six months. Regarding selling and general and administrative expenses, total company SG&A was 27.3% as a percentage of third quarter revenue compared to a total company SG&A in last year's third quarter of 27.2%. Medical expenses as a percentage of revenue were 10 basis points higher in this year's third quarter. Also note that our new national branding campaign impacted SG&A by about 45 basis points. Our effective tax rate on continuing operations for the third quarter was 33.8% compared to 36.3% for last year's third quarter. A prior year federal tax audit closed during the quarter with favorable results. We expect the effective tax rate for fiscal 2016 to be about 36.5%. Our cash and marketable securities were $386 million as of February 29, a decrease of $286 million from the balance as of November 30. Uses of cash in the quarter included $115 million for the dividend, $100 million for repurchases of Cintas common stock and $166 million to pay some of the taxes due on the gains related to the sale of our Shred-it investment. Capital expenditures for the third quarter were about $85 million. Our CapEx by reportable operating segment was as follows, $76 million in Uniform Rental, $6 million in First Aid and Safety, and $3 million in all other. We expect CapEx for fiscal 2016 to be in the range of $270 million to $300 million. Before we open the call up for questions, I'd like to turn the call back to Mike who will provide some additional information related to investments and SAP. Mike?
Mike Hansen: Thanks Paul. Our investment in the SAP system began years ago. We first converted to SAP in our accounting and finance functions. We soon followed that conversion with the implementation of portions of our global supply chain, including production planning and sourcing. With this experience under our belt, we put our first operating business into SAP, our Document Shredding business, and then our First Aid and Safety business. Over the past 2 years, we have been communicating our efforts to convert our largest operating division, Uniform Rental and Facility Services to SAP, which is a capital investment of approximately $100 million. We started with the blueprinting phase, which was designing the system. About a year ago, we moved into the realization phase, which was building the system and testing at. At this time, we expect to complete this realization phase in the next three to four months and then move into the pilot stage. The great news is we've been able to maintain the project costs and time line that we introduced two years ago with minimal changes. I want to say thanks to all of our partners working on this project. They've done and continue to do a tremendous job. In fact, we feel good enough with our progress to date that we've made decisions to extend the footprint of the SAP system into our distribution network and expand our e-commerce capabilities. We anticipate that these extensions will be a capital investment of roughly $40 million over the next year or so. Given the progress made and proximity to implementation, we have better visibility and are now able to share with you the estimated impacts to our fiscal years 2017 and 2018. We expect to begin depreciating the rental capital project around December of 2016. Therefore, our fiscal year 2017 will include about a half of a year of depreciation. It will also include about half of a year of system maintenance costs. The conversion of hundreds of our operations to SAP will occur during fiscal 2017 and extend through fiscal 2018. Training costs, which are expensed when incurred as opposed to amortized over time, will exist in both fiscal '17 and '18. As is customary in such a conversion, we expect to have additional - other additional costs in 2017 and 2018 as a result of inefficiencies until the old system is completely offline. We estimate that the investment in SAP will result in $30 million to $35 million of expense in fiscal 2017 and $45 million to $50 million of expense in fiscal 2018. We will begin to realize some cost structure benefits in fiscal 2019, but will likely see the power of the system beginning in fiscal 2020, once all operations have had some experience in running it. This is a transformational investment and we are confident it will be successful. We've seen many companies, including some in our own industry, struggle with these large implementation projects. Our financial strength and commitment to the long-term has enabled us to dedicate the required internal resources to the project in every phase. We also have the best external resource assisting us as SAP and not a third-party consulting firm has been working with us every step of the way. And as previously mentioned, we have a great experience with SAP from our prior implementations. We look forward to the long-term benefits this investment will provide. That concludes our prepared remarks and we'll now be happy to answer any questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question with Joe Box from KeyBanc Capital Markets.
Joe Box: Hey, good afternoon, guys.
Mike Hansen: Hi, Joe.
Paul Adler: Hi, Joe.
Joe Box: I just wanted to dig into the 6.1% organic growth rate in uniform. I know you guys usually wait until 4Q to give us a little bit more detail on the breakout of that segment. But can you maybe just talk to were there any noticeable differences in the growth rate between the 52% that’s uniform and the 48% that is other or any directional trends between the two?
Mike Hansen: Well, we've talked a little bit, Joe, about the issues that we've had in the oil and gas sector. Outside of that though, we haven’t seen much of a change in the operating environment. And I would say that our sales continue to be broad-based in terms of the different verticals that we're selling to and the different products and services that we're actually selling. And so we haven’t seen much of a change with the exception of the oil and gas that continues to be problematic and has deteriorated even further in this third quarter.
Joe Box: Got you. So it's fair to say that there's not any sort of moderation above and beyond within the uniform only component relative to where you were at over the last quarter or two?
Mike Hansen: No, and I think the organic growth is fairly consistent with the last quarter, second quarter which was at 6.2%. And so, no, we haven’t seen a lot of change in the economic environment, and based on our guidance, we still feel pretty good about going forward.
Joe Box: Got it. Thanks for that. And then Mike, I appreciate the commentary on the breadth of your products earlier. How should we think about the pace of new product intros going into hygiene, first aid, non-uniform markets? Are you seeing an accelerating pace there based on the new workday campaign?
Mike Hansen: Well, I think from a campaign standpoint, first of all, Cintas and all of our partners are very energized by the campaign. We are really excited about it and it really speaks well of the value that we offer. I would say that reactions though, to the campaign are primarily anecdotal. We hear a lot of good news from our locations. But it’s too early to tell whether that’s having any impact on our current results. I think we'll know more about that as we go through the next several quarters. But getting back to the products and services, you know, Joe, we spend a lot of time in terms of innovation. And we invest a lot in R&D to find the right products that can solve problems for our customers. And again, I think that speaks to our new tagline, Ready for the Workday. And you know, Joe, when we think about the products and services, we've got retail inspired products, like Carhartt and our wrinkle free garments that people want to wear. We've got customer focused solutions like our scrub rental programs and our chemical cleaning solutions. And the beautiful thing about these products are they are all proprietary. All of these that I have mentioned are proprietary and cannot be offered by anybody else in the industry. We will - when we introduce a new product, we've got 900,000 or so customers out there that are warm leads. And even though they are warm leads, we don’t get fully penetrated overnight. It takes a while to educate our people on it, on selling new products, and then it takes a little bit of time to sell it to our customers. But having said that, we've been able to grow quite a bit above, as I said GDP and employment and the industry because in part we've created innovative products and services that our customers want. And I would say that we've also - we've got a very, very, diverse customer base and that diversity has really helped us. You see others in our industry who are really suffering because of less diversity. We've got a very diverse customer base. And part of that is on design and part of it is we have products and services that reach farther and reach broader than our competition. So we're going to continue to penetrate our existing customers with our products that we have, and we've got a lot of runway with those. We will also continue to work on R&D. I am not ready to announce any new products. But, Joe, we feel really good about our ability to continue to grow better than GDP, better than employment, better than the industry, because we are innovative. We've got a broader product line. We've got a diverse customer base, and we've got a great penetration opportunity. We think that has served us very well in the past and will continue to serve us into the future.
Joe Box: Got it. Thanks for all the color on that. Just one real quick one, relative to the stronger dollar, the impact is pretty clear on the Canadian business. I'm just curious though, if there is more broadly an opportunity to maybe source your garments better?
Mike Hansen: Well, Joe, I would say there's always - we would tell our global supply chain people, there are always ways we can improve and I think they believe that as well. The Canadian impact that you are referring to was primarily a top line impact. We haven't seen a significant bottom line impact. But, yes, there are certainly sourcing opportunities. The good news is we've got a great global supply chain and they are – they source globally and they are very flexible. We do not own a lot of our manufacturing. And so this group brings us lots of value. And I would say there are always ways to improve, whether it's new technology, new sources or just changes in mix and volume. We certainly think there are opportunities.
Joe Box: Appreciate it. Thanks, guys.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Manav Patnaik with Barclays.
Unidentified Analyst: Hi, this is actually Greg calling on for Manav. I just want to ask about the cross sell opportunity between the First Aid and Safety business and the Uniform business? I think you talked about 20% penetration on the last call. Just wondering how you guys are thinking about accelerating that and whether getting this ERP system in place will help to do that?
Mike Hansen: We do think that - a couple things, our First Aid and Safety business is doing a great job of digesting the ZEE acquisition. But keep in mind that’s a fairly large acquisition for them. It was more than a third of the legacy Cintas First Aid and Safety business. That’s priority number one. But clearly, yes, when we are on the SAP system, one of the benefits is that all of our operations will have more visibility and clarity into our customers and the different products and services that they have or don't have. And so we really do believe one of the real big benefits of the SAP system is to improve that penetration. But having said that, hey look, we feel really good about the First Aid and Safety business altogether. We know that we've got, as Paul said, two more quarters of integration; the integration is going well. Our margins are down from a year ago. We certainly understand that and certainly some of that is due to integration costs. And others are just due to a different business. We're integrating a different business than Cintas is. And we have penetration opportunities. And when we think about that organic growth that we saw this quarter of 11.9%, we're really excited about that. Our people in the First Aid and Safety business have still been able to focus on selling and servicing the customers, as well as starting to get into this the ZEE penetration opportunities. We talk a lot about the penetration opportunities for our rental business. But our ZEE customers generally have been only First Aid cabinet customers. And with our First Aid business, we have the ability or the opportunity to expand into safety products, training services, AEDs, et cetera. And so have - we feel like we've got a good penetration opportunity there and I think our 11.9% organic growth speaks to that a little bit.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay. That makes a lot of sense. Also just wanted to kind of level set, I guess, on energy. It sounded like it came in pretty close to what you were saying with the 80 basis point headwind on the top line and I guess, 1.8% of cost. Is the expectation for the fourth quarter still half as much of an impact on the top line and then that 1.8% on the cost side?
Paul Adler: Yes, Greg, it’s Paul. On the top line, from the customer and the headcount reductions, that about half of the impact from Q3 to be experienced in Q4 is a good figure. In terms of the energy, the cost side of it, though, I think the price per barrel really dropped low in our third quarter, I think it reached $26 at one point. It’s kind of rebounded through the $40 threshold. So I think if it stays at about that level our energy as a percent of our revenue would probably be more in line with our Q2, which was about 2.0% of revenue. And in Q4 last year, our energy was about 2.2%. So the bottom line is we're expecting probably about 20 basis points of benefits from the prices at the pump. But then really offset by the headcount reductions that we expect to continue to incur into Q4.
Unidentified Analyst: Right. Okay, that makes sense. And I guess the last one, just from a modeling perspective, the organic growth in all other would you guys be able to give that?
Mike Hansen: Yes. So Greg, it was about 8.2% for the quarter. And it’s a strong year-to-date as well. All other, just as a reminder, includes that direct sale business and our fire protection business. That direct sale business is typically a slow grower relative to everything else we have, meaning 3%, 4%. So for that organic growth to be as high as it was in that all other segments, that fire protection business is growing quite nicely.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay. Thank you so much.
Operator: We'll next go to Nate Brochmann with William Blair.
Nate Brochmann: Yes, good evening, gentlemen.
Mike Hansen: Hi, Nate.
Nate Brochmann: So I wanted to talk a little bit more about the campaign. I know you won't really be able to look back in the rear view mirror for a while to see the impact. Have you - is that still going on the same timeline that you originally thought that it would or has that extended at all? And then second question, to my knowledge at least since covering you, that this is the first big huge national campaign that you've ever embarked on, and if that is true, why the timing was kind of right to do that?
Mike Hansen: So a couple things. It is following the timeline that we originally established and thought of. I would expect that the spend on this campaign is going to be a bit lower, quite a bit lower in our fourth quarter and likely ramp up again next fiscal year, second quarter-ish. So it is following the original timeline that we had established. This is the largest and the first national campaign certainly that includes television. And it is the largest campaign that we've ever done. And so, why now? Look, we think it’s the right time to continue to get our brand awareness greater and greater throughout the country. We've had many customers over the years say to us, gosh, I didn't know you did that. I didn't know that you did first aid and safety. I didn't know that you had fire protection services. I didn't know you had chemical cleaning services. And the more we heard this, we kept thinking we need to educate. And so we thought that, look, now is a great time to do this because we've got some businesses that are really doing well and executing well. We've got a lot of great products, a lot of fairly new products and we want to get the word out to many, many businesses in North America that when those businesses have issues, need problems solved, think about calling Cintas. They can maybe help us get Ready for the Workday. And so we think it's a great time to do that because we're executing well. We've got a lot of good products and services, and we think its going to give us some momentum going into the future.
Nate Brochmann: Okay. Great for that. And then just kind to circle back on the end market questions a little bit, just to dive in one layer deeper. But at this point, obviously, I would assume that you feel that you kind of have your arm around the oil and gas headcount reductions. Obviously, by kind of giving where we probably are going to go in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter, I would assume that’s the case. And also based on your earlier commentary regarding some of the other end markets, I would assume you are not seeing any further weakness in kind of maybe some of your industrial end markets, is that all fair to say?
Paul Adler: That’s correct, Nate. As far as oil and gas, right, we believe we have a handle on for Q4 in terms of the quantification. We wish we had our hands around it in terms of thinking and believing that it was at the bottom. But those rig counts that we continue to monitor continue to decline and they are probably down about 60% year-over-year. So we'll continue to watch that into next fiscal year. And then in terms of manufacturing, it continues to be positive for us. We believe that more of our customers in the sector are stable or growing as opposed to shrinking. But, of course, we understand the headwinds that are out there and the industry statistics. So we'll continue to monitor it. But, yes, you nailed it, at this point in time the only negative impact in any particular sector is from oil and gas and coal as well.
Nate Brochmann: Sure. Okay. That's great. And then one last, if I could squeeze it in. We talked about, obviously, and – I mean, it's the way everything goes with the SAP and congratulations for not having any major hiccups so far, knock on wood. But with some of those costs that you're anticipating going into next fiscal year and the following, are there any potential offsets? And I mean, I know every day you're always working on productivity improvements and efficiency improvements via technology or whatnot. But is there anything on the horizon that might give us a little bit of an offset to that, that would be above the norm or would there be any potential upside from any synergy benefits related to ZEE?
Mike Hansen: Well, are there any benefits related - synergy benefits related to ZEE? That's a little bit of an independent question. Yes, we absolutely think there are and that will be – we'll incorporate those thoughts into our guidance for fiscal '17 in July. So, yes, we do think that ZEE and the first aid margins are certainly going to improve. From an SAP standpoint, let's keep in mind this is the largest project that we've ever done. As we've kind of come to the end of this realization phase and we've been testing the project, we're really starting to see the power of the system and we're excited about getting this implemented. And we believe that there is the power in the system that we hoped for. We certainly still see that there are long-term benefits. But having said that, we're not going to take any shortcuts in this implementation. We're going to make sure we do it the right way with no adverse impact to our customers. And one of the risk mitigating things about the way we are rolling this out is that we've got hundreds of operations that need to be converted and they effectively happen one at a time. And so its not like we turn it on and our entire rental segment goes live. We have to do this one at a time. Now that mitigates the risk to us. But it extends the rollout a little bit as well through that fiscal '18. And so we - look, we think we're doing this the right way. As I mentioned, we've seen others, both in our industry and outside of our industry struggle with these and we feel fully confident that, that’s not going to happen to us. Now, certainly those numbers that I gave you are fairly large, and as you know, Nate, we're not going to sit idly by and just let those fall to the bottom. We are going to manage the impact as best we can. We are going to control our cost structure and we're going to become as efficient as we can become in the next couple of years. Now in fiscal '17, look, we're going to be on probably less than half of our locations and I would not expect that we're going to see a lot of system benefit. In fiscal '18 we might start to see a little bit of system benefit. But it’s going to be muted because we're going to still be converting quite a few locations. But having said that again, Nate, we're not going to sit idly by and just let $30 million to $35 million drop to the bottom without really managing the impact through our cost structure, through efficiency gains, et cetera. And will we be able to offset all $30 million to 35 million? No, but we will do our best to manage that impact.
Nate Brochmann: That sounds great. Thanks for the added color, Mike. I appreciate that.
Mike Hansen: No problem. And you know, we – look, do not do things for the short term. So this is a transformational system that’s going to carry us for a long time. And it’s worth the investment. It is absolutely worth the investment we're putting in, in the next couple of years.
Nate Brochmann: Great. Thanks.
Mike Hansen: Okay.
Operator: Thank you. We'll take the next question from Denny Galindo with Morgan Stanley.
Denny Galindo: Hi there. Thanks for taking my call.
Mike Hansen: Sure.
Denny Galindo: I had a question on California market, little geographic question. Aramark said they were expanding capacity there and judging by your number of locations, I would guess maybe 7% of your rental revenue comes from California. Have you seen any impact, any competitive impact from Aramark's increased presence in California or are things pretty much business as usual over there?
Mike Hansen: Denny, we haven’t seen any marketable impact. Our West Coast locations are performing very, very well, and I would expect that they will continue to do so. And we haven’t seen an impact.
Denny Galindo: Is that about the right estimate of the size of California, somewhere around that 7% to 10% of revenue?
Mike Hansen: I don’t have – I honestly do not have that number in front of me, Denny.
Denny Galindo: Okay. And then a little bit more color on the SAP question. Is the rollout and it sounds like it's location-by-location, is that evenly distributed throughout the year or is there any kind of seasonal impact to the enrollment? It sounds like it kinds of picks up maybe in the second half of this next fiscal year and does it mean it peaks in like Q1, Q2 and then tapers off after that?
Mike Hansen: So as I mentioned in my opening remarks, we're going to start the pilot sometime in the next three to four months. And that pilot is a very important part of our process. That pilot will make sure that the first several systems are operating the way we think they should operate, that the system performance is as we expect, et cetera. And so, the first half of fiscal '17 is really going to be working through the pilot to make sure that we've built a system, we've tested it, but its not – we've not gone live with it. That first part of fiscal '17 is really the first test on live customers, and we're going to make sure that, that goes right before we start rolling it out. So we'll start to see the implementation pick up in the second half of the year and it will continue all the way through fiscal '18.
Denny Galindo: Okay. And how flexible are those cost numbers, if something like if the macro deteriorated, that you think you could reduce the impact from the SAP training by extending it out further or I imagine there is some kind of range of where you think the numbers will really shake out?
Mike Hansen: Well, we - first of all, the longer the implementation takes, the more expensive it becomes, because we have more people tied up in that rollout process. So it does not benefit us to slow or stop that process once we get it started. We need to get it started when we expect to and we're going to see that move through the finish. But, Denny, if we saw a significant change in the economy, there are things that we can certainly do to help manage our cost structure and really continue to generate some pretty good cash flow, similar to the way we did in the last recession where we generated more cash than ever before in a two year period in the company's history. So we're going to get this thing done. I would certainly hope that we don’t get into a recession in the next two years. But we're operating for the long-term, Denny. And we believe, as I said, this is a transformational system and it’s going to be great for our customers and our partners who are operating the system.
Denny Galindo: Okay. And one last one, just on the acquisition pipeline. I mean, with kind of energy almost bottoming here, are you seeing any small kind of regional players maybe in an energy heavy area that might be worth buying here or what does the acquisition pipeline look like more broadly?
Mike Hansen: The acquisition pipeline still - I would say still looks pretty good. I mean, we've spent $150 million on acquisitions so far this fiscal year. We continue to look for tuck-in opportunities. We think they are out there. And we just need to have the willing seller at the right value. But we think there is a nice pipeline and we're going to continue to work that pipeline. So, yes, I do believe there are still opportunities out there.
Denny Galindo: That's it for me. Thanks.
Mike Hansen: Okay.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Sara Gubins with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Sara Gubins: Hi, thank you. On the costs that you mentioned for next year, the $30 million to $35 million, is that all incremental spend? I mean, could you help us understand what it was or what you are expecting it to be in fiscal '16?
Mike Hansen: So it is - I would say that it is mostly incremental spend, and in fiscal '16, we haven’t spent much. There is some training, we are doing things like training the trainers. But there is not a lot of spend that's hitting the P&L this fiscal year. It will primarily start to happen once we get to the pilot stage and then ramp up once we get to the actual rollout.
Sara Gubins: Okay. And you mentioned that we should also see D&A start to pick up. Could you give us some sense of how we should think about that in fiscal '17?
Mike Hansen: I would say that, I'd rather give you a little bit more information on that in July, because while we've talked about the SAP capital project starting to depreciate, we've got other capital projects that are important to us, like making sure that we have the routes to continue to handle our growth and making sure that we've got capacity. So I think, Sara, I'd rather answer that question in July.
Sara Gubins: Okay. And then just last question, could you give us an update on add-stops, what you are seeing including energy clients and excluding?
Paul Adler: Sara, its Paul. The commentary is very similar to last quarter, meaning that really only two things were noteworthy. First is that in our add-stops metric we certainly see the negative impact to our FRC, our Flame Resistant Garments, as a result of the headcount reductions in oil, gas, and coal. Outside of that though there is nothing remarkable, nothing trending significantly one way or the other. And then the only other item of note would be that the winter weather here across the country was definitely a little more mild this year than last year. And we typically count on more of that snow and slush to drive mat placements and increase revenue accordingly, changes in garments, outerwear, et cetera. We didn’t see it to the extent we did last year. But it wasn’t significant and it's certainly a seasonal type of an impact.
Sara Gubins: Thank you.
Operator: We'll next go to Justin Hauke with Robert W. Baird.
Justin Hauke: Thank you; good evening, guys. I appreciate as well the SAP expense guidelines. I guess, maybe as an offset, a number that we hadn't really gotten is the integration costs associated with ZEE Medical and it was a sizable acquisition. I think the plan was that, that would be fully done by the end of the year, maybe just an update on that and if you could kind of quantify how much that expense has been?
Mike Hansen: We have talked a little bit about getting that completed by the end of the year or shortly thereafter. And it’s probably going to be shortly thereafter. That does not mean that we've seen any major slippage in the integration. It’s just – it is a large implementation or integration for our business and we feel like it is going very well. We haven’t gotten into a lot of specifics about the ZEE integration cost. Justin, with tuck-in acquisitions it becomes a little harder to fully separate total integration costs compared to operating costs. And so, we haven't tried to come to specific numbers on that - on what is specifically integration, because at the end of the day, we've got costs of operating and costs of connecting the businesses and we're hiring service sales reps, those are our drivers. We're hiring service sales reps and there are costs to getting a tuck-in acquisition ready. And so, we haven’t called out anything specific. But I would suggest that probably in the fourth quarter we're going to see some results that are probably about the same, maybe slightly better than we've seen in the third quarter. And I would say that the first quarter, maybe even less so in terms of the mix impact.
Justin Hauke: Okay. Yes, I appreciate that. I'm just trying to just understand how incremental the costs are and independent of the synergies if there was something that would come out. But it did sound like we'll get more of that in '17? I guess, maybe my second question is just the implied guidance for the fourth quarter, and I know this is a little short term oriented. But is the message that you are assuming in the way the guidance is laid out, is that assuming that your margins are relatively flat year-over-year with the fuel cost benefit moderating? And if that is the case, I guess, how should we think about it from the standpoint that the marketing expense falls off as well in the fourth quarter?
Mike Hansen: Yes, I would say that the guidance suggests that we're kind of bracketing last year. Last year our fourth quarter we were at 15.6% operating margin and I would suggest that if we can reach the high end of that guidance, if things go well, I would expect some margin expansion. If we see a little bit of a pullback in the economy, if we see the oil and gas broaden to affect other verticals, we might be at the lower end and see flattish or slightly down. But I'd like to think that we're going to continue to operate in the existing type of economy and if we can hit the top end of the guidance, I would expect that to be some margin improvement.
Justin Hauke: All right. Thank you very much. I appreciate the time.
Operator: We'll next go to John Healy with Northcoast Research.
John Healy: Thanks. Mike, I just wanted to follow up on that question on the margin outlook for 4Q. I was hoping you could size the SG&A benefit you get from having the 66 workdays versus the 65 and just try to put that in context, and what type of scenario would you have to see to see margins going to be anything but up in the fourth quarter?
Mike Hansen: I think we've talked about a 50 - 40 basis point to 50 basis point impact in a quarter for the extra work day, and two thirds of that being in the gross margin. What would we have to see in order for margins to go down, I think we would have to see some pullback in the economy. I think we'd have to see some issues with our customer’s willingness to continue to spend with us. But I would like to think that it is not all that likely.
John Healy: Okay. That makes sense. And from a big picture standpoint, I was trying to think about your customer base in three buckets, your national accounts, your Costcos or Walmarts and General Motors of the world, and then your mid side regional accounts and then your small business customers. Could you talk to any sort of change in performance in terms of how each of those buckets maybe is performing? Is one of those groups kind of driving the lion's share of the growth in the company these days and has that contribution moved at all?
Mike Hansen: I don't have any specific numbers. But I guess, John, I don’t – I am not aware of any changes in those buckets. And in terms of the mix and performance, I am not aware of any changes. Our improvement, our growth continues to be fairly broad. And its - I think its broad in all of our businesses, which tells me that we're seeing good performance in almost every vertical and type of business with the exception of the ones that we called out.
John Healy: Okay. That makes sense. And then one final clarification question. When you mentioned the $40 million to $45 million of spend on the SAP initiative in 2018, was that an incremental $40 million to $45 million on top of the $30 million to $35 million this year or is that an all-in spend number?
Mike Hansen: John, the number was $45 million to $50 million for 2018 and that is an all-in spend. That is not incremental to the $30 million to $35 million for '17, so good question.
John Healy: Thank you.
Operator: We'll next go to Adrian Paz with Piper Jaffray.
Adrian Paz: Hi. Quick question on the taxes. Can you provide more color on the lower taxes that we're seeing this quarter and do you believe that's going to continue into 2017?
Mike Hansen: I do not. Typically we guide towards about a 37.3% all-in tax rate and when we have federal audits, they are fairly large projects and when they - if they are resolved favorably, like this one was, then there can be reserves that we have set up for tax positions that can be released. And that's what happened in this quarter. I think Paul mentioned our expected tax rate is 36.5% for this year, I would expect 37.3% next year.
Adrian Paz: Great. Thanks. Thanks for the color there. And also I'm just trying to get a better understanding of what drove growth in uniform rentals. Could you provide some color on pricing trends that you're seeing in your uniform rentals?
Mike Hansen: Sure. In the US, we really did not see much of a marketable change in pricing from the second quarter, still very competitive, but I wouldn’t say that we saw much of a change. I would say that in Canada, little bit of a different story. We've seen some significant price increases from the competition. And I would suggest it looks likely that they may be looking for some margin opportunities. But I would say, back to the US, not a lot of change.
Adrian Paz: All right. Great. Thank you so much.
Operator: We'll now take a question from Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer.
Scott Schneeberger: Thanks and congratulations on the nice quarter, guys. I'm going to jump around a little bit. First one, anecdotally anything to share about the campaign, it’s been asked already, it's a little early. But you touched on it a little bit, but any specific, without naming names, like anecdotes of where someone actually capitulated and added business from the national campaign? Thanks.
Mike Hansen: I would say - I'm not sure about capitulated, but I would say we get – we have internal communications that will kind of bubble up comments from our sales people and they will be comments like, hey, I got a call today. A prospective customer heard our television ad and decided to call us and ask about our services. We might get, as an SSR stops by, a customer each week. We've gotten some examples of customers coming to our SSRs or our drivers, service sales reps. But we've got customers coming saying, wow, I love that commercial. Tell me more about first aid and safety. We've had examples where regional customers will come to one of our regional sales people and say, hey, I saw the commercial, digital commercial ad and it got me thinking about some of the issues that I have. And so we've seen it both from television, from radio, from digital; we've seen commentary from our salespeople that our customers are signaling out that they have seen the campaign, they like it; and it piques interest at times in some of the things that we can do for them.
Scott Schneeberger: Thanks a lot. And then someone asked earlier about or you guys brought up from a question earlier the new product pipeline. You mentioned a lot of work on R&D, nothing to announce yet. But you've had obviously a lot of success, Carhartts, Calentel [ph] What - are we on the cusp of seeing something new from you, something big as far as another addition to product service?
Mike Hansen: Scott, I would say that we still have a lot of runway in the products and services that we've announced. We do have some things that are in our pipeline that we're working on, but I am not ready to talk about any of them specifically.
Scott Schneeberger: Fair enough. And lastly, you mentioned extending the footprint on the ERP [ph] for distribution, and particularly including e-commerce. I'm curious, could you elaborate on that, what you are looking to achieve there and what the opportunity is? Thanks.
Mike Hansen: So from a distribution standpoint, that is primarily the distribution centers that ship to our rental locations. And so that is fairly obvious that gets them on the same platform and it makes a lot of sense. From an e-commerce standpoint, this system will allow us to share with our customers more information, to allow some of our customers an online buying experience similar to retail, and just allow much more ease-of-use from a selling and an understanding of what we do in the products and services. So it’s really getting to a little bit more of a retail-like application for particularly our larger customers, but for all customers.
Scott Schneeberger: Sounds good. All right; thanks very much.
Mike Hansen: Okay.
Operator: We'll take a question from Gary Bisbee with RBC Capital Markets.
Gary Bisbee: Hey, guys, good afternoon. I obviously noted, as others have, your comments about the product portfolio and outgrowing GDP and all these things. I guess, a couple of questions on that from me. The first one just, is there anything that you think any reasons you would expect the business to behave differently in a future recession than it’s done in the last couple? You clearly did not outgrow GDP in 2008, 2009 and the business contracted quite a bit, not only the top line, but also margins. I realize that was a pretty nasty recession. But anything that leads you to believe you'd behave differently if we had another very difficult economic environment?
Mike Hansen: Yes, I think, first of all, Gary, you hit the nail on the head. That was the greatest recession we've seen in a long, long time. Unfortunately for us that interrupted 40 straight years of growth in sales and profit, so effectively for something like the last 46, 47 years we've grown in 45, 44 of them. So that was a big one. The next recession, a lot depends on how deep and broad it is. But I - one of the things, when we look at our business today compared to, let's call it, 2006, '07, '08, we've got a broader business. We've got a more diverse customer base. We were not much in the healthcare space back then. We were not much in financial services and other professional environments. We've been able to get into those much more with both rental, our rental products and services, but also first aid and fire protection. So we're in some verticals that might be a little less or more resistant, like healthcare to a recession. I think the other thing that I would say that’s different is today our uniform, total uniform business is less than 50% of our revenue. And so, I think if we saw a pullback in jobs, I would not expect that we would lose many customers. But a lot of our products and services are still necessary for our customers, like hygiene products and services, like the fire protection services, like some of the first aid and safety requirements. And in addition to that, there are some required garments like fire resistant clothing. So I think the broadening of our product line, the diversity of our customers, will help us through the next recession. But again, a lot depends on how deep is that recession and how broad is it.
Gary Bisbee: Great that's helpful. And then just a follow-up on that. You talk about having a broader product portfolio and I realize a lot of that is the growth of first aid, fire, and safety. But it’s curious to me in that add-stops really haven't grown much. So it sounds like you haven't had a big part of your growth this up-cycle been driven by selling more stuff to the base. It's been more new customers, if I understand it. And then I go back to this number you give us on the fourth quarter every year and I'm awaiting next quarter of the mix within rentals and the mix of all the five or six different things you give us has been exactly the same percentages for four straight fiscal years. So I'm trying to really assess how much the composition of growth has really changed versus just executing well, bringing on similar types of new customers as you've always done in the past, any comments or thoughts on that? Thank you.
Mike Hansen: Well, the - let's talk about the growth. First of all, new business has been very important to us over the last five or six years and will continue to always be important to us. New business, when we sell a new account, we do not normally sell everything in our portfolio to that new customer. We have to earn the customers trust and we have to show them that our service is of value. So new customers are really important for us. First of all, because they bring revenue but secondly, they bring future revenue opportunities, and so new business will always be very important to us. It is now and will continue to be. And then the penetration is very, very important. And I would tell you that the net add-stops metric, it’s a legacy rental metric, and when we have broadened our business like we have, it really doesn’t apply as much when we're talking about selling hygiene products and services to our customers, selling chemical cleaning solutions. That net add-stops really speaks to uniforms and mat placements. And we don’t like to, we don’t pay attention to it quite as much internally because it’s just losing its importance as we broaden our business. So I would say, new business will continue to be important, penetration will continue to be important and the reason that you haven’t seen any change in the mix of our rental division is because its all been growing and its really important for us that it all grows, because that means we are adding new customers and we are penetrating existing customers. It’s all really important for us.
Paul Adler: I think, Mike, too, and Gary, everything is growing. So the percentages are not changing significantly. But it's also an over $3 billion segment that's going to take some time to change. And one way it is changing, even though proportionally it’s not changing. But for example, in garments, you manufacturing is a minority of the business and we are replacing the typical blue-on-blue shirt and pants with Carhartt or with performance polo’s or cargo pants. And so in hygiene, for example, we have our hygiene standard [ph] signature line that is able to get us not just into the typical restrooms of manufacturing or oil change shops, but high end into offices and corporate complexes. And I think that changeover, even though proportionally it’s not changing, but the kind of the substance of it, the quality of it, so to speak, should bode well and hopefully make us more resilient in the future.
Gary Bisbee: Great. Thank you. Just one quick cleanup one. The incremental SAP expense you called out, is that in SG&A or would any of that be in cost of services and should we on a segment basis think it's all in rentals? Thanks a lot.
Mike Hansen: I would expect that that will all fall into SG&A and the great majority of that will fall into rental.
Gary Bisbee: Thank you.
Mike Hansen: Okay.
Operator: That concludes today's question-and-answer session. Mr. Adler, Mr. Hansen, I'll turn the call back to you for any closing or additional remarks.
Mike Hansen: Thank you very much for joining us tonight. We will issue our fourth quarter earnings in mid-July. We look forward to speaking with you again at that time. Good night.
Operator: That concludes today's conference and thank you for your participation.

Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Cintas Quarterly Earnings Results Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Mike Hansen, Vice President of Finance and Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead, sir.
Michael Hansen: Good evening and thank you for joining us. With me is Paul Adler, Cintas' Vice President and Treasurer. We will discuss our second quarter results for fiscal 2016. And after our commentary, we'll be happy to answer any questions. The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a Safe Harbor from civil litigation for forward-looking statements. This conference call contains forward-looking statements that reflect the company's current views as to future events and financial performance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those we may discuss. I refer you to the discussion on these points contained in our most recent filings with the SEC. We're pleased to report second quarter revenue of $1.219 billion, an increase of 8.5% from the prior-year second quarter. Organic revenue growth, which adjusts for the impact of acquisitions and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, was 6.5%. Organic revenue growth for Uniform Rental and Facility Services was 6.2%, and the First Aid and Safety Services organic growth was 9.8%. The performance of our sales force in both segments continues to be strong, with the solid improvement in the sales rep productivity. We are pleased with our ability to continue to add new customers and to provide existing customers with additional products and services from our broad line. Second quarter operating income was $200.3 million, an increase of 10.3% over last year's second quarter. Second quarter operating margin improved to 16.4% of revenue compared to an operating margin of 16.2% in the prior-year period. The Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment led the way with a margin of 18.1%. Net income from continuing operations for the second quarter of fiscal year 2016 was $115.5 million, compared to $103.7 million in the prior-year period. An increase of 11.3%. Net income from continuing operations as a percent of revenue improved to 9.5% from 9.2% of revenue in last fiscal year's second quarter. Earnings per diluted share or EPS from continuing operations for the second quarter of fiscal year 2016 were $1.03 compared to $0.86 for the second quarter of last year. Second quarter fiscal 2016 EPS from continuing operations increased 19.8% compared to the prior-year period. We are on pace to achieve our sixth consecutive year of double-digit increases in EPS. As Cintas CEO Scott Farmer stated in today's press release, we're happy to again report strong increases in revenue, operating income and EPS. We thank our employees, whom we call partners, for continuously striving to exceed expectations. As a result of our second quarter results, we're updating our annual guidance. We expect fiscal 2016 revenue to be in the range of $4.825 billion to $4.880 billion and fiscal 2016 EPS from continuing operations to be in the range of $3.83 to $3.90. This guidance does not include any potential deterioration in the U.S. economy or additional share buybacks. The EPS guidance is detailed in the table within today's press release. On December 4, we paid an annual dividend of $1.05 per share, totaling $115.5 million. The dividend per share was 23.5% more than last year's annual dividend of $0.85 per share, and was the 32nd consecutive year it have been increased. The dividend coupled with our share buyback program demonstrates our commitment to increasing shareholder value. As previously disclosed since the beginning of fiscal year 2016, Cintas repurchased about 4.5 million shares under our buyback program at an aggregate cost of $382.9 million, including $180.4 million of repurchases in the second quarter. The company still has $380 million available under the current Board of Directors stock repurchase authorization. Before Paul provides more details of company financial performance, I want to briefly address the impact of oil, gas, and coal on our results. We've talked a lot about the benefits of low fuel prices, but we've seen these low fuel prices affect our customers more than anticipated 90 days ago. U.S. oil rig counts are down over 60% compared to last year, and the price of oil has tumbled below $40 per barrel. We see the impact of headcount reductions in not only the oil industry, but also in gas and coal. We estimate that headcount reductions in these industries lowered our organic growth rate by about 75 basis points in the second quarter and reduced our operating margin by about 35 basis points. While low fuel prices still more than offset this bottom-line impact in the second quarter, we expect this net impact to be even or slightly negative in the second half of the year. I'll now turn the call over to Paul for additional information.
Paul Adler: Thank you, Mike. First, please note that there were 65 workdays in this year's second quarter, same number of days as last year's second quarter. The same will hold true for the third quarter. However, this year's fourth quarter will have 66 workdays, compared to only 65 in last year's fourth quarter. In total, fiscal year 2016 will have 262 workdays, two more than in fiscal 2015. As Mike stated, total revenue increased organically by 6.5% in the second quarter. New business wins, penetration of existing customers with more products and services, customer retention, and price increases, all contributed to this solid growth rate. Total company gross margin was 43.3% for the second quarter of this year compared to 42.9% last year. Total company energy-related expenses for this year's second quarter were 2.0% of revenue compared to 2.6% of revenue in last year's second quarter. I will address the impacts of oil, gas, and coal and the recent ZEE Medical acquisition on gross margin at the operating segment level. Recall that effective June 1 of this year, we have three reportable operating segments: Uniform Rental and Facility Services, First Aid and Safety Services, and All Other. All Other consists primarily of Fire Protection Services and our Direct Sale business division. First Aid and Safety Services and All Other are combined and presented as Other Services on the income statement. Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segment includes the rental and servicing of uniforms, mats, and towels, and the provision of restroom supplies and other facility products and services. The segment also includes the sale of items from our catalogs to our customers on route. Uniform Rental and Facility Services revenue was $937.7 million, an increase of 5.2% compared to last year's second quarter. Excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes, organic growth was 6.2%. Our Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment gross margin was 43.9% for the second quarter, an increase of 60 basis points from 43.3% in last year's second quarter. Energy-related costs were 50 basis points lower than in last year's second quarter. We estimate that job losses in oil, gas, and coal negatively impacted this segment's current year second quarter gross margin by 20 basis points. Our First Aid and Safety Services operating segment includes revenue from the sale and servicing of first aid products, safety products, and training. This segment's revenue for the second quarter was $120.4 million, which was 46.4% higher than last year's second quarter. Total growth benefited from the ZEE Medical acquisition. On an organic basis growth for the segment was 9.8%. This segment's gross margin was 43.2% in the second quarter compared to 46.7% in the prior-year period. The reduction in gross margin is wholly attributable to the impact of the recently acquired ZEE Medical business. Given that the acquisition occurred about four months ago, we are in the integration phase and incurring the customary costs of conversion. The assimilation of the business including route consolidation is now under way, which is integral to the realization of synergies. And we're pleased to report 90 basis points of improved gross margin on a sequential basis. We're excited about the benefits and opportunities this acquisition provides. First Aid and Safety is well on its way to becoming a $0.5 billion operating segment for us. Regarding selling and general and administrative expenses, total company SG&A was 26.8% as a percentage of second quarter revenue, compared with total company SG&A in last year's second quarter of 26.7%. Medical expenses as a percentage of revenue were 10 basis points higher in this year's second quarter. Very soon, we will introduce an exciting new marketing campaign. The expense of the campaign began to be recognized in the second quarter. Its impact on SG&A was about 10 basis points. The related expense will continue through the end of the fiscal year with the greatest impact falling in our third quarter. Our effective tax rate on continuing operations for the second quarter was 37.4%, the same rate as in the prior-year period. For the remainder of the fiscal year, we expect the effective tax rate to be 37.3% in both the third and fourth quarters. For comparative purposes, the effective tax rate in last fiscal year's third and fourth quarters was 36.2% and 37.6%, respectively. On October 1 of this year, we sold our investment in Shred-it for $578.3 million before taxes. Cintas also has the opportunity to receive up to $34 million in additional consideration in the future, subject to certain holdback provisions. Note that the gain on sale of the investment is included in discontinued operations. The sale of the investment completes our exit from the document management business. As a result of both the shredding transactions and the sale of the documents storage business, we realized total proceeds of $1.100 billion on a segment that had annual revenue of about $316 million. That's a multiple of three times annual revenue. Our cash and marketable securities were $672.6 million as of November 30, an increase of $472.4 million from the balance as of August 31. Cash provided by operating activities was $122 million in our second quarter. Uses of cash in the quarter included $180.7 million for repurchases of Cintas common stock. As previously mentioned, $578.3 million was received in the quarter, as proceeds on the sale of the investment in Shred-it. Note that our cash will be used in part to pay the taxes on the gains on our Shred-it investment in our fiscal third quarter and fourth quarter. The amount of taxes to be paid is approximately $225 million. Capital expenditures for the second quarter were about $59 million. Our CapEx by reportable operating segments was as follows: $51 million in Uniform Rental, $3 million in First Aid and Safety, and $5 million in All Other. We expect CapEx for fiscal 2016 to be in the range of $250 million to $300 million. That concludes our prepared marks. We're happy to answer your questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Manav Patnaik with Barclays.
Manav Patnaik: Yeah. Hi, good evening, gentlemen. I just wanted to just get a little bit more color on the energy, gas impact that you guys talked about. So you said 75 basis points to your organic growth for the total company, if I heard you right. So what is the assumption embedded in the full year guidance in terms of how that impacts your top-line number?
Michael Hansen: Well, Manav, that – first, let me say that understanding this is not – the impact of this is not an exact science. So we said 75 basis points in the second quarter. And I would say in the second half of the year, we would expect roughly the same in the third quarter, 70 to 80 basis points. And then probably in the fourth quarter, about half of that, because we – the fourth quarter is when we started to see the negative impact from our customers last year. And so, if we continue at the current rate, we would expect that the year-over-year impact is going to be slightly smaller in the fourth quarter.
Manav Patnaik: And is it fair to say that most of that is in the Rentals or is there some of that in the First Aid as well?
Michael Hansen: There is some of that in the First Aid as well. We do have a very nice business in that industry from a First Aid and Safety standpoint.
Manav Patnaik: Okay. And then just around sort of these impacts from layoffs and so forth, I mean we've been reading a lot of that happening on the industrial side of things. Can you remind us of your exposure there, or if you're seeing any of those come in more negatively than maybe you would have thought?
Paul Adler: Yes. Manav, this is Paul. First, I would say that we've worked hard to diversify our customer base. And we've disclosed previously that we have no single customer that comprises more than 1% of our revenue. And we also don't have any three-digit [makes] [ph] code or industry code that comprises more than 10% of our revenue. And obviously, we have weathered the offshoring of all the U.S. jobs, U.S. manufacturing jobs years and years and years ago, and we continued to evolve. Now, we have more hygiene products than we ever had before. We have retail-inspired work wear like Carhartt that enables us to put people in uniform that previously did not want the program or were not interested in one. And we're in healthcare with scrub rental. So we continue to evolve, such that currently, our percentage of our customer base that is in the service-providing sector of the economy is about 70%. So about 30% of our customer base is in the goods-producing areas of the economy. And by goods-producing, I mean oil, gas, coal, construction, and manufacturing as well. So we obviously are reading the same press releases that you are. We understand the headwinds to U.S. manufacturing, and we're keeping an eye on it. But at the same time, we're trying to keep things in perspective. We do know that not every single one of our customers in manufacturing exports. And so, for many of those, they are receiving the benefits of lower energy prices and other low input costs to their cost structure like commodities, et cetera. So the bottom line is we're continuing to monitor it. But at this point in time, the only negative impact to our business that we see in this goods-producing sector of the economy is from oil, gas, and coal.
Manav Patnaik: All right. Fair enough. That's really helpful. Thank you so much for all that color.
Michael Hansen: You're welcome.
Operator: We'll go next to George Tong with Piper Jaffray.
George Tong: Hi, thanks. Good afternoon. Can you discuss how add-stops performed in the quarter, both including oil and gas, and excluding oil and gas?
Paul Adler: Yes. I would say there's two things that were noteworthy regarding adds and the stops in the quarter. And the first, of course, is the impact to our metric from the headcount reductions in the oil, gas, and coal. We definitely saw that negative impact in our flame-resistant garment add-stops metric. The second item of note was that we did have some softness in our add-stops as it relates to weather. If you recall last year, at this point in time, winter seemed like it had already arrived, and it's been a much milder fall and start to winter this year. And when we don't have that snow, we have fewer mat placements. And that cold weather also helps us to get some additional revenue change over into outerwear, jackets, long sleeves, et cetera. So it's hard to quantify, but we do know that there is some softness as a result of that seasonal fluctuation.
George Tong: Got it. And so, would you characterize the add-stops as being overall positive low single-digits, negative?
Michael Hansen: Well, George, the second quarter is generally a positive quarter from us because of some of the things that Paul mentioned, because of the seasonal nature of jackets and extra mat placements. So it was positive, but not as positive as last year, and due to the reasons that Paul cited.
George Tong: Very helpful. And then can you discuss some plans to add to routes this year and how you expect route efficiency to evolve?
Michael Hansen: We plan to add routes similarly to the way we've done in the last few years, and that is throughout the year. Our anticipation is to add routes to allow our drivers, our service sales reps, the time and the daily capacity to proactively serve our customers to look for up-selling opportunities, et cetera. And so I think we'll – we don't expect any dramatic changes in route efficiency this year compared to last year because in both years, we're going to be adding.
George Tong: Got it. And then lastly, can you discuss the sustainability of a high single-digit organic growth in your First Aid and Safety segment, and how penetrated your customer base is with First Aid, i.e., what percentage of rental customers are also purchasing First Aid products?
Michael Hansen: Far fewer than 20% of our Uniform Rental customers are purchasing First Aid and Safety Services from us. We think there's a lot of runway there. And we still believe that there are a lot of opportunities outside of our existing customer base as well. In that First Aid and Safety business, there are a lot of businesses today who are handling these issues themselves in-house, maybe going to a catalog company or to Wal-Mart to serve – to take care of their first aid and safety needs. And we believe that we can do it much, much more efficiently at a great value for them. But we've got a lot of opportunity there to get more into our programs, again both within our customer base and outside of our customer base. How long can we continue this high single, low double-digits? We believe into the future. We love the opportunity that the umbrellas of first aid, safety, and compliance bring us, and we think it's really a great business model for us and a great value proposition for businesses.
George Tong: That's very helpful. Thank you.
Michael Hansen: Okay.
Operator: We'll go next to Gary Bisbee with RBC Capital Markets.
Gary Bisbee: Hey, guys. Good afternoon.
Michael Hansen: Hi, Gary.
Gary Bisbee: It's sort of curious that with the All Other segment as you're calling it now having larger revenue and gross profit than First Aid and Safety that you don't provide any commentary. But I wondered if, at a minimum, you can give us the organic revenue growth for that segment in the quarter.
Paul Adler: Yes, Gary, the organic growth was 6.1% in the quarter. And just remember that that All Other contains predominantly your fire protection services and then also contains our direct sale business, or our national account programs. And so just remember that that can be choppy just by the nature of that direct sale business with the fact that you have rollouts with large customer programs that don't, by their very nature, repeat.
Gary Bisbee: Right, yeah. It looks like that -- is it fair to say that it gets a little tougher from the trend of that in the next couple of quarters? It looks like you've now grown solidly four quarters in a row.
Michael Hansen: I would say that while it can be certainly a bumpy business, the direct sale, I don't know that I would say we're facing headwinds. We still expect good organic growth and improving operating margins. And keep in mind Gary, there are specific segment accounting rules that I think Paul went over last quarter that we have followed and will continue to follow as it relates to break out of the businesses.
Gary Bisbee: Yeah. No, No, I was just – it was curious that you've given comments on the first two but not the third. But I understand it – no, I understand why. So, at any rate, moving on, just any updated color from what you said a quarter ago just on how we should think about the phasing of the integration of ZEE and the costs? Is it reasonable to think that that gross margin continues to decline sequentially like it did this quarter over the rest of the year, or is there anything that would make that more less in the near-term?
Michael Hansen: It is reasonable. So we're about a quarter into that integration. It's going well as Paul mentioned. We are converting routes on to our SAP system. We are rebranding our trucks and that process is going very well. We like the improvements that we're seeing. We still have a lot of improvement opportunities and we would expect that sequentially, over the next several quarters, we'll continue to improve. We could have a little bumpiness here and there given the integration process, but generally speaking, yes, sequentially, going forward, we expect to see improvement, and we're excited about the opportunities that they bring. I would say that when we get to our July earnings release, we'll probably be in better position to speak to our thoughts going forward on the business. But as for this fiscal year, we're focused on the integration, and as I said, it continues to go well.
Gary Bisbee: Thank you.
Michael Hansen: You're welcome.
Operator: We'll go next to Nate Brochmann with William Blair.
Nate Brochmann: Good evening, guys. Congratulations on another good quarter.
Michael Hansen: Thank you.
Nate Brochmann: So I just want to talk two things. One, obviously, you guys have been getting a lot of sales productivity. Part of that is just a function of some of the process things; part of that is the ability to sell more. Just wondering how much more runway you think you have there before you might have to reload or kind of juice a little bit a hiring on the sales force front.
Michael Hansen: Well, just, Nate, just as we are with our routes, we're consistently adding sales reps as well. We certainly understand that in order to keep growing, we do need to continue to expand. We believe that we have opportunities, that there are prospects available for us to continue to add. And the other great thing is, while we're adding, we're also seeing productivity improvements. And as you said, some of that is process and some of that's innovation that allows us – allows our sales reps to have more opportunities to sell. So, we're going to be adding, just as we have over the last few years. There have been times in the last several years, both in our sales reps and in our routes where we have increased the rate of additions in a quarter here or there, but absent that increased rate, we're generally adding because we want to continue to grow, we want to give capacity to our routes, we want to give – we want to get in front of more prospects and existing customers.
Nate Brochmann: And then along those lines, in terms of some of those process/innovative improvements, are those ongoing in terms of constantly know very year, identifying a couple new tweaks that make those processes or those innovations better? Or has there been a couple one-time things that have had kind of oversize impact, or anything that might have an oversize impact over the next 12-18 months?
Michael Hansen: Well, we're – a part of our culture is to continuously challenge ourselves and improve. And so I think we get incremental improvements every year, whether it's with the hiring of new reps and the profiles that we're looking for, whether it's the training that we do to get them ramped up as quickly as possible. The selling process itself, we're constantly looking for ways to improve. We do have a nice sales prospecting system that we put in, gosh, in the last year or so that is helping us. But I don't know that I'd see or care to share any other improvements that will be a leap forward in productivity levels in the next year or so.
Nate Brochmann: Fair enough. And then just kind of a – kind of more industry question, but it feels that right now, things are kind of rational out there. I know it's always competitive pricing, but I was wondering if you could kind of comment a little bit on where you see industry pricing right now in terms of both renewals as well as for new awards.
Paul Adler: Yeah, Nate, this is Paul. Pricing environment really hasn't changed significantly from last quarter. Still favorable overall, as we continue to talk about the value of our services and our products. But at the same time, it does remain competitive. National accounts are, in particular, more competitive than other business, and that's why we still focus on new business efforts around those no-programmers, those that have not had the program before, as we get the best value there. And that split, Nate, at still 60-40: 60% from no-programmers, 40% in terms of getting share from our competition.
Nate Brochmann: Great. It sounds good. Thanks for the time.
Michael Hansen: You're welcome.
Operator: We'll go next to Sara Gubins with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Sara Gubins: Hi. Thanks. Good afternoon. Was the marketing campaign planned earlier and always contemplated in the guidance, or is that new? And could you tell us a little bit more about it?
Michael Hansen: Let me make sure I understood that correctly. Did you ask if it was in the original guidance or...
Sara Gubins: Yeah. I'm just wondering if it's something that's – I'm wondering if it's something that was – that is a new development over the course of this fiscal year or if it was something that you had always contemplated when you originally gave guidance for the fiscal year?
Michael Hansen: Got it. We did contemplate it as we moved into the early in the fiscal year. And with something like a campaign, you can kind of turn it on and off a little bit, you can serve it to meet the needs, and we've done a little bit of that. And we didn't – because at the beginning of the year, there's – we've got so much of the year to go. We want to see how the beginning of the year goes before we commit to things. But the year has gone well so far. We did start spending on that campaign in the second quarter. I would expect as Paul said to see that expense go up in the third quarter. We're excited about the campaign. One of the things that we hear from our customers frequently is that, they didn't know that we can provide all of the different products and services that we do. So for example, we hear from Uniform Rental customers, gosh, I didn't know that you were in the first aid and safety business or I didn't know that you have – that you provide fire protection services. And so one of the goals is to raise awareness of all of the ways that we can provide value to our customers and we're excited about that. As it relates to more details, I would say stay tuned, but we're excited about that. Now, when we...
Sara Gubins: Okay.
Michael Hansen: When I mentioned that – and Paul mentioned, that we'll see a little bit more expense in the third quarter, let me speak a little bit to the second half of the year guidance. Paul touched on a few things in his opening comments. One is we may spend a little bit more on this marketing campaign in the third quarter. Secondly, our tax rate in the third quarter last year was less than what we're guiding towards this year in the third quarter. It was more in the fourth quarter last year than what we're guiding towards. So that's going to have a year-over-year impact, so slightly negative in the third, maybe a little bit positive in the fourth. And then the last thing I would point to as it relates to the second half of the year guidance is that we have one more work day in the fourth quarter than we do in the third quarter. And so when you take all three of those things and you think about our guidance and you think about your modeling, I would suggest that the fourth quarter is going to be weighted more heavily in terms of profitability than the third quarter is. So, sorry for that [indiscernible].
Sara Gubins: Okay. Great. Thank you. No, that's very helpful. Thank you. I think that before, you talked about energy cost being – expecting them to be about 2.5% of revenue this year. I'm guessing that now you expect that they will be lower. What are you anticipating for energy costs this year as a percent of revenue?
Paul Adler: Yes, Sara, the guidance for the remainder of the year assumes that we're going to remain at that same percent of revenue that we are in Q2, which was that 2.0%.
Sara Gubins: Okay, great. And then just last question about margins for from rental. I know there are a lot of puts and takes given the marketing campaign, given the pressure from energy clients. Is it fair to assume that the margin expansion you saw in the second quarter is – on a year-over-year basis is about what we should expect to see in the back half? Or would we even maybe potentially see less because of the marketing campaign ramping?
Michael Hansen: And so, if we think about the overall operating margin, I think that we expect that we'll get some continued margin improvement in the back half of the year. It is going to be a little bit pressured, though, because the year-over-year benefit of energy is going to decrease, probably if – assuming that 2% rate is down to 40 basis points in the third and 20 basis points in the fourth, and that negative impact from oil and gas customers will start to become a bigger part of the net number, if you will. So while we do expect to continue to improve margins, I would say that given the pressure of that alone, we might be a little – we might see a little bit of narrowing in the second half of the year.
Sara Gubins: Okay. Thanks very much.
Operator: We'll go next to Andy Wittmann with Robert W. Baird.
Andrew Wittmann: Hey, guys. So, Mike, just to build on this, and sorry for beating a dead horse, but is it the growth investments that you're making that's preventing more operating leverage from coming through? I mean ex-energy here, obviously there wasn't a whole lot here. It seems like there could be more, but it's – is it just really more reinvestment in the business that's holding you back from putting up [indiscernible] margin gains higher than this, given that organic growth has been excellent?
Michael Hansen: Well, so, Andy, keep in mind that you can't just take the energy benefit, the 60 basis points year-over-year and say that that is the only impact from energy. We are seeing our oil and gas customers being negatively impacted, probably to a larger extent in the second quarter than we anticipated 90 days ago. So, certainly, that low fuel price is having an offset, and we're seeing some of that. On the other hand, we are – we will continue to invest in the business. And you are correct: some of that – I mean, if we pulled back on investment, we could certainly make margins get higher. But we want to keep investing in the business, and we'll continue to do that going forward.
Andrew Wittmann: With the medical being – thank you for that. With ZEE Medical now being four months in, and actually, sequentially showing some less-tier – is this one of the reasons for the guidance? It's like, Mike, before, you were saying kind of zero contribution, but it seems like it might to be off to a little bit better start than that. Is that true or how will you break down the guidance hike?
Michael Hansen: I would say that the guidance hike is a bit on second quarter performing pretty well, and maybe a little bit slightly better than we anticipated, and then just a firming of how we feel about the overall business including the First Aid and Safety improvements. So while I wouldn't put a lot into saying that the ZEE is going much better than we expected, it's going well, and it's going fairly closely to as we expected, and maybe a little bit of that improvement could come from ZEE. But I think it's the combination of feeling really good about the second quarter performance and seeing that move into the second half of the year.
Andrew Wittmann: Thanks. Maybe the last question, then, like on – you picked up an acquisition or some assets from one of your competitors in a court proceeding in the past few months here. I was just wondering if you could give us some help on how that's going to flow through your income statement, including what you expect in terms of the revenue contribution maybe on a go-forward basis, or even what it was in the second quarter? Any financial numbers, color on that transaction, I think, would be helpful for shareholders.
Michael Hansen: Sure. On December 4, we closed an acquisition of Coyne Textile Services. Coyne was in bankruptcy proceedings. We did not buy all of the business; we bought only a part of the business. It's a little bit of a different kind of acquisition for us; first time we bought a business out of bankruptcy. And so, we're in the midst of integrating that, and because it's in – because it was in bankruptcy, obviously it probably wasn't the strongest business that we've every acquired. And so we want to make sure we understand how it rolls in, but it's – we paid about $33.6 million for the acquisition. We believe that it will provide about $25 million to $30 million of annual revenue. We're in the midst of integrating that into quite a few different rental facilities where it's a really nice tuck-in opportunity. We have contemplated that into the guidance. And I would say from a top line perspective a couple things to keep in mind, while we have contemplated that into the guidance, we have also seen the impact of the Canadian dollar weakening a little bit more than we anticipated 90 days ago. And as we talked about oil and gas, that impact, negative impact is a little bit higher than we anticipated 90 days ago as well. And so when you combine those three things together, we feel like the right thing to do is to leave the top end of the guidance where it is, but we feel good enough about the operating environment to move that bottom end of the guidance, revenue guidance up $25 million. From an EPS standpoint, that acquisition kind of fits into, again, getting a better feel for where we are at the middle of the year. And while we might see some benefit, we are – from a bottom-line standpoint, we really need to see what we've got coming out of the holidays before we can adequately assess that business's impact.
Andrew Wittmann: That's really helpful. Thank you very much.
Michael Hansen: Okay.
Operator: We'll go next to John Healy with Northcoast Research.
John Healy: Thank you. Mike, I wanted to ask a little bit just to get some more color on how you're feeling about the holidays and how they'll impact the business. With Christmas week on, plant shutdowns and whatnot over the – at the end of the year could be quite volatile and just kind of any initial early read on how those might trend to the last year and maybe the prior years.
Michael Hansen: No initial signs that it will be different from the previous years. I will tell you that we're cautious about the way we view this economy. And coming out of the holidays, we're a little bit probably more cautious than we thought we would've been 90 days ago. But we still feel good about our ability to execute in this environment. I think, John, a little bit more as it relates to the holiday, and then rolling into January-February, I think a little bit more has to do with the weather. We'd like to see a little bit cooler weather to add more jackets; a little bit of – a little bit more rain and snow will add some more mat placements. That, we'd like to see, and probably has us watching more closely than any shutdowns during the holiday period.
John Healy: Got you. And on the direct sales business, I think this is around the time of the year, or maybe it was a few weeks, that usually starts some of those outerwear promotions. Is the outlook for the direct sales business a little bit more – a little bit softer than maybe you would've thought 90 days ago just given the weather, and that's kind of business that you just won't be able to recoup?
Michael Hansen: I would say that while there is a little bit of that, yes. We do have a lot of good projects in the pipeline in that business and our expectation is that we'll see an offset. So I don't anticipate any unusual softness in that business in the next six months.
John Healy: Okay, great. And then just one final question. I know you touched on a bit about the new marketing campaigns. I was hoping you could maybe give us a little bit color in terms of how you're trying to reach the customer. Is it a different – is it more of a different message or is it a different way. Maybe you're going more to social media or maybe you're going to the television commercials. Any way you can maybe talk to how the ad campaign attempts to reach the small business customer who is putting your services on the shelf?
Michael Hansen: John, I would say we're looking at ways to get as many touches as we possibly can, but I'd rather not get into too many details. I would just say stay tune and we'll talk about it certainly more at our third quarter call.
John Healy: Great. Have a great holiday.
Michael Hansen: Thank you. You too.
Operator: We'll go next to Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer.
Scott Schneeberger: Thanks. Good evening, guys.
Michael Hansen: Hi, Scott.
Scott Schneeberger: Hey. Going back, you highlighted 70% of the business is really a lot of service customers, and then 30%, I think you've said oil, gas, coal, construction, manufacturing was the brunt of the that. And thank you very much for the color you provided on oil, gas, coal. I heard some cautionary remarks on construction, manufacturing saying those domestically – who don't export are doing okay, but what's in the guidance? Is it – going back on the guidance overall, what effects those first three components that are more commodity components, is that basically if the current commodity prices remain the same is how you're thinking about the guidance? And then part of the question too is if you could just elaborate on the concern you discussed on construction and manufacturing, was that just reading headlines like the rest of us? Was it the import-export? And is that petering on being something that could go incrementally worse? Thanks.
Michael Hansen: So our guidance contemplates that the environment that we see today continues. And I would say that we have – throughout our second quarter, we did see our oil, gas, mining customers being more negatively impacted than in the previous quarters. But I would say we haven't seen it extend to any significant degree outside of that. We didn't see that in our second quarter. And I think what Paul was referring to is that we're not convinced that we're in an industrial recessionary environment. We certainly know that the strong dollar can have some impact on certain types of manufacturing and certain types of customers, but we also know that it's a benefit to others. And our thoughts are generally that the current operating environment will continue in the second half of the year. And while we're cautious and maybe a little bit more so than 90 days ago, we still feel good about this operating environment and in our ability to achieve the guidance in this environment.
Scott Schneeberger: Thanks. And a moment ago, when you mentioned that forex, obviously a headwind, could you remind us what your mix of international revenue is? I believe it's predominantly Canada. And I recall you went a little bit international in hospitality just to follow customers a few years back. And given these conditions – so, international mix is the first part, but the second of the question would be how are you thinking about M&A abroad right now, just expansion. And I guess particularly within Canada. Thanks.
Michael Hansen: Well, so, I would say 6% to 7% of our total revenue is international, most of which is in Canada. We have primarily our Rental business in Canada. We do have a direct sale business that is not significant, but certainly part of that business. And with the ZEE acquisition, we just got into Canada. That is a – not a significant amount of the ZEE business either, but all of that combined, probably 6%-ish in Canada, 1% or less everywhere else. And so, let me pause, did I answer your question Scott?
Scott Schneeberger: Yeah. And the follow-up would just be appetite on M&A, I guess, in general?
Michael Hansen: Yes, M&A. So from an international standpoint, because of some of the document management divestitures, we do have about $100 million of cash outside of the U.S. And we'd certainly look for good opportunities to make investments, for example with the ZEE business. We paid for the Canadian business with Canadian dollars – with international dollars. So we'd love to continue to do that kind of acquisition opportunity. As it relates to M&A, in general, so in the U.S., primarily, the pipeline has been good for us in the first six months or so of the fiscal year. We made the ZEE acquisition in August, we made this Coyne acquisition in early December, and we would love to continue to make acquisitions like these two that are great tuck-in opportunities where we feel like we can get really good incremental margins.
Scott Schneeberger: Great. I appreciate it guys. Thanks.
Operator: We'll go next to Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel.
Shlomo Rosenbaum: Hi. Thank you for squeezing me in at the end of here. Most of my questions have been answered, I just have a couple. Could you give a little bit more specificity on the percentage of the revenues, especially from just like oil, gas, and mining? Maybe just honing in on that, is there a number that you can give us?
Michael Hansen: A lot – about a year ago, Shlomo, we talked about that being 2% to 3%; let's call it 3%-ish. I would say given the course of the events over the last year, that business is smaller than 3%. Our other businesses have grown and continued growing, and that business has not. So it's still a fairly small block of business for us, but it has suffered quite a bit.
Shlomo Rosenbaum: Okay. So we're talking about it's like 3% going down maybe a little less than a 1% in terms of total revenue. Just looking at materiality?
Michael Hansen: I don't know that's going down that much, Shlomo, but probably in the 2%-ish.
Shlomo Rosenbaum: No, I don't mean, 2%-1%. I'm saying it may be dropping from 3% to 2%.
Michael Hansen: Oh, yes, correct.
Shlomo Rosenbaum: Okay. And then there's a fair amount of cash on the balance sheet from Shred-it, and outside of paying Uncle Sam, is it that the intention to use for more of these type of acquisitions or should we – if we're thinking about prioritizing on that, would you think – should we be continuing to model in a certain level of share repurchases as you guys have been doing for a while now?
Michael Hansen: So, a couple of comments on cash. Yes, there is a lot on our balance sheet at November 30. A couple of things again, about a $100 million of that is outside of the U.S. So to bring that into the U.S. would be fairly costly. We did spend a $115.5 million on our dividend in the first week of December. That was a dividend of a $1.05, which was a 23.5% increase, so we are happy to share that with our shareholders. We did make the Coyne acquisition that closed on December 4 to just over $33 million. And as Paul said, we've got a – you'll see on the balance sheet about a $236 million income taxes payable that will happen in February. So those last three items we're going to be spending just under $400 million on those alone. So while there is a lot of cash on the balance sheet at November 30, there are plans for a good chunk of that. Having said that, we'll continue to generate cash. We would love to put that cash to work in accretive acquisitions, similar to ZEE and Coyne. And we'll keep looking for those opportunities. That certainly is our highest priority. But if there aren't good opportunities and we believe that the share buyback program is appropriate, we've certainly got a track record of showing that we will put that cash to work.
Shlomo Rosenbaum: Great. Thank you.
Michael Hansen: Okay. And we'll go next to Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan.
Andrew Steinerman: Hi there. I just wanted to quantify a little bit more about the sales administrative line. It was under 27% of revenues, which is towards the low historically, and I definitely heard it's going to bump up at the marketing campaign. My question is just what's a normal sales and administrative percentage while revenues continue to grow at a healthy rate? Will we stay in this kind of 27% range in leverage or do you think over time that has to kind of go back towards 28%?
Michael Hansen: A couple of comments and thoughts. You may see from a First Aid perspective, we're getting really nice G&A leveraging from the ZEE Medical acquisition. That's a business that – where we didn't bring a lot of G&A and overhead across, and that's why we'd like that opportunity so much. So we've seen some real nice leveraging there. Yet a marketing campaign is a little bit of a blip in the second half of our fiscal year, but I would say going into the fiscal 2017 and then even more so in fiscal 2018, we're going to have the SAP project concluding and beginning to depreciate. And so we will see some impact of that in the next two fiscal years. Absent that, we absolutely believe that we should be and believe we can grow SG&A at a slower rate than our revenue growth, and we expect that every single year. And so absent the couple of callouts, we expect to get leveraging in the G&A area every single year. So getting back to, is 28% the right number, Andrew – or is 27%, 28% is right number, we need to see a little bit more of how our First Aid business operates with the ZEE integration. And I think next year will be a better indicator.
Andrew Steinerman: Okay. Thank you.
Michael Hansen: Okay.
Operator: At this time, we have no further questions. So I hand the call back over to our speakers for any additional or closing remarks.
Michael Hansen: Well, thank you all for joining us tonight, and we wish you all a happy holiday. We will issue our third quarter earnings in late March. And we look forward to speaking with you again at that time. Thank you. Good night.
Operator: That does conclude today's conference. We thank you for your participation.

Operator: Good day everyone and welcome to the Cintas Quarterly Earnings Results Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Mike Hansen, Vice President of Finance and Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead, sir.
Mike Hansen: Good evening and thank you for joining us tonight. With me is Paul Adler, Cintas Vice President and Treasurer. We will discuss our first quarter results for fiscal 2016. After our commentary, we will be happy to answer questions. The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a Safe Harbor from civil litigation for forward-looking statements. This conference call contains forward-looking statements that reflect the company's current views as to future events and financial performance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those we may discuss. I refer you to the discussion on these points contained in our most recent filings with the SEC. As we reported today, in the press release, please note that a change in our reportable segments U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles require companies to evaluate their reportable operating segments when certain events occur. As a result of a recent evaluation, effective June 1, 2015, we will report the following operating segments: Uniform Rental and Facility Services, First Aid and Safety Services, and All Other. All Other primarily consists of Fire Protection Services and our Direct Sale business division. We are pleased to report first quarter revenue of $1.199 billion, an increase of 8.8% from the prior year first quarter. Organic revenue growth, which adjusts for the impact of acquisitions, work day differences, and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, was 6.8%. Organic revenue growth for our Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment was 6.8% and the First Aid and Safety Services segments organic growth was 10.5%. The performance of our sales force in both segments was strong. We continue to add new customers and provide existing customers with additional products and services from our broad line. First quarter operating income was $185.5 million, which was 15.5% of revenue compared to an operating margin of 14.8% in the prior year period. This represents a 70 basis point improvement from last year’s operating margin. Net income from continuing operations for the first quarter of fiscal year 2016 was $106.2 million and earnings per diluted share or EPS from continuing operations for the first quarter were $0.93. Note that the first quarter of last fiscal year’s net income and EPS from continuing operations were positively impacted by a gain from the sale of stock in an equity method investment. Excluding this gain, first quarter net income and EPS from continuing operations increased 15.1% and 19.2% respectively, compared to the prior year. Net income from continuing operations as a percent of revenue improved 50 basis points to 8.9% from 8.4% of revenue in last fiscal year’s first quarter, excluding the prior year period gain. We also demonstrated our continuing commitment to providing shareholder value through our stock buyback program. During August and into September through the close of business yesterday, Cintas purchased 2.9 million shares of common stock. This share buyback had no impact on first quarter EPS, but is expected to benefit full fiscal year EPS by $0.05. Since the beginning of fiscal 2016, approximately 4.5 million shares of common stock have been purchased at an aggregate cost of $381.2 million. As of September 23, 2015 Cintas had 381.8 million, available under the current Board of Directors stock repurchase authorization. As Cintas’ CEO, Scott Farmer stated in the today’s press release, we are off to a good start to our fiscal 2016 year. We thank our employees whom we call partners for their strong performance. On August 1, 2015 the company closed on the acquisition of Zee Medical, for a consideration of approximately $134 million in cash. About $121 million were paid at the closing of the transaction and an additional $13 million may be paid in the future fiscal years subject to holdback provisions. We are in the very early stages of the integration of the Zee business. We are excited about the benefits and opportunities this acquisition provides, including expanding our footprint and enabling us to serve an even greater number of customers in North America. As a result of our first quarter results and the recent acquisition of Zee Medical, we’re updating our annual guidance. We expect fiscal 2016 revenue to be in the range of $4.8 billion to $4.880 billion, and fiscal 2016 EPS from continuing operations to be in the range of $3.79 to $3.88. This guidance does not include any EPS impact from the announced agreement to sell our investment in Shred-it, which has not yet closed. This guidance does not include any potential deterioration in the U.S. economy or additional share buybacks. The EPS guidance is detailed in a table within today's press release. I’ll now turn the call over to Paul for more details on company financial performance.
Paul Adler: Thanks, Mike. First please note that there were 66 workdays in this year's first quarter compared to 65 in last year's first quarter. The second and third quarters of this fiscal year will have the same number of work days as last year of 65. This year's fourth quarter will have 66 workdays, compared to 65 in last year's fourth quarter. Thus fiscal year 2016 will have 262 work days, two more than in fiscal 2015. As Mike stated, total revenue increased organically by 6.8% in the first quarter. New business wins, penetration of existing customers with more products and services, retention, and price increases all contributed to the strong growth rate. Total company gross margin was 43.7% for the first quarter of this year, compared to 43.4% last year. Total company energy related expenses for this years’ first quarter were 2.2%. Last year's first quarter energy-related expenses were 2.8%. As Mike previously stated, effective June 1, 2015, we have three reportable operating segments, Uniform Rental and Facility Services, First Aid and Safety Services, and All Other. All Other consists primarily of Fire Protection services and our Direct Sale business division. First Aid and Safety Services and All Other are combined and presented as Other Services on the income statement. The Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segments includes the rental and servicing of uniforms, mats, and towels and the provision of restroom supplies and other facility products and services. The segment also includes the sale of items from our catalogues to our customers on route. Uniform Rental and Facility Services revenue was $938 million, an increase of 7.4% compared to last year's first quarter. Organic growth, which excludes the impact of acquisitions, workday differences, and foreign currency exchange rate changes, was 6.8%. For comparative purposes, this segment's organic growth for the previous quarter, our fiscal 2015 fourth quarter was 6.2%. Our Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment gross margin was 44.7% for the first quarter, an increase of 90 basis points from 43.8% in last year's first quarter. Energy-related costs were 70 basis points lower than last year's first quarter. Our First Aid and Safety Services operating segments includes revenue from the sale and servicing of first aid products, safety products and training. This segment's revenue for the first quarter was $99 million, which was 24.5% higher than last year's first quarter. Total growth benefited from the Zee Medical acquisition. On an organic basis growth was 10.5%. This was a good sequential increase in the growth rate from 8.2% in our fourth quarter. This segment's gross margin was 42.3% in the first quarter, compared to 45.9% in the prior year period. Energy-related costs were 40 basis points lower than in last year's first quarter. As Mike stated earlier, we are in the very beginning stages of the integration of the Zee business. As expected, our First Aid and Safety Services results were negatively impacted by conversion costs, the amortization of intangible assets resulting from the purchase price accounting, and other charges. This impact will continue in the short term as we assimilate the acquired business and begin to realize the synergies.  We’re excited about the benefits and opportunities that this acquisition provides. Regarding selling and general and administrative expenses, total company SG&A was 28.2% as a percentage of first quarter revenue compared to a total company SG&A and last year's first quarter of 28.5%. The 30 basis point improvement in SG&A was realized despite a 40 basis point increase in medical expenses this quarter, compared to last year. On July 15, 2015 Cintas announced that it entered into a definitive agreement to sell its investments in Shred-it for approximately $550 million to $600 million before taxes. The transaction is still expected to close in the fourth quarter of calendar year 2015. As a result of the announced sale of the investments, the related income or loss is now reported in discontinued operations. The investment in Shred-it on the balance sheet is recorded at assets held for sale and a related tax liability is recorded as liabilities held for sale. Our effective tax rate for the first quarter was 37.2%, the same rate as in the prior year period. We expect a full year 2016 effective tax rate to be 37.3%. Our cash and marketable securities were $200 million at August 31, a decrease of $233 million from the $433 million in May 31. Cash provided by operating activities was $143 million in our first quarter. Uses of cash included $121 million, net of cash acquired for acquisitions in about $222 million or repurchases of Cintas common stock. Capital expenditures for the first quarter were approximately $63 million. Our CapEx by reportable operating segments was as follows: $55 million in uniform rental, $4 million in first aid and safety, and $4 million in all other. We expect CapEx for fiscal 2016 to be in the range of $250 million to $300 million. That concludes our prepared remarks. We are happy to answer your questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we will take Manav Patnaik with Barclays.
Greg Bardi: Hi, this is actually Greg calling on for Manav, just wanted to ask about the guidance. It looks like excluding Zee Medical and the buybacks, the guidance is essentially unchanged even with the pretty solid numbers. Just wondering if there has been a changed to your view versus when you first gave guidance or if there is – if it’s just kind of conservatism so early in the year?
Mike Hansen: You are correct. Without Zee and without the share buyback impact, the guidance is generally the same. Our first quarter results were generally in line and we still feel good about the year. There is no change in the way we feel about that with maybe the only possible exception of the Canadian dollar continues to weaken. Today, it was somewhere in the 1.33, 1.34 range which is a little bit weaker than we guided at 1.25. So we may see a little bit of top line impact as we go through the rest of the year. But aside from that, we still feel good about the year and not really any change to our thinking.
Greg Bardi: Fair enough. And then on the M&A environment, should we think of Zee Medical as kind of a one-off opportunity that you’ve had or are you seeing comparatively larger companies coming available recently?
Mike Hansen: Certainly Zee is a great opportunity for us and one that we feel very excited about. It certainly does demonstrate that we want to put our cash to work and we really do like the opportunities for M&A particularly in a case like Zee where there is a lot of tuck-in opportunity. I would say I can’t comment on any other items because I wouldn’t want to speculate, but we’re certainly continuing to be active and looking for opportunities to add value through M&A.
Greg Bardi: Okay. Thanks, Mike.
Mike Hansen: Okay.
Operator: We’ll go next to Andrew Steinerman with JP Morgan.
Andrew Steinerman: Hi, could you review which driver of revenue growth caused the acceleration in the quarter to 6.8% growth year-over-year, you outlined 60 basis points of acceleration which segment did that come from and what’s the organic revenue growth implied for the full year in the revenue guidance?
Mike Hansen: Well, we – a number of things. As Paul mentioned, we had a very good new business quarter. One of the things in the last call that we talked about was a little bit of preparing in the fourth quarter to get off to a good start. So we probably hired some reps early, we added some routes earlier and we got some good momentum going into the year and that continued through the quarter, new business was very strong. Customer retention was a little bit better than last year so another benefit not as significant as the new business. Pricing was I would say the environment didn’t change much but it was still a fairly positive environment with the exception of our energy related customers.
Andrew Steinerman: Sure.
Mike Hansen: So those three areas all contributed. I would say that there was a little bit of an offset from those energy related customers as we’ve talked in the last several quarters. Our oil and gas customers are certainly operating under difficult environments as well as our mining customers and we saw our uniform rental net add-stops being negative for the quarter. So there was a bit of a drag from that, but certainly…
Andrew Steinerman: Did you say add-stops were negative overall because of oil and gas or add-stops were negative in oil and gas?
Mike Hansen: Because of oil, gas and mining.
Andrew Steinerman: Okay, perfect. And then the other part of the question was, what was the organic growth? What is the organic growth implied in the revenue guidance for the year?
Mike Hansen: We haven’t provided that and I would rather not get into that number. I don’t have it calculated. We are really focused on the top line but I would say that we don’t expect many significant changes to that – to the first quarter performance. We still feel good about the year.
Andrew Steinerman: Right. So in the same vicinity that we’ve been thinking about it for a while now?
Mike Hansen: Yes.
Andrew Steinerman: Okay, good. Thank you.
Operator: We’ll go next to George Tong with Piper Jaffray.
George Tong: Hi, good afternoon. Can you talk a bit about how much of your growth is being fueled by organic customer growth versus penetration of the non-programmer market and how that’s evolved in recent quarters?
Mike Hansen: I can’t give you any specific numbers, George, but I will tell you that the penetration opportunities still exist and they are – we are taking advantage of them. Our ability to sell particularly into good uniform rental, anchor accounts with our signature series hygiene products, our chemicals, our microfiber mops et cetera it’s still going very well. I would say that new business has been a strength over the last five years or so but penetration has continued to be very, very solid for us. And while I can’t give you a number, both are continuing to drive organic growth.
George Tong: Got it. And then going back to add-stops, can you describe how add-stops have evolved over the course of the quarter and how add-stops are evolving now into this current quarter so far?
Mike Hansen: I would say that for the quarter, we experienced a little bit of continued deterioration from our oil, gas and mining. Aside from that, I would say it was a pretty constant and consistent quarter. So, not a lot of changes, we went through the quarter and not much change since August 31. We are only a couple of weeks in, but nothing marketable to speak up.
George Tong: Got it. Thank you.
Operator: We’ll go next to Joe Box with KeyBanc Capital Markets.
Joe Box: Hi, Mike. Hey, Paul.
Mike Hansen: Hi, Joe.
Joe Box: So it’s been a few years now since I think your last big addition with respect to route capacity. How are you guys thinking about route capacity going forward? Is it going to be added on really an as needed basis or do you think potentially we could be seeing maybe a broad based addition like we had a few years ago?
Mike Hansen: Generally, Joe, we want to continue to add routes throughout each year and we have continued to do that. So I wouldn’t expect that we will have a big influx of routes anytime soon but a little bit depends on the nature of the economy and what we are seeing with our customers. But I would say I wouldn’t expect to have an influx of new routes in the Rental business. In the First Aid business, we have continued to add routes. We have in that business, our SSRs really do drive a lot of growth and we want to make sure that they have the capacity, the time to spend selling and so we are fairly aggressive in adding routes to that business. But I will tell you with the Zee acquisition, there is a lot of integration to be doing and we’re going to have to take that quarter-by-quarter.
Joe Box: Appreciate that. Thank you. And then maybe just as a follow-up on the macro point that you made earlier, I mean I think we all have a pretty good sense of what’s going on in oil and gas and mining, but I am curious if you may be seeing a bifurcation between industrial oriented customers outside of oil and gas and mining versus maybe what you’re seeing from consumer driven businesses, and if you’re seeing any sort of a change how might that impact you?
Mike Hansen: I wouldn’t say that we are seeing a marketable change from the other customers but the environment has been pretty good. I mean they are – when we can show them value, they will take additional products and services that do add that value. But I wouldn’t say that we’ve seen a marketable change to that, but certainly a different operating environment than our oil, gas and mining customers.
Joe Box: And then one last one from me. Paul, what was the margin tailwind in the Uniform Rental business just from the extra day?
Paul Adler : Joe, typically that extra day in the quarter gives us about 40 basis points to 50 basis points improvement.
Joe Box: Okay. So if I would strip out the 40 basis points to 50 basis points and I think you said there was 90 basis points of tailwind from Energy within the Uniform Rental business, net-net we are looking at a gross margin that’s down in the Uniform Rental business. Can you maybe put some color around why it would have been ex those items?
Mike Hansen: So, yes, we had a 70 basis in the Rental business, we had a 70 basis point tailwind from Energy but roughly 40. When we say 40 basis points to 50 basis points of work day, probably 40 of that is in gross margin, 10 of that is in SG&A. So let’s call it about a 40 basis point benefit from the work day. We have talked about the Energy related customers creating a bit of a drag. Keep in mind when those customers stop or eliminate positions, that is lost revenue but we still have the amortization of the garments and we still are driving the truck to that customer. So we still have a lot of the cost without the revenue. That is basically an offset to that work day benefit during our first quarter. Now I will tell you also, when you compare our first quarter gross margin in the rental business to the fourth quarter in a quarter that had the same level of energy, our gross margin was 190 basis points better. And let’s take off 40 basis points from the work day, we still had a very nice sequential improvement and we feel very, very good about that. We are getting a lot of good leverage.  And then the last comment I’ll make is, one thing to keep in mind about last year was that our first quarter gross margin in Rental was the strongest of the year. It was 50 basis points better than any other quarter. We did have a very good quarter. There was a one-time customer buyout within the quarter that helped that gross margin. And so I think we had a very good gross margin quarter and I would expect that we’re going to continue to see good leveraging within that business knowing that we do have a little bit – we are expecting a little bit of the tailwind or all of the tailwind of the Energy costs to go away in the latter part of the year. Does that help with our gross margin?
Joe Box: Yes. That’s a perfect clarification. Thanks for that. Have a good night guys.
Mike Hansen: Thank you.
Operator: We’ll go next to Andy Wittmann with Robert W. Baird.
Andy Wittmann: Hey, Mike. What was the size of that buyout last year that you just mentioned? Can you quantify in terms of margin or dollars?
Mike Hansen: Yes. We had commented that it was about 50 basis points worth of growth which would effectively mean the same kind of thing on margin.
Andy Wittmann: Yes. It’s basically, almost a 100% flow through when you have to do that.
Mike Hansen: Yes.
Andy Wittmann: Okay. So just on Zee Medical, I thought maybe you guys might call out the integration cost, closing cost separately but it looks like you’re expensing that and just running that through the P&L and as a result you’re not showing EPS accretion but can you give us an idea of if you take out some of those one timers of the integration cost, can you give us what those would have been for the quarter as well as your outlook for the year so we can get a sense of what the normalized or the introductory accretion is from Zee?
Mike Hansen: As you can probably tell from our guidance, we expect no impact on EPS this fiscal year. So this acquisition is about a third the size of our existing First Aid business. It’s a large acquisition for us and there are a lot of integration steps to be done. We need to rebrand the trucks, we are putting people into Cintas uniforms, we have to convert the systems and we’re going to be doing that over the course of the year. I would say the other thing about the Zee business, the routes were not as efficient as the Cintas routes. The custom, the revenue per route, the revenue per customer is not nearly as high as Cintas and so it’s a bit of a - a little bit more of an inefficient business and we've got some work to do to integrate and get that to the levels where we want them to be. Having said that the integration is going very well and we’re excited about that business and its opportunity that it creates for our First Aid business. I’m hesitant to get into any more specific integration costs in the first quarter. We really just got it in the month of May, I'm sorry in the month of August and had a lot of meetings training et cetera and we’re really just now getting started on that. And so again, I’ll reiterate, the current year we're not expecting any accretion, but we certainly do expect to get that next fiscal year. Once we see how the integration develops as the year goes on, we’ll be more in a position to provide guidance at that point.
Andy Wittmann: Okay that's fair. We will look forward to maybe an update on that in the next quarter, maybe just can you give view or broad stroke view of what you think the cost synergies of the businesses are recognizing that there is route overlap and maybe some route underutilization that you inherited?
Mike Hansen : I’m not prepared to do that yet. I want to see more develop within the integration. We certainly have an integration plan, but I'd rather wait until we see a little bit more of the integration develop.
Andy Wittmann: Okay, that is fine. And then, I guess, are you seeing anything different on the competitive environment in terms of pricing you mentioned that it was additive to your quarter, it just seem like the last 12, 18 months was, I’d say pretty good for the overall industry, I think you guys benefit and others did too, do you have tough comps or are your competitors getting more competitive with, for new business pricing. Is there any risk that we have to see in the future from the competitive environment?
Mike Hansen : Well of course there is. The pricing is always competitive, there is no question about that and we are only able to raise prices when we are showing great value to our customers and that’s the, as long as we can continue to show that we are providing great value we don't necessarily see a change in the environment unless the economy changes. I would say that based on that pricing environment, being relatively similar to last, the last several quarters, we haven't seen a lot of competitive changes in this first quarter. And I can't say that that won't happen in the future, but we haven't seen it yet.
Andy Wittmann: Got it. Okay, maybe just a final question just on the reclassification of the segments, I’m curious as to why the fire protection got carved out and put into the other segment whereas the other stuff now redefined, the First Aid and Safety Business and maybe now that we have these new segments how we should be thinking about the margins as we model forward on those?
Paul Adler : Andy, this is Paul. You probably know the accounting guidance is pretty descriptive about reportable operating segments and the guidance requires that companies evaluate their segments periodically and definitely when changes occur. And we had such a change in the first quarter with the acquisition of Zee, and therefore as a result of evaluating, reevaluating that as our reportable operating segments, looking at the guidance we needed to make some changes and the most material of those changes obviously are the fact that First Aid and Safety is now a standalone segment separate from fire.  And then we also made a change in terms of including the sale of items from our catalogues to customers on our routes and including that in the Uniform, Rental and Facility services segment. So those are the two major changes and in the guidance it permits and it is acceptable than to - once you reach a certain threshold of segments and disclosures that the other business units than are combined into an all other segment and that’s where fire is and that's where the direct sale business, you’re thinking about direct sale to national accounts that type of business. That's where those reside.
Mike Hansen: Andy that fire business, the direct sale business there still very important to us. We believe that they are good businesses, but we are giving visibility to 90% of our revenue going forward and certainly the focus is on those two largest businesses that we have. As it relates to the margins of that All Other, you know we expect improvement just like we do in our Other Businesses and there are certainly as leveraged to be gained, there are route density opportunities and so we certainly do expect continued improvement because we have the Direct Sale business in there, it could be a little bit bumpy at times because of the ups and downs of that business, but generally speaking we expect improvement.
Andy Wittmann: That makes sense. Given that Direct Sale now got split between two segments there’s a lot of moving parts, is it, are you guys thinking about giving us maybe last year's numbers restated for the - on a quarterly basis for the new classification of the segments by any chance? Should we be looking for that?
Mike Hansen: Yes. Actually in the earnings release income statements there is a table supplemental information and there we have recast it all the prior year quarter's by segments, we don't bring new gross margin income, assets, so you will have some good segment data under the new structure for fiscal 2015 and then obviously 2016 going forward.
Andy Wittmann: Perfect. Yes, I see that. Thank you very much.
Operator: We will go next to Sara Gubins with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Sara Gubins: Hi thanks good afternoon. Could you talk about your manufacturing clients and are you seeing any change in the behavior?
Mike Hansen : We have not seen much of a change in their behavior in this quarter compared to the last quarter. I would say that’s true for not only manufacturing, but our other verticals, excluding that energy-related sector.
Sara Gubins: Okay. And then share repurchases really accelerated in the last three quarters, could you talk about how we might think about share purchase potential on a run rate basis over time?
Mike Hansen : As we've talked about in previous calls, our goal is certainly to grow organically and followed by M&A and we would love other opportunities like Zee Medical, but when we have additional cash what we certainly will take a look at in increasing dividend, but then if there is cash remaining outside of those opportunities our board likes to put it to work and so I say that Sarah because a lot of it depends on how that cash balance looks and what the other opportunities for cash are. I would say that that buyback program has been quite a benefit, we believe to our shareholders and if we have available cash we’ve shown that we will put it to work. While I can't give you any specifics because it’s a board level decision I would just say that if we have available cash we like to put it to work. We have $381 million left on our current authorization and the board will be looking at our positions over the rest of the fiscal year.
Sara Gubins: Okay, thank you.
Operator: We’ll go next to Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer.
Scott Schneeberger: Thanks very much. Guys could you comment on specifically oil and gas customers and mining separately with regard to what innings you think you are in on add stocks on both as is the headwind that has been certainly on oil and gas, do you think if you could speak to both on where you think you are on the cycle, thanks.
Mike Hansen : That’s a tough question, Scott. I would say that it felt like from an oil rig standpoint in the first quarter, there was some stability towards the end of the quarter. But then you read an article like in today’s Wall Street where there are fracking firms that are starting to close up shop. That’s a tough one to call. I would love to say that we are in the late innings of that oil and gas, but I don’t know that I can say that. I would say that today – as of August 31, those oil and gas customers for us, the revenue is lower today than it was at May 31 because of continued net stops but I’m not exactly sure, Scott, where that’s going to end up. From a mining perspective, we see some pretty hard hits and I’m afraid I can’t give you much future guidance in that either other than to say that it’s been a tough environment for the mining industries at least for our customers and I would expect that that’s not going to turnaround overnight nor will the oil and gas customer impact turnaround overnight.
Scott Schneeberger: All right, thanks for that. And then you’ve addressed some pricing questions earlier, but with regard to pricing across all of your segments, all of your markets and I imagine it’s kind of soft in those two areas we’re just talking about, but it sounds like it’s pretty firm elsewhere. Is there anywhere else outside of rental that good or bad that bares attention or is everything fairly status quo? 
Mike Hansen: I would say that everything is status quo. Now keep in mind that Energy customer impact also does affect First Aid and Safety. We have a lot of good Energy customers but having said that, I would say that the pricing environment for most others is status quo.
Scott Schneeberger: Okay, great. Thanks, Mike.
Operator: We’ll go next to Denny Galindo with Morgan Stanley.
Denny Galindo: Good afternoon. Just quickly on Zee Medical, how much decline in margins in that First Aid and Safety segment was strictly due to Zee Medical? Can we expect a similar amount of impact for the rest of the year?
Mike Hansen: I think that we would have had somewhat of an increase without Zee Medical in that gross margin. I would say that if the integration continues to go well and we start the process of rebranding and putting the routes on to our systems as the year goes on, we would expect to see some improvement. So I would expect that the drag that we saw in the first quarter is going to be the worst of the year and we should start to see a little bit of improvement. I would say that for the year we don’t expected necessarily to turn positive for the cumulative year but by the fourth quarter we could see a little bit of benefit if the integration goes well.
Denny Galindo: Okay. That’s helpful. And another quick one there, is there any seasonality at all to Zee Medical or is there any – you added one month this quarter, is that a representative month or is it higher or lower than what the run rate will be?
Mike Hansen: I would say that from a seasonal standpoint, it’s probably very similar to our business where we have a lot of outdoor activity in the First Aid business in the summer, a lot of construction sites et cetera. You get into the winter, you see better margins because of the cold and flu season. So I think it would track the same kind of performance of our First Aid business. Now, because of the disruption that is happening because of the integration, I am not ready to say that, that the month of August was representative of the year. I would certainly love to see us improve on that but we’re going to need to let the dust clear a little bit on the integration before we can give you a good run rate number.
Denny Galindo: Okay. That’s helpful. And then taking a step back, you talked a little early about route extension, are there any particular cities or metro areas that you’re thinking could be a good opportunity? We had looked at your locations and it seems like the big cities like New York, LA, Chicago had a very low amount of your facilities compared to the total market but any color there would be helpful.
Mike Hansen: We think all of those areas are very good opportunities for more route density, no doubt about it. We do some comparisons internally and from one location to another and we’ve got locations that are more mature where the route density is quite a bit higher than in some of the larger cities like New York and LA even Philadelphia. So we think there really are some good opportunities in a lot of big cities not just a few but a lot. We are not nearly penetrated to the extent we think we can be.
Denny Galindo: Okay. And another clean up one, any update on the SAP implementation? How is that going? Are you still thinking the timeline will be similar to what you thought in the past?
Mike Hansen: That project is going very well. We are on the same schedule as we talked about over the last few quarters. We are on the same cost expectation as we’ve been over the last few quarters and so that means we would expect that we will come out of the realization mode at the end or towards the end of this fiscal year and start to put that system to work a little bit in fiscal 2017 from the standpoint of the roll out should start to happen. And so we will see a little bit of the – I shouldn’t say a little bit, we will see some cost impact and we will quantify that more once we get to the point where we know we’re rolling out but we will see some cost impact next fiscal year.
Denny Galindo: Okay. And then lastly sort of a bigger picture question, one thing we’ve been hearing about a little bit is automation and it kind of feels like other analyst here talks about automation in terms of self driving cars and now you see here a lot in the restaurant industry servers or various positions there. Is that something that you’re seeing it all in terms of your add-stops right now, any impact or is there something that could emerge as the headwind in the future if some of these uniform wears are taken out of the stocks to automation?
Mike Hansen: I can’t tell you that we could – we’ve seen a noticeable impact of that. I am sure it’s happening here and there, but we haven’t seen a noticeable impact. I would like to believe that we in North America are very entrepreneurial and we’re going to continue to create jobs and replace certain jobs that get automated, and we’re going to do our best to put those new jobs into uniform. We certainly believe that we want to continue to put more and different types of job functions into uniforms and we’re going to continue to work on that. I think we’ve been pretty successful over the last handful of years and that we’re going to continue to look for those opportunities and I like to bet on the North American entrepreneur to create more jobs and we’re going to put them in uniform.
Denny Galindo: Sounds good. That’s it from me. Thanks.
Operator: We’ll go next to Gary Bisbee with RBC Capital Markets.
Gary Bisbee: Hi guys. Good afternoon. I wonder if you could share with us to help us think about the trending, what the organic revenue growth was from the new segments over the four quarters of last year.
Mike Hansen: I believe that I can give you a little bit of that, yes. So let me talk Uniform Rental and Facility Services, in the first quarter last year it was 8.5%, in the second quarter it was 8.1%, in the third quarter it was 7.9%, and as Paul mentioned in the fourth quarter it was 6.2%. So not a whole lot difference from what we reported especially directionally. From a First Aid and Safety standpoint, 10% even in the first quarter, 13.7% in the second quarter, 10.6% in the third quarter, 8.2% in the fourth quarter. From an all other standpoint, it was 0.8% in the first quarter, it was negative 0.5% in the second quarter, 3.6% in the third quarter, 3.8% in the fourth quarter and you can kind of see there a little bit of the bumpiness that we talked about in that direct sale business.
Gary Bisbee: And then I don’t think you gave us any color on the other in the segment commentary. What was the organic growth this quarter?
Mike Hansen: Oh, I’m sorry.
Paul Adler: It was 4.9.
Gary Bisbee: Okay. Thank you. And then is there any more clarity you can provide or directional commentary on what the after tax proceeds from the shredded sale is going to be or how we should think about taxes?
Mike Hansen: I would say that, so you can think about the – lets go to the midpoint of the range that Paul gave of 575 in proceed. Now one thing to keep in mind is some of those proceeds will drag out a little bit with kind of the customary holdbacks but let’s go to the midpoint of that number. You will see on the balance sheet that there is an asset held-for-sale of 194, 275 that is our book value. The difference between the proceeds and that book value is a gain on which we’ll have tax of 37.3%. In addition to that on the balance sheet, there is a liability held for sale of 78,457 and that essentially is a differed tax item because we did not pay any tax on last year’s gain at the time of that transaction nor did we paid tax on the dividend that occurred in May. And so when we pay taxes, we will have a little bit of a catch up because of that differed liability. I would expect that, as Paul said, we will see we expect that to close in the fourth quarter of this calendar year. I would expect that if that happens, we will pay those taxes in the first calendar quarter of next year.
Gary Bisbee: Great. Okay. And those taxes I guess will they flow through discontinued operations because that’s where the gain is?
Mike Hansen: Yes, it’s built into our tax rate and so you will see essentially a net income that is the after tax gain.
Gary Bisbee: Gotcha. Okay. All right, great. That’s helpful. Probably not but any thoughts on plans for the proceeds? I know last time you got the first – there was a special dividend provided, any thought on doing that again?
Mike Hansen: We want to see that close first. Our Board will certainly have that on their agenda and we’ll be talking about it but we need to see that close before we commit to spending it.
Gary Bisbee: Okay. And then one clean up one, what was the buyback number of shares in the quarter versus early in the second quarter. I think you lump them together. Is that fair?
Mike Hansen: I don’t – Gary, I don’t have that in my fingertips in terms of the – we did buy some shares in September, I don’t have that at my fingertips in terms of the first quarter only.
Gary Bisbee: That’s fine, don’t worry about it. And then just one bigger picture question, I think you’ve been asked this in a different way earlier but fiscal 2015 was the second year in a row where you pushed out client capacity additions that you talked about at the beginning of the year and I guess I just wanted to understand and once or twice you commented that permitting and things like that was part of the issue but how is utilization across the entire network and do you have markets today that aren’t growing because you’re so short on capacity or was that really – those additions you’ve talked about and delayed, is that more giving you the capacity to grow for several more years? Thanks.
Mike Hansen: Yes, there certainly are those logistical issues of finding the right land, getting the permitting done and then actually building the building. We certainly do have some markets that have capacity that’s getting tight. It’s not preventing us from growing but we are getting close in some of those markets and we do need to add some capacity and our expectation is that we will do that towards the backend of this year, but it’s not preventing us from growing.
Gary Bisbee: Okay, great. Thank you very much.
Mike Hansen: Okay.
Operator: We’ll go next to John Healy with Northcoast Research.
John Healy: Thanks. Mike I wanted to see if you could give us a little bit more color about performance of the Texas and the Canadian regions. You have been upfront about the oil and gas and the mining exposure, but if you just look at those geographies beyond just the vertical they serve, if you just think about the state of the country, how do the growth rates to those two markets look compared to what you guys are reporting for the rest of your business?
Mike Hansen: John, I honesty I don’t have that at my finger tips and I don’t think I would like to give that level of detail out just for competitive reasons, but certainly in Texas and Canada, in West Virginia there are a lot of oil, gas and mining customers and those are the hardest hit areas. We are not shrinking in any of those areas, we’re still growing and certainly not at the same pace as the rest of the country, but I don’t have a number to share with you.
John Healy: I can understand that, but, I guess what I was hoping to get out was just kind of the spillover effect from the oil and gas, specific sectors into other areas of your business within those states, I’m curious to get your thoughts on how much contagion did you see in those markets, was it worse than you thought, it is still to be felt, I’m just trying to understand the spillover factor?
Mike Hansen: We talked a lot last year about that oil and gas being 2% to 3% of our total revenue that sector has gotten hit pretty hard. I would say that while that the - that sector has been hit hard and maybe a little harder than we would have expected, we haven’t seen the spillover to be that much more significant and really not any more significant than we would have expected throughout the course of the last year. I think it has been fairly connected to that energy sector, but we’ve been able to grow quite well despite that and so we don’t see a lot of spillover.
John Healy: Okay. And then I wanted to ask on the M&A front, clearly after organic growth that’s the your biggest priority. I think we are all pretty familiar with what is available to you in terms of asset potential on the Uniform side, but could you talk a little bit more about the First Aid and Safety, I wasn’t that familiar with Zee Medical before the acquisition and are there a lot of kind of what I would say these mid size operators out there that would make sense, or what’s the environment like for those types of assets, you know what’s the landscape like there?
Mike Hansen: There are some small independent opportunities that could be out there. Zee did have a franchise network and so there are some opportunities there, at the right value. I would say there are not a lot of other large players when we think about that business the competition is coming from those smaller players, but also the do it yourselfers, the Grainger’s, the people going down the Wal-Mart or Sam’s club, so I would say that the M&A as the business exists today is likely going to be smaller tuck-in opportunities.
John Healy: Okay. And then just lastly, I might have missed it so I apologize, but the Shred-it move, when do you expect that to close, maybe you guys spend a month out there?
Mike Hansen: We’ve said in the fourth quarter of the calendar year.
John Healy: Okay, great. Thank you.
Operator: We’ll go next to Jason Rodgers with Great Lakes Review.
Jason Rodgers: Yes. I wondered if you could give the annual sales figure for Zee Medical, as well as sales by geography and perhaps how their margins compare to your First Aid and Safety business, thanks.
Mike Hansen: Well the annual revenues as we mentioned in our press release are about, we would expect $100 million to $120 million, because we will own Zee for 10 months this year, we are expecting $90 million to $100 million. I don’t have at my fingertips the revenue by geography, but I will tell you that our margins are in the Cintas legacy First Aid business are better than Zee Medical, but we’ve got a lot of integration to do and we want to see those things improve. I am not ready to quantify a synergy opportunity yet because I want to see more of the integration happen.
Jason Rodgers: Okay, thanks.
Operator: And we have no more questions at this time.
Mike Hansen: Well thank you again for joining us tonight and we look forward to speaking with you again at the end of our second quarter and we’ll issue our second quarter earnings in late December. Thank you.
Operator: That does conclude today’s conference. We thank you for your participation.

===== 2015 Q4  (2015-07-16 17:00:00) =====
Executives: Mike Hansen - Vice President Finance and Chief Financial Officer Paul Adler - Vice President and Treasurer
Analysts: Adrian Paz - Piper Jaffray Greg Bisbee - RBC Capital Markets Sara Gubins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Nate Brochmann - William Blair Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer Andrew Wittmann - Robert W. Baird Manav Patnaik - Barclays Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel Nicolaus
Operator: Good day everyone and welcome to the Cintas Quarterly Earnings Results Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Mike Hansen, Vice President of Finance and Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead, sir.
Mike Hansen: Thank you and good evening. Thanks for joining us tonight. With me is Paul Adler, Cintas Vice President and treasurer. We will discuss our fourth quarter and full year results for fiscal 2015. In addition, we will provide guidance for fiscal 2016 and after our commentary we will be happy to answer any questions. The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a Safe Harbor from civil litigation for forward-looking statements. This conference call contains forward-looking statements that reflect the company's current views as to future events and financial performance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ materially from those we may discuss. I refer you to the discussion on these points contained in our most recent filings with the SEC. As we reported today, in today's press release, our results for continuing operations adjusted to exclude all impacts of the document management businesses and the first quarter benefit from the gain on the sale of stock in an equity method investment are more representative of our ongoing performance. Therefore our discussion of the Company's performance will exclude these items. We are pleased to report fourth quarter revenue of $1.142 billion. Organic revenue growth which adjusts for the impact of acquisitions, foreign currency and the Shred-it transaction was 6% for the quarter. Full fiscal year revenue was $4.476 billion representing organic growth of 7.1% over the prior fiscal year. While revenue in our Uniform Direct Sales segment was unchanged compared to fiscal 2014, our two largest segments, Rental Uniforms and First Aid, First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection grew organically for the year by 7.7% and 9.2% respectively. The performance of our sales force in both businesses were strong. We saw profitable business and penetrated existing customers with our broad line of products and services. Fourth quarter operating income was $177 million which was 15.6% of revenue compared to an adjusted operating margin of 15.4% in the prior year. Full fiscal year operating income was $696 million or 15.6% of revenue. This represents a 120 basis point improvement over last year's adjusted operating margin. We are pleased with our ability to leverage our infrastructure and with the results of our increased focus on managing our cost structure following the Shred-it transaction. Additionally, we benefited from lower energy-related costs compared to last year. Paul will discuss the energy-related costs in more detail. Earnings per diluted share as adjusted for the fourth quarter were $0.86 representing an increase of 11.7% over last year. For the full fiscal year EPS was $3.35, an increase of 21.8% over last year. As our CEO, Scott Farmer stated in today's press release, we also demonstrated our continuing commitment to providing shareholder value through our stock buyback program. We purchased 4.4 million shares of our common stock during the fourth quarter and into the first quarter of fiscal '16 for $370 million. Fiscal 2015 was a very successful year for Cintas. We thank our employees, whom we call partners for their hard work in ensuring this outcome. Yesterday, the Company announced that it has entered into a definitive agreement to sell its investment in Shred-it for approximately $550 million to $600 million before taxes. The transaction is expected to close in the fourth quarter of calendar year 2015 subject to obtaining regulatory approvals and satisfaction of other customary closing conditions. These proceeds will be in addition to the $180 million received at the closing of the partnership transaction on April 30, 2014 and the $113 million received in May 2015 in the form of a dividend from Shred-it. Looking forward to fiscal 2016, we expect revenue to be in the range of $4.700 billion to $4.780 billion. We also expect double-digit EPS growth in the range of $3.74 to $3.83. This guidance includes the impact of having two more workdays in fiscal '16 compared to fiscal '15. Our guidance does not include any EPS impact from the recently announced agreement to sell our investment in Shred-it nor does it include any deterioration in the U.S. economy or any additional share buybacks. The EPS guidance is detailed in a table within today's press release. I'll now turn the call over to Paul for more details on Company performance.
Paul Adler: Thanks Mike. First, please note that there were 65 work days in this year's fourth quarter which is the same as last year's fourth quarter. Full fiscal year of 2015 had the same number of days as fiscal 2014 of 260 days. Fiscal year 2016 will have 262 work days, two more than fiscal 2015. For fiscal 2016 the number of work days by quarter are 66 in the first quarter, 65 in the second and third quarters and 66 in the fourth quarter. As Mike stated, total revenue increased organically by 6.0% in the fourth quarter and by 7.1% for the full fiscal year. Total Company gross margin was 42.6% for the fourth quarter of this year compared to 42.2% in last year's fourth quarter as adjusted. Total Company energy-related expenses for this year's fourth quarter were 2.2%. Last year's fourth quarter energy-related expenses were 3.0% excluding document management. For the full year total Company gross margin was 42.9% an increase of 120 basis points over the prior year adjusted margin of 41.7%. For the full year total Company energy-related expenses of 2.5% or 40 basis points lower than fiscal 2014 as adjusted to exclude document management. I will discuss gross margin and energy-related expenses by segments in just a moment. Before doing so, let me remind you that we have three reportable operating segments, rental uniforms and ancillary products, uniform direct sales and first aid, safety and fire protection services. Uniform Direct Sales and First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection Services are combined and presented as other services on the income statement. The Rental Uniforms and ancillary products operating segment consists of the rental and servicing of uniforms, mats, towels, and other related items. The segment also includes restaurant supplies and other facility products and services. Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products revenue was $873 million an increase of 5.8% compared to last year's fourth quarter. Organic growth which excludes the impact of acquisitions and foreign currency exchange rate changes was 6.5%. Organic growth was higher than total growth because of continued weakening of the Canadian dollar. For the full year rental segment total road and organic growth were 7.2% and 7.7% respectively. Rental segment revenue mix for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 was unchanged from the prior year quarter. The revenue mix was as follows: uniform rental accounted for approximately 52% of revenue. Loss control comprised mainly of entrance mats accounted for 19%, hygiene and other services including restaurant supply, cleaning services and chemical services were 16% of revenue. Shop [ph] towels were 5% and linen and others which is mainly nonperson specific garments such as aprons and butcher coats was 8%. Our Rental segment gross margin was 44.0% for the fourth quarter, an increase from 43.6% in last year's fourth quarter. Energy-related costs were 90 basis points lower than our last year's fourth quarter. For the year Rental segment gross margin was 44.6% an increase of 130 basis points compared to the prior year, about 50 basis points of which was due to lower energy-related costs. Our Uniform Direct Sales operating statement included the direct sale of uniforms and other related products to national and regional customers. Uniforms and other related products are also sold to local customers including product sold to rental customers through our direct sale catalog. Uniform Direct Sales revenue for the fourth quarter was $118 million an increase of 0.3% compared to last year's fourth quarter. When adjusting for foreign currency exchange rate changes organic growth was 1.1% for the quarter and flat for the full fiscal year. Uniform Direct Sales gross margin was 29.8% for the fourth quarter compared to 30.0% in the prior year quarter. For both the full fiscal years of 2015 and 2014 gross margin was 28.5%. The decrease in energy-related costs benefitted gross margins 30 basis points and 10 basis points in the fourth quarter and full-year periods respectfully. Our First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection Service operating segment includes revenue from the sale and servicing of first aid products, safety products and training and fire protection products. First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection revenue for the fourth quarter was $150 million which was 9.8% higher than last year's fourth quarter. Organic growth was 7.3%. For the full-year segment total growth and organic growth was 10.5% and 9.2% respectively. This segment's gross margin was 44.4% in the fourth quarter compared to 44.6% in the prior year. Energy-related costs were 60 basis points lower than in last year's fourth quarter. For the year First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection segment gross margin was 44.1% an increase of 30 basis points compared to the prior year. Energy-related costs were 40 basis points lower than fiscal 2014. Regarding selling, and general and administrative expenses, total Company SG&A was 27.0% as a percentage of fourth quarter revenue compared to a total Company SG&A and last year's fourth quarter of 27.8%. When excluding the impact that document shredding had on last year's fourth quarter SG&A and revenue, last year's adjusted total Company SG&A were 26.8% as a percentage of the adjusted revenue. We had an increase in legal and professional expenses in the fourth quarter. Full year SG&A as a percentage of revenue was 27.4% for fiscal 2015, the same percentage as in fiscal 2014 when adjusted for document shredding. Our effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 37.6% compared to 40.4% in the prior year period. The full year 2015 effective tax rate was 37.2% compared to 38.3% in fiscal 2014. The higher fiscal 2014 effective tax rate was the result of a number of discrete items related to the Shred-it transaction. We expect the fiscal 2016 effective tax rate to be 37.3%. Our cash and marketable securities were $433 million at May 31, an increase of $30 million from the $403 million at February 28. Cash provided by operating activities was $202 million in the fiscal fourth quarter driven by net income and increases in working capital resulting from the timing of vendor and other payments compared to the previous quarter. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 we received a dividend from Shred-it of $113 million. And finally, the company paid $237 million in the fourth quarter to repurchased common stock. Capital Expenditures for the fourth quarter were $54 million. Our CapEx by operating segments was as follows: [Indiscernible] $4 million in rental, 3 million in uniform direct sales, and $7 million in first aid, safety and fire protection. We expect for fiscal 2016 in the range of $250 million to $300 million. That concludes our prepared remarks. We are happy to answer your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from George Tong from Piper Jaffray.
Adrian Paz: Hi this is Adrian Paz on for George Tong. And I want to I guess driving to the rental uniform segment and there has been a bit of deceleration there from prior quarters. Maybe you can touch on trends that you are seeing there that contributed to the deceleration there? And also I want to know if you are maybe seeing softness from the manufacturing sector due to the stronger dollar?
Mike Hansen: Sure, so our rental organic growth, it did come down a bit from the third quarter to the fourth quarter and there were several things that accounted for that. First of all we did see a little bit of softening in our net add-stops performance, a little pullback from our customers. I would say in the middle of the quarter we started to see a little bit of a worsening trend and that actually continued into our first quarter. We also a little bit of a pull back from our national account customers, especially in our emergency services business. We saw a little bit of a negative impact from the oil and gas that we’ve talked about in the past, and then lastly I would say, we did see a little bit of an impact from pricing from the standpoint of the year-over-year impact. So let me talk a bit about pricing. Last year, in the fourth quarter we talked about how we saw an improvement in the pricing environment and that carried throughout our fiscal 2015. And we really didn’t see much of a change in our fourth quarter, but one thing to keep in mind is, we did lap the beginning of that what we saw was a bit of an improved environment. So the year-over-year growth was affected by a little bit. So I would say those four things contributed to a little bit of a deceleration in that rental organic growth. From a manufacturing segment standpoint I can’t say that we saw anything unusual or any significant trend or noticeable trend.
Adrian Paz: Hey great. Thank you. That’s very helpful. And I guess can you touch on, I guess your capital allocation plans with divestiture or the sale of the Shred-it transaction, it seems like you guys have a really strong balance sheet at this point. Maybe you could touch on what you are – if you are looking at any particular segment for M&A plans in general?
Mike Hansen: Well, so certainly when we think about our cash usage we want to make sure that we’re growing organically and we’ll spend what we need to on CapEx. Secondly, we really do like acquisition opportunities if they are at the right value and they create synergies and long-term benefits for the Company. We certainly would be actively involved in looking at acquiring business in our current businesses if the value was there, if we felt like synergies were available. And so we certainly have an active corporate development team and certainly are open to making acquisitions again that are at the right value and that can provide long-term value for us. Certainly after that, we’ve shown that we will increase the dividend. We’ve done so every year since we went public in 1983 and so dividends are an important part of our capital allocation. And then lastly as you’ve seen in the last quarter or so, the buyback program in very important to us and as we mentioned we acquired $370 million of our stock in the last quarter and into the first quarter. So when we think about capital allocation, those are thoughts. Now certainly, with the Shred-it transaction, that will close in the fourth quarter, our board will be busy thinking about how to deploy that cash, what’s the appropriate way to use that and we’ll certainly be actively thinking in terms of how to use that.
Adrian Paz: And looking at perhaps your M&A pipeline, are you really looking for larger transactions or are you happy with maybe just bolt-on opportunities?
Mike Hansen: We would look at both bold-ons. We certainly love bold-ons because they create some great synergies for us. But we certainly would be open to larger transactions again as long as they created a value that we felt like we needed, the synergy opportunities and long-term value for Cintas.
Adrian Paz: Great, thank you. 
Operator: We’ll go next to Greg Bisbee from RBC Capital Markets.
Greg Bisbee: Hi, guys, good afternoon.
Mike Hansen: Hi, Greg.
Greg Bisbee: A couple questions, if I could. The first aid, fire safety organic growth slowed a little more and my sense coming out of last quarter’s call was that there has been a little weather impact that may be would bounce back, is there anything more specific you’d fall out and any thought process in how that might trend given this recent period of deterioration organic growth? Thank you.
Mike Hansen: Yes. We are still pleased with the performance of the business. On the fire side of that business, there does tend to be a little bit more project work and we did see a little bit of pull back in that project work in the fourth quarter. So there are repairs that we do, there are new product sales like fire extinguisher sales to customers and we saw a little bit of pull back in the fourth quarter nothing that we believe to be creating a trend. We still feel very positive particularly about the service side of the business. It's been performing very well. So I think that’s what we’ve seen in the business in the last quarter, but in our minds nothing to be concerned about.
Greg Bisbee: Okay. And then on the gross margins, it looks like both rentals and first aid if you back out the benefit from energy would have seen a gross margin decline somewhat year-over-year that's obliviously change from what’s been a real strong trend for quite some time. Is there anything in particular going on there? I guess comps probably won’t really be, but are you spending more, is there anything else and I guess how do we think about that flowing into your guidance for next year?
Mike Hansen: Yes I think, first let me say, we feel like we had a great year in those businesses where the gross margin in rental went up about a 130 basis points, in first aid it went up about 30 basis points. We continue to invest in both businesses and I think in the fourth quarter, we saw a little bit may be of pulling repair and maintenance into the fourth quarter that may have happened in the first quarter. I think we started hiring a little bit early for the businesses, on the Ralphs [ph] particularly. So we added Ralphs maybe a little bit more aggressively in both businesses than we have and probably just setting the table for fiscal 2016. So, as we think about the guidance I would say we still believe that there is gross margin opportunity. We think incremental margins are going to be healthy. As it relates to our rental business we've talked a little bit during fiscal 2015 about pushing some capacity growth into fiscal 2016 that goes into our guidance thinking a little bit. And the other thing is, when we – from the standpoint of energy so gas fuel prices for us, we’ve included an expectation, that fuel prices for the year would be about the same in fiscal 2016 as in fiscal 2015. Both years would be about 2.5%. On the flip side though, as I mentioned from a rental organic growth standpoint we did see a little bit of negative impact from our oil and gas customers in the fourth quarter and we’ve also included in our guidance into fiscal 2016 that that kind of performance would continue as long as we see the fuel in that 2.5% range. And so the point is on a net basis, while we got a benefit certainly in fiscal 2015 from net, oil and gas in the fuel costs, we think it might turn around a little bit in fiscal 2016. 
Greg Bisbee: That sounds prudent and then just one other one. I assume you have a pretty good sense of what your cost based for the shredding businesses, so should we think of taxes eating up a big piece of those proceeds or is it fairly minor and I guess I’d say the same for the dividends?
Mike Hansen: Yes. So we’ve got a fairly complex transaction. So we’re going to be working on taxes up to the point of time that we close that transaction. But as of May 31, our book value was $219 million and that came down because of the dividend. So we have to record that dividend as a reduction in our book value of our investment. So you can kind of think of the cash that we received, let’s call it the midpoint of 575 compared to a book value of as of May 31, 2019 that’s a $350-ish million gain and so we’ll pay taxes on that gain and probably an easy way to think about that at the moment is using our 37.3% against that. One thing from a cash standpoint to keep in mind is that the gain we recognized a year ago was a deferred tax gain, so we didn’t pay taxes on that piece of the gain, so we’ll have to do that as well when we receive the cash at closing. Does that make sense? So I would say it is going to be a fairly good sized tax bill, but we'll have a lot of cash left over. And we’ll certainly provide more details as we get through those calculations and we firm up the amount of the proceeds.
Greg Bisbee: Perfect, that’s very helpful. Thank you.
Operator: We’ll go next to Sara Gubins from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Sara Gubins: Hi, thank you good afternoon.
Mike Hansen: Hi Sara.
Sara Gubins: A couple of questions about guidance, could you help us think about how much of a benefit from the Shred-it JV is in your fiscal guidance?
Mike Hansen: Yes, as Paul mentioned there is no benefit in the fiscal 2016 guidance as it relates to Shred-it.
Sara Gubins: So, yeah.
Paul Adler: So let me make a couple of points on that. We are going to continue to own 42% of Shred-it until that transaction closes. So roughly for the first half of the year we will record our share of the Shred-it income just like we did in fiscal 2015. We, because of the transaction and you probably had seen that there was an IPO process as well. We didn’t – we just didn’t have clarity on what that performance might look like and so we’ve not included any impact from the Shred-it net income performance that we will share in and then once we haven’t received the cash yet. We need to close that deal first and until we do that we’re not ready to provide any other guidance on how that cash may impact us. One thing about the first particularly the first quarter as it relates to our share of the Shred-it income they have the IPO process going as well as this transaction that we announced yesterday and there will likely be a fair amount of transaction related expenses that we will share in. Now, when we record that, when we record our share of those expenses in the first quarter and in the second quarter, keep in mind those are non-cash – That’s a non-cash entry for us. And the impact is it increases our book value even more. So it’s just an offset we get that gain back when the transaction closes.
Sara Gubins: Got it okay, so just to make sure that I understand it, in the first quarter we’ll see some expenses, which are not incorporated into the guidance, but at the same time in the first part of the half of the year we’ll see a benefit from the JV which is also not incorporated into your guidance?
Paul Adler: No I would say that in the first quarter we’re going to see more than likely a negative impact, because of the transaction expenses and I’m not ready to comment at all on what we will see in the second quarter, but regardless none of that impact is contemplated in the guidance that we’ve given.
Sara Gubins: Okay, and could you tell us what the share count is that you are using for the guidance?
Mike Hansen: Sara it is $115 million for fiscal 2016.
Sara Gubins: Okay, and could you now just think about what might drive you to the higher end of the revenue range for the guidance at 6.8%?
Paul Adler: I think the continued execution by our businesses I think our partners have done a fantastic job in fiscal 2015, and we need to continue to execute well. So our sales performance needs to continue as it has done. We need to continue to be able to penetrate existing customers and we believe that we’ve got a lot of penetration opportunities left. So we need to continue to penetrate our customers and we need to execute. So I think the range of guidance that we’re giving is certainly what we believe to be an achievable range and I think if we execute well like we have this year we can get to towards the top end of that range.
Sara Gubins: Okay, and just last question, you mentioned that you were seeing a bit more pricing pressure after having had it improve for the last year. Is it coming in particular regions or from particular types of competitors? I’m wondering what’s driving the change there?
Paul Adler: So I’m sorry, maybe I wasn’t clear. We haven’t seen a change in the pricing environment of any significance. Pricing is still competitive. It always has been in our business. It always will be. So pricing is still competitive. But we haven’t seen much of a change in our fourth quarter compared to our third quarter, second quarter, et cetera. What my point was, in the fourth quarter of last year we saw a bit of a change at that point where we saw an improved environment for pricing. And we quite honestly, we talked a little bit about training our people to speak to our customers about the great value that we are providing to our customers. And so a year ago we saw a bit of a change from the third quarter to the fourth quarter in terms of that pricing environment and now we've lapped that change. And so what that does is it has a little bit of an impact on our year-over-year growth as it relates to the third quarter growth compared to the fourth quarter growth.
Sara Gubins: Got it, thanks very much that's helpful.
Paul Adler: Sure.
Operator: We will go next to Nate Brochmann from William Blair.
Nate Brochmann: Good evening gentlemen.
Mike Hansen: Hi Nate.
Nate Brochmann: Just wanted to talk a little bit obviously with the document management business you guys did a great job kind of growing that with a few acquisitions, but then kind of growing organically and then getting the fairly positive shareholder wealth creation event out of that. And I was just wondering when you think about the business now as it stands in terms of the portfolio of services what do you expect to have and be able to grow in terms of replacing that business and what could be the next big opportunity or what else is in the hopper in terms of things to think about?
Mike Hansen: Well, the great news is our growth this year has replaced it. Our revenue in fiscal 2015 is almost the same as in fiscal 2014. So the good news is we have replaced it now. Now clearly, how do we continue to grow into the future, from a rental business we need to continue to create solutions for our customers that are of high value. We need to get more known programmers into uniform rental programs, things like new types of Carhartt programs, fire resistant clothing offerings. So we need to continue to create innovation. We need to create innovation with our facilities, services products and services and we need to continue to penetrate. We've got quite a, we believe to be quite a penetration opportunity in our customer base. And the nice thing about having about a million customers is we've got a lot of warms leaves out there that we can continue to work to penetrate. From a first aid, safety and fire business standpoint, it is a bit of the same. We need to go out and capture new customers and we need to continue to look for adjacencies under the umbrellas of safety and protection and we've done a very nice job in creating product adjacencies that we can then sell into existing customers. So it is the answer to your question about how do we continue to grow and what is the business? We feel like we've got a lot of opportunity in our existing businesses. Now having said that, we certainly would look for other ideas that might be wholly new businesses, but it has got to be a business that can create some good long-term value for us.
Paul Adler: And you know Mike I think that's actually there is actually one point and like the rental segment is that it is not just the traditional uniform wearer based. As you develop these new fabrics that you are able to attack a whole different suite of end markets, correct?
Mike Hansen: Yes that is correct and more retail inspired offerings certainly helps as well.
Nate Brochmann: Correct, okay. And that is actually a good read and then I apologize for asking another question on guidance, but I am presuming as you mentioned that there is probably a little bit of pessimism in terms of just looking at the revenue line both on the oil and gas customers as well as just kind of looking at some of the add-stops I know that we have gone from negative to neutral a little positive here and there and now back to negative and we’re not really getting that run rate. So I assume that most in the guidance is probably a little bit of pessimism around the oil and gas and the add-stops with the optimism coming from the new customers and the penetration et cetera in terms of the same playbook, correct?
Mike Hansen: Yes that is correct and Nate, I should probably point out one additional item. We’ve seen a fair amount of movement in the Canadian exchange rate during the year. Keep in mind our guidance is total revenue growth for the current year. So for fiscal 2015, our average currency exchange rate was about a $1.15 Canadian and we have seen that now go to closer to 1.20, 1.25. And so our guidance assumes a 1.25 for fiscal 2016 and so that does have about a 50 to 60 basis point negative impact on total revenue growth. So having said that, let me put that aside and make sure that I’m also talking about, look we feel really good about the business. We’ve had some really nice momentum and so we believe that we do have some real nice opportunities. But you’re right, we've got a little bit of headwind in the Canadian currency, got a little bit of headwind in the oil and gas impact and a little bit of headwind in the net add-stops area.
Nate Brochmann: Okay. So obviously if any of that kind of changes and we get a different flow, we could get a little upside there. And then just in terms of the bottom line, you've talked about the incremental margins and the gross margin opportunity and maybe even pulling some growth investment maybe into this quarter relative to next year. But is there any additional catch-up and any additional investment at this point that we need on either the hiring front on the sales side or an extra layer of new routes that we are playing catch-up on in terms of thinking about or is it kind of just normal growth investment with that level of revenue in mind?
Mike Hansen: Yes, I would say it is normal investment that we have made with the exception that we have talked a little bit about the processing, rental processing capacity. But aside from that, we have been continuously investing in routes in the rental business and the first aid, safety and fire business; we will continue to do that, but generally it is a bit of business as usual. I don’t see any need for an accelerated rate of investment unless something changes like we do see a dramatic change in net add-stops or a dramatic change in the economy.
Nate Brochmann: Okay. Great, I appreciate the time.
Operator: We will go next to Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer.
Scott Schneeberger: Thanks, good afternoon. I was just curious on all the discussion on bit of the decline in net add-stops inventory in the quarter and moving into the first quarter, I understand it is incorporated in the guidance [ph] I think, but might be just could you take us a little bit further into what you think is driving that or what you are seeing beyond what you had said already or is it really not much of that?
Mike Hansen: Well, I don’t know that there is much to add other than to say we have seen a little bit of a bumpy economic ride. There have been some ups and downs in employment. Some months have been narrower than others. We have seen some macro events that have probably given businesses pause. We have seen a stronger U.S. dollar. We have got the prospect of interest rates. So I think we have seen a little bit of a bumpy ride and I would say aside from that bumpy ride, I don’t have a lot of additional color to add other than the oil and gas impact certainly.
Scott Schneeberger: Great, thanks. And then, just I have two others both they are kind of quirky. You guys mentioned legal and professional was elevated in the fourth quarter. I'm curious, was that just associated with what was going on with Shred-it or is there something else particularly on the legal side that we should be concerned or aware about?
Mike Hansen: Yes, that was generally a good part of that related to the transaction.
Scott Schneeberger: Okay. Thanks and then lastly, just an update on the ERP and its influence on CapEx where we are in that cycle, just want to make sure we are aware of where you are on that on that?
Mike Hansen: Yes, we talked about that being about a $100 million project. We have spent about half of that in fiscal 2015. The project is right where we wanted it to be. We are still very optimistic that that will continue on that calendar that we've talk about and so I would expect that we could see another $40 million to $50 million of CapEx during fiscal 2016. We've talked about fiscal 2017 would be the year when we start the rollout and start to see some impact potentially mid-year to the end of the year.
Scott Schneeberger: Excellent, thanks very much and nice work.
Mike Hansen: Thanks.
Operator: We’ll go next to Andy Wittmann with Robert W. Baird.
Andrew Wittmann: Hi guys, thanks for taking my question. I wanted to Mike ask a little bit about the strategic decision on the exit of Shred-it. I mean, first time you contributed in the joint venture, you got the synergies and created the value. You really worked substantially selling the business, but now you are likely to sell it you could have been the buyer and bought it back in. So what were you seeing in the business as it related to the rest of your business that made it the right decision for you to exit that today?
Mike Hansen: Well, if we go back a year ago, some of the things that we’ve talked about relating to that business, we really do believe that it was a good business for us. We took a business, changed the business model from onsite to offsite shredding. We added our people, our culture, our processes and we felt like we really made a - created a great business. But there were some things that we didn’t like as much and that is generally what we found was the decision maker was different than the decision maker for most of our businesses. The commodity impact was a bit of a bumpy ride through the years and we weren’t crazy about that. We felt like we were a little concerned that there weren’t many product adjacencies for us in that business. So the growth was coming from volume primarily and so, for those reasons, we and then finally we weren’t seeing enough or improvement quickly enough and that was one of the main reasons why we also wanted to do the transaction with Shred-it a year ago. When we think about how that’s gone over the last year as I’ve mentioned several times in the last few quarters, we've been very, very pleased with how the business has progressed, how the integration has progressed. But when we think about our investment, there’s a lot of uncertainty in the macro environment. There is a lot of uncertainty about how commodities will continue to affect that business. There is uncertainty in a way of the stock market as it related to the IPO alternative with Greece and China creating some wild rides. There’s uncertainty as it relates to being a minority owner and having a bit of a limited influence. And then finally there was uncertainty as it relates to the impact that it would have on our P&L. And so generally speaking, the thoughts that we had a year ago for making the transaction and the uncertainty about the position that we were in led us to believe that taking the certainty of this deal was a great opportunity for us.
Andrew Wittmann: Was there a $50 million that you’re highlighting Mike as you look up to number?
Mike Hansen: The total purchase price is $2.3 billion for the entire company, but we have to pull out debt and some transaction expenses and so there can be a little bit of movement in those. And as in most deals there’s a little bit of a hold back and so that’s the reason for the range.
Andrew Wittmann: Is it a fair playbook to look at the first time you contributed this to the joint venture where you wound up doing a decent sized special dividend and then kind of followed up some buyback, is that you think decent [indiscernible] are going in assumptions as to how the capital redeployment may go?
Mike Hansen: I hate to speculate on that Andy. We haven’t closed the deal yet, so it’s we don’t have the cash. Our Board so we just announced it yesterday, so our Board will certainly have that on their agenda and give a thoughtful process to how we put that cash to work. So I can’t speculate on that yet. But as you know we’ve shown a very much of willingness to put that cash to work.
Andrew Wittmann: And then my final question from me one more is, just your comments on the sales productivity, it sounds like it must have been really strong in the fourth quarter. Can you give us a sense about how the sales productivity this fourth quarter compared to the sales productivity last fourth quarter?
Mike Hansen: We do see some very good productivity from our sales reps, it was probably relative to the prior year our best quarter of the year. I’d rather not get into too much detail, but it was a good quarter for us. Our people and our partners have been very productive. Our training processes have gone very, very well. We have very good products and services to arm them with and they’ve done a very nice job.
Andrew Wittmann: Okay well, that seems like it would have an implication then for the revenue growth rate since that wasn't all captured as new business in the fourth quarter, that should give you at least some visibility into the revenue growth that you have next year. Is that fair? 
Mike Hansen: It is fair. It does give us a bit of a nice start to the year.
Andrew Wittmann: Okay, thank you very much.
Mike Hansen: Sure.
Operator: We’ll go next to Manav Patnaik from Barclays.
Manav Patnaik: Hi good evening guys and firstly congratulations on the way you guys did your portfolio realignment I guess. The one question I had I mean is just around the M&A your appetite, you said you’d love to do tuck-ins and maybe even the larger one occasionally. But if I look at the history, I mean, in uniform, you guys haven't done a deal in the last two years, really. In first aid, also it's been like two or three a year, I guess going back the last three years if I look at the disclosures. So maybe if you can just help us understand the pipeline that you see, like are there opportunities? I know you'd love to do it, but does it seem like there's a lot out there?
Mike Hansen: There are opportunities, now I would say that in our rental business and probably our first aid business there are as many opportunities as there was 15 years ago and probably not, but there are opportunities, they are very good opportunities and we’ll continue to explore them. But they have to be at the right value for us. We generally need a willing seller and so far we just haven’t seen the alignment, but we’re certainly active and we’ll not hesitate to make an acquisition particularly in our existing businesses that we believe has good value.
Manav Patnaik: Okay and is the, I guess the preference for the larger deal, like what is the, I mean is there an active consideration to look at the larger ones versus the smaller ones or not really?
Mike Hansen: I would just say that we certainly would be involved if there was a willing seller or a process and we think a large acquisition could at the right value be accretive for us. And so we would certainly take a look.
Manav Patnaik: Okay and then just last one from me, I know you talked briefly about some of the trends and for the net add-stops, but generally speaking, is there any way for you to characterize based on what you guys have seen historically, where we are in terms of on innings or however you want to characterize it in terms of the upsets and just employment -- I mean improvement on the employment front?
Mike Hansen: I am not sure that I can give you a specific in terms of innings or where I think we are. We've had a fairly nice stretch of economic performance albeit bumpy, but we've had a fairly nice stretch of economic performance over the last several years. How long will that continue, I am not sure. What I do know is that we will do our best through any economic cycle to continue to penetrate existing customers and then find ways to create value to know programmers. But I am not sure I can give you a specific inning or timeframe Manav.
Manav Patnaik: Okay, all right fair enough thank you guys.
Operator: We'll go next to Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel.
Shlomo Rosenbaum: Hi thank you for squeezing me in here. Most of my questions have been answered. I just want to touch on two items that were brought up a little bit earlier. Just on the add-stops metric what has the trajectory been? No I'm not talking about the last quarter, but just the last few years and has there really been more of an upswing if you would kind of chart that and where do we stand versus let's say where we were seven or eight years ago before we had kind of the great depression or the great recession, where do we stand versus that because there was always just kind of a lever are we back to levels that we had seen prior to things going bad or where do you see it right now?
Mike Hansen: I would say that the performance has certainly been more choppy in the last several years. Going back prerecession, I don’t have that at my fingertips but I will tell you over the last few years, because of the choppiness that we've seen in the adds and stops, we've talked a lot about seeming to have a positive trend only the churn next quarter and to a bit of a negative trend because of the choppiness that we have seen. The overall impact to the business I would say has been a bit muted and there still is opportunity to see a better impact. I was just looking at -- if you think about the jobs that are in the historically strong uniform rental sectors. Some are still at lower levels than prerecession. And I think that is just a reflection of the bumpiness and inconsistency that we've seen in the last several years.
Shlomo Rosenbaum: Okay. And then one other thing that was brought up before and I just want to touch on, do you have any recent new introduction of products or services that have been added like what you did with Carhartt and what you've done with [indiscernible] kind of agreement and what you've done with kind of the floor washing, is there anything recent that's been added that seems like it is another potential opened end market for you guys?
Mike Hansen: Well we're always working on innovation Shlomo, but I will tell you that our chemical business, our Carhartt business, they are still relatively small and we've got a lot of growth opportunities still in those. And we have the other one that I could mention is a our signature series hygiene products and even though we've introduced those a few years ago, it takes a little bit of time to get those penetrated throughout the country and so we're still working on those. We're focused on continuing to drive penetration. I don't have any new things to talk about. We certainly know that innovation is important and we're working on it. But I don’t have anything new to talk to you about. We're just focused on continuing to penetrate with some of these newer products and services where we've got a lot of room.
Shlomo Rosenbaum: Okay great, thank you so much.
Mike Hansen: Sure.
Operator: And at this time, we have no further questions in the queue.
Mike Hansen: Well, thank you very much for joining us tonight. We will be issuing our first quarter earnings in late September and we look forward to speaking with you again at that time.
Operator: This does conclude today's conference. We thank you for your participation.

===== 2015 Q3  (2015-03-18 17:00:00) =====
Executives: Mike Hansen – Vice President-Finance and Chief Financial Officer Paul Adler – Corporate Controller
Analysts: Andrew Steinerman – JPMorgan Greg Bisbee – Barclays Andy Whitman – Robert W Baird Faton Begolli – Merrill Lynch Bank of America Nate Brochmann – William Blair Scott Schneeberger – Oppenheimer Joe Box – KeyBanc Capital Markets
Operator: Good day everyone and welcome to the Cintas Quarterly Earnings Results Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time I'd like to turn the conference over to Mr. Mike Hansen, Vice President of Finance and Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead, sir.
Mike Hansen: Good evening and thank you for joining us this evening as we report our third quarter results for fiscal 2015. With me is Paul Adler, Cintas' Corporate Controller. After our commentary, we will be happy to answer questions. The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a safe harbor from civil litigation for forward-looking statements. This conference call contains forward-looking statements that reflect the company's current views as to future events and financial performance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ materially from those we may discuss. I refer you to the discussion on these points contained in our most recent filings with the SEC. As we reported in today's press release, our results for continuing operations adjusted to exclude all impacts of the document management businesses are more representative of our ongoing performance. Therefore, our discussion of the company's performance will be based on the exclusion of document management. We are pleased to report third quarter revenue of $1.109 billion. Organic revenue growth, which adjusts for the impact of acquisitions, foreign currency and the Shred-It transaction was 7.5% for the third quarter. Each of our businesses organic growth was positive for the third quarter with rental organic growth being 7.8%, Uniform Direct Sales being 4.8%, and First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection Services organic growth being 7.5%. The third quarter revenue impacts from severe winter weather and the oil and gas related customers’ was relatively minor. Paul will touch on this when discussing the individual business results. We’re also pleased to show continued improvements in income as adjusted compared to last year’s third quarter as adjusted as operating income increased 17.1%, net income from continuing operations increased 20.2%, and earnings per diluted share increased 25%. Certainly, lower energy related costs help the comparison to last year, but we also feel good about our ability to leverage our infrastructure and manage our cost structure. Paul will discuss the energy related cost in more detail. We want to recognize our employees and we call partners for their dedication and competitive urgency in serving our customers. They continue to do a great job. Let me make a few comments about the Shred-It investment. First, regarding the presentation on the income statement, we have pulled the results out of SG&A and included in a line under income taxes entitled loss on investment in Shred-It, net of tax. This is in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and provide the pure indication of the performance of the business. Second, regarding the third quarter impact, we’ve recognized a $6.8 million net loss for our third quarter or negative $0.06 per share. This negative impact was primarily due to integration costs such as IT, system converting costs and rebranding costs. In addition, Shred-It has a fairly large presence in Canada and the weakening of the Canadian dollar compared to the U.S. dollar also had a negative impact. The conversion in general though, continues to progress as planned and we are pleased with the performance of the business. We indicated in today’s press release that we acquired 3.2 million shares of our common stock during the third quarter. The total cost was $251 million and the average cost per share was $78.84. This buyback had $0.01 positive impact on our third quarter EPS and we expected to benefit the fourth quarter by $0.02. As we announced on this past January of 13th, the Cintas’ Board authorized a new buyback program of $500 million and that entire program remains available as of today. We also announced in today’s press release that we have updated our guidance. We now expect our fiscal 2015 revenue to be in the range of $4.46 billion to $4.49 billion. We have tightened the revenue range slightly to reflect continued weakening of the Canadian dollar and for potential oil and gas related customer impact. While we did not see any noticeable revenue impact in the third quarter from our oil and gas related customer, we did began to hear from them that a negative impact is coming. On the EPS side, we now expect our fiscal 2015 earnings per diluted share guidance to be in the range of $3.55 to $3.58. When excluding the special items of the impact of the Document Shredding business and the additional gain on the Shred-it Transaction, the impact of the sale of stock in an equity investment and the impact of discontinued operations including the sale of the Document Storage and Imaging business. We expect fiscal 2015 earnings per diluted share to be in the range of $3.31 to $3.34. This EPS guidance is detailed in a table within today’s press release. I will now turn the call over Paul for more details on the third quarter performance.
Paul Adler: Thank you, Mike. Before moving into the third quarter results, let me remind you that there were 65 work days in this year's third quarter, which is the same as last year's third quarter. Our fourth quarter will have 65 work days, which is the same as last year's fourth quarter, for a total of 260 work days for the fiscal year. Looking ahead to next fiscal year, fiscal 2016 will have 262 work days, so two more than this year. By quarter, the work days will be 66 in the first quarter, 65 in the second and third quarters and 66 in the fourth quarter. As Mike mentioned total revenue in the quarter increased 7.0% excluding last year’s impact of Document Shredding. Total revenue increased organically by 7.5%. Total company gross margin was 42.9% for the third quarter of this year compared to 42.3% in last year’s third quarter. The current quarter gross margin of 42.9% expanded 80 basis points from last year’s third quarter gross margin of 42.1% adjusted to exclude Document Shredding. Total company energy related expenses for this year’s third quarter were 2.4%. Last year’s third quarter energy related expenses were 3.2%, but excluding Document Management they were 3.0%. I’ll discuss gross margin and energy related expenses by business in just a moment. Before doing so, let me remind you that we have three reportable operating segments: Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products, Uniform Direct Sales and First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection Services. Uniform Direct Sales and First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection Services are combined and presented as other services on the income statement. The Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products operating segment consist of the rental and servicing of uniforms, mats, towels and other related items. The segment also includes restaurant supplies and other facility products and services. Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products revenue was $859.5 million, which is up 7.2% compared to last year's third quarter. Organic growth, which excludes the impact of acquisitions and foreign currency changes, was 7.8%. Organic growth was higher than total growth because of the continued weakening of the Canadian dollar. We did not see any noticeable third quarter revenue effect from oil and gas related customers, but as Mike mentioned, these customers businesses did begin to feel the impact of the low oil prices in the later part of the quarter. Aside from the oil and gas related customers, we saw no marketable change to net add stops in the third quarter. Our Rental segment gross margin was 44.6% for the third quarter, an increase from 43.9% in last year's third quarter. Most of these improvements came from energy related costs, which were 70 basis points lower than in last year’s third quarter. The third quarter Rental Segment gross margin of 44.6% was a slight decrease from this fiscal year’s second quarter gross margin of 44.8%. Energy related costs in the third quarter were 20 basis points lower than in this fiscal year’s second quarter. Our Uniform Direct Sales operating segment includes the direct sale of uniforms and other related products to national and regional customers. Uniforms and other related products are also sold to local customers, including products sold to rental customers through our direct sale catalog. Uniform Direct Sales revenue for the third quarter was $112.2 million, an increase of 4.2% compared to last year's third quarter. When adjusting for foreign currency changes, organic growth was 4.8%. Uniform Direct Sales gross margin was 27.7% for the third quarter, a slight improvement from last year's third quarter gross margin of 27.5% and this year’s second quarter gross margin of 27.6%. Both of these improvements are mostly due to lower energy related expenses. Our First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection Services operating segment includes revenue from the sale and servicing of first aid products, safety products and training, and fire protection products. First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection revenue for the third quarter was $137.1 million, which was 8.2% higher than last year's third quarter. Organic growth was 7.5%. We continue to be very pleased with this business. Third quarter organic growth came down some from previous quarters due to fewer repair jobs on the fire protection side of the business and due to the severe winter weather in the Northeast. This segment’s gross margin was 44.3% in the third quarter, an improvement of 80 basis points compared to last year’s third quarter gross margin of 43.5%. Energy related costs were 60 basis points lower than last year’s third quarter. The third quarter gross margin of 44.3% was an improvement over this fiscal year’s second quarter gross margin of 43.8%. Energy-related costs accounted for 40 basis points of the improvement. Switching to selling and administrative expenses, total company SG&A was 27.2% as a percentage of third quarter revenue, compared to a total company SG&A in last year's third quarter of 28.6%. When excluding the impact that document shredding had on last year's third quarter SG&A and revenue, last year's adjusted total company SG&A was 27.8% as a percentage of the adjusted revenue. On our second quarter call, we indicated that our risk management claims experience was better than the previous year and that better experience continued into our third quarter. Keep in mind however that we are self-insured. In addition to risk management and number of minor improvements were realized in other expense categories. The third quarter SG&A of 27.2% was a 50 basis point increase, compared to the 26.7% in this fiscal year’s second quarter. As we mentioned on the second quarter call, payroll taxes reset in our third quarter. This expected increase was partially offset by a number of minor improvements in other expenses. Our effective tax rate was 36.2% for the quarter, compared to 36.7% last year. The effective tax rate can fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter based on tax reserve builds and releases relating to specific discrete items. We expect the fiscal 2015 effective rate to be 37.3%. Our cash and marketable securities were $490 million at February 28, a decrease of $337 million from the $827 million at November 30th. This decrease is due to paying the $202 million dividend in early December and the execution of the $251 million share buyback during the third quarter, partially offsets by cash generated from our operating cash flows. Accounts receivable decreased $12 million since November 30th, due to the timing of collections. New goods inventory and in-service inventory levels at February 28th were relatively consistent with November 30th balances. Accounts payable increased roughly $27 million since November 30th, due to the timing of vendor payment due dates. Current accrued liabilities decreased by $221 million since November 30th, due largely to the payments of the accrued dividend, which was paid in December. Long-term debt remained at $1.3 billion, representing 1.6 times EBITDA. And finally, CapEx for the third quarter was about $50 million. Our CapEx by operating segment was as follows: $43 million in Rental, $2 million in Uniform Direct Sales, and $5 million in First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection. We expect CapEx for fiscal 2015 to be in the range of $220 million to $250 million. That concludes our prepared remarks and we’ll now be glad to answer any of your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And we’ll take our first question from Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan.
Andrew Steinerman: It’s Andrew. I definitely appreciate you’re kind of talking about oil clients upfront because you’d be asking anyhow. But my question is when you look at your percentage exposure to oil clients, has it changed since you talk about those in late December and whey you say that you’ve allowed for some room for easing with your oil clients into fourth quarter, how much is this going to move the kind of fourth quarter organic number like is this a big deal or you’re just trying to kind of communicate one small piece of the business?
Mike Hansen: Andrew, we knew that we would get out this question, so we’re trying to anticipate a little bit. The magnitude of those oil and gas customers has not changed since the second quarter, so it’s still in the lower single-digits. And when we think about the fourth quarter, more of the impacts based on our guidance movement is due to the Canadian dollar, but there will be a little bit of an impact from the oil and gas customers. We have started to hear from them that they are reducing workforce to some extent. But like I said the impact is within our guidance and the amount of those customers hasn’t really changed.
Andrew Steinerman: Great. And just – the business even if they reduce people, I mean the uniform rental business doesn’t move quickly so I could try – again maybe I will try one more time, do you think that the oil and gas clients pulling back might move your organic rental number 10, 20 basis points? Or is that higher given the low single-digit exposure overall?
Mike Hansen: Well, I think it will be a relatively small move. And while we – I hesitate to give too many specifics, but I think it certainly is going to be less than a percentage point of impact in the fourth quarter. Now, the other thing I would say Andrew is we’re in the midst of this impact and we’re hearing from customers making moves on a daily basis if you will. And so, it’s a little bit hard to peg it exactly. We do think certainly that it’s within our guidance. As we get into fiscal 2016, we’ll certainly have to continue to evaluate how this moves and speak to that in July, but again it’s not – it is a relatively small portion of our overall revenue.
Andrew Steinerman: I appreciate. Mike, let me try one more time. So 95 plus percent of your business continues to be strong, right.
Mike Hansen: Yes.
Andrew Steinerman: Okay, thank you.
Operator: And we’ll take our next question from Gary Bisbee with RBC.
Unidentified Analyst: Hi, good afternoon, this is [indiscernible] for Gary, not to continue along the oil and gas exposure, but I think you guys mentioned last quarter some of the pricing pushback potentially from customers regarding lower fuel prices. Is that tended to materialize in the quarter and any comment on that?
Mike Hansen: Our pricing environment in the third quarter was relatively the same as the second quarter. So we didn’t see much of a change, I think what we had signaled last quarter was that look as we – as those customers start to feel the impact of the lower oil prices, conversations about pricing may be a little bit more difficult. But we did not see a dramatic change in the pricing environment in the third quarter.
Unidentified Analyst: Fair enough thanks. And I guess in terms of the – add-stop metric, I guess any kind of commentary around that and any more color just regarding, I guess, in the overall context of the job market here?
Mike Hansen: Well we, as Paul said, we didn’t see a noticeable change in the net add-stops number and that’s as you’ve probably heard from us that’s been relatively consistent over the last several years. And I think the impact of net add-stops on a quarter specific basis is just not that large and that’s the way it is been for the last-gasp five years and that’s what we saw in the quarter, just not much of an impact.
Unidentified Analyst: Thanks. 
Mike Hansen: We certainly love to see our customers begin to hire at a higher rate and feel the impact of that, but we didn’t see that in the third quarter.
Unidentified Analyst: Fair enough. And then I guess in terms of these Shred-It impact are you guys wanted to disclose, I guess what potential impact that could be on fiscal 2016 estimates or any whether it’s going to be material for your guys or kind of expected impact from that?
Mike Hansen: Well I will tell you, a year ago when we closed that transaction, we certainly with Shred-It put together a business plan and that business plan included certain performance expectations, certain synergies, certain integration costs. And that I would say that that integration is going as expected and we continue to be happy with that business. But because we are in the midst of that integration process, the results and the cost of those re branding efforts and IT conversion efforts are little bit unpredictable right now. And so we are not prepared to give really much of a forecast for the fourth quarter and certainly not for our fiscal 2016. As we get into fiscal 2016, that may change, but we need to see more of the integration be completed before we’re going to be ready to give forecasts.
Unidentified Analyst : Great and if I could sneak one more, and I guess could you guys comment, I guess on the M&A pipeline and kind of the activity levels there and, I guess, if the valuations are increasingly higher for you guys in the context around that would be great, thanks.
Mike Hansen: Sure, we do have an active pipeline were we are constantly looking for opportunities in that area. I would say that evaluations are generally fairly high, but we’re certainly willing and looking for opportunities in that area. Even though nothing significant is close we’re still that is a great use of our cash and we’re still looking for those opportunities.
Unidentified Analyst : Great, thanks so much.
Mike Hansen: Sure.
Operator: And we’ll take our next question from Manav Patnaik with Barclays.
Greg Bisbee: Hi, this is actually Greg calling on for Manav. I was just hoping you add a little bit more color on the weather impact for this quarter. I know the weather is pretty bad last year, just want to see how much for tailwind that actually was for the quarter?
Paul Adler: I would not say that it was a tailwind for the quarter. Last year, you are correct, last year the winter was fairly severe and it really affected our document management business more than any other business. It also tends to affect our first aid and safety and fire business a little bit more. And so I wouldn’t call that a tailwind for this quarter because yes obviously we don’t have the document management results and we had some weather issues this quarter in first aid safely and fire as well.
Greg Bisbee: Okay. And then I guess on document sales here [indiscernible] some of the tough comps, can be a little bit lumpy but this mid single-digit range that you had is that a reasonable expectation for what you are thinking about that business and what it can do?
Paul Adler: I am sorry you are talking about the document management business.
Greg Bisbee: I am sorry, Direct sales – Uniform Direct Sales.
Paul Adler: Uniform Direct Sales, all right.
Greg Bisbee: Sorry for that.
Paul Adler: That’s a very good business for us and we do believe that it can grow in the mid single-digits. We want to make sure that we’re selling the right accounts and profitable accounts. We aren’t interested in selling commodity direct sale of uniforms but we do believe that can grow in the mid single-digits.
Greg Bisbee: Okay.
Paul Adler: But as you say it is a bumpy ride with that business.
Greg Bisbee: Okay. And just one more from me on the CapEx guidance trending well there, is that being pushed out fiscal 2016 or is that kind of, you’re realizing that you don’t need to do quite as much or how should we think about that?
Mike Hansen: I would say that the processing capacity that we spoke off in the first half of the year is getting pushed into next fiscal year. We still have some SAP spending. As you know, we’re in the midst of the SAP projects for rental. And we’ll see a little bit of that get pushed into next year as well.
Greg Bisbee: Okay, thank you.
Operator: And we’ll take our next question from George Tong with Piper Jaffray.
Unidentified Analyst: Hi, this is [indiscernible] calls on for George Tong. I just wanted to touch on Uniform Rentals and see if you can give us a little more color on what’s really driving growth there, is it new customers, is it better pricing, give us a little more color on that.
Mike Hansen: Sure, it’s – I would say that it’s a same thing that’s been driving for the last several quarters and that is good new business sales, so new customers. It is penetration of existing customers with additional products and services and certainly pricing has helped this fiscal year as well. We’ve talked about the pricing environment being more positive this fiscal year than compared to last fiscal year, so that’s certainly has helped us well. So it’s a combination of the three of those.
Unidentified Analyst: Great. And touching back on CapEx, I know you were planning to build up some new facilities to expand your production capabilities or your processing facilities. I just wanted to see if there is any update on those plans?
Mike Hansen: We still are actively working on those plans. As I have mentioned that the actual spending has been pushed – will get pushed into next fiscal year, but we still do need some capacity in certain areas and we’ll be moving forward with those plans next fiscal year.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay, great. Thanks for the color.
Mike Hansen: Sure.
Operator: We’ll take our next question from Andy Whitman with Robert W Baird.
Andy Whitman: Hi, guys. Good afternoon. Like I just wanted to understand the – some of the impacts of Shred-it here and maybe the first thing is a definitional question in your guidance. You mentioned that Shred-it – your guidance excludes – assumes I think you said considers no contribution from Shred-it. Is that saying that you expected to be EPS neutral or are you saying Shred-it is going to do what it’s going to do and you’re not considering that in how you’re guiding. And the reason why I ask this is for the quarter obviously it had a – I guess a negative $0.06 impact and previously my working assumption was that Shred-it was going to be EPS neutral. So I guess this restructuring but thought that was contemplated. Was what you saw in Shred-it unexpected for you or where you guiding exclusive of Shred-it from the get-go?
Mike Hansen: We’ve been guidance exclusive of Shred-it. We that integration – while it continues as expected, it can be a little bit unpredictable in terms of when this spend happens and so we’re just not prepared to give good guidance on a quarter-by-quarter basis. We do really believe that synergy opportunities are being achieved and will continue to be achieved and we really do believe that – that it will be additive to us. But we’re in a little bit of a period of unpredictability and hesitant to give any kind of guidance as a result.
Andy Whitman: Okay, that’s helpful. Is it even meaningful to try to get the quarterly breakdown, now that you’ve pulled the Shred-it contribution out of the SG&A and put it on its own line, would you be comfortable giving that and even if you did can we make anything of it?
Mike Hansen: Sure it will. I mean the quarter itself was $6.8 million and prior to this in the second quarter, I believe it was roughly $300,000 of a net expense, in the first quarter, because in our first quarter we were so close to the transaction date, that there weren’t a lot of integration activities happening.
Andy Whitman: Yes, Okay, all that is helpful. I think – that’s it, I think all I have for this time. Thanks.
Mike Hansen: Okay.
Operator: And we’ll go next to Faton Begolli with Merrill Lynch Bank of America.
Faton Begolli: Hi, this is Faton Begolli calling in for Sara Gubins. So my first question is on the SMP implementation. Could you update us on the role out of that and what benefits you are seeing?
Mike Hansen: Well, we are in a very early stages and so that the early stage is mean we are – we’re still building the system, we expect to be able to pilot that system, probably something early fiscal 2017 and if all goes well, then we’ll start to see a roll out some time in fiscal 2017 and continuing into fiscal 2018. So we’ll start to see the depreciation of that system, partially in 2017, probably if all goes well, a full year in 2018 and really want to start to see the benefit until we get to that point. So we haven’t seen any benefit of it yet nor have we seen any real expense yet.
Faton Begolli: I see, okay. Thank you and you also mentioned no change in add-stops. We had a point where we – where you would expect growth there or what would it take a expect growth in that metric?
Mike Hansen: Well it certainly would take our customers hiring at a more accelerated pace. When we think about the jobs, certainly the headlines are looking better and that is good news. We just haven’t seen that translate to net add-stops yet. Keeping in mind that the last several months are seasonally adjusted and so it gives a little bit difficult to equate the BLS information to our net add-stops. But we just haven’t seen yet and we need to see our customers more rapidly hire.
Faton Begolli: I see, okay. So switching gears to a potential acquisition, so giving your recent performance and your recent operating results, would you expand the countries outside of the U.S. few acquisition. Is that in your plan?
Mike Hansen: Well we – I would say that our first priority and our first preference would be to acquire businesses that are in our existing businesses within the U.S. and Canada. As certainly we will get the most value and synergies out of those kind of acquisition opportunities. Having said that, if we were able to find the right acquisitions internationally and in the right businesses we certainly would take a look at those. But as you probably seen from Cintas over the years, we would likely be a little bit more cautious about that. But our preference is acquisition opportunities in our existing businesses in the U.S and Canada.
Faton Begolli: Got it. Thanks. Okay, so my last question is just a housekeeping question, what do you expect for a share count for the end of the year?
Mike Hansen: I would – we are expecting something around $119 million.
Faton Begolli: Okay, that is all I have, thank you.
Mike Hansen: You’re welcome.
Operator: We will take our next question from Nate Brochmann with William Blair.
Nate Brochmann: Good evening, everyone.
Mike Hansen: Hi, Nate.
Nate Brochmann : So I want to follow-up a little bit on the add-stop metric and I know we haven’t really seen an increase in I know that we kind of been fluctuating from neutral, maybe the slightly positive and even sometime slightly negative. But if we were to assume that maybe at some point that starts getting moving, would there be anything in the cost structure or anything in terms of just utilization or capacity at a point that we’d have to add so significantly that we could not at least for a period of time recognize maybe some historical relationships between the increase in the add-stop and then incremental gross margins that would get associated with that route density?
Mike Hansen: Well, if we saw a rapid pick up in adds, so keeping in mind, we would likely have some additional material cost when a customer adds a new employee. We will go to our stockroom where we have existing garments and we’ll pull as many of those existing garments as we can and those are already in our cost structure. However, there are times due to size, differences, et cetera, where we may have to order some new garments as well. So there is a little bit of an incremental material cost impact. We then have to wash those instead of those garments sitting in our stockroom, we have to wash those garments and sort them. But then from a service standpoint, we’re already going to that customer, we’re already delivering and there really isn’t any additional cost there. So it is a very accretive kind of business and its great business and we love to see more of it. Would we get enough net add-stops to dramatically affect our capacity where we’d have to really see some significant hiring in order to do that. So, we’d have to have a lot of net add-stops affecting one or two or a few locations and that’s unlikely.
Nate Brochmann: Okay, and yes that’s helpful. And then second – and I don’t know if there is anything that you can really share, but obviously you’ve been very successful over the last several years in terms of adding some new services, anything new in the pipeline that we can talk about or anything else in terms of that incremental in terms of the extra cross-selling opportunity?
Mike Hansen: Well, we’re certainly always working on new products and services, no question about it. We are still working hard to penetration as many customers as possible with our Carhartt program. We’ve talked about Scrub Rental program and our chemicals. And those are still selling very, very well and the growth rates are still very good. I’m not ready to talk about any new items, but the really nice thing about our business is we’ve got close to a million customers that we’re seeing generally on a weekly or monthly basis and that relationship and that frequency create some good opportunities for us. And so we’re always looking and we’re currently working on ways to improve – not improve but increase the amount of products and services with each of them.
Nate Brochmann: Sounds good, I appreciate the time. I’ll turn that over.
Operator: And we’ll take our next question from Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer.
Scott Schneeberger: Thanks. Good afternoon. I’m curious on new wins and penetration. Just curious any commentary on end market themes that you’re seeing there where the strength is coming from for the most part?
Mike Hansen: You know the theme that we’ve talked about over the last years or may be a couple of years is that healthcare is becoming a more and more important vertical for us as we create more products for that verticals such as the Scrub Rental Program, such as Microfiber mops and wipes. It is becoming more important for us and that’s been a nice vertical. I would say that really nothing other – no other verticals that really top out as being a big change to us.
Scott Schneeberger: Thanks and I think that’s been covered pretty well, but I just ask it one more time just to drive it home. In the oil and gas end market, you’re saying low single-digit exposure that’s what it was last quarter that’s what it is this quarter. Was it about the same going back a year or 18 months ago? And then what I’m getting at is – is that come on strong this year or has that been pretty stable for the past couple of years?
Mike Hansen: Well, the oil and gas vertical requires a lot of fire resisting clothing. And so, I would say over really the last five years, it’s been a very nice vertical for us. We have had a lot success and the industry has had a lot of success selling fire resisting clothing to them. I would say that it hasn’t been a change to us though. It’s been fairly consistent and a good growth vertical for us for a number of years. I would say if you go back 10 years, Scott, probably less revenue in that area than today.
Scott Schneeberger: Excellent, thanks. And one more from me, I think it’s pretty clear, but just would love to get your perspective on the increase in the guidance. How much of it was relative to the internal expectation for the fiscal third quarter? How much was contribution from share repurchase that’s been done recently and just other puts and takes [indiscernible] or a bridge is essentially what I’m looking for? Thanks.
Mike Hansen: Well, the share buyback was $0.03, $0.01 in the third quarter and we expect $0.02 in the fourth quarter. I would say a lot of the guidance and we’re – I’m speaking to EPS was because of the good results in the third quarter certainly. And it just reflects our expectation for the fourth quarter. We’ve been at a pretty good operating margin for the year. I think Bill and I talked a little bit about that being relatively consistent throughout the year and I wouldn’t expect to change from that now.
Scott Schneeberger: Great. Thanks for the color.
Mike Hansen: Sure.
Operator: We’ll take our next question from Joe Box with KeyBanc Capital Markets.
Joe Box: Hi, good afternoon guys.
Mike Hansen: Hi, Joe.
Joe Box: So, Mike, I think you mentioned earlier in your prepared remarks that you do expect operating leverage from density gains. I’m just curious should we think about that statement as maybe being status quo versus you’d previously expected from density or are there maybe some bigger benefits out in front of us as you implement your SAP system and maybe we could be looking at continued above trend incremental margins?
Mike Hansen: I think the – our guidance would start to suggest that when you think about our third and fourth quarter of last fiscal year, we had some very healthy incremental margins. From a rental standpoint, the operating margin was close to 50% in the second half of the year, the incremental opportunity margins. It’s hard to keep that rate going for long periods of time, but we do still believe that that we can have very good incremental margins because we’ve got quite an infrastructure around the U.S. and Canada and we can continue to add products and services to our customers and some of those are not – some of the revenues that we’re getting is not processed, so we’re not really using any processing capacity. So we think there is still a certainly our good incremental margin opportunities as we move forward. Having said that at the 50% clip that that’s pretty hard to sustain over long periods of time.
Joe Box: Of course, I appreciate that. Thanks Mike. And just maybe one quick one on Shred-it, I appreciate the commentary you’ve given us so far, but I do want to try to understand maybe where we’re at from an integration standpoint, really just to help us with our model. Can you just give us a sense of maybe what inning you think you’re in as you’re integrating these two companies? Are you guys just scratching the surface on re-branding on IT and route consolidation? Or do you think you’re maybe in mid or late innings?
Mike Hansen: I would say that that we’ve passed the 50% mark and so we’re probably in that third quarter of the integration.
Joe Box: Thank you that – that’s helpful. And then just one last oil and gas question, I’m not really curious about the top line impact, but I do want to ask on working capital. If you do start to see some assets come back to you, could you possibly re-deploy those into other markets like construction or petrochemical or are they all pretty industry specific?
Mike Hansen: Well, it certainly would be customer by customer, but we can use fire resistant clothing in other industries besides oil and gas. Anything that’s got kind of a flash fire opportunity can – will need fire resisting clothing and there are lots of opportunities for those. So they’re not quite as broad as our general work wear uniform, but there are other opportunities except for certain customers, who have very specific garments that that we would have an inventory liability protection on.
Joe Box: And do you think we would notice it in the working capital line or is it too small?
Mike Hansen: I don’t think it would be noticeable, no.
Joe Box: Okay, thanks guys, nice quarter.
Mike Hansen: Thanks.
Operator: And we’ll take our next question from Adams [Indiscernible].
Unidentified Analyst: Hi, guys this is Adam [Indiscernible] on for John Healy. Great job on the quarter.
Mike Hansen: Thank you.
Unidentified Analyst: Yes, I was wondering if you guys could help us out with the SG&A line, it was impressive again this quarter. I was hoping you could guide us about that line item moving forward into 2016 from a modeling standpoint?
Mike Hansen: I am sorry, is it Adam?
Unidentified Analyst: Yes.
Mike Hansen: Adams, we’re not prepared right now to give fiscal 2016 guidance. I would tell you that that we do believe that we can continue to get leverage in the SG&A area, but not prepared right now to give 2016 information.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay, great. Thanks guys. Good quarter.
Mike Hansen: Thanks.
Paul Adler: Thanks.
Operator: That concludes today’s question-and-answer session. Mr. Adler, Mr. Hansen, I’d like to turn the conference back over to you for any additional or closing remarks.
Mike Hansen: Well, thank you very much for joining us tonight. As a reminder, we’ll be issuing our fourth quarter earnings in mid July. So we look forward to speaking with you at that time. Good evening.
Operator: That does conclude today’s conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2015 Q2  (2014-12-18 17:00:00) =====
Executives: Bill Gale - SVP and CFO Mike Hansen - VP and Treasurer
Analysts: Greg Bisbee - Barclays Andy Whitman - Robert W. Baird Sara Gubins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Dan Dolev - Jefferies Joe Box - KeyBanc Capital Markets Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer Andrew Steinerman - JPMorgan
Operator: Good day everyone and welcome to the Cintas Quarterly Earnings Results Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time I'd like to turn the call over to Mr. Bill Gale, Senior Vice President of Finance and Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead, sir.
Bill Gale: Thank you for joining us this evening. With me is Mike Hansen, Cintas' Vice President and Treasurer. After our commentary, we will be happy to answer questions. The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a safe harbor from civil litigation for forward-looking statements. This conference call contains forward-looking statements that reflect the company's current views as to future events and financial performance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ materially from those we may discuss. I refer you to the discussion on these points contained in our most recent filings with the SEC. As we reported in today's press release, our results for continuing operations adjusted to exclude all impacts of the document management businesses are more representative of our ongoing performance. Therefore, our discussion of the company's performance will be based on that, the exclusion of document management. We are pleased to report second quarter revenue of $1.123 billion. Organic revenue growth, which adjusts for the impact of acquisitions, foreign currency and the Shred-It transaction was 7.2% for the second quarter. Rental organic growth was 8.1%. And First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection Services organic growth was 12.1%. The performance of our sales force in both businesses remain strong and penetration of additional products and services into existing customers continued. Our second quarter gross margin was $481.4 million or 42.9% of second quarter revenue. This was a nice improvement over last year's 41.3% as we continue to leverage our infrastructure, continue to operate very efficiently, and increased our revenue per stop from added penetration at existing customers. Second quarter operating income was $181.6 million or 16.2% of second quarter revenue. This was a 20.7% increase over last year's second quarter operating income of $150.5 million or 14.3% of last year's revenue. Second quarter net income and earnings per diluted share as adjusted also improved nicely compared to last fiscal year second quarter amount, as adjusted. Second quarter net income was $103.7 million, which was 9.2% of revenue and grew by 24% over last year's second quarter. Second quarter earnings per diluted share as adjusted was $0.86, which grew over 26% compared to last fiscal year's second quarter figure as adjusted of $0.68. As Scott Farmer indicated in our press release today, our employees, who we call partners, have executed our game plan very effectively, and we look forward to the second half of our fiscal year. We are updating our fiscal 2015 guidance as a result of our second quarter results. Before discussing the guidance though, let me make a few comments on our views of the economy. We have certainly been pleased with the U.S. employment growth in the last few months. While the employment growth continues to be more narrow than we would like, the overall growth totals have been good. This has not yet translated into marketable improvements in our rental net add-stops metric. But our customers are recognizing the value of our products and services and our penetration continues to be solid. Our guidance assume that the U.S. economy will remain in this current state during the second half of our fiscal year. We do believe, however, that this economic state is fairly fragile. Many macro factors such as interest rate environment, energy prices and global economic issues could upset the U.S. momentum, and so we are hesitant to turn too optimistic. With these views in mind and based on our second quarter results, we now expect our fiscal 2015 revenue to be in the range of $4.45 billion to $4.5 billion. We now expect our fiscal 2015 earnings per diluted share guidance to be in the range of $3.49 to $3.54. When excluding the special items of the impact of the document shredding business and the additional gain on the Shred-It transaction, the impact of the sale of stock and an equity investment and the impact of the discontinued operations, including the sale of document storage and imaging business, we expect fiscal 2015 earnings per diluted share guidance to be in the range of $3.20 to $3.25. This EPS guidance is detailed in the table within today's press release. I will now turn the call over to Mike for more details on the second quarter performance.
Mike Hansen: Thanks, Bill, and good evening. Before moving into the second quarter results, let me remind you that there were 65 work days in this year's second quarter, which is the same as last year's second quarter. Looking ahead to the remainder of fiscal 2015, we will have 65 work days in each quarter, for a total of 260 work days for the fiscal year. These work day figures for fiscal 2015 are the exact same as in fiscal 2014, so we will have no work day differences or adjustments for the remainder of this fiscal year. We have three reportable operating segments, Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products, Uniform Direct Sales, and First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection Services. Uniform Direct Sales and First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection Services are combined and presented as other services on the face of the income statement. The rental uniforms and ancillary products operating segment consists of the rental and servicing of uniforms, mats, towels and other related items. The segment also includes restaurant supplies and other facility products and services. Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products revenue was $865 million, which is up 7.6% compared to last year's second quarter. Organic growth, which excludes the impact of acquisitions and foreign currency changes, was 8.1%. Organic growth was higher than total growth because of the weakening of the Canadian dollar. As Bill mentioned, the performance of our sales team continued to be strong. We did not see a marketable improvement in net add-stops compared to last year's second quarter, but we did see our typical seasonal net adds for jackets and entrance mats. Entrance mat net adds were somewhat stronger than last year due to the early wintery weather this year. Penetration of additional products and services to existing customers remains strong. Our Rental segment gross margin was 44.8% for the second quarter, an increase from 42.9% in last year's second quarter. Energy-related costs were 20 basis points lower than in last year's second quarter. We've continued to leverage our infrastructure and are operating very efficiently. The second quarter Rental gross margin of 44.8% was a decrease from this fiscal year's first quarter gross margin of 45.1% due to a number of items, none of which are significant. Energy-related costs in the second quarter were 20 basis points lower than in this year's -- this fiscal year's first quarter. Our Uniform Direct Sales operating segment includes the direct sale of uniforms and other related products to national and regional customers. Uniforms and other related products are also sold to local customers, including products sold to rental customers through our direct sale catalog. Uniform Direct Sales revenue for the second quarter was $117.5 million, which was 3.6% lower than last year's second quarter. When adjusting for foreign currency changes, the organic decrease was 3.2%. Uniform Direct Sales gross margin was 27.6% for the quarter, a decrease from last year's second quarter gross margin of 28.8%. This decrease was due to lesser volumes and a mix towards lower-margin accounts. Our First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection Services operating segment includes revenue from the sale and servicing of first aid products, safety products and training, and fire protection products. First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection revenue for the second quarter was $140.4 million, which is 12.7% higher than last year's second quarter. Organic growth was 12.1%. As has been the case for the last few years, this business continues to execute at high levels and continues to innovate with new products and services. This segment's gross margin was 43.8% in the second quarter, which is slightly above last year's second quarter of 43.4%. Energy-related costs were 20 basis points lower than last year's second quarter. The second quarter gross margin of 43.8% is fairly consistent with this fiscal year's first quarter gross margin of 43.7%. Energy-related costs were 20 basis points lower than the first quarter. Moving to a few comments on the document shredding business. As a reminder, under U.S. Generally Accepted Account Principles, we will continue to include document shredding results in last fiscal year's income statement. However, beginning with the first quarter of this year, fiscal 2015, we no longer record any document shredding revenue, gross margin or operating income. Instead we will simply show our share of the partnership income in our corporate operating segment. During the second quarter of fiscal 2015, there was a slight loss of $300,000 net of tax from the partnership. Switching to selling and administrative expenses, total company SG&A was 26.7% as a percentage of revenue in the second quarter, compared to a total company SG&A in last year's second quarter of 28%. When excluding the impact that document shredding had on last year's second quarter SG&A and revenue, last year's adjusted total company SG&A was 27% as a percent of the adjusted revenue. The decrease in SG&A as a percent of revenue from last year's adjusted 27% to this year's 26.7% is made up of a number of minor changes from last year, none of which are of any significance. Looking ahead to our third quarter, keep in mind that payroll taxes reset with the new calendar year. We expect this resetting to increase third quarter payroll taxes by roughly 80 basis points over second quarter levels. Our effective tax rate was 37.4% for the quarter, compared to 37.8% last year. The effective tax rate can fluctuate from quarter to quarter based on tax reserve billeds [ph] and releases relating to specific discrete items. We expect the fiscal 2015 effective rate to be 37.3%. As we discussed on our first quarter conference call, we changed our accounting classification of the document storage and imaging business to discontinued operations, effective with this fiscal year's first quarter reporting. The classification of this business as discontinued operations means, under U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, that we must condense all income statement impact from the business into one line on the income statement for all periods presented. As a result, we no longer show any document storage and imaging revenue, gross margin or operating income in either this year's or last year's income statement. Instead, the entire results in both years are condensed into one line on the income statement, entitled 'income from discontinued operations net of tax.' For this year's second quarter, we had $17 million of net income from discontinued operations net of tax. This income resulted in earnings per diluted share from discontinued operations of $0.14. Included in this net income figure is a gain on the sale of the document storage and imaging business totaling $16.3 million net of all related expenses and taxes. As we announced on November 6th, 2014, we sold this business in three separate transactions which closed this past October and November. The aggregate consideration of these businesses was roughly $180 million. We received roughly $160 million of cash at closing with holdbacks [ph] of roughly $20 million to be determined over the next 12 months. The gain in this second quarter was computed based on the $160 million of cash received at closing. Our cash and cash equivalents were $827 million at November 30th, an increase of $245 million from the $581 million at August 31st. Again we received cash of $180 million from the sale of document storage and imaging -- $160 million. The remaining increase was generated from our operating cash flow. Keep in mind that we paid our annual dividend of $202 million on December 5th. Accounts receivable increased $21 million since August 31st due to the increase in sales. New goods inventory and in-service inventory levels at November 30th were $236 million and $528 million, respectively. These balances are fairly consistent with the balances at August 31st. Accounts payable increased roughly $30 million since August 31st due to the timing of vendor payment due dates. Current accrued liabilities were $503 million at November 30th, an increase of $210 million. This increase was due to the accrued dividend of $202 million at November 30th. Note that the assets and liabilities classified as held for sale at August 31st were sold as part of the document storage and imaging sale, except for certain document storage real estate properties that remain classified as held for sale at November 30th, these properties are currently being leased to the buyers of that business. Long-term debt remained at $1.3 billion, representing roughly 1.7 times EBITDA. And finally, CapEx for the second quarter was about $45 million. Our CapEx by operating segment was as follows: $35 million in Rental, $3 million in Uniform Direct Sales, and $7 million First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection. We expect CapEx for fiscal 2015 to be in the range of $250 million to $275 million. That concludes our prepared remarks, and we will now be glad to answer any of your questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Manof Phenix [ph] from Barclays.
Greg Bisbee - Barclays: Hi. This is Greg actually calling on for Manof [ph]. Just wanted to get some details on your energy costs in this lower cost environment. Does the current guidance that you have assume that oil prices and gas stay this low or is there potential upside should we remain at these low rates?
Bill Gale: Greg, as you know, our guidance has a range of about a nickel, and our basic assumption is that, generally speaking, the experience that we had in our second quarter will continue for the rest of the year. So let me just give a little color on that, because we anticipated this. If you look at the average price of fuel, and this is taken from the U.S. Energy Information Administration, in our fiscal second quarter, the average price of gas was $3.13 a gallon and the average price of diesel was $3.71 a gallon. In the first quarter, the average price of gas was $3.54 a gallon and the average price of diesel was $3.88 a gallon. Now, keep in mind, a little over 50% of our fleet is diesel, and we have not seen the dramatic drop in diesel prices that we've been seeing in gas prices. But if you think about what happened in our energy prices from the first quarter to the second quarter as a basis of revenue, we had about a 14 or 10-basis-point decline in the cost of our revenues. So, you know, while it's having an impact, we would expect the kind of experience we had in the second quarter to continue through the year. If we get what we saw late in the second quarter continue through the year, then we -- that would help us, all else being equal, to achieve toward the higher end of the guidance.
Greg Bisbee - Barclays: Okay, very helpful. And I guess along the same theme, I was wondering if you had gotten any feedback from your customers on the lower costs and if it's impacting their business and maybe, you know, specific to your energy customers, how big is that to you, and what do you expect that impact to be for those contracts?
Bill Gale: Well, no particular industry is overly significant to us, but there's no question that if these energy prices continue with these levels, our exploration customers, which have been pretty robust here in the last several years, are going to be impacted. And therefore, if they start laying off some of their employees, that will certainly have an impact on our revenue from those type of customers. It's not material but it will have -- it will be negative. On the other hand, lower energy prices would seem to me to drive some benefit for other types of businesses. So I think it's hard to really say whether or not it's going to have, you know, a negative or a positive impact on the company because there's going to be some industries that will benefit and some that won't.
Greg Bisbee - Barclays: Fair enough. And if I can sneak in one more, just on the buyback slowdown this quarter, does that have anything to do with the special dividend and what's your appetite for buybacks going forward?
Bill Gale: Yeah. We are certainly, you know, keep everyone in mind. We bought $250 million worth of stock late in our fourth quarter, into the first quarter, this past fiscal year. We did pay the special dividend in addition to our regular dividend in early December. We also have indicated that we are very, very interested in making acquisitions. And we are continuing to pursue, you know, a fairly active pipeline. Obviously nothing significant has happened at this point, or we would have announced it. So in view of the fact that we may not find the acquisitions that we would like to have, I think the Board has shown in past experience that we will certainly be active in purchasing our own stock if warranted.
Greg Bisbee - Barclays: Okay, very helpful. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Andy Whitman from R.W. Baird.
Andy Whitman - Robert W. Baird: Thanks. First, I wanted to give a very sincere congratulations to you, Bill, on a great career, and many successes, and Mike also. Big shoes to fill. Bill, I think we'll all miss your ability to put a dour outlook on the economy when your numbers are actually quite good. So that's what I'll miss the most about these calls.
Bill Gale: Well, thank you for the kind words, Andy.
Andy Whitman - Robert W. Baird: Yeah. But that being said, I have dovetail that into a question, because I think it's the question that everybody is going to be asking, when you look at the guidance range, it looks like there's a material deceleration in the growth rate that you're assuming, in EPS. The fuel benefit only gets better from the average levels that you saw in the second quarter, you alluded to that upside, you know, puts on the top line here. But is there something in the business here that you're seeing either somewhat offset on the cost side coming in or deceleration in some of the businesses that we should be aware of that leads us to the guidance range that you've given here?
Bill Gale: Well, I think as Mike mentioned in his comments, keep in mind, we've got the payroll tax reset, which is approximately an 80-basis-point impact in our third quarter. We also had a second quarter in which our experience in our workman's comp and auto claims was better than it had been in the previous couple of quarters. We tend to see a slight increase at our medical costs in the third quarter -- in our third quarter. So with that said, we see a little bit of headwinds there, you know, which will impact the SG&A line and thus would impact the overall margins. I think we've got to keep in perspective that the energy cost, try to put that when I responded to Greg at the first question, is not as significant as some may believe. Certainly we would benefit from continued low gas prices, but it's not as significant as I think some people think. Because our overall energy costs are 2.5% of revenue, of which the delivery side of it is approximately 1.5%. Now, so with that said, we still would like to see a broader employment growth. We have not seen any adds to speak of at existing customers. We have seen additional penetration of products and services at our customers, but we've yet to see really the uniform wears being added. Were that to happen, then we would certainly be at the upper end of the guidance, but based on our current view, we thought the guidance that we provided was appropriate.
Andy Whitman - Robert W. Baird: Got it. So just -- you mentioned efficiency, obviously the business model has got some leverage in it, but efficiency was a word that was mentioned a few times. Last we checked, the implementation of SAP to the uniform business, the Rental segment, you know, still kind of more in the future than present [ph]. Is there anything that structurally that's new and different or are we seeing other things like leverage, and frankly, price contribution adding more to the margin expansion we're seeing here? I think those are other key questions, then I'll leave it there.
Bill Gale: Andy, you're right, the last two things you hit on, leverage of the infrastructure and the price increases have certainly benefited margins. The SAP system is still in its early stages. We will not be piloting anything, at the earliest, until our fiscal 2016, and therefore there really won't be anything benefiting us probably until latter part of 2017 or 2018. So right now it's really one of just getting additional volume within our routes and through our plants. We mentioned previously that we will be constructing some new facilities in various markets. We're not moving as rapidly as we once thought, as we continue to look for the appropriate pieces of land. And therefore, that's one of the reason why you saw a reduction in the CapEx guidance, because we don't think we'll be moving as fast with those -- that new construction as we originally thought. So I would say that as long as we can continue to leverage what we've got, we'll continue to see margins at these levels, adjusted for the SG&A I talked about earlier.
Andy Whitman - Robert W. Baird: Would you -- on the pricing, would you say that pricing continues to get better sequentially here? Is it --
Bill Gale: You know, we're a little concerned, it's okay to the second quarter, but as we see these lower gasoline prices in the headlines, we're wondering, is that going to create some difficulty for the industry to continue to get the kind of pricing that we've been seeing lately. So I think there is a concern out there that, you know, we'll have to make sure we explain this properly when we continue to try to get price increases.
Andy Whitman - Robert W. Baird: All right. Thanks.
Operator: Our next question comes from Sara Gubins of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Sara Gubins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Hi, thanks. Good afternoon. Maybe just a follow-up on the discussion around pricing. Could you give us any sense of the magnitude of price increases that you're seeing?
Mike Hansen: No, Sara, we don't talk about those in any magnitude publicly. We just, as we said in the first quarter and a little bit today, we did see an improvement in the pricing environment in the last six months compared to a year ago.
Sara Gubins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Right. Okay. Last quarter when you talked about margin expectations, it sounded like you were thinking that they'd be flat in the absolute versus the first quarter. And then of course in the second quarter they were up quite nicely. I'm wondering what drove the surprise, if it was a surprise, but what drove the surprise in the quarter. And it may have been pricing and it may have been a little bit of energy, but I'm wondering if there was anything else.
Mike Hansen: Well, in the second quarter relative to the first, our overall gross margins were about the same, we got -- which was a very good level year over year, helped by nice -- the nice pricing environment, helped by leverage of our infrastructure, and the penetration of new products and services. The real sequential margin improvement was in that SG&A where Bill mentioned we had better workers' comp and auto experience in the second quarter. And the other thing we talked about in the first quarter was the extra G&A, if you will, because of the document shredding contribution, so we lost quite a bit of revenue to cover that extra G&A. And we've done a very good job of managing our cost structure and kind of rationalizing that G&A to the organization that we have today. And so we're pleased with the execution there.
Sara Gubins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Great. And then just last question, would it be possible to give any more color on what's driving the strong uniform rental growth? And I'm thinking new programs versus some market share shifts.
Bill Gale: I think a lot of it's driven by the strong execution of new business by our sales organization, so, new customer adds, primarily from the programmer side [ph]. Again approximately two-thirds of our new business is coming from customers who have not used the services before. But I think it also is driven by the additional products and services. As we've spoken about for the last several years, we continue to expand our offerings both within the Rental segment as well as within the First Aid and Safety segment, to provide additional things to our customers. And I think that has helped the growth rates in both those segments.
Sara Gubins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Dan Dolev from Jefferies.
Dan Dolev - Jefferies: Hey. Thanks for taking my question. Question on the gross profit in uniform rental. So if I look at the incremental margins in Q1, they were very strong, in the mid 70s. They decelerated a little bit in Q2. My question is, so it stopped the accelerating trend which started early last year. My question is, it seems like it should be accelerating given the cheaper energy prices. So what was -- what made it decelerate? And the second part of the question is, what kind of level do you think you can maintain throughout 2H? Thanks.
Mike Hansen: Well, Dan, in both quarters, our gross margin was very strong, and it's been that way for a number of quarters now, and we continue to get very healthy incremental gross margin in that business. And as long as we continue to penetrate and make our customers more valuable, as long as we can continue to grow without adding capacity, it should be healthy. And so, you know, overall that incremental margin was still very healthy.
Dan Dolev - Jefferies: Absolutely. But you see that not decelerating significantly below, so, call it the mid-60s to high-60s.
Mike Hansen: Well, I think, Dan, some of that depends on the mix of the revenue that comes. And we've talked a little bit about adding some capacity, rental processing capacity in a few markets in the future. And so it depends on the timing of that capacity addition and it depends a little bit on the mix of revenue that we get. If we see a marketable improvement in our customers' hiring, we may see even better incremental margin.
Dan Dolev - Jefferies: Great. Thank you, and congrats again for both of you for the promotion and for the retirement.
Bill Gale: Thank you, Dan.
Mike Hansen: Thanks, Dan.
Operator: Our next question comes from Joe Box from KeyBanc Capital Markets.
Joe Box - KeyBanc Capital Markets: Hey. Good evening guys.
Bill Gale: Hi, Joe.
Mike Hansen: Hi, Joe.
Joe Box - KeyBanc Capital Markets: So I just want to take the rate question from earlier, just take it from a different angle. When you guys are looking at rates and you're saying that rates are actually up, are you looking at core rental rates or are you maybe looking to say a yield number that might include ancillary fees like loss waiver, stuff like that? Just trying to understand what it is.
Mike Hansen: What do you mean by rates, Joe?
Joe Box - KeyBanc Capital Markets: Well, just maybe the core rate that you might charge a customer per day. When you're saying pricing is going up.
Mike Hansen: When we're talking about pricing, being a little bit of a better environment today than a year ago, what does that mean? Is that your question?
Joe Box - KeyBanc Capital Markets: Correct. Correct.
Mike Hansen: Yeah. Well, that -- generally that means when we are renewing some accounts, we're able to do it at a little bit of a better level. When we have -- our contracts generally have an annual price increase opportunity and that annual price increase opportunity can be a little bit easier. And it just comes back to our ability to speak to the value that we're providing to our customers. And we've been able to do a pretty good job of that in the last six months.
Joe Box - KeyBanc Capital Markets: That's good to hear, Mike. I just wasn't sure if that was, you know, you're maybe able to tack on some additional surcharges and that was able to raise the bill, and you're maybe considering that core pricing. But it doesn't sound like that's the case. And then -- maybe just switching gears then. I'm curious, from a high level, are you guys starting to see new business formation? Are you still seeing subtractions? Has that been a positive driver? Or is the organic growth really more of a function of ancillary products to existing customers at this point?
Bill Gale: Well, there's still no question, we're adding new customers, Joe. Is that indicative of the economy, adding new businesses? I don't think we really could say that for sure, because there are so many businesses that were out there that weren't using our services. So I don't think we could, you know, tell you that there's all these new business adds or whatever. I can just say, from our perspective, we're able to get more companies to take our services and we're getting more of our existing customers to take some of our other services. So I think those are the two primary reasons why you're seeing the growth.
Joe Box - KeyBanc Capital Markets: Understood. Just one last follow-up for you. Are the payroll taxes higher than they'd normally be in 3Q, so there'd actually be a year-over-year impact? Are you just pointing out the sequential change?
Bill Gale: Sequential change. We're just trying to make sure that everyone understands that. No, it's not a year-over-year thing, it's a sequential change.
Joe Box - KeyBanc Capital Markets: Okay. So I guess I'm really just trying to understand then why there wouldn't be better SG&A leverage in the back half of the year. And I certainly understand there are some minor things in there like auto claims and workers' comp.
Bill Gale: No, there's a lot of things in there. And I think what we're telling you is that we would not expect there to be a significant improvement in the overall SG&A number at this point. We think we've done a pretty good job given the fact we lost a lot of revenue from the document shredding and document storage transactions, and we're trying to get that revenue right-sized for the -- those costs, right-sized for the remaining revenue. I just -- I think that so many of you do you models and then you want to assume the same level of SG&A from the second quarter and the third quarter. So we're telling you that's not the case. What we're also telling you is that we would expect the rates that we saw in the second quarter adjusted for payroll taxes, adjusted for potential increases in workman's comp type cost, to basically be comparable for the rest of the year.
Joe Box - KeyBanc Capital Markets: Understood. Thanks guys, and great quarter.
Mike Hansen: Thanks, Joe.
Bill Gale: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Scott Schneeberger from Oppenheimer.
Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer: Thanks. Yeah, let me add guys, Bill and Mike, congratulations to both of you. So you covered it well earlier, but just curious if you could add, if you want to do so at this juncture, your oil and gas exposure as an end-market, just that part of the total mix. I know you mentioned that you didn't think it would be too material on a direct level, maybe on a broader level over time. But just curious on that. Thanks.
Bill Gale: Scott, it's in the low single digits. It's nothing of any significance. I don't have the exact number, but as you followed us for years, there's just no one industry that really impacts us all that much.
Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer: Great. Thanks. Appreciate that. And then curious on M&A pipeline, you addressed that a little bit earlier as well. Would appreciate if you could delve a little more into the types of things you're seeing. Obviously you have a lot of cash sitting over [ph] on the balance sheet right now, a lot of flexibility with things that you do. And I know that you're going to come across this as a dumb question, but is document management, which seems to have some M&A activity, completely out of the picture? Thanks.
Bill Gale: Yeah. Document management is completely out of the picture. We've disposed of the storage and imaging business and we still have our 42% share of the joint venture, but we will not be pursuing any document management transactions within Cintas any longer. We certainly are going to pursue acquisitions in our other businesses. And we will continue to do. There are some big ones, there are some small ones, and there are some good regional players. We also will continue to pursue other businesses that either will complement one of the segments we're already in or may perhaps even be another new segment, although historically we've never gone into a brand-new segment in any big way without testing it first. So I just wanted to be sure everyone understands that we are actively pursuing things within First Aid, Safety, Fire, as well as in the uniform side of the business, and we will continue to do so. But we will not make an acquisition that doesn't make sense economically just because prices may have become a little frothy.
Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer: Great. And good job and congratulations again.
Bill Gale: Thanks.
Mike Hansen: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Andrew Steinerman from JPMorgan.
Andrew Steinerman - JPMorgan: Good evening. I was wondering if, Bill, you meant to say, to get to the high end of the revenue guide, that we need add-stops to pick up. I know you said something similar to that. But is that what you meant?
Bill Gale: To get -- I really didn't address the revenue, Andrew. I was talking more about the profit side, because I think it was more of a margin question. To get at the high, you know, yes, if we -- I would know. I would tell you that the high end of the revenue guidance does not assume a significant improvement in add-stops. If it would assume a continued good pricing environment, a continued impact of good new business results, and the penetration that we've seen. If we were to see a lot of our customers really adding people and therefore increasing the revenue per stop in a significant way, we certainly would be able to get to that top end of the guidance plus some as we go forward.
Andrew Steinerman - JPMorgan: Yes. I'm still sort of curious about this add-stop and wondering if you think add-stops will increase this cycle, because when I look at the Labor Board's [ph] diffusion index, it's broadening out. And it's including categories that seemed extremely relevant for uniforms, like manufacturing and warehousing and transportation, but perhaps they're adding people in areas that are uniformed, or something along those lines that I was just wondering if you feel like, if this continues, that add-stops will go up?
Bill Gale: I certainly hope so, but I will tell you from our experience with our existing customers, we are not really seeing that type of activity. Now we're not seeing declines either.
Andrew Steinerman - JPMorgan: Right. Which category do you think needs to kick in more for add-stops to go higher?
Bill Gale: Which category, you mean like which…
Andrew Steinerman - JPMorgan: Manufacturing, transportation?
Bill Gale: Services, I think just generally services. That's the bulk of our customer base, are in the service sectors.
Andrew Steinerman - JPMorgan: Okay. Thank you very much.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our Q&A session. I'd like to turn the call back over to Mr. Bill Gale for closing remarks.
Bill Gale: Again I want to thank everyone for joining us this evening. And on behalf of all my fellow partners here at Cintas and our management team, we want to wish you a very happy holiday season. Mike will be back in March to give you our third quarter results.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference for today. We do appreciate your participation. Have a great day. Thank you.

===== 2015 Q1  (2014-09-29 17:00:00) =====
Executives:  Bill Gale - SVP of Finance and CFO Mike Hansen - VP and Treasurer 
Analysts: John Healy - Northcoast Research George Tong - Piper Jaffray Andy Whitman - Robert W. Baird Andrew Steinerman - JPMorgan Greg Halter - Great Lakes Review Dan Dolev - Jefferies  
Operator: Good day everyone and welcome to the Cintas Quarterly Earnings Results Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Bill Gale, Senior Vice President of Finance and Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead, sir.
Bill Gale: Thank you for joining us this evening. With me is Mike Hansen, Cintas’s Vice President and Treasurer. After our commentary we will be happy to answer questions. Let me remind you that the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a Safe Harbor from civil litigation for forward-looking statements. This conference call contains forward-looking statements that reflect the Company’s current views as to future events and financial performance. I refer you to the discussion on these points contained in our most recent filings with the SEC. We are pleased to report first quarter revenue of $1.102 billion. Organic revenue growth which adjusts for the impact of acquisitions and the Shred-it Transaction was 7.2% for the first quarter. This was a nice acceleration from the 6.2% organic growth in our fourth quarter ended May 31st, led by a rental organic growth of 8.1% and our first aid safety and fire protection services organic growth rate up 10.1%. Our sales force performance in both businesses was strong and the pricing environment in the first quarter improved from our previous quarter. We were a little disappointed with the negative 2.2% organic growth change in our uniform direct sale revenue as we have a third consecutive quarter of year-over-year revenue decline. While much of the declines in the last three quarters relates to large national account roll-outs occurring last year and not repeating this year, we have seen some softness in our Fortune 1000 national accounts as well. As we noted in today’s press release, our first quarter income statement was affected by a few items that are not representative of our ongoing operational performance. First, as we indicated in our July earnings call, we had a $13.6 million gain net of tax on the sale of stock in an equity method investment during this year’s first quarter. Second, our fiscal ‘15 first quarter income from continuing operations did not include any document management services operating segment results. Mike will provide more details about the accounting for document management and its impact on the first quarter and the remainder of this fiscal ‘15 year. Third, we recorded an additional $4.1 million gain, net of tax, during this year’s first quarter, due to receiving additional proceeds related to the Shred-it Transaction. We have identified these items separately in today’s press release, so I will speak to the results as adjusted for those items. Our first quarter gross margin was $477.9 million or $43.4% of first quarter revenue. As Scott Farmer said in today’s press release, the gross margin improved in each of our businesses. In fact, the first quarter’s gross margin of 43.4% was the highest as a percent of revenue since fiscal 2006. We continue to operate our businesses very efficiently and are taking advantage of existing capacity in our infrastructure. First quarter operating income was $163.5 million or 14.8% of first quarter revenue. We’re very pleased with this improvement over last fiscal year’s first quarter adjusted operating income as a percent of revenue of 13.4%. First quarter net income and earnings per diluted share as adjusted also improved nicely compared to last fiscal year’s first quarter amount as adjusted. First quarter net income as adjusted was $92.4 million, which was 8.4% of revenue and grew by almost 21% over last year’s first quarter. This fiscal year’s first quarter earnings per diluted share as adjusted was $0.78, which grew over 25% compared to last fiscal year’s first quarter figure as adjusted of $0.62. We are very pleased with the start to this fiscal year and thank our employees who we call partners for their hard work and dedication. I will turn the call over to Mike for more details on the first quarter performance and the impact of the Document Management Business. And then, I will provide a few comments on our updated fiscal 2015 guidance.
Mike Hansen: Thanks, Bill and good evening. I’ll start with a few comments on Document Management. We indicated in today’s press release that we have changed our accounting classification of the document storage and imaging business to discontinued operations. We’re evaluating strategic opportunities for this business, and we’ll provide more details as appropriate. The classification of this business as discontinued operations means under U.S. generally accepted accounted principles that we must condense all income statement impact from the business into one line on the income statement for all periods presented. As a result, we will no longer show any documents storage and imaging revenue, gross margin or operating income in either this year’s or last year’s income statement. Instead, the entire results in both years are condensed into one line item on the income statement, entitled income from discounted operations net of tax. Let’s switch to Document Shredding. Because we continue to have an ownership in the Document Shredding business through our partnership with Shred-it, U.S. GAAP says we really haven’t exited the business. As a result we will continue to include document shredding results in last fiscal year’s income statement; however, beginning with this first quarter of fiscal ‘15, we will no longer report any document shredding revenue, gross margin, or operating income. Instead, we will simply show our share of the partnership income in our corporate operating segment. During the first quarter of fiscal ’15, there was no impact from the partnership. From a modeling perspective, the end result of these changes in document management accounting means that we will have no document management operating segment results going forward. The easiest way to model the comparison of fiscal ‘15 results to last year will be to exclude the entire document management operating segment results from last year. So, as a result of the changes I just discussed, we now have three reportable operating segments. Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products, Uniform Direct Sales, and First Aid Safety and Fire Protection Services. Uniform Direct Sales and First Aid Safety and Fire Protection Services are combined and presented as other services on the face of our income statement. Before moving into the first quarter results, let me remind you that there were 65 workdays in this year’s first quarter which is the same as last year’s first quarter. Looking ahead to the remainder of fiscal ’15, we will have 65 workdays in each quarter for a total of 260 workdays for the fiscal year. These workday figures for fiscal ’15 are the exact same as in fiscal ‘14, so we will have no workday differences or adjustments for the remainder of this fiscal year. The Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products operating segment consists of the rental and servicing of uniforms, mats, towels and other related items. The segment also includes restroom supplies and other facility products and services. Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products revenue was $857 million, which is up 8.1% compared to last year’s first quarter. Organic growth was also 8.1%. Growth of roughly one-half of 1% was due to a contractual buyout caused by a change in government regulation that forced a customer to close one of its operations. As Bill mentioned the performance of our sales team continued to be strong and first quarter new business was better than last year. In addition, the pricing environment improved relative to the fourth quarter and last year’s first quarter. We still have not seen much impact from net add-stops which were down slightly compared to last year’s first quarter. Our Rental segment gross margin was 45.1% for the first quarter, an increase from 42.6% in last year’s first quarter. As bill mentioned, we’ve continued to leverage our infrastructure and are operating very efficiently. In addition, we continue to sell products and services that do not require additional processing capacity such as our hygiene products and services and our chemical dispensing services. Lastly the more favorable pricing environment help drive incremental margins as well. Our Uniform Direct Sales operating segment includes the direct sale of uniforms and other related products to national and regional customers. Uniforms and other related products are also sold to local customers, including products sold to rental customers through our direct sale catalog. Uniform Direct Sales revenue for the first quarter was $105 million, which was 2.2% lower than last year’s first quarter. As Bill indicated earlier, lower sales to our Fortune 1000 national accounts has been the driver of the revenue decline. Uniform Direct Sales gross margin was 29% for the first quarter, an improvement over last year’s first quarter gross margin of 27.7%, while our revenue was lower than last year’s first quarter. Our sales mix was more weighted towards our higher margin hospitality business. Our First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection Services operating segment includes revenue from the sale and servicing of first aid products, safety products and training and fire protection products. First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection revenue for the first quarter was $140 million, which is 11.3% higher than last year’s first quarter. Organic growth was 10.1%. This businesses sales team continued to perform well and our national account business continues to thrive. This segment’s gross margin was 43.7% in the first quarter which is fairly consistent with last year’s first quarter of 43.6%. Switching to selling and administrative expenses, total company SG&A was 28.5% as a percentage of revenue in the first quarter compared to a total company SG&A in last year’s first quarter of 28.8%. When excluding the impact of the document shredding had on last year’s first quarter SG&A and revenue, last year’s adjusted total company SG&A was 27.8% as a percentage of the adjusted revenue. The increase in SG&A as a percent of revenue from last year’s adjusted 27.8% to this year’s 28.5% is due to two items. First our worker’s comp and auto insurance related costs were higher in this year’s first quarter compared to last year. Second as we mentioned in our earnings call in July the contribution of the document shredding business to the Shred-it partnership leaves less revenue to cover our SG&A structure. Specifically certain corporate G&A expenses such as the operation of our corporate headquarters must now be allocated to our remaining three operating segments instead of the four operating segments that we had last year. We expect this headwind to continue for the remainder of this fiscal year. Our effective tax rate was 37.4% for the quarter, compared to 37.2% last year. The effective tax rate can fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter based on tax reserve bills and releases related to specific discrete items. We expect fiscal ‘15 effective rate to be 37.3%. Turning now to the balance sheet, as a result of the classification of the document storage and imaging business had discontinued operations. Our August 31st balance sheet now shows all assets associated with that business in one-line item entitled assets held for sale. The balance in this line item at August 31st was $151 million. There is also a line item entitled liabilities held for sale, which incorporates certain liabilities associated specifically to the documents storage and imaging business at August 31st. The balance in outline item at August 31st was $15 million. Our cash and cash equivalents were $581 million at August 31st, an increase of $68 million from the $513 million at May 31st, mainly due to strong operating cash flow. Accounts receivables decreased by $19 million since May 31st due to improved collection performance and the reclassification of documents, storage and imaging related AR to assets held for sales. New goods inventory and in service inventory levels at August 31st were $250 million and $514 million respectively. These balances are relatively consistent with the balances at May 31st. Accrued compensation and related liabilities at August 31st decreased by $41 million from the May 31st balance mainly due to the payment of fiscal year ‘14 bonuses and commissions. Long-term debt remained at $1.3 billion representing roughly 1.7 times EBITDA and finally CapEx for the first quarter was about $68 million. Our CapEx by operating segment was as follows. $61 million in Rental including roughly $25 million related to the SAP project, $2 million in Uniformed Direct Sales, and $5 million in First Aid Safety and Fire Protection. We expect CapEx for fiscal 2015 to be in the range of $275 million to $325 million. I will not turn the call back to Bill for comments on our updated fiscal 2015 guidance.
Bill Gale: Thank you, Mike. We’re updating our fiscal 2015 revenue guidance to be in the range of $4.4 billion to $4.475 billion. This revenue guidance has changed from our initial guidance provided in July to reflect the elimination of document storage and imaging revenue due to its classification as discontinued operations. This updated guidance also reflects our first quarter revenue performance and our thoughts on the U.S. economic environment for the remainder of our fiscal 2015 year. As Scott Farmer indicated in our press release earlier today, we believe the U.S. economy remains inconsistent and we believe recent global events increase the unpredictability of the environment. We are also updating our fiscal 2015 earnings per diluted share guidance to be in the range of $3.20 to $3.29. This guidance reflects a number of items. First we have eliminated the benefits from the documents storage and imaging business. Second, we have incorporated the additional $0.04 Shred-it Transaction gain. Third, this updated guidance continues to assume no benefit from the Shred-it partnership but does reflect the first quarter $0.11 gain on the sale of stock in an equity method investment which was also in the initial guidance provided in July. Lastly the updated guidance reflects the first quarter performance and also our thoughts on the U.S. economic environment. This concludes our prepared remarks and we will now be glad to answer your questions.
Operator:  Thank you. (Operator Instructions). And we’ll take our first question from John Healy with Northcoast Research.
John Healy - Northcoast Research:  Bill, I had this question come in to me. I just was hoping to get a little bit more color on the guidance. If I think about the moving parts, the $0.11 item was already in the guidance and you kind of called out the $0.04 gain. So if I back that out, the guidance looks like it’s moving up by about $0.10. How should we think about that $0.10 from a contribution standpoint in terms of how does your view on the economy change and the other item I thought that would be contributing to it would be, how do we think about the movements of document storage now that it’s in discontinued ops, if that’s a net positive or how that impacted the guidance?
Bill Gale: Well, the document storage and imaging business did have a minor contribution to our initial guidance, it was about $0.03. So, basically you are backing that out. I think you accounted for the $0.04 special gain in the first quarter due to the Shred-it Transaction, but you are correct that we are increasing guidance on the rental first aid business and our direct sale business basically. Primarily, as the result of the first quarter results, which were better than we originally expected, and while we expect the rest of the year to be good, we don’t expect it to be as robust as we saw in the first quarter. Again, it could be a bit conservative on our part, but there has been ongoing inconsistency in the jobs reports. We still are seeing a reluctance in the part of many of our customers to expand our operations, to add employees. As Mike indicated, there was very little, there was no help from add-stops in the quarter, basically it continues to be from new business and then again as he said, a better pricing environment. So, I guess in summary what we are saying is yes increased guidance from continuing operations but probably not at the same rate that you saw in the first quarter.
John Healy - Northcoast Research: And I wanted to ask, when I was taking the notes from your initial comments, it sounded like you guys were at the margin I would say talking positively about the pricing environment. I feel like it’s been a long time since I’ve heard anything like that on the Uniform Rental Costs. So I was hoping if you could talk to kind of what you are seeing on that side of things? Maybe what’s driving it? Is it a cost push in the business or is it more disciplined from industry competitors or just some more color that you are seeing there?
Bill Gale: Well I went back and looked at some of our releases last year and our calls. And I think we did indicate that pricing environment was beginning to improve even in fiscal ‘14. And I think what happened in this first quarter is we saw continued improvement. I think part of it is driven by probably a better education on our part for our service providers and sales people to go to our customers and explain that we’ve had the cost increases over the last several years and have not really been able to pass those on to the extent that we feel justified that we should be able to. So I don’t want to create a belief that we just have really skyrocketed prices, we haven’t, but we certainly have been able to get more of a price increase than we have since the end of the recession.
John Healy - Northcoast Research:  And then just final question from me on the discounted ops. Any thought in terms of when we might see that kind of realistically come to a close? Is it a quarter out or two quarters out, how should we think about that?
Bill Gale: John, I really can’t answer that question right now. There’s a lot of things going on. So it would be premature for me to speculate on a specific timeframe.
Operator:  And our next question comes from Manav Patnaik with Barclays.
Unidentified Analyst :  Hi this is actually Greg calling on for Manav. I was hoping you could talk maybe about the specific industry verticals. I know you said that the recovery has been inconsistent. But I was wondering if maybe you could talk to specific verticals that you’ve seen some strength in recently?
Mike Hansen: Well, as it relates to our performance Greg, it’s been relatively broad revenue growth for us. Our new business still comes from customers of all different types. We’ve been able to sell additional products and services into existing customers of all types. And so, I would say that it’s been a fairly broad revenue growth stream for us. As we look at the job performance, even in this first quarter as well as the entire calendar year, we’ve generally seen a bit of narrow employment improvement, and about a third coming -- about a third of the employment growth coming from some verticals that don’t help our businesses, particularly uniform rental much and that being professional services, fast-food service, temps, education. But having said that, we’ve been able to continue to sell to many different verticals both in new business and in penetrating with additional products and services.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay, fair enough. And then maybe on the M&A pipeline. How active has that been and do you expect to ramp-up post some of these document management transactions?
Bill Gale: Well, we’ve have been -- we’ve remained active Greg, in the M&A area throughout the last couple of years. And as I have indicated in the past, it’s not for lack of effort on our part, it’s for the appropriate valuation that we feel an acquisition would make sense for our shareholders. So, at this point, we are still very much wanting to do some big acquisitions, and we are continuing to work diligently for those. But there is nothing at this point that has come to fruition, primarily because of valuation expectations.
Operator: Next question comes from Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer.
Unidentified Analyst: This is Daniel again for Scott. Can you address some of the margin enhancing initiatives you are doing this year that can provide potential upside to your current outlook?
Bill Gale: Well, I think the first quarter was reflective of a lot of things we’ve already been able to implement. It’s greater utilization of our plans and our routes. It’s more selling of products and services that do not require the processing through our laundry facilities, things like chemical dispending and hygiene services et cetera. I think it also is just an attitude on the part of the company to continue to drive excess cloths out of the business and work toward improving the margins back to the levels that we had achieved prior to the recession. We had stable energy cost, so we didn’t have to deal with that this quarter. Better utilization of our stockrooms for our Uniform business. So, I think it’s just a number of different things. As far as looking out for the rest of the year, I think you as look at our guidance what we’re saying is we would probably anticipate maintaining margins at relatively the same levels that we achieved in the first quarter. As far as any significant upside potential, I doubt if that is really available. I’d say it’s more maintaining what we’ve achieved.
Operator: Next question comes from George Tong with Piper Jaffray. Please go head.
George Tong - Piper Jaffray: Good afternoon. Can you discuss how add/stop performance in the quarter compared versus your expectations and what your views are for add/stop performance next quarter?
Bill Gale: Well, we talked to last quarter that net add/stops were slightly better than the previous year. In this first quarter, they were slightly lower than last year. And so we really haven’t seen much of a trend. We’ve continued to kind of bump along with net add/stops. We haven’t seen any change in that performance or any discernable trends in September either. And so, we are expecting that we’ll just kind of continue to bump along relatively and consistently in net add/stops, and don’t anticipate that our customers will start hiring at any rapid pace anytime soon.
George Tong - Piper Jaffray: Got it. And your updated guidance does that incorporate improvements and add/stop performance?
Bill Gale: Not really. It pretty much just reflects kind of a status quo where we don’t really see any improvement over prior years in add/stops but we’ll continued new business, which is basically new customers and increased penetration of different products and services. And then hopefully a reasonable pricing environment continuing as we saw in the first quarter.
George Tong - Piper Jaffray: That’s very helpful. And as you look at margin performance, how would you segment out contribution from pricing versus greater route and planned utilization versus the say cost savings initiatives?
Bill Gale: I really don’t have a way of doing that very easily George and probably wouldn’t be able to disclose that even if I had it because of competitive things. But I would say all of them are contributing factors. And it’s, basically you’ve got all different sorts of initiatives going on from different levels of capital investments, from efficiencies. Obviously the pricing helps. So, it’s just very difficult for me to be able to split that kind of stuff out.
George Tong - Piper Jaffray: Got it. And last question, this is a longer-term strategic question. But with respect to margins, how do you think about the path to peak margins in terms of just how long it takes to get there and whether your success in pushing through pricing, whether that means you can break above prior peak margins?
Bill Gale: I am not sure I would commit to breaking above prior peak margins. I’d love to be able to get back to those margins in the future. And I think we’re making very good progress towards that regard. But keep in mind, the cost of doing business today is more than what it cost back in 2005 and ’06, we hit those margins. So, we are attempting to get back there, but to exceed it would be pretty difficult thing to do, I think.
Operator: We have Andy Whitman, Robert W. Baird.
Andy Whitman - Robert W. Baird: Hey, guys good afternoon. Bill, I don’t want to make two side of a point on it, but you made a comment that the margins that you put up here in the first quarter might kind of continue through the balance of the year. Are you referring to the year-over-year growth in margins on the operating line, which really the 140 basis points on the clean basis or you’re saying the absolute level or is that referenced to the gross margins? Maybe just a little, again not trying the two side of a point, but I want to understand what you meant by that.
Bill Gale: Well, sorry for the confusion Andy. What I was saying the absolute level of the margins should be relative, I would hope, would be relatively to close what we achieved in the first quarter.
Andy Whitman - Robert W. Baird: Okay, great. And then just on the revenue line you kind of gave us some help about the document storage business, in fact $0.03, you talked about. On the top line, what was your forecast for what that business can do? We were modeling somewhere around $80 million, maybe $90 million, is that about right?
Bill Gale: Absolutely right.
Andy Whitman - Robert W. Baird: So then really you do have a slight raise than on the revenue line, if you kind of adjust for that as well. Just a little bit, but a little bit of on the revenue line.
Bill Gale: You are correct.
Andy Whitman - Robert W. Baird: Okay. And then just as it relates to the government contract you highlighted, you said that half of percentage point Mike. Should we see that basically as kind of a one-time benefit? So, you can make the argument that the segment growth of 8.1, because really the 7.6, still very good but not quite 8.1?
Mike Hansen: That’s right Andy, but it’s not a government contract. It is a customer. It was a commercial customer who, because of a government regulation, was forced to close down some of their operations and therefore they bought out of their contract. So it was not to having to do with the government so we’ll get sure clarify that.
Andy Whitman - Robert W. Baird: No, that’s helpful. And then just as it relates to the asset for sale for the storage business, it’s on the balance sheet like you noted for 151. I guess when you move things to discontinued operations and assets for sale, you have to at least to evaluation test there. I guess I think is it true that you would, if it would have been less than the 150, you would have market-to-market that what you thought it was. So, can we assume that the 151 would be a minimum for what you get for it?
Mike Hansen: Well, you are absolutely right. We have an obligation to impair it if it were not going to get that value. So, this is all subjective. But our expectation is that those were fair values that are on the balance sheet.
Andy Whitman - Robert W. Baird: To call it asset for sale or to put in discontinued, do you need a letter of intent or something more formal or is it really just a subjective decision or just using this as maybe a way for investors to gauge where you might be along in that process?
Bill Gale: It’s a very complex set of analysis that one must go through, and we decided to be conservative. And basically classify it that way since we believe that within the next months we won’t necessarily be operating those as we are today, they’ll be part of a joint venture or they’ll be sold to another party.
Andy Whitman - Robert W. Baird: And then can you just afford maybe one last question, I wanted to ask about the ancillary services and the rental segment. And I’ve asked this one plenty of times before. But maybe Mike can you talk about the relative growth rates of the ancillary services versus what you consider core uniform rental? And maybe just as it relates to the longer-term trend, you’ve always talked about how the number of services that you can offer customer increases your retention. But how has that number of services and products that you’ve been offering tracked? Can you give us some sense about how that’s improved over the last couple of years, if it’s improved?
Mike Hansen: Okay, regarding your first question about the growth of the different products and services. We have seen very good growth in our uniform rental business, and we have seen growth in our ancillary products and services. So, the mat rental, the hygiene products and service, which is made-up of air fresheners and soaps and towel dispensers and the chemical dispensing. All are growing quite nicely. We won’t get into the specific level of growth on any of them, but they are all growing quite nicely. And we continue to improve the amounts of products and services at our existing customers. We still believe we have a long way and a long great opportunity continue adding those. But certainly they have gotten better, in terms of the penetration amounts, have gotten better in the last few years. That doesn’t give you any specific numbers. But we don’t really get into the specifics of any of those. But I can tell you that directionally we’re doing very well.
Operator: We’ll move to Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan.
Andrew Steinerman - JPMorgan: I just wanted to focus on the revenues guidance of 4.9% to 6.7%. I assume very little of that has acquisition, past acquisition, baked in to just like the first quarter had only 20 basis point differential. And so my question is assuming that point is right and we get over 7% growth in the first quarter, is there anything other than a conservative view on the economy that suggest more like a mid-single digit like a 5% growth for the balance of the year to kind of get into the 4.9% to 6.7% range with the same percent start?
Bill Gale: Your assumption first, and yes there is no real acquisition growth going forward other than what you just saw.
Mike Hansen: And Andrew, I would say that is a pretty good summation of our view for the rest of the year, and that’s what reflected in the guidance. Yes, again, we are being somewhat conservative, driven by enlarge by what we continue to see this inconsistency, and then all the different activity going around the world that seems to impact people’s thinking on business. So, obviously, if we can achieve similar results in the rest of the year that we saw in the first quarter, we’ll be at the upper end if not exceed that guidance. So obviously, if it goes the other way, we’ll be down the lower-end.
Andrew Steinerman - JPMorgan: And could you just mention how much storage -- document storage revenues were in the previous guide, I mean what was taken out of the guide and put into discontinued ops for 2015?
Bill Gale: Maybe for $85 million, last year’s storage revenue was $82 million. And so it’s roughly that same amount.
Operator: We’ll move to Greg Halter with Great Lakes Review.
Greg Halter - Great Lakes Review: Based on the cash flow statement, there appears to be about 61.4 million in the repurchase of common stock. I just was curious as to the timing of that and the number of shares.
Mike Hansen: Well, 700 and some thousand shares were the result of the share purchase program that we reported to you in July. That was kind of the combination of the 4.2 million shares we bought beginning in our fourth quarter. Then the remainder of that was due to the fact when we have restricted stock that that’s with our partners. There is a tax obligation as a considered ordinary income. And so what we do is we basically sell enough of a share that they invest and to pay for the payroll taxes.
Greg Halter - Great Lakes Review: Okay, so there really wasn’t anything new in this fiscal quarter?
Mike Hansen: No.
Greg Halter - Great Lakes Review: Okay and probably 10 years ago I was in one year plans for Investor Day or something like that, and there was great discussion and potential around RFID. And just wonder if anything has occurred in that regard in terms of making that a viable solution in some of the plans?
Mike Hansen: It really has not. We continue to experiment with it, but it has not really proven to be beneficial yet. And we are certainly trying it but it’s nothing we’ve been able to rollout.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) And we next move to Dan Dolev with Jefferies.
Dan Dolev - Jefferies: Just really a macro question, Bill, I am just thinking about your comments today and compare them to your comments the last, maybe quarter or two. Am I misreading it or you incrementally more bearish on the U.S. economy or is it just over-interpreting you analysis or is it everything the same really?
Bill Gale: I think it’s the same. I don’t think my view, our view I shouldn’t say it’s my view, our views have really changed from the way we felt the last couple of quarters. We were obviously pleased with the first quarter results, better than what we initially expected. But has that given us confidence that that will continue, not yet. And we’d love to be able to continue to surprise everybody on the upside, but I just not confident enough to give you that comfort.
Dan Dolev - Jefferies: No, that’s help. I thought I sense something, but I guess I was over interpreting. I appreciate it.
Mike Hansen: Thank you all very much for joining us and being interested in the results. And at this point, we would expect to issue our second quarter results some time before the Christmas holiday in mid to late December. So, until then, thank you again.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today’s conference. We do thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Have a great rest of your day.

Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Cintas Quarterly Earnings Results Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Bill Gale, Senior Vice President of Finance and Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead, sir.
Bill Gale : Thank you. Thank you for joining us this evening. With me is Mike Hansen, Cintas' Vice President and Treasurer. We will discuss our fiscal 2014 fourth quarter results, which include the effects of the April 30th closing of the partnership transaction with Shred-it International. In addition, we will provide our initial guidance for fiscal 2015. After our commentary, we will be happy to answer questions. The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a safe harbor from civil litigation for forward-looking statements. This conference call contains forward-looking statements that reflect the company's current views as to future events and financial performance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results differ materially from those we may discuss. I refer you to the discussion on these points contained in our most recent filings with the SEC.  We are pleased to report fourth quarter revenue of $1.157 billion. Keep in mind that this total does not include any shredding revenue for the month of May due to the closing of the shredding transaction on April 30th. Excluding document shredding revenue, our fourth quarter revenue grew 4.7% over last year’s fourth quarter. Last year’s fourth quarter had one more work day than this year. When adjusting for the impact of the difference in workdays, revenue, excluding document shredding grew 6.3% and it grew organically by 6.1%. As Scott Farmer stated in our press release, after a difficult winter, we were pleased to see our growth rate improve in both our rental and First Aid, Safety and Fire segments. Excluding document shredding related amounts, our fourth quarter operating income was $165.4 million, which was 15% of revenue. This represents an 80 basis point improvement over last year’s fourth quarter operating margin for the same businesses. Our rental operating margin improved 140 basis points over last year’s fourth quarter operating margin despite having one less work day. We continue to see improvements in both plant and route efficiency as we add more volume.  Fourth quarter net income was $127.2 million and earnings per diluted share were $1.03. However, excluding the effects of the shredding transaction, our net income was $94.3 million and earnings per diluted share were $0.76. These fourth quarter results bring to a close a very successful fiscal year for Cintas. Our Rental segment and First Aid, Safety and Fire segment in particular had record years. Our Rental segment achieved record annual revenue of $3.2 billion and it topped $500 million in operating income for the first time, finishing at $507 million. The rental operating income of $507 million was 15.7% of revenue, which was an 80 basis point improvement over last year’s operating margin of 14.9%. Our First Aid, Safety and Fire segment revenue for the year was a record annual level of $514 million topping $500 million for the first time. Operating income was also a record $49 million, thanks to our employees who we call partners for a great year. I will now turn the call over to Mike for more details of the fourth quarter and the effects of the shredding transaction and then I will provide a few comments on our fiscal 2015 guidance.
Mike Hansen: Thanks Bill and good evening. I will start with a reminder on workdays. There were 65 workdays in this year’s fourth quarter versus 66 workdays in last year’s fourth quarter. Looking ahead to fiscal ‘15, we will have 65 workdays in each quarter for a total of 260 workdays for the fiscal year. These workday figures for fiscal ‘15 are the exact same as in fiscal ’14. So we will have no workday differences or adjustments for the next four quarters. We have four reportable operating segments; Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products, Uniform Direct Sales, First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection Services and Document Management Services. Uniform Direct Sales, First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection Services and Document Management Services are combined and presented as other services on the face of our income statement. The Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products’ operating segment consists of the rental and servicing of uniforms, mats, towels and other related items. The segment also includes restroom supplies and other facility products and services. Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products revenue was $825 million, which is up 5.1% compared to last year’s fourth quarter. However taking into account the one less workday this year, revenue grew 6.7% over last year. Organic growth was also 6.7%. The Canadian dollar, relative to the U.S. dollar remained weaker than last year during our fourth quarter and it negatively impacted our rental growth rate by 0.6 percentage points. Adjusting for this impact, rental organic growth would have been 7.3%. As it has done for the last several years, new business continues to be the main driver of revenue growth. Net [add/stops] [ph] were negative for the quarter which is typical for our fourth quarter due to seasonal changes, but were slightly better than last year’s fourth quarter. Within the rental segment revenue and based on fourth quarter performance, Uniform Rental accounted for 52% of the total; dust control, which is mainly entrance mats accounted for 19%; hygiene and other services which is restroom supply, cleaning services and chemical services was 16%; shop towel revenue was 5%, and linen and other, which is mainly non-person specific garments such as aprons and butcher coats was 8%. Our Rental segment gross margin was 43.6% for the fourth quarter, an increase from 42.1% in last year’s fourth quarter, which had one additional workday than this year’s fourth quarter. Our incremental gross margin has remained strong as we have been able to increase revenue without adding additional processing capacity. Our route efficiency continues to improve as well since adding route capacity in mid fiscal ‘13. Our Uniform Direct Sales operating segment includes the direct sale of uniforms and other related products to national and regional customers. Uniforms and other related products are also sold to local customers, including products sold to rental customers through our direct sale catalog. Uniform Direct Sales revenue for the fourth quarter was $118.5 million, which was 5% lower than last year’s fourth quarter. Last year’s fourth quarter included large national account roll outs which did not repeat this year. The fourth quarter revenue of $118.5 million was higher than this year’s third quarter revenue of $107.7 million. Uniform Direct Sales gross margin was 30% for the quarter, down from last year’s fourth quarter gross margin of 30.8%, mainly due to the lower volumes this year. Our First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection Services operating segment includes revenue from the sale and servicing of first aid products, safety products and training and fire protection products. First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection revenue for the fourth quarter was $137.2 million. When adjusting for the workday differential, this revenue level represents an increase of 11.1% over last year’s fourth quarter revenue. Organic growth was 10.2%. We have seen good adoption by our customers of our new First Aid and Safety Products and Services and our First Aid national account sales have been strong. This segment’s gross margin was 44.6% in the fourth quarter, compared to 43.5% in last year’s fourth quarter. Energy-related costs were consistent with last year. The gross margin improvement was due in part to improved mix, for example, higher training sales on the First Aid side and good leveraging of our infrastructure. Let’s move to a discussion of Document Management Services. This segment has included document destruction or shredding and document storage and imaging services. We provided the document storage and imaging services revenue and operating income for the fourth quarter in today’s press release. We were pleased with the business’ performance. Fourth quarter revenue was $23.1 million and growth over the last year exceeded 20%. Organic growth was 15.4%. Our European business has had good momentum during the fiscal year and it continued during our fourth quarter. Our Document Shredding revenue for the fourth quarter was $53.7 million. This amount reflects only March and April revenue. Beginning with the months of May and into the future, we will no longer include Shredding revenue in our reported revenue since we are accounting for the partnership investment under the equity method of accounting. The closing of the Shred-it transaction resulted in the recognition of a gain due to the fair value of our share of the Shred-it partnership being greater than the book value of our investment in the business. Keep in mind that the book value of our investment was recorded throughout our balance sheet, including accounts receivable, property and equipment, goodwill, service contracts, and other assets offset by certain liabilities contributed to the partnership. The net effect of this transaction in the fourth quarter was $32.9 million in net income and $0.27 to EPS. The investment in Shred-it partnership is recorded within the balance sheet line item entitled investments. Going forward, we will record our 42% share of the partnership income within our SG&A line on the income statement. We continue to be excited about the partnership with Shred-it. As we discussed on our call in March, we believe the combination of our Document Shredding business with Shred-it will create opportunities for synergies that will benefit our customers, our shredding employees and our shareholders. Having said that, in order to realize the synergies, the partnership will incur costs to transition IT platforms, to convert the operations and the trucks to the Shred-it name, to consolidate certain administrative functions et cetera. We expect the bulk of these transition expenses to be incurred in our fiscal ’15 year. As a result, we do not expect the partnership to contribute any income to Cintas in fiscal 2015. Instead, we expect to begin realizing synergies and income in our fiscal year 2016. Switching to selling and administrative expenses, SG&A was 28.2% as a percentage of revenue in the fourth quarter, which was up from last year’s fourth quarter figure of 27.8%, due to a number of different items including workers comp claims experience, legal and professional expenses, and slight higher bad debt expense. The fourth quarter SG&A of 28.2% was lower than the third quarter percentage of 29.1%. Payroll taxes reset our third quarter and we generally see a reduction from the third to the fourth quarter as a percent of revenue. Medical expenses were also slightly lower than the third quarter. Our effective tax rate was 40.5% for the quarter compared to 37.4% last year. This year’s fourth quarter rate included a number of discrete items related to the Shred-it transaction. Excluding the effects of the transaction, the fourth quarter effective rate was roughly 37.1%. We expect the fiscal ’15 effective rate to be 37.3%. Turning now to the balance sheet, our cash and marketable securities were about $513 million at May 31, an increase of $159 million from the $354 million at February 28, mainly due to strong operating cash flow. Although we received $180 million of cash on April 30, at the closing of the Shred-it transaction, we used $206 million during the quarter for the share buyback program. As I mentioned a few minutes ago, our investment in the shredding business was reflected in the balance sheet in a number of different items. When comparing our May 31st balance sheet to the February 28th balance sheet, you will notice decreases to accounts receivable, property and equipment, goodwill, service contracts and other assets due to the contribution of the shredding assets to the partnership. These balances have been replaced within an investment balance of roughly $340 million that is combined with other investments in the balance sheet line items entitled investments. Long-term debt remained at $1.3 billion, representing roughly 1.6 times fiscal 2014 EBITDA. Net cash provided by operating activities for the fourth quarter was about $222 million, a $38 million improvement over last year’s fourth quarter. And finally CapEx for the fourth quarter was about $32 million. Our CapEx by operating segment was as follows: $23 million in rental, less than $1 million in Uniform Direct Sales, $4 million in First Aid, Safety and Fire protection, and $4 million in document management. We expect CapEx for fiscal 2015 to be in the range of $275 million to $325 million. This range is higher than the last few years because we expect to embark on the SAP implementation for our rental business and expect to add some rental processing capacity during the year. I will now turn the call back to Bill for comments on our fiscal 2015 guidance.
Bill Gale: Thanks Mike. Our fiscal 2015 guidance is for revenue to be in the range of $4.425 billion to $4.525 billion and earnings per diluted share to be in the range $3.06 to $3.15. Let me provide some color to this guidance. We have explained that we will not include document shredding revenue in our fiscal 2015 reported revenue. However due to accounting requirements we still need to include the document shredding revenue in our fiscal 2014 reported revenue. This means reported growth rate will look artificially low. In our press release though we provided the table that shows fiscal 2014 base revenue without document shredding of $4.276 billion. This fiscal 2014 base revenue provides a better comparison to fiscal 2015 guidance. As Scott Farmer indicated in our press release today, while the U.S. employment picture has improved this calendar year, it is a relatively narrow improvement. One third quarter of the new jobs this year are in areas not typically strong in uniform rental, foodservice, professional services, temporary workers in education. We set our revenue guidance with this employment narrowness and the largely inconsistent U.S. economic performance in mind.  From an EPS perspective as we reported today, our EPS for fiscal 2014 was $3.05. This figure included the net impact of the Shred-it transaction of $0.26. It also included a $0.04 benefit net of tax from the operating income of the document shredding business in fiscal 2014. As Mike just mentioned though, we do not expect any benefit in fiscal 2015 from the shredding partnership. When excluding these two amounts, our fiscal 2014 EPS would have been $2.75 and we believe this provides a better comparison to our fiscal 2015 expected results. Our fiscal 2015 EPS guidance does include and $0.11 benefit from the sale of stock of an equity method investment that occurred a few weeks ago on June 30th. It also includes the $0.09 benefit from the share buybacks that occurred between April and June of this year. The EPS guidance does not assume any additional share buybacks for the remainder of fiscal year ’15. As I just indicated a few minutes ago, we remain unconvinced that the U.S. economy will become consistent. In addition, as a result of the contribution of our document shredding business to the Shred-it partnership, we have less revenue that contributes to covering our SG&A structure. We will continue to control cost as we have always done but we also need to grow back into some of our SG&A infrastructure. We set our EPS guidance with those items in mind. That concludes our prepared remarks and we will now be glad to answer your questions.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) And we will take our first question from Sara Gubins with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. 
Sara Gubins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch:  Could you tell us some more about the rental capacity that you are adding for the year? I think you’d talked before about adding some more processing capacity?
Bill Gale: Yes, Sara, and we did speak about this in a few other calls, and it was initially our expectation that we would have added some of this capacity in fiscal ’14, but we did not. What we are adding basically is processing capacity in the form of new facilities, especially because of rapid growth that we’ve had in certain markets and some of those plants will be relatively expensive. For example, we will be adding a new plant in the New York Metro area and as anybody who lives in New York knows, land up there and construction cost et cetera are relatively expensive. So we have several plants that we will be adding. Some of them will come online maybe toward the latter part of this year. Others will not come online until next year, but they will -- a lot of that capital will be spent in fiscal ’15.
Sara Gubins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: And then if you could give an update on add/stops and pricing trends?
Mike Hansen: As I had mentioned a little earlier, add/stops were negative for the quarter, which is not unusual given changes being made due to the change in weather, a little bit better than last year, but I would say not -- we’re not seeing much impact from the employment which seems to be a good headline but as Bill mentioned, it’s fairly narrow. So net add/stops, little bit better than last year, negative for the quarter. Pricing seems to be a little bit better. I would say it’s driven within our new business but generally we saw a little bit better pricing environment this quarter than maybe a year ago.
Sara Gubins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch:  And then just last question, you mentioned the SAP implementation for the rental business. Could you tell us some more about that and whether or not there are any concerns that that might be disruptive during the year? Thank you.
Bill Gale: Well, I don’t think it will be disruptive. Let me answer that, because we will do it in phases and the first phase is what they call a blueprint or it’s a design phase and it really doesn’t have any impact on our operations at all but we have to dedicate a lot of resources and capital toward the implementation of this project and the design to determine what we need to do with the software and how they implement it. So we will get through that and then assuming that that is successful, which we expect it to be, then we will start into some more of the detailed programming requirements, data development et cetera that will be needed to run the system. This will be a multi-year implementation. We would not start actually impacting our locations or our customers for some time and hopefully we will be well prepared to handle that. I can assure you we are very careful on these type of projects. But I think it’s important for all of our investors and analysts to understand that any Company that does embark upon these type of projects, it is a large expenditure, it takes a lot of time and effort to put it in and yet when it is successful and we certainly think at this point it will be, it will provide benefits into the future. And they don’t come right away but they certainly provide opportunities to more efficiently run our business, handle our customers’ needs et cetera. 
Mike Hansen: And the good news is we have just recently, as you have heard us say on prior calls, we have recently finished the roll-out of our First Aid, Safety and Fire business onto the SAP platform.
Operator:  And we will take our next question from Hamzah Mazari with Credit Suisse.
Hamzah Mazari - Credit Suisse: Could you give us an update on customer penetration specifically? How many of your customers subscribe to more than one service or several services and has that number changed over the last few quarters? How should we think about where you are in that process?
Bill Gale: Hamzah, I would say we have made some minimal progress in that arena, certainly not to the extent we expect to have. One of the problems that we have with doing that is the multiple types of computer systems we are on. So that’s one of the reasons why we are willing to invest in the SAP system across the entire portfolio of businesses. So, yes we certainly do continue to see some additional penetration but nothing to the extent that we ultimately expect it to be.
Hamzah Mazari - Credit Suisse:  And then maybe just your commentary around growing into your SG&A infrastructure. Do you need cyclical growth for that or how do we think about your comments there and SG&A trends going forward?
Bill Gale: Well, I think what we need is revenue growth that we certainly expect to have in order to replace roughly $300 million of revenue that we no longer have from the shredding business, now that it’s part of the joint venture. So you can think about it in this way. You’ve got certain fixed costs that really don’t go away when you basically don’t have that revenue to cover that anymore. For example, we still have an audit fee that costs just as much now as it did when we had document shredding. We still have certain G&A functions that you just can’t cut out parts of because you no longer have the shredding business. So this goes through the entire organization and while we certainly have reduced staff in certain areas where there is the ability to have a variable level of expenditures associated with revenue, there’s a lot of areas where that just won’t take place. So, our expectation is that during the course of the next year, we will essentially grow into that SG&A level and then once we reach fiscal ‘16, not only will we have covered that, the reduction in the shredding revenue, but we expect to start seeing some contribution on the bottom-line from the Shred-it joint venture.
Operator:  And we will take our next question from Joe Box with KeyBanc Capital Markets.
Joe Box - KeyBanc Capital Markets:  I think it’s been a while since you guys have actually added some plant capacity. So can you maybe just kind of walk us through the process of how that works? Do you typically operate two separate plants or do you wait for a lease to expire and then you consolidate the two?
Bill Gale: Well, what we’re talking about, Joe is primarily the building of an additional plant in markets where we already have plants. So we are not replacing a plant. We’re actually adding a plant. The last time I think we opened a new rental plant was back in fiscal 2008 and then of course we have the great recession and therefore we actually closed a few of our facilities, especially those that had been acquired through an acquisition. So the prior, and by the way we generally own our plants Joe. It’s not a leased facility. We lease our branches or some of our First Aid and Safety operations, but our rental plant because of the extent of the infrastructure within that plant for water treatment, sortations, et cetera, we generally own those facilities. But the idea is, is that we grow so much in a market that we are forced to build another plant to handle the additional volume, and that’s the case here, that we basically have exhausted our ability to squeeze much more out of the existing plants we have and therefore we have to add another one.  
Joe Box - KeyBanc Capital Markets: Understood, I get that you guys are already in the market and you’ve run out of capacity there and you have to build a new one. I guess ultimately what I’m trying to understand is how we should think about the margin headwinds from adding an additional plant? 
Bill Gale: It depends on, it’s so variable depending upon the cost of what that plant will take and then how many other plants are in that market and as you move volume around you know, generally you’ll start the new plant with a said amount of volume, certainly not your capacity but you’ll also have released some of the capacity constraints in some of the other plants. So Dan, I can’t really answer your question because it’s going to be different if it’s in a New York area versus a Cincinnati, Ohio area. 
Joe Box - KeyBanc Capital Markets: Okay, that’s fine and I can certainly circle up to you guys offline on some other questions but one other quick follow up. I know you guys don’t provide guidance by segment, but can you maybe give us a feel for how we should be thinking about rental margins in FY’15? Clearly a strong finish to the year. And are you assuming a lot more leverage to the plant in the first half then maybe when some of these plants start to come online we could be thinking about a little bit less leverage? Any cadence would be helpful. 
Bill Gale: I would say our expectations are that margins, barring any significant cost change which we don’t anticipate should be as good as they were this year but I think you make a good point. They’ll probably be a bit stronger in the first half of the year than the second half of the year depending on how this additional capacity comes online. But when you look at it in total for the year, our expectation is we’ll be good as if not slightly better than this year. 
Operator: And we’ll hear next with George Tong with Piper Jaffray. 
George Tong - Piper Jaffray: Going back to add/stops, can you give some color on how add/stops are trending so far in the first fiscal quarter and whether directionally we’re seeing continued improvement? 
Bill Gale: You know George, we’re so early that I would say we haven’t seen much of a change from the fourth quarter. 
George Tong - Piper Jaffray: And touching on your comment earlier of the need to grow back into SG&A infrastructure, have you made all the necessary variable cost reductions you need or do you see opportunity for additional cost cuts in fiscal ’15? 
Bill Gale: I’d say that there was -- some of it has lapsed into ’15 because you just continue -- the transaction took place on April 30th. So there’ll be a little bit of cost reduction as we move into early ’15 but it won’t be substantial. 
George Tong - Piper Jaffray: And then lastly, could you share some commentary on how do you expect Shred-it to contribute to Cintas beyond fiscal 2015, reflecting any synergies to growth in margins you’re expecting from the JV? 
Bill Gale: Well, we certainly expect synergies. We’re not prepared at this time to quantify them. I think there’s a lot of work being done on the part of the two organizations that have come together. They certainly are optimistic of being able to achieve more than what the two companies were doing separately, when you add them together. So I think as we get closer to ’16, FY’16, we’ll have clarity and we’ll certainly be able to provide that when we give guidance for FY’16 a year from now. 
Operator: We’ll hear next from Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer. 
Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer : I’m curious, with SAP, you mentioned its multiyear and obviously a big step up in CapEx. I know you’re probably not in a position to give guidance beyond fiscal ’15. But directionally do you think that might come back in ’16 or you think this is going to be a multiyear elevation? 
Bill Gale: You talking about the CapEx expenditures? 
Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer : Yes. 
Bill Gale: I would say the first two years are going to be relatively capital intensive and then they will -- it should fall dramatically after that. 
Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer : And any OpEx impact from the implementation? 
Bill Gale: I hope not too much. If our experience is similar to what we saw with First Aid, we see a little tick up during the conversion of the operations and shortly thereafter in some of the SG&A or in the G&A expenditures and then over time the benefits start being realized. So it’s, again it’s too early to really tell. We don’t know to the extent of how it’s really going to impact the day-to-day operation itself and until we get through the design phase and start some of the pilot implementations, it’s hard for us to be able to predict that. All we know is that right now, at least going into this, we feel very positive that this is a good use of capital in that the long term return will be very beneficial to the Company.
Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer : And kind of on a similar vein, now with this partnership with Shred-it closed, what are the M&A thoughts with regard to the core Cintas business? And just kind of a derivative of that, do you see any further involvement? I’m assuming this is no but any further involvement with infusions to the JV -- is that something that’s been discussed?
Bill Gale: We would not expect any infusions into the JV. So we believe that they will be able to generate sufficient cash on their own in order to continue to grow and do what they need to do. With regards to Cintas core business, yes, we are very interested in making acquisitions as long as they achieve the financial and strategic objectives that we’ve set out. And that includes acquisitions within the Uniform business, the Facility Services business, First Aid, Fire and potentially some new businesses. So we’ve got an active corporate development group. We’ve got a lot of cash and a great amount of debt capacity and we are certainly going to look for opportunities to grow the Company.
Operator: And we’ll hear next from Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan.
Andrew Steinerman - JPMorgan: I wanted to ask about rental gross margin and the effect of merchandised amortization in end of quarter, and are we at a point where we have to infuse more garments into service that might weigh on gross margins going forward?
Bill Gale: During the quarter Andrew we did not see any change in the trend. So I would say we’ve not hit a point where we need to infuse garments. We still have stock rooms that have a lot of capacity, that have a lot of uniforms in them. And we’re using them very efficiently. So I would say I wouldn’t expect to see a significant change in the injection rate.
Andrew Steinerman - JPMorgan: Good. And would you expect rental gross margins to be up for fiscal 2015?
Bill Gale: Well, as I mentioned earlier to a question Andrew, we would expect there to be a slight improvement in that. It will most likely happen early in the year and then is dependent on the time of when the additional capacity comes online. It may come down a bit. But overall for the year they should be up versus fiscal ’14.
Andrew Steinerman - JPMorgan: Right. Bill, I was actually little confused by the comment before. So when you said margins should be up for fiscal 2015, you meant total operating margins or did you mean just rental?
Bill Gale: I’m talking specifically about rental because that was what the question was posed.
Andrew Steinerman - JPMorgan: Sure. So, could you just comment, in the guidance what’s implied in total operating margin for fiscal ’15?
Bill Gale: We don’t break it down like that Andrew but if you look at the growth rates in the top line, they’re a little less that the growth rates in EPS and therefore I would tell you that there has got to be a little bit of margin expansion. 
Operator: We’ll take our next question from Nate Brochmann with William Blair & Company.
Nate Brochmann - William Blair: Just wanted to talk a little bit, you guys have done a really outstanding job of going after and getting some new business from non-programmers as well as kind of penetration with some additional services throughout the organization. Could you talk about like the ability to kind of keep that churning? Obviously I know the market is pretty big out there in terms of the potential, but in terms of whether than has been over the last couple of years, some like low hanging fruit and opportunities or whether it’s something that you’ve done differently, I know that we’ve injected a few more sales people here give or take a year ago to get after that. Could you just talk about in terms of the pipeline and the opportunity in terms of how to keep that going?
Bill Gale: I think it’s very similar. Our expectation, it will continue that way for the next several years. We still have a very large sales force. Our mix of new business continues to be more heavily weighted toward the no-programmer side versus the programmer side. Therefore, we continue to see the market self-expanding. We are looking always for new products to help attract other types of no-programmers and we’ve had several of those things roll out in the last year or two. So right now I would say I feel very good about our ability to continue to sell a lot of new business with the bulk of it coming from no-programmers.
Nate Brochmann - William Blair: And Bill do you think, and I know this might be hard to answer, so I kind of get it. But do you think that anything has changed fundamentally in terms of the percentage of non-programmers that are converting over to a uniform program or is it that’s there is just more overall businesses out there to go after? So maybe not necessarily the percentage of programmers versus not has changed or do think that the -- that the share of the pie is increasing in terms of the conversion?
Bill Gale: I think the share of the pie is increasing because there are more products that we have that enable us to go after certain types of businesses that maybe in the past we never would have gone after.
Nate Brochmann - William Blair: Okay. So, I think that’s an interesting point in terms of why it might be a little bit better that it was in the past in terms of the conversion rate?
Bill Gale: The conversion rate, though I just want to make sure, the conversion rate has not changed that dramatically since I’ve been with the Company other than during the recession. So I just think that we’ve gotten a lot bigger. We’re $3.2 billion now in the rental division and yet I still think we feel like there is just tremendous opportunities out there, because in the past maybe there was a limited number of businesses that we would have gone after, but now given our wide spectrum of different types of garments, different type of facility services products and services, there is more types of businesses we can go for.
Nate Brochmann - William Blair: Okay, that makes sense. And then specifically within the Fire and Safety opportunity, are you guys pretty much everywhere you want to be at this point. And is further growth at this point just continue to build off of the locations you have and scaling that in terms of continue to increase profitability there or are there more locations and more sales people to go in terms of relative investment?
Bill Gale: There are -- certainly within the Fire business, we are not nearly to the point of being everywhere we want to be. So there are many, many, cities that we believe we still need a presence in and we would like to make acquisitions and to get into city. Short of that we certainly feel that if it’s important enough we will start Greenfield in those cities. Therefore, I would say the geographic expansion is primarily within the fire business. As far as the uniform rental and the first aid businesses, we’re by and large in most of the largest metropolitan areas, but that doesn’t mean there’s not acquisition opportunity. So tuck-ins are opportunities and relatively profitable and therefore we will continue to go after those too.
Operator: We’ll take our next question from Justin Hauke with Robert W. Baird.
Justin Hauke - Robert W. Baird: Yes. So what’s the rationale for running the joint venture income through SG&A as opposed to just adding a separate equity income contribution? I’m just, I’m trying to understand, are we going to be able to have any visibility into performance of the joint venture from here?
Bill Gale: Justin for the first year as we’ve said, we don’t expect any contribution from it anyway. So it’s going to be so small that it’s really not worth reporting out into a separate line. Starting in fiscal ’16, if we feel like the contribution is something that is significant, we’ll pull it out and put it into a separate line.
Justin Hauke - Robert W. Baird: Okay. But for right now we should just basically think it as like a negative offset to your SG&A?
Bill Gale: Well, you should think of it for fiscal ‘15 as kind of a zero.
Justin Hauke - Robert W. Baird: Right. But going forward in ‘16 in terms of thinking about it?
Bill Gale: Yes.
Justin Hauke - Robert W. Baird: Okay. Just one clarification. On the guidance, I know you said that ‘15 includes the $0.09 contribution from share repurchases in the fourth quarter and so far in the first. And then there was $0.11 benefit as well, that you mentioned. What was that?
Bill Gale: That was a gain on the sale of an equity investment that we had, that was closed on June 30th.
Justin Hauke - Robert W. Baird: So if you net those two out – I’m just trying to reconcile that with your comments that you’re expecting margins to be up next year. Because if you kind of take both of those out, it looks like the EPS and the revenue growth are about the same?
Bill Gale: It depends what base you start at Justin, but, again Mike tried to -- we tried to share with you that you got to back out of fiscal ‘14 some things like the shredding contribution et cetera and all the transaction costs. But then you take that and you take out the -- go to the top end of the guidance knock out the two items, the share buyback impact and the investment gain, I think you’ll find that there will be a larger increase in EPS than there would be in the top end of the revenue guidance.
Justin Hauke - Robert W. Baird: I guess my last one is just on healthcare, I know that was a concern for ’14 and it sounded like your healthcare expense on a dollar basis is actually lower year-over-year in the fourth quarter. Is there any additional healthcare impact that we should be assuming in ‘15 or is that the -- the impact’s mostly gone through at this point and it’s more or less a flat assumption going forward?
Bill Gale: First off, our medical expenses were about the same year-over-year. So I don’t know where you might have gotten less then. Regarding our expectations, who knows? I really – I’m having difficulty predicting it, because the rules keep changing. There is just too many uncertainties. So right now, I think we’re surprised that it did not go up more dramatically in ‘14 versus the prior year. Next year I would say if I were a betting man, I would think it would go a up a little bit, but I hope it won’t be more than a little bit, because again until we get clarification from the healthcare providers and from the government, it’s hard to predict. 
Operator: And we will take our next question from Dan Dolev with Jefferies.
Dan Dolev - Jefferies: When I look at your guidance, your top-line guidance this year, excluding shredding, so 3.5% to 5.8%, I would say it’s like 1 point lighter than similar guidance that was given in July of last year through this year. Where is the slower growth coming from? Is it shredding or is there someone else, something else?
Bill Gale: Well, shredding was certainly a big contributor. Even though it wasn’t -- it was like less than 10% of the revenue, it still was a rapid grower. But to answer the guidance, Mike and I anticipated that there would be some questions on this. And I think it’s important for everyone to understand that first off, there is a lot of inconsistency in this job growth and the economy and therefore we are trying to take that into consideration. We don’t foresee there being any big catalyst to really getting things going. And I would tell you that we tend to be conservative, especially at the beginning of a fiscal year. I would rather make sure that the expectations -- that we can meet expectations. So we tend to be on the conservative side. Therefore I hope that as we go through the year, if we see growth better than what we are currently giving you in the guidance, we will certainly adjust the guidance upward as we go through the year.
Dan Dolev -Jefferies: Thanks. And is that conservatism also reflected in your commentary about not expecting any EPS benefit from shredding this year. 
Bill Gale: That one is a real tough one to say. They’ve got a lot of things they have to go through and changing an IP platform and rebranding the trucks and everything else. I think it’s too early for me to say that that’s conservative or not. I would say right now, I think our expectation of no contribution is maybe realistic. 
Operator: And we’ll take our next question with Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel Nicolaus.
Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel Nicolaus: I just have a few housekeeping type questions in general. The SG&A from the shredding that you said to expect as zero. That’s from a total year perspective though, right? I mean if there is going to be a lot of investments to go after the synergies, I would expect that at least for part of the year that you would have some -- to the extent that there is some losses, that might be reflected and you guys have called that out for us, is that the right way to think of it?
Bill Gale: Yes, I think if we saw -- so for example, we may see because of the timing of some of these transitional expenses, we may see some ups and downs from quarter-to-quarter and we would likely point those out to you, yes.
Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel Nicolaus:  Okay. And then the SAP system, I know you guys went through -- in the fiscal year ‘10 timeframe there was a roll out of SAP and you guys had built up some inventory in advance of that. What was that for and how many other parts of the business are there left to roll this system out to?
Bill Gale: We started the SAP -- the first thing we did were our financial systems and that was done several years ago. That was back in probably the ’09 timeframe. Very successful and that was phase one. Phase two was we took our global supply chain, essentially the manufacturing, the ordering of garments and other products, we put that on SAP. That’s where the buildup of inventory was, in anticipation of converting the vet system and we didn’t want any disruption. Then we embarked upon the SAP implementation at our First Aid and Safety and Document Shredding operations, and that just concluded just at the end of this past fiscal year. So now we are moving forward into the rental business and then yet to be done would be the Direct Sale business and the Fire business.
Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel Nicolaus: Okay, great. And then in terms of the document storage, that’s such a tiny part of that business. Does it make sense to think about that as an ongoing business for you guys?
Bill Gale: At this time, yes. As we mentioned in March, we are evaluating strategic options for that business. We had a very nice fourth quarter. We are very encouraged by the growth rate. But we will continue to evaluate alternatives and if and when we should decide to something differently other than to continue to operate them, we will certainly let everyone know. 
Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel Nicolaus: Are they concentrated in particular geographies for?
Bill Gale: Primarily, they are located in the Midwest and in the UK and in the Benelux countries.
Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel Nicolaus: Okay. And then internally, how are you evaluating -- how are you valuing the Shred-it transaction? In other words what you contributed in there? And the reason I’m asking that question is it seems like the transaction cost of $26.3 million is like -- at least versus the investment, it seems like you paid a fee of 7.2%. That sounds like an IPO fee unless you valued the transaction much higher than net investment?
Bill Gale: Mike you want to take him through a little details there?
Mike Hansen: Sure. Shlomo, we did not use any investment banking firm to do this. Instead the transaction costs that you refer to, a large portion of it relates to the stock compensation expense because we early vested stock options and restricted shares for those employees who move from Cintas to the joint venture. We also had some costs, certainly some legal and professional costs related to public accounting, firms looking at the tax side of things and looking at the valuation for our accounting purposes. We had some IT contracts that had to be canceled that were specifically related to the Document Shredding business. So those are the kind of costs that were incurred as part of the shredding transaction itself.
Operator: We’ll take our next question from Sean Kim with RBC Capital Markets.
Sean Kim - RBC Capital Markets: I guess sort of looking back at fiscal ’14, I think your results for the full year came in probably at the high-end or ahead of what your initial guidance would have suggested a year ago. So I guess, what do you think drove the better performance? Because it seems like if we think about what your comments about add/stop trends during the year, it doesn’t seem like much has changed. So I was just wondering what do you think drove the better performances here?
Bill Gale: I think Sean, it was really an excellent execution on the part of our Rental business and our First Aid and Safety business. They were able to squeeze more capacity out of existing operations. They did very well on new business. As Mike mentioned, we saw a little bit of an uptick in the pricing environment, which helped. And I think that was really the reason that we surpassed our initial feel of guidance on both the revenue side and EPS side.
Sean Kim - RBC Capital Markets: Okay. And in terms of share repurchases, assuming no major M&A activity, do you think it’s safe for us to assume a similar level of stock repurchases that you done over the past couple of years?
Bill Gale: Sean, that's hard to say because I would tell you that we want to make acquisitions, but obviously if we don’t then we would anticipate that we would use that cash to purchase our own stock. I would not model it that way. I would hope that we would be able to make some acquisitions, but again you know and I know that you just can’t predict when that will happen.
Operator: It appears there are no further questions at this time. Mr. Gale and Mr. Hansen; I’d like to turn the conference back to you for any additional or closing remarks.
Bill Gale: I would just like to thank everyone for joining us this evening. It was a very complicated quarter, but you all are pretty smart people because you all pretty much figured it out. And therefore we appreciate your support. We will anticipate providing our first quarter update sometime in the latter part of September. So thank you again. Have a good rest of the summer.
Operator: And this does conclude today’s Cintas quarterly earnings results conference call. We thank you again for your participation.

===== 2014 Q3  (2014-03-19 17:00:00) =====

Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Cintas Quarterly Earnings Results Conference Call. Today’s conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Bill Gale, Senior Vice President of Finance and Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead, sir.
Bill Gale - Senior Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer: Good evening and thank you for joining us. With me is Mike Hansen, Cintas’ Vice President and Treasurer. We will discuss our fiscal 2014 third quarter results. In addition, we will discuss this morning’s press release in which we announced an agreement o combine our Document Shredding business with Shred-it International. After our commentary, we will be happy to answer questions. The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a Safe Harbor from civil litigation for forward-looking statements. This conference call contains forward-looking statements that reflect the company’s current views as to future events and financial performance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those we may discuss. I refer you to the discussion on these points contained in our most recent filings with the SEC. We are pleased to report third quarter revenue of $1.130 billion, which represents growth of 5.1% from last year’s third quarter. Our third quarter had one more workday than last year. Adjusting for this workday difference, revenue increased by 3.5% over last year’s third quarter. Organic growth, which adjusts for the impact of acquisitions and workday differences, was 3.1%. Let me provide some color on our organic growth figure. First, we experienced a weaker Canadian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacting organic growth by 0.5 percentage points the. Second, we had a difficult year-over-year comparison due to our Uniform Direct Sales operating segment having the largest uniform program rollout in the company’s history during last year’s third and fourth quarters. This adversely impacted this year’s organic growth by 1.7 percentage points. Finally, revenue in this year’s third quarter was impacted by the severe winter weather experienced by the majority of the United States. There were numerous days, in which our operations or our customers or both were closed as a result of the severe condition. Due to the nature of our businesses, the effects were greatest on our first aid, safety and fire protection services and document management services operating segment. Our operating income for the third quarter was $150 million or 13.3% of revenue. This operating margin was 90 basis points higher than last year’s third quarter operating margin, up 12.4%. Much of this improvement was the result of a very strong performance by our rental uniforms and ancillary products operating segment. Also the additional workday in this year’s third quarter had a positive impact on operating margin due to the number of our large expenses, including rental material cost, depreciation and amortization being determined on a monthly basis instead of a workday basis. Third quarter net income was $84.6 million and earnings per diluted share were $0.69, a 15% increase over the EPS of $0.60 in last year’s third quarter. As Scott Farmer stated in our press release, despite the many headwinds this quarter, we grew earnings at a double-digit rate. We are pleased with our results for the quarter and fiscal year-to-date and we complement our employees who we call partners. We especially recognize the hard work and dedication of our route-based operations and partners who were challenged by this winter severe conditions. Earlier today, the company announced an agreement with the shareholders of Shred-it International Incorporated to combine Cintas’ Document Shredding business with Shred-it’s Document Shredding business. Under the agreement, Cintas and Shred-it will each contribute its Document Shredding business to a newly formed partnership that will be owned 42% by Cintas and 58% by the shareholders of Shred-it. The combined entity will operate under the Shred-it brand and is expected to have annual revenue in excess of $600 million. In addition to its 42% ownership of the partnership, Cintas will receive approximately $180 million in cash at the closing of the transaction, which is expected to occur before May 31, 2014. Following closing the new company will be led by Vince DePalma, current Chief Executive Officer of Shred-it, who will become CEO of the new venture and Karen Carnahan, current President and Chief Operating Officer of the Cintas’ Document Management Division, who will become COO of the new venture. The partnership will allow the Document Shredding businesses of both companies to leverage the combined scale and create synergies in a way to generate more profitable growth for shareholders, additional opportunities for employees and better service to customers. Such synergies include one IT platform taking advantage of the enhanced revenue and lower cost of plant-based shredding facilities versus on-site shredding and improve route efficiency and density. We also see this transaction as in the best interest of our shareholders due to the opportunity to enhance value as noted above but also due to the nature of the shredding business. The volatility of the paper price we receive for the shredded paper creates an unpredictable variable in performance that is not present in our other segments. Additionally while we’ve found many opportunities to extend service offerings in our other segments the same does not exist in the Document Destruction business. Based on our third quarter results and our view of the U.S. economic climate we’re updating our fiscal 2014 guidance with revenue in the range of $4.550 billion to $4.575 billion and earning per share in the range of $2.75 to $2.79. This guidance assumes no deterioration in the U.S. economy, does not consider any future share buybacks, and excludes any impact of the transaction with Shred-it described previously. Now I’d like to turn the call over to Mike for more details on the third quarter.
Mike Hansen - Vice President and Treasurer: Thank you, Bill. As Bill mentioned total revenue increased 5.1% from the third quarter of last year with total company organic growth being 3.1%. Total company gross margin for the third quarter was 42.4% which is an improvement from last year’s third quarter gross margin of 41.1%. I’ll discuss these items in more detail by segments Before doing so let me remind you that there were 65 workdays in our third quarter versus 64 workdays in the same quarter of last year. Our fourth quarter will also have 65 workdays whereas last year’s fourth quarter had 66 workdays, so we’ll have one less workday in the fourth quarter. For the full fiscal year we will have 260 workdays which is one less than last year’s total. We have four affordable operating segments, Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products, Uniform Direct Sales; First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection Services, and Document Management Services. Uniform Direct Sales, First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection Services and Document Management Services are combined and presented as other services on the phase of the income statement. The Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products operating segment consists of the rental and servicing of uniforms, mats, towels and other related items. This segment also includes restroom supplies and other facility products and services. Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products revenue accounted for 71% of company revenue in the third quarter and totaled $801.7 million which was up 7.1% compared to last year’s third quarter. Organic growth was 5.4%. The weaker Canadian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar impacted our rental segment growth by 0.6 percentage points. We continue to be pleased with the amount of new business generated by our sales representatives. Our rentals segment gross margin was 43.9% for the third quarter, an increase from 41.9% in last year’s third quarter which had one less workday than this year’s third quarter. We continue to see improved leveraging of our fixed costs. We’ve been able to increase revenue without adding additional processing capacity. Also as we have discussed on previous calls we began to increase our route capacity in last year’s second quarter and we’ve now lapped that initial investment. The efficiency of these routes has improved and has helped to increase rentals gross margin. The rental segment’s third quarter gross margin of 33.9% was also an improvement from the 42.9% in the second quarter. Energy-related costs were about 30 basis points higher than the second quarter, but improved route efficiency and fixed cost leverage were more than enough to offset the impact and drive margin improvement. Our Uniform Direct Sales operating segment includes the direct sale of uniforms and other related products to national and regional customers. Uniforms and other related products are also sold to local customers, including products sold to rental customers through our direct sale catalog. Uniform Direct Sales revenue accounted for 10% of company revenue in the third quarter and totaled $107.7 million. In comparison to the prior year quarter, revenue was 14.6% lower. The nature of this business is that the revenue can be quite choppy based on the timing of large national account program rollouts. As we have discussed on previous calls, we had several very large national account rollouts during the second half of last fiscal year, which will not repeat this year. This prior year activity included the largest customer rollout in company history in the third quarter of last year. Uniform Direct Sales gross margin was 27.5% for the third quarter, down from last year’s third quarter gross margin of 29.2%. The prior year third quarter margin benefited significantly from the revenue from our largest customer rollout ever. Our first aid, safety and fire protection services operating segment includes revenue from the sale and servicing of first aid products, safety products and training and fire protection products. First aid, safety and fire protection revenue which accounted for 11% of company revenue in the third quarter was $126.7 million. This represents an increase of 12.3% over last year’s third quarter revenue. Organic growth was 9.2%. The severe winter weather’s impact on this segment’s growth rate was 1.3 percentage points. The segment’s gross margin was 43.5% in the third quarter compared to 44% in last year’s third quarter. The severe weather negatively impacted margin. Also the margin fluctuates from time-to-time depending upon the mix of products and services provided. The gross margin of 43.5% is slightly better than the second quarter gross margin of 43.4%. Our Document Management Services operating segment includes document destruction, storage and imaging services and it accounted for 8% of third quarter total company revenue. Document destruction or shredding comprised about 80% of segment revenue for both the third quarter and fiscal year-to-date and about 70% of segment operating income. Please note that we allocate all of our corporate overhead to each segment. At this time, we are not able to quantify the amount of the overhead currently allocated to the document management operating segment that will need to be absorbed by the other operating segments after the closing of the transaction with Shred-it. We will provide more clarity in July when we provide fiscal year 2015 guidance. A gain or loss on the transaction will be recognized in the period in which the transaction is closed, which we expect to occur in our fourth quarter of fiscal 2014. Going forward, our investment in the partnership will be recorded under the equity method of accounting and we will record our share of the partnership’s net income or loss into our earnings. Switching to selling and administrative expenses, SG&A was 29.1% as a percentage of revenue in the third quarter, which was up from last year’s third quarter figure of 28.7%. The change was due to a number of relatively minor items, including payroll tax increases imposed by various states, slightly higher bad debt expense and professional and legal fees related to the document destruction transaction previously mentioned. In the second quarter of this fiscal year, SG&A was 28.3%. The increase in the third quarter is due to the resetting of payroll taxes at the beginning of the calendar year. Our effective tax rate was 36.8% for the quarter compared to 36.1% last year. Last year, our third quarter effective tax rate reflected the favorable impact of a change to certain tax regulations. We had no similar items in this year’s third quarter. We expect the effective tax rate for the full fiscal 2014 year to be 37.3%. Turning now to the balance sheet, our cash and marketable securities were about $354 million at February 28, an increase of $41 million from the $313 million at November 30, despite the $93 million dividend paid within the third quarter. Accounts receivable increased about $9 million since November 30. DSOs were 41 compared to 40 in last year’s third quarter. Total inventory, including new goods inventory and in-service inventory at about $755 million at February 28 was relatively consistent with amounts at November 30. Accrued liabilities at February 28 decreased from the November 30 balance primarily due to the payment in December of our annual dividend. Long-term debt was $1.3 billion comparable to the amount at November 30 And net cash provided by operating activities for the third quarter was about $386 million, an $18 million improvement over last year’s third quarter. CapEx for the third quarter was about $37 million. Our CapEx by operating segment was as follows: $25 million in rental, less than $1 million in Uniform Direct Sales, $3 million in first aid, safety and fire protection, and $8 million in document management. We expect CapEx for fiscal 2014 to be in the range of $150 million to $180 million. This concludes our prepared remarks and we will now be glad to answer any of your questions.
Operator: Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Hamzah Mazari from Credit Suisse.
Hamzah Mazari - Credit Suisse: Good afternoon. Thank you. Just a question on the proceeds out of the JV of the document shredding business, I realize you want less exposure to OCC and ONP, but could you give us a sense of what you plan to do with the proceeds? And then also as you look to sell the imaging and storage business, what do you expect out of proceeds for that, maybe uncertain, but just give us a sense do you buyback more stock here? Do you reinvest in the business?
Bill Gale: Well, Hamzah I would say, first off the transaction has not closed. So it’s premature to discuss what we are going to do with the proceeds. Secondly, the board will certainly evaluate the utilization of the proceeds in the best way possible, but it’s really no different than what our current position has always been and that we will utilize our cash to grow our businesses by investing in those businesses with capital expenditures as appropriate. We will certainly look for good acquisitions. We are open to acquisitions in any of our businesses if they make economic sense and we have demonstrated that we certainly will be willing to repurchase stock if warranted. I will remind everyone that we purchased over 3 million shares of stock at the beginning of this fiscal year. With regard to your comment on the storage and imaging business, we have not made any decision yet on whether we are going to sell that business or not. We said that, that business will continue to be operated as Cintas’ businesses. We will look at opportunities for value creation, but nothing has been decided at this point.
Hamzah Mazari - Credit Suisse: Okay, thank you. And then maybe if you could give us a sense of how to think about the incremental margins you are currently generating, you mentioned better fixed cost absorption. Just give us a sense of where incremental margins are and where they could go given the current pricing environment, the additions on route capacity and just what you are hearing from your customers?
Bill Gale: Well, I would say we have – I think we have done an outstanding job with our margins in a difficult economic environment over the course of the last couple of years. Again, we are creating much of our growth through new business, which is more costly, but I think with the utilization of our assets, our facilities, our routes have really paid dividends and you have seen the improved margins in the businesses quarter-over-quarter especially within the rental segment and the first aid and safety and fire segments. So where can margins go? Certainly we think that they can continue to improve. We would love to have some opportunity to get some of that from pricing, but pricing remains very competitive as it has been for several years. And so what we’re doing is just making sure we’re running our operations as efficiently as possible utilizing our assets appropriately and we’ve seen some benefits from that.
Hamzah Mazari - Credit Suisse: Okay.
Mike Hansen: Keeping in mind Hamzah at the beginning of the year we signaled that there maybe a need for some additional processing capacity and that we’re still evaluating that but that may occur more than likely not this fiscal year but maybe in for the next fiscal year. And so they’re probably will come a time in the near future when some additional capacity is needed.
Hamzah Mazari - Credit Suisse: Got it. That’s very helpful. I appreciate it and I’ll turn it over. Thanks.
Operator: We’ll now go to Sara Gubins from Bank of America.
Sara Gubins - Bank of America: Hi, thanks. Good afternoon. Could you give us an update on the trends that you saw in the quarter in add-stops?
Bill Gale: Add-stops we’re still positive in the quarter, Sara but they were less so than they were in the first and second quarter of this fiscal year or even in comparison to the third quarter last year. However, I will remind everyone that those of you who monitor the jobs reports will also note that jobs added in this most recent quarter were less than they were in the first half of our fiscal year as well as in the third quarter of last year. So we would have anticipated more add-stops if the employment level had increased and yet that did not happen.
Sara Gubins - Bank of America: It makes sense. Could you give us an update on trends in different verticals within rentals particularly manufacturing but I’d be interested to get your broader comments as well?
Bill Gale: What we’re seeing is of course what we’re seeing is stable workforces among our customers and we’ve been seeing that for sometime, we’ve talked about it. Growth is coming from pretty much our traditional type of rental customers. I would say there is no one segment that really stands out. You mentioned manufacturing, well manufacturing is a segment, a part of the growth, but it’s really the service business that we continue to see which has the bulk of our wares and we continue to see opportunities for new customers in that particular vertical. So I don’t think anything really sticks out at this time, it’s generally just we’re selling more business to customers either no programmers or currently with other competitors that we really follow our traditional type of uniform ware.
Sara Gubins - Bank of America: Okay, great. And then just last question. It looks like there wasn’t any share purchasing in the quarter although I know you did quite a bit in the first half, any comments on that and how you are thinking about it for the rest of the year?
Bill Gale: Well I think yes keep in mind we bought 3 million share over 3 million shares in the first part of the year but we also were in the midst of this transaction which precluded our ability to be as active in the market as we might have been able to have the transaction not been occurring.
Sara Gubins - Bank of America: Thank you.
Operator: We’ll now go to Shlomo Rosenbaum from Stifel.
Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel: Hi, thank you very much for taking my questions. Hey Bill, who dictated or what dictated the equity split over there? Why would you guys not want to own that business? I understand there is some volatility but just based on the leverage that is possible from a bigger business and also the capacity utilization from your off-site shredding plus the fact that at some point in time the paper prices are going to come back. I would think that the contribution right now is at a point in time in the cycle that it’s probably not necessarily as good of a price as you could have valued the whole equity at in a few years?
Bill Gale: Shlomo it really comes down to what’s being contributed by both sides to this venture. So the fact of the matter is that Shred-it is contributing more revenue and more EBITDA than we’re at this point given the relative size of the destruction businesses. We think by retaining our ownership in this thing we see a very good opportunity for value creation by the combination of these two very strong organizations. And we think it is a very appropriate time to do this and we’re very pleased with the establishment of the relationship with Shred-it and the fact that we’re not a majority owner, it does not bother us given our confidence in the combined management teams and businesses of the two companies.
Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel: Just to be clear I think it’s a good deal, I was just hoping you would have done more equity on that deal based on where we are in the thing. I understand you’re saying based on the EBITDA and revenue contribution that’s what you came out with. So, why the $180 million payment, can you give us an insight into that?
Bill Gale: That’s primarily driven by the fact that we’re not contributing any debt to the operation, whereas the partnership is going to actually leverage themselves up with debt and in order to maintain the appropriate equity split we received cash at closing as a result of that transaction.
Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel: Okay, I understand. And then do you have any kind of estimate in terms of the weather impact to the overall business in general? Is there some way to quantify that or it just seems to me and when I’m going with this is the Uniform Rentals business I thought did particularly well despite the weather issues. So I’m just trying to figure out how well it really did underline?
Bill Gale: Well I think the Uniform Rental business was able to overcome some of the weather issues because many of our locations we have four day – four days route weeks. So in other words our operations have an extra day if needed to makeup when they have these types of conditions they have to operate in, whereas if you look at our other businesses we don’t have that extra, that flexibility and being able to overcome the loss of revenue on days when operations were required to be shutdown or customers were shutdown. So I think that was one of the main reasons. As far as quantifying it it’s difficult because we looked at it in a number of different ways and I think Mike mentioned it in his comments in the First Aid Safety segment we calculate that we probably have an impact to our growth rate of about 1.5%. I would say we probably saw a similar if not little greater impact in the Document Management business and the Uniform Direct Sale business is very hard to predict. We know we had lower revenue from our catalog business which is sold by our route drivers due to the fact that they’re focusing making sure that could deliver and pickup the rental products and services and probably did not have as much time to spend with their customers and trying to sell products out of the catalog. The Uniform Direct Sale business much of our – that businesses in the hospitality sector and obviously they experienced some issues associated with the weather, that mean they slowed down some of their buying, I can’t say that for sure, I suspect that might be part of the case. But certainly weather did have an impact but with all that said I really think our people did a great job I mean we – I thought the results were very well, very good for given those conditions and so I feel very good about it.
Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel: And just one more just to clarify, the accounting on the JV, you guys are going to take the profitability of that business on to the P&L below the operating line? Is that how that’s going to work?
Bill Gale: Yes, that’s correct, Shlomo. So just to reiterate what Mike said basically after the transaction is completed there will be the recognition on a quarterly basis of our 42% share of the net income or loss of that JV, of that partnership. Now that partnership’s net income is going to be impacted in the first 12 to 18 months by some one-time cost as they’re attempting to gain the synergies that are going to be very good for this venture. And then we’ll see the benefit of those synergies as – coming forward as we move through the relationship. Obviously the leverage that will exist on that partnership will also be reflected in their net income, the interest expense. So we’ll be picking that part up in that recognition of the investment in the partnership. But it will be separately reported within the income statement and as you – you know and just for everybody else’s benefits, we will not be consolidating any of their revenue, it will be strictly an investment line.
Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel: Right. So in terms of the way you’re going to look at the business, you’re going to – looking at the business absent this investment basically go on a go forward basis, that’s what it sounds like after the sale?
Bill Gale: I am sorry I don’t understand your question.
Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel: In other words, on an EPS basis when you guys go ahead and give it, you are going to be talking about the operations of the business that you are actually controlling as opposed to this JV?
Bill Gale: There will be an EPS impact from this investment. It will fall into our net income and therefore be part of our EPS.
Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel: And you are going to give us guidance based on that as well, you are going to give us guidance next year?
Bill Gale: Well, we are going to give you to the extent we can Shlomo. You got to understand there is a business plan that’s being, going to be developed. We may not have all of the ability to really predict exactly what’s going to happen in the first year or so, but we will give you guidance to the best of our ability in July when we provide our first look at fiscal ‘15.
Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel: Okay, thank you very much.
Operator: Our next question comes from Justin Hauke from Robert Baird.
Justin Hauke - Robert Baird: Yes, good evening guys. I guess one more question on the transaction. Can you talk about what have any impact on the capital intensity of that business? And I guess the reason why I ask that is you are talking about doing more offsite shredding as opposed to onsite and our understanding has been that, that over the long run that’s less capital intensive, you need less trucks? And I guess the second part of the question would be just in terms of your M&A strategy, the document management has really represented the lion’s share of where you have been focused over the last few years and so now that this is part of the joint venture, I am just wondering is there still the same level of transaction capital that’s needed within that venture from you?
Bill Gale: The new partnership will fund its own capital requirements. So, we will not be injecting any capital to that partnership or we don’t anticipate injecting any capital in that partnership to continue to fund their growth. We still are running and operating storage and imaging businesses although that as Mike said, that’s only 20% of that segment. And I have some capital needs although they tend to be more stair step type needs as you fill up a facility then you have to purchase another facility and build the racking appropriately for that. So I would say that the capital expenditures will be lessened by the result of us not funding the document shredding business. On the other hand, as Mike said, we are going to have some capital expenditures needed over the course of next few years for production capacity in our rental business. We also are continuing on our implementation of an ERP system and that will consume some capital needs over the next year and the year after as we start moving into some of our other bigger businesses to put into SAP.
Justin Hauke - Robert Baird: Okay, that’s helpful. And I guess just are you going to continue to at least in the Qs where you have the consolidated contribution of the venture? I mean, are we going to have any more insight other than just the equity income contribution that comes to you, in other words…
Bill Gale: That is yet to be determined, Justin. There is a lot of very complex accounting rules and disclosure rules and we don’t have enough details yet to know exactly what we are going to be required to disclose or not.
Justin Hauke - Robert Baird: Okay. And then just the last one just a clarity, so there was no divestiture of any control of your operations to Shred-it. So in other words, I think you said the $180 million cash infusion was just to balance the capital structure of the two ventures coming together as opposed to you divesting any part of it as their direct ownership?
Mike Hansen: Right. You keep in mind the $180 million is coming to us and secondly we owning 42% of the new partnership, we will not have control of that partnership. It will be a minority interest.
Justin Hauke - Robert Baird: Okay, that’s helpful. Thank you very much.
Operator: Our next question will come from Nate Brochmann from William Blair.
Nate Brochmann - William Blair: Good evening gentlemen.
Bill Gale: Hello.
Mike Hansen: Hi, Nate.
Nate Brochmann - William Blair: Hey, why didn’t you talk a little bit in terms of just the overall pricing environment, obviously I know that everything kind of remains competitive, but it feels like it’s pretty rationale and stable right now. I was just wondering if you could talk about the pricing environment both in terms of kind of winning new business as well as some of the existing retention stuff?
Bill Gale: Well, Nate, I’d say it’s never rationale enough for us. We’d always like more. But with that said, I don’t think it’s improved a lot, but it certainly has been deteriorated. Our ability to win new business was still pretty good and retaining business, our loss business is very, very good and has been so for the last year or so, but it’s still tough. And I would say we are not able to get the kind of prices we like to have, because we have got some very good competitors out there who continue to price aggressively and we have to be able to meet them in the marketplace.
Nate Brochmann - William Blair: And are you seeing that more in terms of where you are running up against potential new accounts? Are you seeing that more on the retention side?
Bill Gale: When you say more, I think it’s not as bad as it was back in ‘09 and ‘10, but I’d say it’s been pretty steady. We are seeing at both places when a competitor knows that our contract with the customer is up, they are in there wanting that business just like we are in their customers when their contracts are up. And new business, it all depends on how competitive the buyer wants to be if they – that they want to get multiple bids, then it becomes more aggressive, but on the other hand, they are satisfied that our product offerings are better than what they can get elsewhere and they like the value of the business, which is one of the great things that we think we offer. Then often we can get closer to a book price on those new customers.
Nate Brochmann - William Blair: Fair enough. That makes sense. And kind of going back to the weather and the top line impact a little bit, you kind of gave a rough number of where you think that went and you clearly pointed out the overall macro jobs report number. In your kind of feel and talking to your customers, do you feel that there would be a little bit more momentum if it wasn’t for the weather out there in terms of just where the overall job growth is and your opportunity to win some new accounts or do you feel that it’s still sluggish at best?
Bill Gale: I think it’s still sluggish. I think the weather created a little bit more sluggishness than otherwise would have happened, but there is not a lot of momentum out there from what we can gather.
Nate Brochmann - William Blair: Okay, that’s great. I appreciate it. Thanks guys.
Operator: We will now move to George Tong from Piper Jaffray.
George Tong - Piper Jaffray: Hi, thanks. You talked earlier about excess capacity investments potentially for next fiscal year, where is your utilization currently and which segments do you think will require the most investment for growth?
Bill Gale: Well, it’s very difficult to utilization, George. It’s just, I mean, this is the local business and you got to look at every operation separately and every market separately, but we think the rental segment is 71% of our overall revenues they also are the ones that are going to require the largest amount of capital infusion in order to continue to grow on such a base. I think we have done a really nice job of continuing to utilize the existing capacity, but we are going to come to a point in certain markets and we have already started the process of looking for appropriate land to build the new capacity and that will be coming online over the course of the next couple of years. We always will have truck needs in both the rental business and in the first aid and safety and fire businesses. So that will be required. And then as I mentioned, I don’t want to overlook whether reiterate this, is the SAP ERP implementation looks like it will go forward and therefore it will consume some big capital in order to get that done, but we think the benefits of that are certainly justifying the expenditure in that – for that system.
George Tong - Piper Jaffray: And do you think the next round of capital infusion or investments will be similar to what you did last year in the second quarter?
Mike Hansen: Last year in the second quarter was primarily a route-based infusion if you will and we are going to – we have continued and will continue to add routes periodically as we need them and don’t expect another infusion if you will at any one point in time that is a significant amount from a routing standpoint, but as Bill mentioned there maybe some processing capacity CapEx.
George Tong - Piper Jaffray: Got it. Could you comment more on sales rep productivity in your Uniform Rentals business and specifically quantifying how much of the growth this quarter was driven by new business?
Mike Hansen: Sales growth continues to be driven by new business; our new business results are still good. We’ve been very pleased with the productivity levels. We’d like to see certainly more customer hiring but we just haven’t seen the momentum in the economy to be able to provide for that. So it’s continued to be driven by new business results.
George Tong - Piper Jaffray: Alright. And then lastly you noted a smaller positive add-stop metric this quarter, what assumptions for add-stops are you incorporating into your revised guidance?
Bill Gale: Well given the range of guidance it really could be anything from flattish to what we saw in the first half of this year. So it’s not going – we don’t see a significant change in the add-stops ratio over the course of the next three months. But I think the guidance allows for a variable from flat to a little bit more robust than we saw this quarter.
George Tong - Piper Jaffray: Got it. Thank you.
Operator: We’ll move to Scott Schneeberger from Oppenheimer.
Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer: Thanks. Good evening guys. With the guidance for fourth quarter and the full year, I’m just curious and we have a little incident that happened in the third quarter with an extra day, but with one less workday in the fourth quarter. Could you give us and help with our models with regard to perhaps top-line and operating income impact there? Thanks.
Mike Hansen: I think from a top-line standpoint you can simply take last year’s fourth quarter revenue divided by 66 days and multiply that by 65 days to get your base. From an operating income standpoint Bill and I’ve generally talked about a 50 basis point impact.
Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer: Great. Thanks for that. And then fiscal 2015 versus fiscal 2014 now, I think you gave 2014 over 2013 for full year date with – just allowing the theme, but is there going to be a difference?
Mike Hansen: They will be the same. There will be 65 work days in each quarter in fiscal 2015 for a total of 260, the same as to fiscal 2014.
Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer: Great, thanks. And then going back to the earlier questions guys obviously a lot of cash coming in, maybe a little you mentioned ERP might take up more CapEx, but probably less from the relationship now with Document Management. So we’ve got into now probably a lot of opportunity for buybacks. But I was just curious I think a lot of the acquisition activity historically has been in Document Management which did certainly leave the door open there. I was hoping to delve in a little deeper as to what type of opportunities you may explore may pursue on the acquisition front? Thanks.
Bill Gale: Scott, we’re going to pursue acquisitions in all of our businesses as appropriate. Now we’ve been making acquisitions in the fire business, we made a lot of acquisitions to establish our footprint in first aid. We’ve had some fairly significant uniform acquisitions although nothing significant since 2006, but we’re certainly open to that. Again you have to have a willing seller and you have to have appropriate valuation to make sense. And we will continue to look at those opportunities as they present themselves.
Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer: Great. And one final one if I could, obviously in direct sales a year ago, a big national customer would – want a progress report on how that’s going and how the big customer addition outlook is within that segment? Thank you.
Bill Gale: The big customer was the United Airlines Continental merger and that was the one that we were asked to provide all the uniforms for the new combined airline. And I would say it went extremely well, they were very – they’re very pleased with it. And I think it turned out to be successful for both sides.
Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer: Thanks, guys. Thanks very much.
Operator: We’ll now go to Dan Dolev from Jefferies.
Dan Dolev - Jefferies: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Back to the acquisition, it seems like it’s a fantastic deal. Per my math you’re sacrificing about $10 million of EBITDA getting paid $180 million. I mean back in September you said that you’re still pursuing a lot of Document Management acquisitions. So my question is really what has changed, was it valuation that was so attractive or were there any other bigger strategic decisions to maybe over time completely get rid of this business in the long-term that made you do this? Thanks.
Bill Gale: Well we really aren’t getting rid of the business. We still own 42% of a bigger entity. So I don’t think you should assume that there was – that was involved in this. I think it’s an opportunity to join two very good companies that will focus totally on document destruction and I think you’re going to see value creation as a result of those two entities coming together run by very good management teams and we’re going to share in that upside as well as having getting $180 million upfront on this thing?
Mike Hansen: Yes, Dan, one of the reasons we talked about really liking these small document shredding acquisitions over time. And this is very much like a large one where we have a lot of opportunities to put more volume into our plant-based shredding facilities to get efficiencies, to drive on to one IT platform. And we’ve got a lot of opportunities here that it takes a long time to accumulate many small acquisitions in order to get the synergies created by this deal. So that’s why we’re so excited about this deal.
Dan Dolev - Jefferies: Got it. Did it make more sense than just buying Shred-it?
Bill Gale: No, I don’t think Shred-it was necessarily for sale and they were bigger than we were. And I think that the combination of the two made more sense to our Board and to the management team than any other opportunity that was available.
Dan Dolev - Jefferies: Got it. Bigger you mean on a shredding size not on an overall size?
Bill Gale: Right. But that’s what this is focused on is the shredding side only.
Dan Dolev - Jefferies: Got it. Well thanks a lot. Appreciate it.
Operator: Our next question will come from Joe Box from KeyBanc Capital Markets.
Sean Egan - KeyBanc Capital Markets: Hi guys. This is Sean Egan in for Joe Box. I just have a quick question. I wanted to go back to the pricing environment you spoke of earlier. When you mentioned that pricing pressures were kind of creating an environment that wasn’t where you would like it to be, we’re hearing from our contacts that they’re getting quite a bit of pushback from a lot of their customers due to Affordable Care Act implications on their budgets. And they’re really sharpening their pencil and pushing back on their vendors and I’m curious to know how much of that pricing pressure are you seeing from competitive or new competitors versus an existing client coming back to you and pushing back?
Bill Gale: Sean I really don’t have the knowledge to really comment on that. Again we’ve got thousands and thousands of customers and locations. I’m sure there were some examples that exist of what you said. But for me to really say that that’s what we’re seeing, I really don’t know.
Sean Egan - KeyBanc Capital Markets: Okay, great. And then just a housekeeping item following up, regarding the transaction, are there any anticipated charges such as any write-downs associated with the deal possibly by the end of the fiscal year?
Bill Gale: All that should – there certainly are those things that could happen. As we said its very complex, accounting and tax transaction, all that will be a part of what a gain or loss gets recognized as we move forward on the deal. So I don’t – I’m not in a position at this time to be able to tell you what that is because there was a lot of work yet to be done on valuations and really looking at the details of the deal. And we will certainly provide color on that as we report our fourth quarter results in July. We do not anticipate providing any further guidance on that at this time. We will discuss it so with the fourth quarter.
Sean Egan - KeyBanc Capital Markets: Okay, great. That’s all from me. Thank you.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) We’ll now go to Manav Patnaik from Barclays.
Manav Patnaik - Barclays: Hey, good evening gentlemen. Just one question around the thought process with document management, I mean clearly Shred-it was purely shredding, you guys obviously kept shredding in the document management together. Just some can you just remind us sort of what the strategy there was and why that got left behind?
Bill Gale: Well, the original strategy years and years ago, Manav, was that we first got into document destruction, the document shredding. And then we wanted to – we had some opportunities to pickup some storage business and we thought that, that might be required in order to appropriately grow the shredding business. We have been happy with some of the storage businesses that we have purchased. And as we have studied this industry, you really don’t have to have both of them in all the markets in order to grow either one of them. So it became apparent to us and we started saying this a few years ago that we were going to focus more on the destruction side and we were just opportunistically going to look for places in which to grow the storage business, but not in a big way. Shred-it, on the other hand, has a very, very small storage business in Canada. They have focused primarily almost exclusively on the destruction side. And really it doesn’t make sense to throw our storage and imaging business into this deal, because the whole concept here is to focus on document destruction. And so that’s how this whole thing is transpired.
Manav Patnaik - Barclays: Okay, fair enough. And then just a quick point on the M&A pipeline, clearly you guys have slowed down the pace of the small M&A that you guys have done across the board. You mentioned obviously, I sort of understand that landscape in the uniform rental space, but can you help us understand the number of smaller players or midsize larger in the fire, safety area because I guess that’s the other area that you had been active?
Bill Gale: Yes. And we are still active, there are a lot of players in the fire business that we are in discussions with, but again it comes down to an expectation on the part of the seller versus what we are willing to pay in order to get the appropriate valuation for our shareholders. So there have been some small acquisitions and will continue to be. They will pick up when the meeting of the minds get closer together.
Manav Patnaik - Barclays: Okay, alright. That’s helpful then. Thank you, guys.
Operator: And it appears there are no further questions. I will turn the conference back over to you Mr. Gale for any additional or closing remarks.
Bill Gale - Senior Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer: Well, I want to thank everyone for joining us tonight. I also wanted to thank you for moving it back like we moved back a day and being able to participate tonight. We are sorry for that bit of confusion, but a lot of that revolved around the timing of this acquisition, I mean this transaction I am sorry and so we appreciate that. We are very excited about forming this partnership with Shred-it. We think it’s great for the shareholders, for our customers and for our partners and we will look forward to talking to you more about it in our fourth quarter earnings release, which should occur sometime in mid-July. Good night.
Operator: This concludes today’s presentation. Thank you for your participation.

We are pleased to report second quarter revenue of $1,144,000,000, which represents growth of 7.9% from last year's second quarter. The number of workdays in both this year's and last year's second quarters was 65. Organic growth, which adjusts for the impact of acquisitions, was 7.1%, the same organic growth we achieved in our first quarter. Mike will give more details by operating segment in a few minutes. Our operating income for the second quarter was $153 million, which is 13.4% of revenue. This operating margin is 30 basis points higher than last year's second quarter operating margin of 13.1%. It should be noted that last year's second quarter included an $8.5 million gain on the sale of an investment and a $1.6 million write-off of a garment processing system used in one of our rental locations. When adjusting for these 2 items, our operating margin actually improved by almost a full percentage point. We are also very pleased with our results so far in fiscal 2014. Second quarter net income was $84.9 million and earnings per diluted share were $0.70. It should be noted that our revenues and earnings per share were record quarterly amounts for Cintas and I wish to congratulate all of our Cintas employees who we call partners for this achievement. We also just recently paid our annual dividend of $0.77 per share, which was a 20.3% increase over last year's dividend and was the 31st consecutive year in which we raised our dividend. As Scott Farmer indicated in our press release, based on our second quarter results and our view of the U.S. economic climate, we are updating our fiscal 2014 guidance with revenue in the range of $4.525 billion to $4.575 billion and EPS in the range of $2.73 to $2.79. This guidance assumes no deterioration in the U.S. economy and does not consider any future share buybacks. In July, when we provided our initial guidance, we gave our expectation that fiscal 2014 medical expense would be higher than fiscal 2013 by 10 to 30 basis points due to the effects of the Affordable Care Act and that this impact would be seen in the second half of the fiscal year. While there remains a great amount of uncertainty about the impact of this program in the future, we still expect it to increase our medical expense in the second half of this fiscal year. However, the impact will likely be at the lower end of the 10- to 30-basis-point range provided in July. This expectation is included in our updated guidance. Now I would like to turn the call over to Mike for more details on the second quarter.
J. Michael Hansen: Thanks, Bill. As Bill mentioned, total revenue increased 7.9% from the second quarter of last year, with total company organic growth being 7.1%. Total company gross margin for the second quarter was 41.7%, which is an improvement from last year's second quarter gross margin of 40.7%. I will discuss these items in more detail by segment. Before doing so, let me remind you that there were 65 workdays in our second quarter, which was the same as last year. As we look ahead to the remainder of the fiscal year, our third quarter will have 65 workdays, whereas last year's third quarter had 64, so we will have one additional day. Our fourth quarter will also have 65 workdays, whereas last year's fourth quarter has 66 workdays, so we will have one less workday in the fourth quarter. For the full fiscal year, we will have 260 workdays, which is one less than last year's total. We have 4 reportable operating segments: Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products; Uniform Direct Sales; First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection Services; and Document Management Services. Uniform Direct Sales, First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection Services and Document Management Services are combined and presented as Other Services on the face of the income statement. The Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products operating segment consists of the rental and servicing of uniforms, mats, towels and other related items. The segment also includes restroom supplies and other facility products and services. Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products revenue accounted for 70% of company revenue in the second quarter and totaled $804.3 million, which is up 6.4% compared to last year's second quarter. Organic growth was also 6.4%. Sales rep new business and productivity continued to be strong. And similar to the first quarter, our national account revenue penetration was very good. Our Rental segment gross margin was 42.9% for the second quarter, an increase from 41.9% in last year's second quarter. Energy-related costs were comparable to last year's second quarter. As Bill mentioned, we wrote off a garment processing system during last year's second quarter. Excluding this impact, Rental gross margin improved by 80 basis points. As we've discussed on previous calls, we began to increase our route capacity in last year's second quarter and we have now lapped that initial investment. The efficiency of these routes has improved throughout the past 12 months and has helped to improve Rental's gross margin. In addition, we continue to see improved leveraging of our plant infrastructure. The Rental segment's second quarter gross margin of 42.9% was also an improvement from the 42.6% in the first quarter. Energy-related costs were about 10 basis points lower than the first quarter, but improved route efficiency and plant infrastructure leverage also contributed to the improvement. Our Uniform Direct Sales operating segment includes the direct sale of uniforms and other related products to national and regional customers. Uniforms and other related products are also sold to local customers, including products sold to rental customers through our direct sale catalog. Uniform Direct Sales revenue accounted for 11% of company revenue in the second quarter and totaled $121.9 million, which represented sales growth of 10.6% compared to last year's second quarter. We've been very pleased with the Uniform Direct Sales revenue this fiscal year, which is up 9% for the 6 months ended November 30. In fact, Uniform Direct Sales revenue was up 11.5% for the trailing 12 months. Having said that, the nature of this business is that the revenue can be quite choppy based on the timing of large national account program rollouts. As we've discussed on previous calls, we had several very large national account rollouts during the second half of last fiscal year, which will not repeat this year. As a result, we expect Uniform Direct Sale revenue for the second half of fiscal '14 to be down 5% to 10% compared to last year's second half. Uniform Direct Sales gross margin was 28.8% for the second quarter, up from last year's second quarter gross margin of 27.4% and the first quarter gross margin of 27.7%. This increase is mainly due to a greater mix of hospitality account sales in the second quarter and better leveraging of our distribution network infrastructure. Our First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection Services operating segment includes revenue from the sale and servicing of first aid products, safety products and training and fire protection products. First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection revenue, which accounted for 11% of company revenue in the second quarter, was $124.6 million. This represents an increase of 11.7% over last year's second quarter revenue. Organic growth was 8.8%. This segment's gross margin was 43.4% in the second quarter, which is up 100 basis points from the 42.4% in last year's second quarter. Energy-related costs were lower by 20 basis points. The remaining improvement is due to better leveraging of the infrastructure, particularly at the warehouse level. The gross margin of 43.4% is relatively consistent with the first quarter gross margin of 43.6%. Our Document Management Services operating segment includes document destruction, storage and imaging services and it accounted for 8% of second quarter total company revenue. Document Management revenue totaled $93 million, which is 12.2% higher than last year's second quarter. Revenue increased organically by 6.9% compared to last year. Average recycled paper prices remained at about $125 per ton, which is down about 17% from last year's second quarter average. Organic growth, excluding recycled paper revenue, was 9.4%. The second quarter gross margin was 45.7%, which is an increase from last year's second quarter gross margin of 45.4%. Energy-related costs were 30 basis points lower than last year. The lower recycled paper prices had a negative impact of $1.9 million on Document Management's gross margin. Using the same recycled paper prices last year, the second quarter gross margin would have improved by about 140 basis points. This improvement is due to our continued migration from on-site to off-site shredding and better performance in both our North American and European storage businesses. Switching to selling and administrative expenses, SG&A was 28.3% as a percentage of revenue in the second quarter, which is up from last year's second quarter figure of 27.6%. However, as Bill mentioned, last year's second quarter SG&A included an $8.5 million gain from the sale of stock in an investment. Adjusting for this onetime item, last year's second quarter SG&A percentage would have been 28.4% compared to this year's 28.3%. Our effective tax rate was 37.9% for the quarter compared to 36.5% last year. Last year, our second quarter effective tax rate reflected the favorable impact of a change to certain tax regulations. We have no similar items in this year's second quarter. We expect the effective tax rate for the full fiscal 2014 year to be 37.3%. Turning now to the balance sheet. Our cash and marketable securities were $313 million at November 30, an increase of $30 million from the $283 million at August 31. Accounts receivable increased $8.9 million since August 31. DSOs were slightly below 40, which was a nice improvement from the 43 in last year's second quarter. New goods inventory and in-service inventory levels at November 30 were $249 million and $509 million, respectively, both up slightly from August 31 levels. Accrued liabilities at November 30 increased from the August 31 balance, primarily due to the accrual of our annual dividend that was paid on December 11. Long-term debt at November 30 was $1.3 billion compared to the amount -- comparable to the amount at August 31. Net cash provided by operating activities for the second quarter was $140 million, an $8 million improvement over last year's second quarter. And CapEx for the second quarter was $39.3 million. Our CapEx by operating segment was as follows: $24.4 million in Rental; less than $1 million in Uniform Direct Sales; $4.4 million in First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection; and $10.1 million in Document Management. We expect CapEx for fiscal 2014 to be in the range of $225 million to $250 million. This concludes our prepared remarks and we will now be glad to answer any of your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan.
Andrew C. Steinerman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Could you give us a sense of how you see organic growth proceeding through the balance of the year, particularly looking at year-over-year comps in the Rental business?
William C. Gale: Andrew, our expectation is that we should see mid single-digit growth, organic growth, in the Rental business, again, assuming that the economy kind of stays in the mode that it's in. We saw a decent jobs report in the month of November. However, it was choppy relative to the prior months. So our expectation is we're going to continue to see that choppiness and, therefore, as a result of that, we expect that most of our growth is going to come from new business, which is what has been happening so far this year. And therefore, we're targeting somewhere in that mid single-digit area.
Andrew C. Steinerman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Yes. I would also love for you to build and make a comment about add-stops. When I look at the end markets for uniforms and look within the labor report, it just seems like we've moved past the bottom and there's been a little bit of acceleration in the end markets that you guys served the most since the summertime. Do you characterize the fall in the same way?
William C. Gale: I don't -- I'm not as bullish on it as you have -- as you are, Andrew. I looked at it -- Mike and I have been looking at it. We study it every month. And I will agree with you, November looked good, as I just said earlier, but October was poor. There just is no consistency to our -- as we look at it. So I would hope that it might pick up and stay consistent, but right now, I have to be honest and say I'm not confident that, that level -- that it will continue. We saw -- if you look at our add-stops, we've kind of had some choppiness. We've talked about it being up one quarter and then down another quarter. And if you look at our add-stop in the second quarter, it was slightly down compared to the first quarter and to the second quarter last year. So we sure haven't seen any robust improvement in hiring among our existing customers yet.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Manav Patnaik with Barclays.
Gregory Bardi - Barclays Capital, Research Division: This is actually Greg calling on for Manav. And going off of what Andrew said, could you give a little bit of your thoughts on which verticals you're starting to see improvement in, just comparing the different verticals and where the hiring environment has been picking up a little bit versus some of the others?
William C. Gale: I would say that we continue to see reasonable strength in the energy sector and we're seeing building strength in the health care arena.
Gregory Bardi - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Okay. And just one more. On the rollout of the ERP system, maybe just a little update there on how the rollouts work for First Aid and Document Management and when you think you're going to move on to some of the next stages?
William C. Gale: We are about 60% to 70% through the rollout in Document Management and First Aid -- the First Aid business. It has had a few bumps in the road, but we've overcome them. We've had some issues, technical issues, that we've been very -- working very closely with our ERP provider to rectify and I think we've gotten over that now. So our expectation is we will complete that rollout in those 2 businesses sometime in mid-calendar '14. At that point in time, we will be most likely embarking upon a design effort for 1 or 2 of our other businesses. We're going to be making that decision here over the next several months.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Sara Gubins with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Sara Gubins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: You've had a nice gross margin expansion, particularly on an underlying basis in Rental Uniforms. And I'm wondering if you think that 80-basis-point year-over-year expansion is a reasonable run rate for the second half of the year.
J. Michael Hansen: Well, we do believe that we will continue to see some expansion. As we say often, Sara, a lot depends on where the revenue comes from. And if new business continues to be the driver, the expansion will be a little more muted. If we do see continued -- a continued trend like we saw in November employment, then, and we have our customers hiring, we may see some better expansion. Built into our guidance, though, I would say probably something similar to the second quarter levels.
Sara Gubins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Okay. And how should we think about longer-term gross margin potential in that segment?
J. Michael Hansen: Well, we've talked a little bit. When we've talked earlier in the year about our CapEx expectations, we did discuss that, in some cases, in some markets, we're running out of plant capacity. So we will talk -- probably have to invest maybe at the end of this fiscal year or into next fiscal year. So there may be some investment that we have to do to add some capacity, but generally speaking, we expect continued margin improvement over time.
Sara Gubins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Okay. And then last quarter, you talked about of your new business wins about 60% were no programmers and 40% you thought were market share. And I know that you don't look at that every quarter, but I'm just wondering, if there's any reason, as you look at, at the marketplace, to think that, that's changing?
J. Michael Hansen: No. I would say there's no reason to think that's changing. That's been pretty consistent as we've come out of the recession and I wouldn't expect that, that would change much.
Sara Gubins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Great. And then just last question. So nice to hear that you think your health care increases will be at the low end of prior expectations. I'm just wondering why, what's driving those lower.
J. Michael Hansen: Well, when we thought about how this would impact us, there were a couple of different things. First, there are -- there's something called a transitional reinsurance fee, which we know will happen. There are other administrative costs and expenses that will happen. The other thing that we expected to happen was that more people would come onto our insurance plan, both for the higher dependent ages because of the individual mandate and also because we thought other companies may be eliminating their coverage or at least making it less beneficial. And while we did see an increase in the number of enrollments more than normal, it was less than we had originally feared. So yes, we think it's going to be the cost of the administration, the reinsurance and more participants.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Hamzah Mazari with Crédit Suisse.
Hamzah Mazari - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Just a question on the national account business. You've talked about that being pretty competitive. Could you give us a sense of how much of that is related to just the economy being choppy versus potential overcapacity in the industry?
William C. Gale: I'm not quite sure I understand your question.
Hamzah Mazari - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: I'm just asking on the national account business. Could you give us an update of how competitive pricing is in that business?
William C. Gale: Well, yes, it remains very competitive. We believe that part of the reason that our national account business continues to be strong is our relatively broad product offering that we have, especially compared to some of our other industry participants. So when we go to some of our national account customers, we are able to offer more than just one particular product offering, be it like a uniform program or an entrance mat program or whatever. So I think as a result of having a number of different things, we're able to be more successful with some of these national account customers and bundle different products and services for them and that enables us to probably have greater penetration than others.
Hamzah Mazari - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Great. That's helpful. And just a follow-up. If you could give us a sense of sort of what your expectations are on sort of building out capacity going forward.
William C. Gale: Well, we certainly -- as Mike mentioned a few minutes ago, we certainly are seeing some pressure points in some of our geographic markets for need for some capacity in the Rental business. And as a result of that, we have several projects underway at various stages that anticipate the building of additional capacity. It takes a while to do that, in that you've got to find the right piece of land, negotiate for that and then, obviously, design and build out the facility. So based on where we're at today versus where we thought we would be, I would tell you that we're a little behind our original timetable on building some of that capacity. It certainly hasn't cost us to not be able to grow in a market, but we've been able to utilize what we have. But as a result of that, I would expect our CapEx to pick up in the latter part of this year and maybe bleed over into 2015. That is certainly going to require more cash flow to build the plants, but also as Mike said, could cause a little bit of short-term, a less robust improvement in gross margin as a result of that.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Joe Box with KeyBanc.
Joe Box - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: Just a quick clarification on that. So you're -- it looks like you're taking down your CapEx guidance by about $10 million to $15 million or so. Is that all based on the new plants that you're constructing? And is it, basically, all just push-out into the next year?
William C. Gale: Yes, pretty much so. Yes, Joe.
Joe Box - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: Okay. Perfect. And then just switching over to the First Aid side. Over the last couple of quarters, you guys have put up pretty good margins performance there. And it sounded like you were starting to get some scale benefits. I guess it seems to me like you might have taken a little bit of a step back this quarter on an easy comp. Was there something specific there within First Aid?
J. Michael Hansen: Well -- the gross margin improved. And you're talking about sequentially or year-over-year, Joe?
Joe Box - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: Year-over-year on the operating margin side.
J. Michael Hansen: Yes. So in the gross margin, we improved by about 100 basis points and I talked a little bit about that in my prepared remarks. On an SG&A basis, there is some reflection of the investment in SAP. And keep in mind, that's a pretty large endeavor in both Document Management and First Aid and Safety. And you do see a little bit of an increase in the SG&A this quarter year-over-year for both of those businesses. And while we certainly expect benefit from that system, it is not a 1- to 2-year payback. So that's the blip that you're seeing in SG&A that kind of falls down to that operating margin.
Joe Box - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: I mean, is that something that we should expect to see, then, flow through over the next several quarters or is that a "blip?"
J. Michael Hansen: Well, I think what you'll -- I think you'll still see that level of investment as we implement the project. So while we're in the implementation phase, we do have some groups of people going around and training our new users. And so there are some additional costs that will likely, as Bill said, run through the rest of this fiscal year. And then we should be almost fully implemented by mid-calendar '14. So I wouldn't expect that incremental cost to continue, but certainly, there's the cost of SAP that will continue. Having said that, we expect to get benefit going forward. And that benefit will come through better information, better price reviews. And that should come, it's just not a quick turn.
Joe Box - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: Right. Just a quick question on pricing on your legacy Uniform Rental business. I know pricing is still probably very competitive, but we are starting to get some chatter that it could be loosening up for non-national accounts. Is that something that you've seen or is it still a bit premature?
William C. Gale: Joe, we have so many operations around the country and different customers we're going to. I hear anecdotally lots of different things. I cannot confirm for you that I've heard that take place. I mean, I hear some markets, it's -- "Oh, this is more aggressive. We've seen it." In other markets, "Yes, it's firming up." So from what I'm hearing, I can't confirm that, that's happening based on our experience.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Andrew Wittmann with Baird.
Andrew J. Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: So just maybe a couple of bookkeeping things here. Maybe this is in the commentary, but can you comment on the number of shares repurchased and maybe the average price? It looks like -- I get about 961,000 shares, about $59 per share, but can you give us the real numbers?
J. Michael Hansen: We purchased about 1.2 million shares during the quarter. We talked about most of those purchases were prior to our first quarter earnings release. We have about $505 million remaining on the authorization. We bought about 3.2 million shares for the year. Andy, I don't have in front of me the average price. That will show up in our Q.
Andrew J. Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: Yes. Okay. And then can you -- Mike, maybe a little bit of detail inside -- Mike, I think I ask this question every quarter, but can you give us some color inside the Rental segment between kind of core uniform wearing versus the facility services? Are you seeing any differentiation in the growth rates between those business? Maybe some color there.
J. Michael Hansen: We're seeing real good growth in all of the pieces within the Rental business. And while we don't disclose the different pieces individually, I'll say that garments are growing nicely. And the different businesses within the facility services: the dust; the chemicals; hygiene products and services; our deep clean business, all those businesses are growing fairly well and there's not any real overweighting of any of them.
Andrew J. Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: Got it. The -- just in terms of, so, a year ago, we've now lapped the investments in human capital that you made in terms of routes and maybe some more salespeople. Can you just talk about kind of where you are in that curve right now? Are we still folding those and ramping those new routes up? Or are we at the point where, in addition to plant capacity, we need some more route capacity? Can you just talk about where we are in that today versus a year ago and if there's an expectation for growth there?
William C. Gale: We always are going to be adding routes. So as long as we grow, we're going to be adding routes. But we you don't anticipate, at this point, adding routes to the same degree we did a year ago. So the fact that we have gone a year now from the -- kind of the unusual surge in number of routes has certainly -- we're starting to feel the positive impact of that as those routes build up. And I think that was part of the reason you saw some improvement in the margin in the Rental business. Right now, Andy, unless there is a major increase in the revenue growth rate, I think routes capacity will be added at a -- kind of a nominal pace going forward.
Andrew J. Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: That's very helpful. Maybe one last question here in the Affordable Care Act. With some of the provisions changed and others delayed, we've got the outlook for this fiscal year. Is there any way -- is there anything that's changing about your out-year look out from the -- outlook from the experience that you've had so far in rolling people for calendar 2014 that makes you think that maybe the longer-term effect in your fiscal '15 is maybe greater than or less than your previous expectation?
William C. Gale: I guess I'm somewhat encouraged by the fact that we didn't have as many participants coming onto the program that we had feared might happen. But there is so much yet to be played out on this whole thing with some of the delays and parts of the law and that certain businesses do not have to necessarily add or offer the service. I think we've got to wait and see. I just don't think we have enough information yet to know what the full effect of this thing is going to be. And therefore, while we kind of are set now for our enrollment for '14, we really don't know what's going to happen to the cost structure and the -- because we're self-insured, and what ends up happening from the standpoint of the cost per head. So I think we've just got to wait and see, Andy.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from John Healy with Northcoast Research.
John M. Healy - Northcoast Research: Guys, I wanted to ask a little bit about the fire resistant garments segment. There's been a little discussion in the industry that maybe that market is showing a little plateauing or just baselining of the growth rate. And I was curious to get your thoughts on what's happening in that end market from a demand perspective. And maybe some color in terms of what that might represent as a percentage of the uniform business today.
William C. Gale: I think there's been a little bit of a slowdown in that business, John, only because you were comparing it to that robust growth that we were seeing, as energy was just booming throughout the country here a couple of years ago and through most of last year. But given the fact that we've kind of seen a plateauing of that, obviously, our new business is not as big as it was. However, we are still the largest provider in that market. I don't think there's been, really, a reduction in the number of employees in the energy sector that are required to wear these garments. We really haven't seen any big competitive situation. It's just that you're not seeing that many -- as many oilfield workers going forward. But our FRC business is still one of the highlights of our Rental business and continues to be.
John M. Healy - Northcoast Research: Got you. And I want to ask you a big picture question. Bill, you're always good at giving us a read on how you feel about the economy. And just kind of as we move into the calendar year, I mean, you've had a great last 6 months of the business and your growth rates kind of organically show like there's a little bit of moderation. But I guess if you do the postmortem on calendar 2013, did the business and the economy maybe feel -- come out better than you might have thought? And then, I guess, as you look to calendar '14, are you feeling better about where we're at versus 6 months ago? Or -- I'd just appreciate any color or perspective you could provide there.
William C. Gale: Well, I would say '13 -- calendar '13 certainly turned out to be modestly better than what I had originally expected and I think we have seen similar results in many businesses. So I think many businesses were able to adapt to a slow growth environment and have done quite well in it. As we look into '14, we kind of see -- right now, I think our expectation is more of the same. We don't see any catalysts out there to really improve growth substantially, nor do we see anything on the horizon that would throw us yet into a recession. So right now, I guess we're kind of thinking, it should be comparable to what we saw this year. With that said, I think people have to keep in mind, though, it has not been a consistent year -- or month-over-month improvement. There's been some real choppiness that we've seen throughout '13. And I kind of think that maybe is what we'll see in '14. But when you step back and look at it, you'll say, "Oh, okay, that wasn't a bad result given what kind of pressures continue to exist out there in the economy."
John M. Healy - Northcoast Research: Okay, great. And just final question. In the first quarter, you guys were kind enough to call out the operating margin headwind associated with the lack of the workday. I think it was around 50 basis points or so. Is that a realistic type of benefit we should expect just from a comp standpoint in the third quarter, given the extra workday that should benefit you guys?
J. Michael Hansen: Yes, I think that's a reasonable way of looking at it, John. We'll get the same kind of impact in that we'll have an extra day of revenue to cover things like depreciation, amortization of the garments and other rental items. So I think that's a good way of looking at it.
William C. Gale: But then keep in mind, the fourth quarter, you're going to have that negative comparison again.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from George Tong with Piper Jaffray.
George K. Tong - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division: I'd love to revisit the margin discussion a little bit, particularly around the uniform rental business. On one hand, we're definitely seeing improvements in route productivity. That's balanced, I think, somewhat by the fact that the non-program [indiscernible] isn't really changing and isn't really expected to change over the next couple of quarters. So can you talk a little bit about how those dynamics are going to play out and how you expect margins to play out over the course of the fiscal year and into fiscal '15?
J. Michael Hansen: Well, as we talked a little bit earlier, we would expect that the routes that we added last year will continue to become more efficient. In probably the next 6 months, we'll see continued improved leveraging of our plant infrastructure. But probably, towards the end of the fiscal year, maybe in the next fiscal year, we will have some investments to make in different pockets for plant capacity. So that will certainly affect us going into fiscal '15. And, George, again, it just -- there's a lot of dependent -- a lot of dependence on how the revenue comes. And if we see the kind of year that Bill just kind of mapped out, then I would expect to see some continuing improvement, with a little bit of impact of the investment that I mentioned. Does that help?
George K. Tong - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division: That's helpful, Mike. And could you give us an updated view on what employment figures need to be [indiscernible] acceleration in organic performance?
William C. Gale: Well, we would -- I think we've kind of looked at it, George, and said that if we could see -- I'm going to throw out this as a general number because it really will depend where the job growth is coming -- but if you can see job growth consistently, 250,000 plus a month, that generally correlates to existing businesses adding employees. And as long as that's kind of across the whole economy, then we would see the impact of that happening on our customers and, therefore, we would see an improved add-over-stop rate.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel.
Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: I don't have too many questions left, but we talked a lot about expanding the routes and how that's been productive. Can you talk a little bit more about products that you've added in the various lines of business that you have and in the last, say, year or 2 and how some of that is driving some of the growth? Or is it really just adding the routes and that's really what it is?
William C. Gale: Well, I think we've expanded some of our offerings in, like, the hygiene arena, Shlomo, which has helped us grow a little bit faster in certain segments. But I don't know if it's really any other significantly new products other than that. I think it's just been, generally, additional penetration of customers with some of those products. And we've talked, for example, of the chemical dispensing business, still a relatively small part of our business, but that has been an add-on to many of our hospitality-type customers. So that's been beneficial to us.
Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: Okay. And then can you talk a little bit about the floor cleaning business and how many cities you're in? Are you continuing to expand that now?
William C. Gale: I don't know exactly how many cities we're in. We are in many of the major markets across the U.S. Right now, our focus has been on additional penetration within those markets that we're in as opposed to opening up new markets, because we'd like to take advantage of the management structure that's required to run that operation. But I would tell you that, I would think we're -- we've got to be in 50 of the top 100 MSAs.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Dan Dolev with Jefferies.
Dan Dolev - Jefferies LLC, Research Division: Just really quickly back to the economy. I did notice that on the press release, Scott said that he's seeing some signs of economic growth beginning to appear. And I looked back and I saw that this was compared to a previous press release which said that there's still no any evidence in the economy. Was that just November? Am I reading too much into that? And maybe you can please explain what he was saying versus what you were saying, that you're not that bullish.
William C. Gale: It's the holiday season, Dan. We were just trying to be optimistic. No, I'm teasing. I would tell you that it certainly feels a little better to us as we've gone through now 2 quarters of our fiscal year. The fact that, yes, it's still been choppy. And as I mentioned to Andrew at the top of the call, we still have no good consistency. But when you kind of look at the stock market and what's happening with that, you sense that maybe Washington is at least getting together -- or getting along a little bit better. I guess there's kind of a feeling that, "Okay, things are not going to be back like they were in the '90s, but maybe we're going to be okay." And so we kind of sense that in talking with our customers. And we looked at the November jobs report and we said, "Hey, that wasn't bad." So -- and I think we've had 2 quarters now in a row of each one of our business segments grew organically more than 6%. So I think that gives us some comfort to say, "Okay, maybe things will be all right."
Dan Dolev - Jefferies LLC, Research Division: That's good. I hope so. One other question on shredding. You are growing very fast. And Iron Mountain, I don't think, discloses the growth in shredding, but I'm estimating they're growing about 3%, which is well below you. So are you just -- can you maybe tell us what the market is growing at? And it looks like you're gaining a lot of share and who you're gaining share from.
William C. Gale: I do not have any statistics on what the market is growing, so I -- and I really can't comment on anything Iron Mountain does. All I can tell you, Dan, is that, yes, we've seen a nice pickup in our service revenue. And while the paper prices continue to be a little bit of a headwind, we are pleased with the business. We -- our model has been one of converting to more off-site shredding and that seems to be going very well. We've had some nice wins on some pretty good-sized national account customers. So I think that's been benefiting us. And I would say that we are taking business primarily from the smaller players because more and more companies realize that they're not really engaging a company to do waste pickup. They're engaging a company to do privacy protection. And they've got to be sure that it is securely handled and that companies have the standards to do that. And I think that has helped us with our growth rate.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Sean Kim with RBC Capital Markets.
Sean Sun-Il Kim - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: First, on guidance. I think when you guys initially gave guidance, it assumes sort of mid single-digit organic growth in the Rental segment. It's come in a little bit ahead of that in the first half. So I guess it makes sense for you to raise the lower end, but just wondering why you guys lowered the top end of the guidance as well.
William C. Gale: Well, I think part of that is driven by the fact of paper prices. And the Document Management business have not rebounded as much as we had initially hoped. I think it also is attributable to what Mike was talking about in the direct sale business in that we are not going to have as good a second half as we did in the first half and as we did in the second half last year. And as we got closer to that period, we don't have any other big rollouts that are going to happen to replace that business. And I think it's just the general conservative view of what we see we might have to deal with. We get into the winter -- if we have a bad winter, that has a bit of an impact on our business. So I think it's just -- it's all those factors together, Sean. I wouldn't read too much into it, other than it's not as optimistic as we hoped it might have been when we started the fiscal year, but it's certainly not as pessimistic as we feared it might be when we started.
Sean Sun-Il Kim - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: Okay, great. Just one more, if I may. I think, historically, you guys have done more share repurchases in the fiscal first quarter and the fourth quarter. Is that -- did you think that's something we should expect in fiscal '14 as well, sort of acceleration in buybacks towards the end of the fiscal year?
William C. Gale: Well, I will remind everyone that during the first quarter and into early the second quarter of fiscal '14, we did purchase 3.2 million shares. Whether or not we will purchase any shares in the fourth quarter is subject to our board's direction. And I can't predict at this time nor can I signal what we may do. So I -- all I would say is past practice is sometimes an indication of the future.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Greg Halter with Great Lakes Review.
Gregory W. Halter - LJR Great Lakes Review: I noticed that in the quarter, I think there was only about $300,000 or so in M&A. I don't know if you addressed this, but I'm wondering what your thoughts are there going forward. And it kind of piggybacks on the question before that. You're obviously -- just boosted the dividend by over 20%. And if there were not to be any share repurchases, your cash would be growing very rapidly here, leading either to debt reduction or cash on the balance sheet that's not...
William C. Gale: That's not what? [Technical Difficulty]
William C. Gale: All right, I'll try to answer his question. Hopefully, he can hear the answer. I think acquisitions always are going to be somewhat unpredictable. We did -- certainly, we do continue to have a very active full-time M&A staff within our company that is constantly looking for good acquisitions. And unfortunately, in the second quarter, we did not have a lot of meeting of the minds with sellers as to the appropriate valuations and, as result of that, we didn't make them. That doesn't necessarily mean that's going to happen in the third and fourth quarter because there's always ongoing discussions. And I don't know what will happen. I can't predict that. Regarding the cash buildup, it's a nice problem to have in that it gives us a lot of options for maximizing shareholder value. And I think our board has shown a pretty good process of putting that cash to appropriate use and I don't expect that to change.
Operator: And we'll take our next -- actually, at this time, we do have one question remaining in the queue. [Operator Instructions] We'll take our next question from Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer.
Scott A. Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division: Following up on M&A, just on where you're looking there, Bill. Should we think you're primarily focused in Document Management, still? Is there activity in Rental? Just across your segments, thoughts on where you may be more or less active.
William C. Gale: Scott, we're actually active in all of the business segments, I'd say, with the exception of direct sale. There is not a lot of value to buying direct sale businesses, generally. So we don't spend a lot of effort there, but in all -- in the other 3 segments, we continue to evaluate different opportunities.
Scott A. Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division: Great. And then last year, you said that the Superstorm Sandy had an adverse impact, but that it was not material. Curious, the weather has been solid this quarter, any benefit or risk on comparison from that? And then just taking that a step further, how would you kind of rank order the 3 biggest drivers of year-over-year margin expansion?
William C. Gale: Certainly, because of what we said last year, we knew there were a lot of concern that people thought that Hurricane Sandy might have an impact on us and that's why we made the comment that it was a minimal impact, it wasn't material. So I can't really say that we had any benefit this quarter of any -- because it wasn't material to begin with. Relative to the components of the gross margin improvement, I would say the most of it has come from the route, utilization of the leveraging off the route additions; and then, secondarily, probably from the plant utilization. And then we -- I think we had a minor energy pickup, didn't we, Mike, quarter-over-quarter?
J. Michael Hansen: It was minor, if there was one. Yes, it was comparable. It was primarily those 2 items.
Operator: And it appears there are no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the call back over to our speakers for any additional or closing remarks.
William C. Gale: I want to thank everyone for joining us during this very busy time of the year. Appreciate your interest in Cintas. And on behalf of all of the Cintas family, we want to wish everyone a very happy holiday season and a successful 2014.
Operator: And again, this does conclude today's Cintas Quarterly Earnings Results Conference Call. We thank you again for your participation.

Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Cintas Quarterly Earnings Results Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Bill Gale, Senior Vice President of Finance and Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead, sir.
William C. Gale: Thank you for joining us this evening as we report our first quarter results for fiscal 2014. With me is Mike Hansen, Cintas's Vice President and Treasurer. After some commentary on the results, we will be happy to answer questions. The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a safe harbor from civil litigation for forward-looking statements. This conference call contains forward-looking statements that reflect the company's current views as to future events and financial performance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those we may discuss. I refer you to the discussion on these points contained in our most recent filings with the SEC. We are pleased to report first quarter revenue of $1,120,000,000 which represents growth of 6.6% from last year's first quarter. Our first quarter had one less workday than last year. Adjusting for this workday difference, revenue increased by 8.2% over last year's first quarter. Organic growth, which adjusts for both the impact of acquisitions and the difference in workdays, was 7.1%. As mentioned in today's press release, the organic growth for each of our 4 operating segments exceeded 6%. Mike will give more detail by operating segment in a few minutes. Our operating income for the first quarter was $140.1 million, which is 12.5% of revenue. This operating margin is 70 basis points lower than last year's first quarter operating margin of 13.2%. On our July earnings call, I indicated that comparisons to last year's first quarter would be difficult due to 3 items. First, as I mentioned a few minutes ago, our first quarter had less workday than last year. This had a negative impact of approximately 50 basis points on this year's operating margin due to a number of our large expenses, including rental material costs, depreciation and amortization, being determined on a monthly basis instead of a workday basis. Secondly, this year's first quarter recycled paper prices were over 20% lower than last year's first quarter recycled paper prices. This resulted in a negative impact to operating margin of 30 basis points compared to last year's first quarter. Finally, we began adding route capacity in the second quarter of last fiscal year, so last year's first quarter had none of the expenses associated with that capacity expansion. All in all, we are pleased with our first quarter operating margin results and a solid start to our fiscal 2014 year. First quarter net income was $77.8 million, and earnings per diluted share were $0.63. We were active with our share buyback program and purchased a total of 3 million shares of Cintas stock in the first quarter and into September. Since we purchased the shares in the latter part of the first quarter and in September, the buybacks had no impact on our first quarter earnings per share. However, we expect that these buybacks will benefit fiscal year 2014 EPS by about $0.04. We announced in July that our Board of Directors authorized an additional share repurchase program of $500 million. As of today, we have available for future share repurchases $15.4 million under the October 2011 board authorization and $500 million under the July 2013 board authorization. As Scott Farmer indicated in our press release, much uncertainty remains in the U.S. economy. The employment picture from month to month remains uneven and inconsistent, a reflection of businesses' uncertainty about future investment plans. As a result, we are maintaining our fiscal 2014 revenue expectations to be in the range of $4.5 billion to $4.6 billion. We are updating our EPS expectations to include the impact of the buybacks through today so that we now expect fiscal 2014 EPS to be in the range of $2.70 to $2.79. Now I would like to turn the call over to Mike for more details on the first quarter.
J. Michael Hansen: Thanks, Bill. As Bill mentioned, total revenue increased 6.6% from the first quarter of last year, with total company organic growth being 7.1%. Total company gross margin for the first quarter was 41.6%, which is down from last year's first quarter gross margin of 42.4%. I'll discuss these items in more detail by segment. Before doing so, let me remind you that there were 65 workdays in our first quarter, which is one less than last year. In fiscal '14, we will have 65 workdays in each quarter, for a total of 260 workdays. This creates year-over-year workday differences in each quarter except the second and results in one less workday for the entire fiscal year. We have 4 reportable operating segments: Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products; Uniform Direct Sales; First Aid, Safety, and Fire Protection Services; and Document Management Services. Uniform Direct Sales; First Aid, Safety, and Fire Protection Services; and Document Management Services are combined and presented as other services on the face of the income statement. The Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products operating segment consists of the rental and servicing of uniforms, mats, towels and other related items. This segment also includes restroom supplies and other facility products and services. Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products revenue accounted for 71% of company revenue in the first quarter and totaled $792.9 million, which is up 5% compared to last year's first quarter. Adjusting for the one less workday in this year's first quarter, this segment's revenue grew 6.7%. Organic growth was also 6.7%. This was a nice uptick from the 4.8% organic growth rate in the fourth quarter. National account revenue penetration was strong during the quarter, which enhanced the growth. Additionally, sales rep productivity was strong, and net add-stops showed modest improvement over both last year's first quarter as well as the fourth quarter. Our Rental segment gross margin was 42.6% for the quarter, down from 43.3% in last year's first quarter. Energy-related costs were 10 basis points higher than last year's first quarter. The remaining decrease compared to last year was due to having one less workday in this year's first quarter and due to the costs associated with adding route capacity last fiscal year beginning in the second quarter. The first quarter gross margin of 42.6% improved from the 42.1% in the fourth quarter, despite having one less workday in the first quarter compared to the fourth quarter. Energy-related costs were 30 basis points lower than the fourth quarter, and we did start to see improved efficiency in our recently added routes. Our Uniform Direct Sales operating segment includes the direct sale of uniforms and other related products to national and regional customers. Uniforms and other related products are also sold to local customers, including products sold to rental customers through our direct sale catalog. Uniform Direct Sale revenue accounted for 10% of company revenue in the first quarter and totaled $107.5 million, which represented growth of 7.2% compared to last year's first quarter. Uniform Direct Sales gross margin was 27.7% for the first quarter, down from last year's first quarter gross margin of 29.4% and the fourth quarter gross margin of 30.8%. This decrease is mainly due to a greater mix of national account sales in the first quarter. National account sales generally have a lower gross margin than hospitality accounts. Our First Aid, Safety, and Fire Protection Services operating segment includes revenue from the sale and servicing of first aid products, safety products and training and fire protection products. First Aid, Safety, and Fire Protection revenue, which accounted for 11% of company revenue in the first quarter, was $125.9 million. This represents an increase of 13.6% over last year's first quarter revenue. Adjusting for one less workday in the first quarter compared to last year, revenue growth was 15.3%. Organic growth was 9.2%. This segment's gross margin was 43.6% in the first quarter, which is up 50 basis points from the 43.1% in last year's first quarter. Energy-related costs were lower by 20 basis points. The remaining improvement is due to better leveraging of the infrastructure, as well as an improved mix of high gross margin sales in the first quarter compared to last year's first quarter. These improvements were partially offset by the one less workday in this year's first quarter. The gross margin of 43.6% is relatively consistent with the fourth quarter gross margin of 43.5%. Our Document Management Services operating segment includes document destruction, storage and imaging services, and it accounted for 8% of first quarter total company revenue. Document Management revenue totaled $94.1 million, which is 10.3% higher than last year's first quarter. Adjusting for one less workday in this year's first quarter, revenue increased by 12%. Revenue increased organically by 6.3% compared to last year. Average recycled paper prices remained relatively low at about $125 per ton, which is about $45 per ton lower than last year's first quarter average. Organic growth, excluding recycled paper revenue, was 10%. The first quarter gross margin was 45.9%, which is down from last year's first quarter gross margin of 49.1% and from the fourth quarter gross margin of 46.4%, primarily due to the drop in paper prices. However, we also invested in off-site shredding facilities in the past year to allow additional migration to the more efficient service model of off-site shredding. Switching to selling and administrative expenses, SG&A was 29.1% as a percent of revenue in the first quarter, which is down slightly from last year's first quarter figure of 29.2%. General and administrative labor was down as we continue to leverage our cost structure. This was somewhat offset by a 20 basis point increase in medical expenses. Our effective tax rate was 37.1% for the quarter, compared to 37.5% last year. The effective tax rate can fluctuate from quarter to quarter based on tax reserve builds and releases relating to specific discrete items. We expect the effective tax rate for the full fiscal 2014 year to be 37.3%. Turning now to the balance sheet, our cash and marketable securities were $283 million at August 31, down $75 million from the $358 million at May 31. This decrease was primarily due to using $101 million of cash for the share buyback program. Accounts receivable increased $15.6 million since May 31. DSOs were just below 40, which was slightly better than last year's first quarter. New goods inventory and in-service inventory levels at August 31 were $245 million and $500 million, respectively, both up just slightly from May 31 levels. We continue to be pleased with our ability to manage inventory levels appropriately. Accrued compensation and related liabilities at August 31 decreased by $35 million from the May 31 balance, mainly due to payment of fiscal year 2013 bonuses and commissions. Accrued liabilities decreased $37 million compared to May 31, primarily due to payments of accrued bond interest and accrued profit sharing. Long-term debt at August 31 was $1.3 billion. As of August 31, our total debt-to-EBITDA remains slightly below 2x. CapEx for the first quarter was $37.5 million. Our CapEx by operating segment was as follows: $22.2 million in Rental; less than $1 million in Uniform Direct Sales; $3.3 million in First Aid, Safety, and Fire Protection; and $11.3 million in Document Management. We expect CapEx for fiscal 2014 to be in the range of $240 million to $260 million. This concludes our prepared remarks, and we will now be glad to answer any of your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We'll go first to Sara Gubins with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Sara Gubins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: One just quick housekeeping question. Could you give us your share count at the quarter end and maybe today, given the late nature of the repurchases?
J. Michael Hansen: The share count at the end of the quarter was 120,778,000. And for the year, we're modeling about 122.5 million shares.
Sara Gubins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Right, okay. You saw a nice acceleration in uniform rental. And in your prepared remarks, you mentioned seeing some improvement in national accounts. Could you give us any more color on perhaps what type of national accounts and if you would expect that acceleration to continue?
J. Michael Hansen: Sure. As you know, Sara, we have quite a few facility services offerings, and we saw some real nice penetration into our national accounts in -- particularly, in our cleaning areas, our floor cleaning, our emergency floor cleaning businesses, restroom cleaning. And as far as we'll -- do we expect that to continue, it's a little bit hard to say. But we certainly believe that our national account customers see the value of those products and services. But I would say, it's a little too early to tell whether we'll see that throughout the rest of the year.
Sara Gubins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Okay. And then just last question. On the fourth quarter call, you mentioned that you'd be adding route capacity during fiscal '14, although not as much as in fiscal '13. Any change to those plans?
J. Michael Hansen: No. We -- I would say, going forward, we'll typically add route capacity as necessary. And we'll generally add some in a -- certainly, in a growing environment. And where our new business remains strong, we'll continue to add routes throughout the year and into the future. I would say, though, it would not be at the pace that we saw beginning in the second quarter of last year. We did have a little bit of a catch-up for some -- from added capacity, so I wouldn't say we'd be at that same pace for the rest of the year.
Operator: And we'll go next to Joe Box with KeyBanc.
Joe Box - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: Just a bit of a follow-up on that question, more taking it from the margin angle. How do you think that we should be viewing incremental operating margins over the next couple of quarters? Obviously, they've been subdued as you've deployed more route capacity. Do you think that incremental margins should remain subdued? Or would it be reasonable to assume that they could potentially reaccelerate now that you'll actually be anniversary-ing the capacity expansions?
William C. Gale: Well, Joe, it'll come down to where is the business coming from. As we've said on last several quarters, the more of our growth that comes from new accounts, the less improvement we'll see in margins because we have additional material costs, we -- that tends to fill up the routes a little faster. And therefore, you just don't get the rapid improvement in the margins. If, on the other hand, and we haven't seen this yet, but if on the other hand we were to see a real acceleration of growth of wares in existing accounts, then obviously, that would have a much better impact on the margins themselves. So I can't really tell you that. At this point, we did -- as Mike said, we had a modest improvement in our add-stops, but it wasn't significant. So we're still in a, I would say, a lackluster employment growth environment.
Joe Box - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: Okay, fair enough. It looks like your first aid margins were actually the highest first quarter margins that you've had since the downturn. Just curious, is that a function of the benefits of scale? Are you getting a more favorable mix there? If you could just maybe give us any color on what's driving it and maybe how we should think about the upset from current levels.
William C. Gale: I think it's kind of a scale situation. We have been developing our national footprint in the first aid and fire business over the last several years. And the more volume we have in those different markets, those -- some of those markets that are relatively small, the better impact that we have on our margins. I think it also is attributable to some of the initiatives the management team put in place to make sure that, that business was generating the profits that we think are appropriate. And they've done a good job at basically providing additional products and services offerings to their customers that have enhanced the revenue at each of the existing stops. So I think that's been -- that's also been a factor in it.
Joe Box - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: Great. And then just one question on the buyback. Over the last few years, when you've been in the market buying stock, you done it in a meaningful way. I realize you obviously don't provide guidance on buybacks, but should we view this as a more one-off opportunistic quarter? Or would you say you're putting more emphasis on the buyback?
William C. Gale: Well, I would say that it is -- we felt confident, given our board's directive, to proceed with the buyback that we did in this quarter, which I think was significant. As far as what we do going forward, it is all dependent on what happens with our other opportunities for uses of cash, our confidence in the future and how the board directs us to proceed with what they feel is the best way to enhance shareholder value.
Operator: And we'll go next to Manav Patnaik with Barclays Capital.
Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Just one, first, quick question. I mean, it seems like you did some acquisitions like this quarter. I know you typically provide the breakout of where you did those in the Q. Could you just give us a flavor of maybe the spread this quarter?
William C. Gale: They were primarily in the Document Management segment. I would say about 2/3 of it were Document Management and the other 1/3 -- or the other 30% or so was in our first aid and safety segment.
Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Research Division: All right. That's what I figured. So can you maybe just elaborate a little bit more around the -- just the Document Management side? Obviously, the organic growth there for the last 3 quarters has been in around that 6% mark. Is that a sustainable rate? And what the trends behind that are?
William C. Gale: Well, the Document Management segment continues to provide us with a lot of acquisition opportunities because there are so many businesses doing document management around the country. And now that we have established a pretty decent national footprint, it behooves us to look for other tuck-in acquisitions that we can have in some of these markets in order to improve the profitability. So I think we're going to continue to see opportunities in Document Management going forward because there are just still so many out there. So at this point in time, we are very disciplined on it. We're making sure that they generate the returns we want. But we see this probably will continue for some time.
J. Michael Hansen: And as Bill mentioned just a minute ago how our First Aid, Safety, and Fire segment's gross margin has benefited from the scale of these -- of adding more volumes. So these tuck-ins are quite nice to help the leverage and the gross margin and overall operating margins in those businesses. As they become bigger, we become more efficient.
Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Yes. So I get that on the acquisition front. I guess I was trying to pin more on the organic side. So is a lot of the organic growth, then, being driven basically from accumulating all these prior acquisitions you guys have done and now finally benefiting from the footprint? Is that what the main driver there is?
William C. Gale: Well, we've had pretty good organic growth, absent the fluctuations in paper prices, for some time in this segment. The benefits you'd get from having more locations available to you gives you opportunities on a national scale to sell a national account. So from that perspective, it does enhance organic growth. But I don't want to leave you with the impression that we couldn't grow organically if we didn't make these acquisitions. We feel very good about that, our ability to do that. But our goal has always been to become a national player in that business.
Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Got it. And just one last thing. I mean, in terms of the guidance, obviously, you left the revenue unchanged. So -- and I guess tieing to the earlier question on if the organic growth on the rental side can continue this -- I guess, the 6.7% range. I guess -- I mean, that clearly implies there's probably some deceleration towards the back half. But would you say that's just more caution? Because, like you said, it's a lackluster environment, but there -- if these trends continue, obviously, there would be upside there.
William C. Gale: I think it's a -- I don't want to call it conservative, but we want to factor in all the uncertainty that we still hear out there in the marketplace. I think the Fed's action yesterday gave you some indication of their view of the economy as relatively soft. So I would say, yes, we're being cautious, but I don't think unreasonably so, given all the other things that we continue to see and hear.
J. Michael Hansen: This -- we mentioned that there was a modest improvement in net add-stops. This is not the first time we've seen a nice uptick in net add-stops only to be followed by a downturn. And as we've talked about quite often in the last couple of years, this employment picture is so bumpy and inconsistent that we're certainly hesitant to say that there is momentum.
Operator: . And we'll go next to Andrew Wittman with Robert W. Baird.
Andrew J. Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: I guess since we've done some talking about document, I'm going to do one more and just talk about what's going on in that business. Obviously, paper prices have been kind of stubbornly low, I guess, I would say here. It's weighing on the overall profitability of that business, at least to the income statement. Can you talk about reaction in the marketplace on the service levels and the pricing for service levels? Are we starting to see that go up, in other words, to offset these paper price challenges? And just talk about another initiatives that you might have to improve the profitability there outside of paper prices.
William C. Gale: You certainly have seen a, I would say, a stabilization of service pricing because some of these people just were trying to survive on the paper price itself, and they obviously cannot do that with the cost of servicing. So to the extent that there's an upside to lower paper prices, it's more rational service pricing. I think we've got to keep in mind, this paper price is driven by a lot of different factors from currency levels, from foreign demand, et cetera. We're going to see fluctuations from quarter-to-quarter. But I think the general trend is that what we saw in the first quarter was probably a low for the year. We expect there to be a more -- a slight increase as we go through the year, more comparable on average to what we saw last fiscal year.
J. Michael Hansen: And Andy, as it relates to your question about improved profitability, one of the comments I had made was that we've invested -- we continue to invest in the business, and we've invested in some offsite shredding facilities, and that allows us to replace the very expensive, large shredding trucks with much smaller box trucks. We use less fuel because of that. We're able to see more customers because we're not shredding on-site. And so we get a lot of leverage and efficiency once we start to fill those off-site shredding facilities up. Today, we've got excess capacity in those shredding facilities because, as we've talked, we've just created a number of those in the last year or so. So we've got, certainly, a plan to create more efficiency and become more profitable in the business.
Andrew J. Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: Got you. Can you help us get our arms around that trade-off from on-site to off-site shredding, what the economics look like, maybe the cost of a truck versus building a facility, just to help us understand what that could be?
William C. Gale: I would say, I really don't want to get into details of that because it's -- some of it's kind of a strategic thing on how we're structuring these things and what we're paying for them. So suffice it to say that you can get more volume on a per capital dollar basis through an off-site shredding than you certainly can with an on-site shredding.
Andrew J. Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: Fair enough. Jumping over to the core rental segment, then, can you talk a little bit about customer retention, the sales hiring pace and potentially the amount of new business that you're seeing in the market today?
J. Michael Hansen: Customer retention is -- remains very good. We're at historically pretty high levels, and we feel very good about that customer retention. Sales productivity is very good. New business continues to be the fuel for the growth, and I would say I don't see that necessarily stopping in the next several quarters. We feel very good about the execution in that area. And as far as continued growth in that business, we certainly would love to see some better employment, some add-stops pickup, but we're not ready to certainly say that we've seen a trend from that employment.
Andrew J. Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: Got it. So your sales force is flattish in terms of your headcount there?
J. Michael Hansen: Well, we strategically will look for opportunities to add reps when we can, when it makes sense, if we have capacity that we want to fill up in certain markets, if we have additional prospects that we identify in certain markets. So we're generally adding sales reps as we see opportunities, and that will continue to happen throughout the year. We've not made any significant investments like we did about 3 years ago. But we'll continue to look for opportunities where it makes sense.
Andrew J. Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: Okay. Last one for now, was -- can you describe just -- like the characteristic of the new business wins? Is it still roughly 50-50 split between a no-programmer versus a market share gain?
William C. Gale: I would say it's a little bit more no-programmer, probably 60%. We don't measure that every quarter, but the last time we looked at it, of course, in conjunction with the last fiscal year and basically looking, talking to our salespeople anecdotally, that seems to still be the case that it's a little more coming from the no-programmer. Competitive wins, sure, we're still there. We're still getting some competitive wins. But again, the preponderance or the -- let's say, the majority of the new business is no-programmers.
Operator: And we'll go next to Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer.
Scott A. Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division: Following up on that last question within rental. You've touched a bit on, obviously, new business, new programmers and then add-stops. Could you talk to pace of lost business? I imagine that, that stabilized nicely and perhaps an improvement for you in the overall picture. And then also taking it a step further into pricing and what type of environment you're seeing out there.
J. Michael Hansen: Retention, like I said, is still pretty strong, and we didn't see any change in trend. It's -- our retention has been pretty good for the last couple years and has gradually improved, but we didn't see any difference or change in trend in the quarter. From a pricing standpoint, it continues to be very aggressive. And particularly, when it comes to a customer renewal, we're still seeing very aggressive competition. And so pricing is competitive. We're in a relatively low inflationary environment. And as it relates to us going to our customers and looking for price increases, it's generally a customer-by-customer conversation, but it's one that's not as easy to do in a low inflationary environment and where there is very competitive prices at renewal time. So it's been a difficult environment for price increases. I wouldn't say that it's changed much from the last several quarters, but it continues to be very competitive.
Scott A. Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division: Okay. On the cost side, obviously, nothing like what you saw 2, 2.5 years ago. Cotton prices starting to swing from down year-over-year to up year-over-year. Could you just address that? It doesn't look like that's going to be a major issue, and you certainly operated well through it last time we saw a spike in those, but could you readdress it? Also, any initiatives with regard to synthetics or any changes?
William C. Gale: Well, the cotton price, what you -- the headlines are the spot prices, and they'll fluctuate just like all these other commodities do on a spot basis based on weather forecast and other things. Our global supply chain group is very cautious on ensuring that they have an adequate supply of low-cost products, and I am not too concerned right now by this recent increase. It's something we'll keep our eye on, but it certainly is nothing that I think is going to cause us any big difficulties going forward.
Scott A. Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division: Great. And just one more last. I noticed last sentence of the press release, discussion about guidance, including the impact of Affordable Care Act. Since the last that we heard from you, any changes in assumptions, expectations, strategy on how you may approach that? Still a lot up in the air, but just curious on an update.
William C. Gale: Yes, I don't think anything has changed from the 2 months ago when we talked about this initially. We put in our guidance and what we talked about our fourth quarter that we expected a 10- to 30-basis-point increase in medical cost due to the Affordable Care Act. I have no reason to say that any different today. I think there's still a lot of uncertainty. A lot of things are still up in the air as to what is going to be put in, how it's going to be put in. So as far as I'm concerned, really nothing has changed in the last couple of months. All I can kind of be confident in saying, it's going to be more expensive than it had been. And I think we have reflected that appropriately in the guidance.
Operator: And we'll go next to Nate Brochmann with William Blair.
Nathan Brochmann - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: I wanted to talk a little bit kind of around those last couple of questions. But when we talk about retention and we talk about pricing and the ability to bring on some new customers, whether it's a nonprogrammer or in a competitive bid, how important, at this point, is your diversity of services in terms of bringing that immediately to the table as an additional offering and something that maybe not all the other competitors offer? Is that helping you get in the door a little bit faster or winning a little bit more business or creating that additional retention above and beyond what you might have historically seen with maybe just 1 or 2 products?
William C. Gale: Well, certainly, I think it -- and it does, we've proven to ourselves that adding additional products and services to a customer improves the retention of that customer because the more things you do for the customer, the less likely it is you're going to lose that customer. So I don't think there's any question about that. I think the variety of offerings that we have gives us more opportunities for new business for different types of customers. So we don't always lead with Uniform Rental. Depending on what the customers' needs are, we may get in there initially on tile and carpet cleaning or document shredding or first aid and safety. And then, I think, once they begin to know us and see us, then we share with them opportunities of other things we could do for them. So I think the fact that we have so many different things that we do probably gives us a broader spectrum on which to go after new business.
Nathan Brochmann - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: And is that still being identified by route person? Or how is that kind of changing if you're looking at more of a enterprise, what's best for the customer and what's best for Cintas to lead with? How are you able to identify that via the fact that -- I know there's different sales forces within each different segment.
William C. Gale: Well, I think we've stratified our sales force to handle different-sized customers, different business units. So I think that's one way we do it. We have a fairly active marketing group that is constantly working with the sales organization, identifying prospects, identifying opportunities for all of our different service offerings or sale offerings. So it's -- with a sales force as large as we have, with the variety of different businesses we have, we've got a marketing committee for each of the businesses, which works -- meets every, what, 6 weeks, I think, to basically look at ways to penetrate other types of industry segments or other type of customers. So it's just a collaborative effort, Nate, that we're constantly looking for opportunities.
Nathan Brochmann - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: Okay. Yes, I mean -- and that sounds great. It's just, I mean, at the end of the day, I think you're seeing some really nice trends in -- particularly in those other services, as alluded to. I mean, obviously, some decent strength. Part of that is scale and maturity, but part of that is, I feel like, the broader sales effort is probably making a few more inroads than it used to.
William C. Gale: All right. Well, yes, well said. I totally agree with that.
Nathan Brochmann - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: And then just one last thing. I know you talked about this before, and people have asked you about it before, and I think it's probably still early and there's other macro things that mask this, but I think the more we see -- and every once in a while, we hear about another plant opening in terms of this kind of "nearshoring" on the heavy manufacturing-type theme, are you guys seeing any impact at all from that in terms of your somewhat industrial base of customers? Have you won any accounts that kind of feel that, that's been a benefit? And if so, do you think that there's anything to be said for whether that helps in terms of acceleration or not?
William C. Gale: I'm sure there are cases where that's helped. I could not give you any real examples. I -- obviously, if you open a manufacturing plant anywhere in the U.S. that previously had not been there, that's not only going to provide an opportunity for that particular customer, but all of the businesses that serve that new facility. And so I think it's a more gradual-type thing that certainly helps the overall economy continue to grow. So we've seen growth in the economy, albeit modest -- more modest than we all would like, but we've seen growth. We've seen growth in our business, and I think that certainly, that has been a factor to the extent that there's been creations of new businesses within a particular area. Unfortunately, you also have continued closures and reductions of -- or elimination of businesses as we go through there, so we haven't seen this rapid growth, but -- so I think it's there. It's just probably just one element of why we're seeing some modest growth.
Operator: And we'll go next to Sean Kim with RBC Capital Markets.
Sean Sun-Il Kim - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: My first question is regarding CapEx. I think your CapEx was less than $40 million in the quarter, and yet, you're still guiding to $240 million to $260 million for the full fiscal year. So there is -- it seems like it's a pretty -- there's an increase over the rest of the year. And I'm trying to understand, you said the pace of route capacity additions will probably be slower, and yet your CapEx, I think, is going to go up. So I'm trying to understand what's going on there.
William C. Gale: Probably the biggest reason, Sean, is as we talked about the CapEx guidance that we gave in July, which we've retained the same number, we indicated that one of the reasons for the relatively good-sized increase in CapEx and expectations in '14 versus '13 was the fact that we needed to build some new rental capacity, some new plants, and we had some initiatives on our ERP computer system. Those 2 items take a little bit longer to kind of work through the system. Decisions have to be made, we have to find land, we have to contract for the design of the building. So I would say that we would most likely see our CapEx higher as we go through the year under the presumption that we move forward with some of these new plants and with some of the ERP software initiatives that we thought we were going to do back in July. So we continue to evaluate that. As of right now, I have no reason to believe we're not going to do those things, and that's why we've retained the CapEx guidance where it's at.
Sean Sun-Il Kim - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: Okay. Just one last question. In terms of gross margins in the Rental Uniforms segment, do you think we've sort of hit -- it's gone down for the past, say, 4 quarters or so, and now we're beginning to anniversary the route capacity additions. So do you think we've sort of hit bottom there and we're going to see some leverage there going forward?
J. Michael Hansen: Well, I think we will. As we -- as our routes continue to get more efficient, we think that there will be some improvement there. But as Bill mentioned a little while ago, it really is hard to tell based on -- until we know where the revenue growth is going to continue to come from. If we were to see employment really pick up and our customers started hiring, we would really see some nice leveraging of those routes because we're adding revenue to the existing stops. If we continue to see the growth be driven by new accounts, then we may continue to add routes. And at some point, as Bill also said, we will add some plant capacity. And so it is dependent on where the revenue comes from. I would expect that our routes that we added last year will continue to get a little bit more efficient through this year.
Operator: And we'll go next to Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan.
Molly R. McGarrett - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: This is Molly McGarret for Andrew. I just have one brief one. Can you give your view on sort of long-term targets, what you're thinking for top line growth and operating margins relative to prior peaks? If you bring it through this cycle, what will drive that in terms of the length of the cycle or penetration rate? What kind of variable do you think will drive that?
William C. Gale: Well, Molly, as we have indicated on a number of occasions publicly and probably in previous calls, the top line growth rate that we're going to be able to achieve is going to be dependent, to a large extent, on the robustness of the economy. So let's put it this way: if we continue to see an economy growing as it has been for the last year or so, the growth rates that you're seeing today are probably what you're going to continue to see. We're not -- unless we see an acceleration of employment, we're not going to see an acceleration of our growth rates organically. With that said, I think as we've talked a lot about on this call, we also have initiatives underway to improve the profitability of our business where we're getting to scale in some of the newer businesses. We've done some things, I think, in the rental side that will continue to improve the profitability there. So I feel good about growth. I just would say that I'm not going to really believe that we can do something that's not possible organically unless the economy cooperates a little bit more robustly.
Operator: And we'll go next to Gregory Halter with Great Lakes Review.
Gregory W. Halter - LJR Great Lakes Review: I just wanted to be clear on what the rental business's organic revenue growth rate was, unadjusted, for the one less day?
J. Michael Hansen: I -- we don't really calculate it that way, Greg. The total...
Gregory W. Halter - LJR Great Lakes Review: Would it be the 5.0%?
J. Michael Hansen: Well, that was the total growth for the quarter, unadjusted. Yes.
William C. Gale: And there was no...
J. Michael Hansen: Actually, there was no acquisition price [ph].
William C. Gale: Yes, there were no acquisitions. So yes, it basically -- well, 5% -- adjusting for the workday, 6.7%, because there were no acquisitions.
J. Michael Hansen: Yes, right.
Gregory W. Halter - LJR Great Lakes Review: Okay. That sounds good. And in your guidance, I know you mentioned the -- I believe, you're modeling 122.5 million shares for the year. And in the guidance, on the EPS, does that assume that there won't be any further share repurchases or that they're not being counted in there?
J. Michael Hansen: That assumes that there will not be future share repurchases, yes.
William C. Gale: Now keep in mind, too, when Mike gave the outstanding shares, you've got to adjust for share equivalents that are sitting out there in the form of invested restricted stock and stock options. So that's one reason why the number is higher. I just want to make sure everybody understands that. But no, our assumption is that -- and that's included in our guidance, too, is that there would be no further share buybacks because we just don't have any basis on which to say what they would be.
Gregory W. Halter - LJR Great Lakes Review: Right. There's no 10b5-1 plan or anything like that in place?
William C. Gale: Well, I didn't say that, but I just...
Gregory W. Halter - LJR Great Lakes Review: Okay, one last one for you. On the rental business, I wonder if you could comment on how things like the fire-resistant clothing and Carhartt and womenswear are doing?
William C. Gale: Fire-resistant clothing continues to be a very nice business for us, Greg. This is where I'm very enthusiastic about government regulation because it is forcing a lot of customers to basically provide these type of garments to their employees. And as a result of that, being the largest FRC provider in the world, we're doing well there. That, coupled with the fact that the energy sector is a big user of that and continues to grow nicely in the U.S., obviously, has been one of the reasons that we've seen some growth there. Carhartt continues to be a star within the company. There is a unique set of workers and people in this country that like that product, and we're the only one who can offer that as a rental product, and it has certainly been beneficial to us and continues to do so, less so than the FRC, but it certainly is a benefit. Womenswear has picked up a little bit. I would say I'm not as enthusiastic about the growth there yet. I think we need to continue to develop the appropriate type of garments that are appealing to women in different types of jobs on a rental program. And so I would say it's better than it was, but it could be a lot better, and we're continuing to look at different things.
Operator: And we'll go next to Andrew Wittmann with Robert W. Baird.
Andrew J. Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: There's been a lot of talk about penetrating the health care market, I think, in the industry broadly. Can you just talk about some of your services that you're offering to the health care industry, some of the initiatives that you have in place? What would be really helpful is giving us some sort of size about the level of revenue that you're generating today from the health care industry and what your outlook is on for the growth rate there.
William C. Gale: I certainly think health care opportunities will continue to be one of the reasons why we will grow. And the penetration rate is still very low. The focus that we have in health care from a rental side is more in the facility services and providing products that can enable a health care institution to provide the sanitation they need to avoid the in-house problems that they have with infectious diseases and that sort of thing. So we've worked with health care to come up with some products that can help keep their place cleaner and, on a rental basis, that provides cost-saving opportunities to the health care institution, and we're continuing to do that. We've made some inroads, but it's still small. We're not really focusing on the garments of the nurses and the health care providers that you would see, that you would just generally see, but rather looking at scrub rentals and the facility services-type products. Now, of course, health care is a big industry for us in the Document Management business and continues to be a driver in the growth of that business because of the privacy protection laws that all health care institutions need to worry about.
Andrew J. Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: Can you help us by giving us a general size of that business, Bill or Mike?
William C. Gale: No, I don't have that information available. And even if I did, Andy, I probably wouldn't be able to share it with you.
Operator: And that concludes our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Bill Gale for closing remarks.
William C. Gale: I want to thank everyone, again, for joining us this evening. We are very happy with these results, given the environment we're operating in, and we feel good about this year. So thank you, and we'll look forward to speaking with you in December, right before the holidays, when we announce our second quarter earnings.
Operator: Thank you, everyone. That does conclude today's conference. We thank you for your participation.

Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Cintas Quarterly Earnings Results Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Bill Gale, Senior Vice President of Finance and Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead, sir.
William C. Gale: Good evening. Thank you for joining us as we report our fourth quarter results for fiscal 2013. With me is Mike Hansen, Cintas' Vice President and Treasurer. After some commentary on the results, we will be happy to answer questions. The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a safe harbor from civil litigation for forward-looking statements. This conference call contains forward-looking statements that reflect the company's current views as to future events and financial performance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ materially from those we may discuss. I refer you to the discussion on these points contained in our most recent filings with the SEC. We are pleased to report fourth quarter revenue of $1,129,000,000, which represents record quarterly revenue for Cintas and growth of 7.2% from last year's fourth quarter. Organic growth, which adjusts for the impact of acquisitions, was 6.2%. Our operating income was $153.9 million, which is 13.6% of revenue, an improvement over the 13.4% in last year's fourth quarter. This operating margin improvement comes despite adding route capacity during the past 3 quarters, material cost headwinds due to a high volume of new business sold during the fiscal year and a reduction in recycled paper prices of about $10 per ton during the fourth quarter compared to last year's fourth quarter. Fourth quarter net income increased by 9.4% to $86 million. Earnings per diluted share were $0.69, a 15% increase over last year's fourth quarter EPS of $0.60. Our EPS growth rate was higher than our net income growth rate because of the positive impact of our share buyback program. We purchased roughly $338 million of Cintas stock in the last 15 months, which certainly had a positive impact on our EPS growth rate. During the fourth quarter of fiscal '13, we purchased about $28 million of Cintas stock, which brought our fiscal year 2013 purchases to roughly $208 million. As of May 31, we had about $162 million available under the current board authorization for future share purchases. May 31 marked the conclusion of a very successful year at Cintas, one in which we achieved both record sales and earnings per share levels. Fiscal '13 revenue topped $4.3 billion, and earnings per share grew 11% to $2.52. This was the third consecutive fiscal year of double-digit earnings per share growth. In fact, our EPS grew 80% in that 3-year period. Operating income for fiscal 2013 grew by 4.7% over last year to $565 million. This operating income increase came despite a negative year-over-year recycled paper price impact in excess of $13 million. This resulted in a drag on operating margin of 30 basis points. In addition, operating income increased despite the addition of route capacity during the final 3 quarters of the fiscal year. This route capacity was necessary due to the solid new business sales during the last few years. Our employees, who we call partners, continue to do a great job of executing our game plan in order to achieve these record fiscal 2013 results. Now I would like to turn the call over to Mike for more details on the fourth quarter, after which, I will provide additional comments on our fiscal 2014 guidance.
J. Michael Hansen: Thanks, Bill, and good evening. As Bill mentioned, total revenue increased 7.2% from the fourth quarter of last year, with total company organic growth being 6.2%. Total company gross margin for the fourth quarter was 41.4%, which is down from last year's fourth quarter gross margin of 42.1% but slightly better than this year's third quarter gross margin of 41.1%. I will discuss these items in more detail by segment. Before doing so, let me remind you that there were 66 workdays in our fourth quarter, which is the same as last year's fourth quarter. In fiscal '14, we will have 65 workdays in each quarter for a total of 260 workdays. This creates year-over-year workday differences in each quarter except the second and results in 1 less workday for the entire fiscal year. We have 4 reportable operating segments: Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products; Uniform Direct Sales; First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection Services and Document Management Services. Uniform Direct Sales, First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection Services and Document Management Services are combined and presented as other services on the face of the income statement. The Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products operating segment consists of the rental and servicing of uniforms, mats, towels and other related items. The segment also includes restroom supplies and other facility products and services. Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products revenue accounted for 70% of company revenue in the fourth quarter and totaled $785 million, which is up 4.8% compared to last year's fourth quarter. Organic growth was also 4.8%. Within rental, based on fourth quarter revenue levels, uniform rental accounted for approximately 52% of the segment's revenue. Dust control, which is mainly entrance mats, accounted for 19%; hygiene and other services, which is restroom supply, cleaning services and chemical services, was 16%; shop towel revenue was 5% and linen and other, which is mainly nonperson-specific garments such as aprons and butcher coats, was 8%. Our rental segment gross margin was 42.1% for the fourth quarter, down from 43.3% in last year's fourth quarter. Energy-related costs were 20 basis points higher than last year's fourth quarter. The remaining decrease compared to last year was due to the route capacity added during fiscal '13 and material costs being higher than last year due to the high levels of new business sold in the past year. The fourth quarter gross margin of 42.1% improved from the 41.9% in the third quarter. Energy-related costs were 10 basis points higher than the third quarter. The gross margin improvement is mainly due to the fourth quarter having 2 more workdays than the third quarter. Our Uniform Direct Sales operating segment includes the direct sale of uniforms and other related products sold to national and regional customers. Uniforms and other related products are also sold to local customers, including products sold to rental customers through our direct sale catalog. Uniform Direct Sales revenue accounted for 11% of company revenue in the fourth quarter and totaled $124.7 million, which represented sales growth of 12.1% compared to last year's fourth quarter. In the fourth quarter, we concluded several large rollouts in our Fortune 1000 business that began in the third quarter. Uniform Direct Sales gross margin was 30.8% for the fourth quarter, consistent with last year's fourth quarter gross margin of 30.7%. Our gross margin of $38.5 million represents a 12.6% increase over last year. The fourth quarter gross margin of 30.8% is an increase over the 29.2% gross margin in the third quarter. This improvement is mainly due to an improved mix of higher margin hospitality sales in the fourth quarter. Our First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection Services operating segment includes revenue from the sale and servicing of first aid products, safety products and training and fire protection products. First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection revenue, which accounted for 11% of company revenue in the fourth quarter, was $125.4 million. This is our highest quarterly revenue amount for this segment and represents an increase of 15.1% over last year's fourth quarter revenue. Organic growth was 8.9%. Revenue for the year was $460.6 million, which is record annual revenue for the segment. Our First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection Services employee partners had an outstanding year. This segment's gross margin was 43.5% in the fourth quarter, which is up 110 basis points from the 42.4% in last year's fourth quarter. This improvement is due to better leveraging of the infrastructure, as well as an improved mix of higher margin sales than in last year's fourth quarter. The gross margin of 43.5% is below the 44% gross margin in the third quarter due to a seasonal change in mix. Our third quarter generally has more cold and flu-related items, which have very good gross margins. Our Document Management Services operating segment includes document destruction, storage and imaging services, and it accounted for 8% of fourth quarter total company revenue. Document Management revenue totaled $94 million, which is record quarterly revenue for this segment and is 11.3% higher than last year's fourth quarter. Revenue increased organically by 6.7% compared to last year. Average recycled paper prices remain relatively low at about $140 per ton, which is about $10 per ton lower than last year's fourth quarter average. The fourth quarter gross margin was 46.4%, which is down 40 basis points compared to last year's fourth quarter gross margin of 46.8%. Energy-related expenses were 40 basis points lower in this year's fourth quarter than in last year's fourth quarter. The gross margin decrease is mainly due to opening a number of off-site shredding facilities. These facilities have significantly more capacity than our on-site shredding trucks and will create operational efficiencies and leverage opportunity as volume continues to grow. Switching the selling and administrative expenses, SG&A was 27.8% as a percentage of revenue in the fourth quarter, which is down from last year's fourth quarter figure of 28.8%. Medical expenses were 30 basis points lower than in last year's fourth quarter. As we discussed last quarter, we are self-insured, so medical expenses can tend to fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter. Amortization of acquisition-related expenses decreased by 30 basis points as compared to last year. And finally, we continue to manage our cost structure and had better leverage of our G&A functions during this year's fourth quarter. Our effective tax rate was 37.4% for the quarter compared to 36.2% last year. The effective tax rate can fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter based on tax reserve builds and releases relating to specific discrete items. For the full fiscal 2013 year, our effective tax rate was 36.9%, which is relatively consistent with last year's 36.8%. Turning now to the balance sheet. Our cash and marketable securities were $358 million at May 31, up $112 million from the $246 million at February 28. This increase was due to cash generated from operations, which was roughly $184 million in the fourth quarter. Included in the $358 million at May 31 was $51 million of cash located outside of the U.S. Accounts receivable was consistent with the balance at February 28. DSOs were just below 40, which is slightly better than the third quarter level of 40. New goods inventory at May 31 was $240 million, down $7 million from February 28, due mainly to the sale of inventory associated with several large uniform direct sale customers. Despite higher sales this year, the new goods inventory is down about $11 million from last year's May 31 level due to improved inventory management. In-service inventory grew to $497 million at May 31, up from the $482 million at February 28 due to continued sales of new rental customers without much change in net adds from customers. Accrued liabilities increased $33 million compared to February 28, primarily due to increases in accrued bond interest and accrued profit-sharing. Long-term debt at May 31 was $1.3 billion. As of May 31, our total debt-to-EBITDA remains slightly below 2x. As I already mentioned, cash provided by operating activities in the fourth quarter was $184 million, which is up 14% from last year's fourth quarter amount of $162 million. CapEx for the fourth quarter was $44.7 million. Our CapEx by operating segment was as follows: $31.7 million in rental; $1.5 million in Uniform Direct Sales; $3.1 million in First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection and $8.4 million in Document Management. Our total CapEx for fiscal '13 was $196 million. We expect CapEx for fiscal 2014 to be in the range of $240 million to $260 million. This expected fiscal '14 amount is higher than fiscal '13 due to continued implementation of our enterprise-wide system and due to an anticipated need for rental processing capacity in several markets. I'll now turn the call over to Bill for comments on our fiscal 2014 guidance.
William C. Gale: Thanks, Mike. Our fiscal 2014 guidance is for revenue to be in the range of $4.5 million to $4.6 billion and earnings per diluted share to be in the range of $2.66 to $2.75. Let me provide some color and walk through a few assumptions so you can better understand the guidance. As Mike mentioned, our fiscal 2014 year will have 1 less workday than fiscal 2013. This will have a negative impact on fiscal '14's revenue growth as well as EPS. Fiscal '13 also had 1 less workday than the previous year, and this had a negative 40 basis point impact on fiscal '13's revenue growth rate. The negative EPS impact of 1 less workday is due to a number of our large expenses, including rental material cost, depreciation and amortization, being determined on a monthly basis instead of a workday basis. One less work day results in 1 less day of revenue to cover these expenses. As Scott Farmer indicated in our press release, the U.S. economy has shown some signs of improvement in the past several months. However, much uncertainty and unevenness remains. Just last week, a number of economists lowered their second quarter GDP forecast to below 1.5%, with softer second half 2013 forecasts as well. Evidence of this uncertainty continues to show itself by our customers' reluctance to hire. Our net add-stops metric was negative in the fourth quarter and worse than the fourth quarter of the previous 2 years. It is true that overall U.S. employment figures have strengthened in the past several months. However, 2/3 of the job gains in the past 4 months have been in industries not typically strong for our rental programs: financial and information services; professional and business services, including temporary employees; education and food service. We certainly hope to see broader strengthening in employment in the coming months, but we have not seen it yet. We have modeled our fiscal '14 guidance with the expectation that this current uncertain economic climate will remain. We have not assumed any deterioration in the U.S. economy. There are a number of factors causing the current uncertain environment in the U.S. economy: future Federal Reserve action and its impact on the interest rate environment; the impact of worsening economies in Europe and China, to name a few. The Affordable Care Act is certainly one of those factors, and it has a direct impact on our cost structure. The Affordable Care Act includes new costs such as the transitional reinsurance fee, which is scheduled to begin in 2014 and other associated administrative and reporting expenses. As a result, we expect fiscal 2014 medical expenses as a percent of revenue to be higher than fiscal 2013 by 10 to 30 basis points. Note that while we do have available capacity under our current share buyback program, we have not considered any additional buybacks in the fiscal '14 guidance. One final comment on the fiscal '14 expectations. We expect the year-over-year comparisons for our first quarter to be very difficult for 3 reasons. First, the first quarter has 1 less workday in it than last year's first quarter. This will have a negative impact on both the revenue growth rate and operating margins, particularly in the rental segment. Secondly, current recycled paper prices are roughly $45 per ton, lower than last year's first quarter average. This will create a negative $3 million to $5 million year-over-year impact on our Document Management segment's first quarter revenue and operating income. And finally, we started adding route capacity in the second quarter of fiscal 2013. As a result, last year's first quarter had the highest gross margin of the fiscal 2013 year. While these added routes will help us continue to grow revenues, route efficiency is certainly affected, especially compared to last year's first quarter. This concludes our prepared remarks, and we will now be glad to answer any of your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And we will take our first question from Joe Box with KeyBanc Capital Markets.
Joe Box - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: Just a question for you on the new guidance. How are you guys thinking about the organic revenue growth for the uniform rental and ancillary business? I'm just kind of curious how sticky that mid-single-digit growth rate is.
William C. Gale: That's pretty well built into our guidance, would be an expectation at that level.
J. Michael Hansen: Yes, as I mentioned, Joe, there was no difference between the total growth and the organic growth in the rental business in our fourth quarter, and we haven't factored in any rental acquisitions in that guidance.
Joe Box - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: Perfect. And a quick back-of-the-envelope math suggests that operating margins should be somewhere between, I think, 12.7% to 13.4% next year. Just from a sensitivity standpoint, what really needs to happen to get you guys to the higher end of that range? And I guess conversely, what needs to happen that -- or what could happen that would push you to the lower end of the range?
William C. Gale: Well, I would say there are several things that would push us to the higher end of the range. One would be a pickup in our adds over stops, resulting in more revenue per stop in our rental business due to maybe new hires or I guess existing customers adding on new hires or services. Another opportunity to get to the higher end would be higher paper prices than what we may be anticipating. A third thing could be that maybe we are being a little too conservative on the impact of the Affordable Care Act. Third thing could be -- or fourth thing could be lower energy prices. I think there's a lot of speculation of what may happen with energy prices. We presume that energy prices in '14 will be comparable to what we saw in '13, which, in the fourth quarter, were about 3.2% of revenue.
Joe Box - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: Perfect. And Bill, can you remind me what percentage medical expense was in 4Q?
William C. Gale: 3.5%.
J. Michael Hansen: I think it was 3.3%.
William C. Gale: 3.3%.
Joe Box - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: Was that pretty consistent throughout the year?
J. Michael Hansen: Well, in the third quarter, we talked about that it was at the -- we've seen medical expenses be in the 3% to 4% of revenue range. And our third quarter, we were at the top of that range or the higher end of that range. So the fourth quarter was kind of a, certainly, a reduction from the third quarter levels that we saw. For the year, we were kind of in that mid-3% range.
Operator: And we will now take our next question from Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan.
Andrew C. Steinerman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Could you give a quick comment on CapEx expected for the coming year?
William C. Gale: Yes, we're expecting $240 million to $260 million, Andrew. And as Mike mentioned in his comments, this is up from what we've seen in the last couple of years, one, due to continuation of the rollout of our enterprise resource filing software and -- but secondly, we're at -- we're going to be -- we're anticipating the need to build some rental capacity in some selected markets. So that guidance assumes the opening of some new rental capacity.
Andrew C. Steinerman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Okay. And do you feel like this elevated level of CapEx will go down in the following year?
William C. Gale: Depends on what happens with the revenue growth. If revenue accelerates, then we may be looking at some more rental capacity.
Andrew C. Steinerman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Okay. And then any assumptions in fiscal year 2014 guidance of paper prices changing? Or are you just taking paper prices where they are currently?
William C. Gale: Kind of where we saw them in fiscal '13.
Andrew C. Steinerman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Okay. And then lastly, I didn't quite understand your ACA comment. Given that the penalties have been pushed off, what are the nature of the ACA's comments that you feel will be impacting 2014? And over what timeframe within 2014 do you think these expenses will come?
William C. Gale: Well, January 1 is when these expenses come. So just because of the recent change, as we understand it, in businesses not having to provide health insurance doesn't impact those companies that are continuing to provide health insurance, and that we are going to have to start paying these additional taxes and fees associated with the Affordable Care Act. So that, as far as we've been able to ascertain, is still in place. The other thing that we are anticipating is that due to the uncertainty surrounding exchanges, due to the fact that many employers might drop coverage, we don't know what's going to happen, we think the participation rate on the part of our employee base may increase either by employees themselves coming on because maybe they've been covered under their spouse coverage or not carrying insurance at all, or may be now they'll convert their family coverage over to Cintas' plan for maybe what their spouse's plan has been. So all of those factors go into effect and therefore, we think that the increases will start in the last 5 months of our fiscal year, which will begin January 1.
Operator: And we will now go to Nate Brochmann with William Blair & Company.
Nathan Brochmann - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: I wanted to follow up on that real quick, Bill, in terms of the CapEx spend in terms of some new capacity. Are those in new markets where you're seeing expanded business? Are those in some old markets where, during the downturn, you took away capacity and now you're adding some back? Could you talk a little bit just in terms of how to think about that?
William C. Gale: They're actually in existing markets where we're currently at. And I would tell you, it's not due to the fact that we eliminated capacity necessarily, but rather that we have been growing in those markets at a rate that we are just bursting at the seams and needing to build capacity.
Nathan Brochmann - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: Okay. Good, and that's encouraging from that angle. And then kind of second, one of the things where you have done a great job is kind of penetrating some of your customers with some of the newer services, as well as just kind of converting some of the nonprogrammers in the face of the add-stop metric. Is that pretty much obviously somewhat embedded in your forecast going into next year in terms of kind of those penetrations in that way that you have grown over the last couple of years is kind of continuing? And in the face of all this uncertainty, and you're absolutely right with all the government issues, are some of those customers that have been very eager to add some of those new services, is that getting incrementally harder at this point? Or is it still in the face of a sluggish environment, still pretty readily accepted in terms of being able to -- in terms of the sales cycle being about the same length?
William C. Gale: Well, I -- you asked a lot there. I think generally, our guidance is assuming we'll continue to see the very good results in new business from new customers, primarily no-programmers or the majority, which are no-programmers, but as well as some competitive wins. So again, higher cost initially with that kind of growth; obviously, some additional pressure on capacity, et cetera. So that's what's assumed in our guidance. We are continuing to do some penetration of other products and services with customers -- with existing customers, and we'll continue to focus on that, things like chemical dispensing and some of the facility services product -- products. But when you really look through the impact of where the growth is coming from in rental, it's primarily driven by new customer wins, and that's what our assumption is continuing to go forward. It's what we've seen through the last couple of years, really.
Nathan Brochmann - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: Okay. And then just one last quick one in terms of those new wins. I know typically on a brand-new customer, you don't see a lot of competitive pressures. But how's the overall pricing environment? And then I'll turn it over.
William C. Gale: Very, very competitive. It is no different than what it's been for the last couple of years. And I would tell you, we are seeing some competition on no-programmers because some of our big competitors have actually started doing the same approach and often, a customer can be fairly sophisticated, and they may bring in another supplier. So it is, certainly, still a competitive situation.
Operator: And we will now go to Andrew Wittmann with Robert W. Baird.
Andrew J. Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: So just, I guess, building on Nate's question a little bit, can you just talk about retention rates of customers and how your service levels maybe compared this year versus last year?
William C. Gale: We have seen improvement. Our rental management made a concerted effort to really improve our lost [ph] business rates, and I think they've done a nice job and that. The trend is going in the right direction, focusing on service as well as some of the additional products that we have. So it has improved from the prior year or 2.
Andrew J. Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: Great. And then just to dig into the direct sale, you guys kind of alluded to -- it sounded like finishing up some of the larger rollouts. Are there still other large rollouts that are ongoing? It appears that there's some -- obviously, the segment's done well and I just want to kind of understand what we should be expecting here over the next couple of quarters.
William C. Gale: Well, I would say that the big rollouts began, Andrew, in primarily the third quarter and continued through the fourth. I don't see a repeat of those big rollouts, but we won't really see -- we're working on new ones obviously, but our guidance doesn't assume any big rollouts in '14, but rather kind of a status quo of the revenues that we saw in '13.
Andrew J. Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: Okay. So just on a run rate basis here then, is -- does 1Q feel a little bit like 4Q?
William C. Gale: I don't -- we really don't get into specific quarters. I'd just tell you, for the year, it's just a modest growth in the direct sale business.
J. Michael Hansen: Yes, with the real large rollouts in the second half of the year, our fiscal '14 Uniform Direct Sale is going to have a hard time growing much over those large amounts. Generally, we like to see that Uniform Direct Sales number, over time, grow in the mid-single digits, and it's continued to do that even though it is pretty lumpy. But I would say, again, I'd say that we've got a little bit better comps in the first half of the year. In the second half of the year, it's going to be tough to see much growth.
Andrew J. Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: Yes. Okay. That makes sense. And just digging into the balance sheet a little bit here, can you talk about kind of priorities of capital, recognizing that you still do have some capacity on the buyback program? Typically, there's a -- we see a dividend hike somewhere here later in the year. And then just the M&A environment as well, I'd just like to get some of your thoughts on that.
William C. Gale: Well, it hasn't -- our desire really hasn't changed much. We want to use the cash, number one, to grow the business through additional capacity and other needs that we have. Secondly, we'd love to make good acquisitions. But as you can see from the results, we didn't make a whole lot of acquisitions during the year, but I'd say that's due to a -- not a lack of desire on our part, but rather a lack of good opportunities, so we continue to stay disciplined. You -- certainly, the past 30 years have shown that we continue to increase the dividend every year, and that decision will be made later this calendar year by the board. And then the share buybacks, we still have money left under the current authorization, and we've got a lot of cash sitting there. And obviously, we will follow the direction of the board to execute on that buyback as conditions warrant.
Andrew J. Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: In terms of the dividend, is it fair to think about the dividend growth rate in line with the earnings growth rate? I mean historically, that's been a fairly good proxy. Is there anything different that might change that today, Bill?
William C. Gale: I really can't comment on that, Andrew, because the board will discuss that at their future meetings. But certainly, history tends to be an indication of the future, so I would say it should increase.
Operator: And we will now go to John Healy with Northcoast Research.
John M. Healy - Northcoast Research: Bill, I wanted to ask a little bit more about your guidance. When I look at kind of what you put out last year in terms of the top line band, and pretty comparable in terms of the band that you put out this year, so when you think about the impact of the Affordable Care Act, are you guys more concerned with the uncertainty regarding what it could do to the demand side of your business? Or is it just that from a cost perspective, it's really just not known to you yet? So I'm trying to understand the guidance and what part has maybe more risk to it.
William C. Gale: Well, I'm concerned on both parts. But to me, the economy and what the impact of this thing could have on the attitude of businesses to hire employees is probably more of a long-term concern to me than anything else. And I think that there is a tremendous amount of concern on the part of many businesses of what this could do to them, even though there may have been some rule changes that businesses don't have to necessarily provide health insurance next year if they have over 50 employees. Those companies that do have over 50 employees realize that the cost of providing that insurance to every employee is going to go up, just like we're anticipating it's going to go up. And then, of course, the issue is what happens in '15 when these rules get reinstated as far as businesses. So John, there's so much uncertainty out there that I think businesses are -- don't like uncertainty. And as a result of that, I think they're being cautious. But it's not just the Affordable Care Act. As I mentioned in the comments, what's the Fed going to do? What interest -- what's going to happen with interest rates? What's going to happen in China? How's the European economy going to impact us? All of that stuff is weighing on people's decision of how much they should invest and that has impact, ultimately, on us and how fast and how much more we can grow. So I think we've done a pretty darn good job as a company over the last few years adapting to this environment. Sure, we'd like faster growth from our existing customers, but it hasn't been there. So we've been able to go out and get new business, and hopefully, we've got a lot of pent-up demand that ultimately will generate additional business for us as confidence builds.
John M. Healy - Northcoast Research: Got you. And I might have missed it, but were you guys able to quantify what the estimate is on the ACA act on the cost structure for '14?
William C. Gale: Yes, we said 10 to 30 basis points is our current estimate.
John M. Healy - Northcoast Research: Okay. I have a question on the document management side of the business. We came across you guys partnering up with a national retailer to offer the shredding side of the offering. I was wondering if that's something you're looking to do more of? And do you see an opportunity to maybe even do some other -- cross-sell other parts of the business with some of the office stores out there?
William C. Gale: I don't see a lot of that going on. We did partner with that one retailer. It hasn't really been any significant part of our business. And at this point, I don't really see too much expansion of that.
John M. Healy - Northcoast Research: Okay. Great. And just one housekeeping. Mike, I was wondering if you could give us, by quarter, maybe the comps for the paper market so we could better model that?
J. Michael Hansen: The actual prices in fiscal '13 first quarter were $170; second quarter, $150; third quarter, $140; fourth quarter, $140.
Operator: And we will now go to Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel, Nicolaus.
Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: Bill, when did that add-stop metric turn [ph] down? It looked pretty optimistic at the end of the last quarter, and I'm not sure if you said it's head taking [ph] number 4, number 5 or number 6 over the last few years.
William C. Gale: Yes, we were a little surprised at that too, Shlomo. It happened shortly after we announced our earnings back in March, so we had seen a tick-up late in the third quarter, and then we got into kind of the spring and it kind of turned the other way on us. And it was interesting how one of other -- our other national competitors saw the same thing happened with their business that they announced a couple of weeks ago.
Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: And it just looks like -- I mean, not adjust [ph] , but it looks like it's attributable to kind of macro uncertainty in terms of the hiring side. Is that what you guys are thinking?
William C. Gale: That's what we're -- yes, it's certainly not an individual thing for our customers. It's more of a macro thing.
Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: Okay. And then where did you guys come out in the fourth quarter versus your internal plan, both like revenue and margin? Were you guys in line, above, below? How did it do versus what you thought you would do?
William C. Gale: Well, we have a plan at the beginning of the year, but then we have to adjust it for reality as we go through the year. And I would say based on what we saw happening through the year, we pretty much finished in line.
Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: And the fourth quarter as well, I mean, you say going into the fourth quarter?
William C. Gale: Again, if I take the plan as it may, I thought it might be a year ago, I would say we finished under that plan. But as we went through the year, we adjusted to reality and we finished in line with our expectations.
Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: Okay. I understand. And then you guys had a particularly strong cash from ops. So you had good free cash flow in the fourth quarter. I was wondering, do you anticipate -- one of the items were working capital items, it seems. Do you anticipate a reversal of that? Or is there something sustainable in the way that you guys can grow that? I'm just wondering if the cash from ops might -- is there a potential for that to go down at the same time CapEx goes up, so you find a particularly narrow free cash flow year as opposed to what we saw this year?
William C. Gale: We got a little bit of benefit in the fourth quarter from inventory reduction due to the fact we had built up some inventory for some of these direct sale rollouts, and we then dissipated that inventory as we roll those out. So I don't think you'll see a repeat of that. Everything else should be in line, though. So there'll be -- probably a minor increase, a relatively minor increase in inventory levels as we go through '14, which, obviously, would have the offset effect that we saw in the fourth quarter.
Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: Okay. And then First Aid has been growing very nicely for a while. I was wondering if you can just give us a little bit more detail as to -- we've seen the pickup in that growth. It seems the year-over-year growth was particularly strong. What's the, I guess, a near term 1 or 2 years outlook for this business? And secondly, how have you guys done such a good job over there?
William C. Gale: Well, first, I want to credit our management team in the first aid group. I think they've really done a nice job and the sales team also. But what it has been, Shlomo, is the fact that we've now got more of a national footprint, and we're able to provide these First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection Services to national customers. So we're focusing on some of that, and that's increased the growth. The other thing that they -- that the business unit has done is expanded their product offerings, especially in things like training. And that has been very, very well received in the marketplace. So I think it's a combination of the national footprint's there. Therefore, we can provide coverage to a lot of national customers, and we've got a pretty broad offering of products and services within that group that are very appealing to helping companies maintain compliance with laws and regulations.
Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: So how should I think about the growth of that? Is this like a double-digit grower going forward now?
William C. Gale: Yes, I think so. I think it's a double-digit, low teens type growth rate in an economy like we've seen.
Operator: And we will now go to Dan Dolev with Jefferies.
Dan Dolev - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division: Just 2 quick questions. The first one, again, on the organic growth in the rental business. You did just mention now that you got a little bit caught by surprise on a sort of unexpected weakness. How has that looked in the last few weeks or month or so? Because you were much more positive. I think in February you said there was quite a little bit of life in that business. And how does that look -- how is it looking in the last few weeks?
William C. Gale: It's comparable to what we saw late in the fourth quarter, Dan, and all that was factored into the guidance that we provided. We still are very bullish on the new business and therefore, we still anticipate that the rental segment will grow organically in fiscal '14.
Dan Dolev - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division: Okay. And then just a quick question on the organic growth in the Document Management business. The comps seem to be much easier this quarter, and yet the acceleration is lower than it was in the last quarter. How much of that is paper prices versus demand?
J. Michael Hansen: I'll give you -- sometimes, we'll talk about the growth without recycling, and our organic growth in the fourth quarter without recycling was 8.9%. That is a nice increase over the 7.1% in the third quarter, and we've seen steady improvement in that organic growth rate without the recycling for the last 5 quarters. So after the shocks of the up and downs of paper, now that paper has kind of steadied out over the last 3 quarters, we've seen some real nice organic growth improvement in the business.
Operator: And we will now go to Greg Halter with Great Lakes Review.
Gregory W. Halter - LJR Great Lakes Review: Wondered if you have your -- the rate on your debt that you're paying now? I think last time, it was around 4.5%. Is that still the case?
J. Michael Hansen: It is. Yes, there has been no change, and it's all fixed rate debt.
Gregory W. Halter - LJR Great Lakes Review: All right. And your tax rate expectations for fiscal '14, probably around 37%?
J. Michael Hansen: Yes, we've modeled 37.3%, which is kind of where we've opened the last few years as well.
Gregory W. Halter - LJR Great Lakes Review: All right. And I know the SAP is an ongoing program, but have you seen any benefits that you can quantify at this point?
William C. Gale: We've seen some benefits in a couple of the early conversions, obviously, in the finance group and the Global Supply Chain group. We've seen some of the benefits we were anticipating. It's still too soon to see them as we're rolling it out into our first venture in any of our business groups. We've had a few hiccups, but nothing serious. But I would say right now, we are continuing to expect to roll it out company-wide, but we want to make sure that we're successful in the initial business rollout first.
Gregory W. Halter - LJR Great Lakes Review: All right. And what's the performance of Europe and the outlook there for your business overseas?
William C. Gale: Pretty much run for profit, improve margins, generate cash. Right now, it's doing reasonably well. It's not growing a lot, but that's by design. And we are continuing to take some of the marketing and operating ideas that we have done here in the States, have been successful and applying them over in Europe with some degree of success. So I would say that it's kind of let's prove out that what we've invested in made sense and it can generate the kind of profits and cash flow that we originally anticipated.
Gregory W. Halter - LJR Great Lakes Review: All right. And on your CapEx, the $240 million to $260 million, I mean, obviously, most would go into the rental. But if you were to look at the other businesses on a percentage of what you expect to spend there, how would that play out?
William C. Gale: Well Rental will be the biggest part. It's 70% of the revenue, and it's a major capital user with the equipment facilities and trucks. The next biggest area, of course, is Document Management, and they would be the next highest percentage of capital. We will really break down our CapEx expectations by business unit. We'll report what it actually was after the fact, but that will give you some idea where it's going to.
Gregory W. Halter - LJR Great Lakes Review: All right. And one last one, do you have the number of shares either bought in the quarter or for the year? When I look at your cash flow statement, it shows $216 million and I think, Bill, you cited $208 million for fiscal '13. There may be some timing there.
J. Michael Hansen: We have purchased $200 -- almost $208 million during the fiscal year, which was a 5-point -- just under 5.1 million shares. There's a little bit of a difference on the balance sheet between the two -- from the $208 million because we do buy back some shares related to our equity compensation program and stock option exercises. So there's a little bit of a difference there.
Operator: And we will now go to Sara Gubins with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Sara Gubins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Sorry if I missed any of this, but could you talk about the rate at which you're continuing [ph] route capacity?
J. Michael Hansen: Sara, did you say the rate at which we're adding route capacity?
Sara Gubins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Yes.
J. Michael Hansen: Well, as you -- as we mentioned, we started to add route capacity in our second quarter and continued to do that into the third and fourth quarters. As we move into '14, we will -- because of the new business performance, we'll likely continue to add routes, probably a little bit less and a little bit more strategic than in fiscal '13. So probably not quite as many coming in the next year as we did in fiscal '13.
Sara Gubins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Okay. Great. And then separately, as you think about M&A opportunities over time, how do you think about what the split between what might be additive to existing businesses versus acquisitions that could be more of a branch-out into ancillary or really new areas?
William C. Gale: We're primarily, at this point, focused more on acquisitions that would be additive towards our existing segments. I don't see us, at this point, really aggressively going after a new leg of the stool in the next year or 2.
Sara Gubins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: So more geographic than anything else or...
William C. Gale: No, a lot -- geographic is part of it, but it's probably more tuck-in, where we can buy a facility or a business in an area that we're already in and combine that with our existing operations.
J. Michael Hansen: Really has to do with where -- if we can find a tuck-in opportunity at a good value, we certainly love those kind of acquisition opportunities, and that can happen wherever we have current operations.
Operator: And it appears there are no further questions at this time. Mr. Gale, I'd like to turn the conference back to you for any additional or closing remarks.
William C. Gale: I just want to thank everyone for joining us. I know it's a very busy time with earnings season, and we're off-cycle, but this is the one that always fits in with everybody, all the calendar year companies. So thank you for the attendance. I hope everyone has a good rest of the summer, and we'll speak with you in the latter part of September as we report first quarter results.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. We thank you for your participation.

Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Cintas Quarterly Earnings Results Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Bill Gale, Senior Vice President of Finance and Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead, sir.
William C. Gale: Thank you for joining us this evening. With me is Mike Hansen, Cintas' Vice President and Treasurer. After some commentary on the results, we will be happy to answer questions. The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a safe harbor from civil litigation for forward-looking statements. This conference call contains forward-looking statements that reflect the company's current views as to future events and financial performance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ materially from those we may discuss. I refer you to the discussion on these points contained in our most recent filings with the SEC. We are pleased to report third quarter revenue of $1,076,000,000, which represents record quarterly revenue for Cintas and growth of 6.3% from last year's third quarter. Organic growth, which adjusts for the impact of acquisitions and the impact of 1 less workday compared to last year's third quarter, was 6.9%. As we noted in the press release, the organic growth in each of our 4 operating segments improved from second quarter levels. We indicated in last quarter's call that we expected our uniform direct sales segment to have a good second half of the fiscal year, and that was certainly true in our third quarter. The execution of our global accounts and strategic markets and our global supply chain teams during the third quarter was outstanding as we rolled out several large new programs on our way to over 15% growth in the uniform direct sales operating segment. Third quarter net income decreased by 1.7% to $75 million, and there were a number of factors that contributed to this decrease. Our third quarter had 64 workdays, which is 1 less than last year's third quarter. Keep in mind that a number of our large expenses, including rental material cost, depreciation and amortization, are determined on a monthly basis instead of a workday basis, and 1 less workday results in 1 less day of revenue to cover those expenses. In addition, we have discussed on our last few calls that strong new business sales and the absence of meaningful customer hiring over the past few years have resulted in increasing rental material cost and capacity pressure on our routes. As a result, rental segment material cost exceeded last year's third quarter material cost, just as it also did in this year's second quarter. We also continue to add route capacity during this quarter to ensure that we have the ability to continue providing excellent service to our customers. In our selling and administrative expenses, our cost associated with employee-related medical benefits increased by roughly 60 basis points compared to last year's third quarter. Keeping in mind that we are self-insured, this increase was due to new claims experienced during the quarter. Medical costs have historically been in the range of 3% to 4% of revenue, and this third quarter expense continued to be in that range. In addition to higher medical costs, our expenses associated with auto and other liability claims increased roughly 50 basis points compared to last year's third quarter. Despite these added costs during the quarter, our earnings per diluted share for the third quarter did increase over last year's third quarter. This year's earnings per diluted share were $0.60, a 3.4% increase over last year's third quarter of $0.58. This was due to the positive impact of our share buyback program. During the third quarter, we purchased roughly $28 million of our stock, bringing our total purchases during the last 12 months to $309 million of Cintas stock. As of February 28, we have $191 million available under the current board authorization for future shares repurchases. As we enter our fourth fiscal quarter, we are updating our fiscal 2013 guidance based on our third quarter performance. We expect revenue to be in the range of $4.3 billion to $4.325 billion, and earnings per diluted share to be in the range of $2.50 to $2.54. The guidance assumes the current U.S. economic environment continues and does not worsen going forward. It also assumes no impact for additional share repurchases. Now I would like to turn the call over to Mike Hansen for more details of the third quarter.
J. Michael Hansen: Good evening. As Bill mentioned, total revenue increased 6.3% from the third quarter of last year with total company organic growth being 6.9%. Total company gross margin for the third quarter was 41.1%, which is down from last year's third quarter gross margin of 42.1%, but slightly better than this year's second quarter gross margin of 40.7%. I will discuss these items in more detail by segment. Before doing so, let me remind you that there were 64 workdays in our third quarter, which is 1 less than last year. Our fourth quarter will have 66 workdays, which is the same as last year's fourth quarter. As a planning note for fiscal '14, we will have 65 workdays in each quarter for a total of 260 workdays. This creates year-over-year workday differences in each quarter except the second, and results in 1 less workday for the entire fiscal year. We have 4 reportable operating segments: rental uniforms and ancillary products; uniform direct sales; first aid, safety and fire protection services; and document management services. Uniform direct sales, first aid, safety and fire protection services and document management services are combined and presented as other services on the face of the income statement. The rental uniforms and ancillary products operating segment consists of the rental and servicing of uniforms, mats, towels and other related items. This segment also includes restroom supplies and other facility products and services. Rental uniforms and ancillary products revenue accounted for 70% of company revenue in the third quarter and totaled $748.9 million, which is up 3.9% compared to last year's third quarter. Organic growth was 5.5%, which is a nice uptick from the 4.5% organic growth rate in the second quarter. Sales rep productivity continued to be strong and we did see a slight pickup near the end of the quarter in our net adds stops metric. Our rentals segment gross margin was 41.9% for the third quarter, a 120 basis point decrease from last year's third quarter gross margin of 43.1%. Energy-related costs were down 10 basis points from last year's third quarter. Bill touched on the primary reasons for the decreased gross margin: the impact of 1 less workday, the higher material cost and service costs associated with added route capacity. The third quarter gross margin of 41.9% was the same as the second quarter. The negative impact of 1 less workday in the third quarter was offset by the impact of the processing system write-off in the second quarter. Our uniform direct sales operating segment includes the direct sale of uniforms, branded promotional products and other related products to national and regional customers. Uniforms and other related products are also sold to local customers, including products sold to rental customers through our direct sale catalog. Uniform direct sales revenue accounted for 12% of company revenue in the third quarter and totaled $126.1 million, which represented sales growth of 15.6% compared to last year's third quarter. As Bill mentioned, we had several rollouts in the third quarter in our Fortune 1000 business, including the largest single customer rollout in Cintas' history. Uniform direct sales gross margin was 29.2% for the third quarter, down from last year's third quarter gross margin of 30.5%. This segment's gross margin can move from quarter-to-quarter due to changes in mix of product and timing of program rollouts. And this year's third quarter revenue included a much higher mix of Fortune 1000 national account sales, which tend to have slightly lower gross margins than our hospitality and gaming business. Our first aid, safety and fire protection services operating segment includes revenue from the sale and servicing of first aid products, safety products and training and fire protection products. First aid, safety and fire protection revenue accounted for 10% of company revenue in the third quarter. Revenue was $112.9 million, which is up 11.3% over last year's third quarter revenue. Organic growth was 6.9%, which is a nice improvement over the 4.8% organic growth rate in the second quarter. This segment's gross margin was 44% in the third quarter, which is up 80 basis points from the 43.2% in last year's second quarter, and the 42.4% in this year's second quarter. Our first aid and safety gross margins were very strong due to continued efficiencies gained by the good performance in this business. Our document management services operating segment includes document destruction, storage and imaging services and that accounted for 8% of third quarter total company revenue. Document management revenue totaled $87.8 million, which is 8.9% higher than last year's third quarter. Revenue increased organically by 5.8% compared to last year. We have lapped last year's steep drop in recycled paper prices and now have better year-over-year comps. This year's third quarter average recycled paper price remain relatively low at $140 per ton, but this is slightly higher than last year's third quarter average of $135 per ton. This $140 average price also remained lower than our expected third quarter paper price of $160 per ton. Our updated guidance for the fourth quarter assumes that recycled paper prices will stay roughly at the $140 level. The third quarter gross margin of 47.1% is comparable to last year's third quarter of 47%. Switching to selling and administrative expenses, SG&A was 28.7% as a percentage of revenue in the third quarter, which is up slightly from the 28.5% in last year's third quarter. As Bill mentioned, medical and auto and other liability claims were up a combined 110 basis points. Offsetting these increases were better leveraging of our G&A functions and constant challenging of our cost structure. Our effective tax rate was 36.1% for the quarter compared to 37% last year. The effective tax rate can fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter based on tax reserve builds and releases relating to specific discrete items. For the full fiscal 2013 year, we expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 37%, which is slightly higher than last year's 36.8%. Last year's rate was impacted favorably by the resolution of federal audits. Turning now to the balance sheet, our cash and marketable securities were $246 million at February 28, down $30 million from the $276 million at November 30. This decrease was due to the $80 million payment of our annual dividend in December, offset by cash generated from operations. Included in the $246 million at February 28 was $54 million of cash located outside of the U.S. Accounts receivable increased by $16 million since November 30 due to the higher sales level in the third quarter compared to the second quarter. DSOs were roughly 40, which is the same as at last year's third quarter. New goods inventory at February 28 was $247 million, up $11 million from November 30 due mainly to inventory associated with several large uniform direct sales customers. Despite higher sales this year, the inventory level of $247 million is down $29 million since last year at February 29 due to improved inventory management. Accrued liabilities decreased $87 million compared to November 30, primarily due to the $80 million December payment of our annual dividend. Long-term debt at February 28 was $1.3 billion. As of February 28, our total debt to EBITDA remains slightly below 2x. Moving on to cash flow, cash provided by operating activities in the third quarter was $141 million, which is up from last year's third quarter amount of $132 million. CapEx for the third quarter was $52.7 million. Our CapEx by operating segment was as follows: $38.3 million in rental; $1.4 million in uniform direct sales; $2.5 million in first aid, safety and fire protection; and $10.5 million in document management. We expect CapEx for fiscal 2013 to be in the range of $190 million to $210 million. This concludes our prepared remarks and we will now take any of your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Sara Gubins with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Sara Gubins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: You saw a nice pickup in the organic growth trends. I'm wondering if you could talk about the tone of your clients. And any details on types of clients maybe by industry that are adding programs or expanding their programs?
William C. Gale: Sara, what we saw was -- we saw a weak beginning of our quarter. December was relatively weak. January, first couple weeks started out, and then things got a little bit better. And as we got into February, I would say the latter part of February began to show a little bit of life in the add-stop metric among existing customers. I would say the general tone that I'm hearing from our operating and sales management is kind of a little bit of relief that we got through some of these big issues that the year-end fiscal cliff and some of the other things that were going on. And while I don't think there is a robust attitude that things are going to be really great, I think that there's just kind of a relief and maybe a little bit more optimism in the marketplace.
J. Michael Hansen: And so I would say that we did not see any significant -- one segment has significant improved performance over another. It was generally pretty broad.
Sara Gubins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Okay. And then it's a little hard to compare because of the year-over-year days not matching, but if I look at the guidance for the fourth quarter, it looks like you could be expecting a slowdown in the organic growth rate. So first, is that correct? And second, if so, could you talk about why?
William C. Gale: I'm not sure that's totally correct. The low end of our guidance would show growth of about 5.6% and the top end about 8%. But there -- I would say, within that guidance, we're looking at kind of a quarter relatively similar to what we saw this quarter.
Sara Gubins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Okay. And then just last question, any update on the pricing environment? Is it getting any marginally easier now that there's some incremental optimism?
William C. Gale: I would say the answer to that question is no. It's no different -- the pricing environment appears to be no different than what we've seen for the last several quarters, which is a pretty competitive environment.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Nate Brochmann with William Blair.
Nathan Brochmann - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: I wanted to talk 2 things. I mean, one, kind of following on that question, I mean, I'm definitely encouraged to see kind of the organic growth picking up. And I would assume that despite of probably a little bit of a weather impact, too, I would assume, and some of your regions seen a couple of loss days because of weather compared to last year where we didn't really have much weather, would that be fair to say that, that was kind of a little bit of a headwind during the quarter?
William C. Gale: I'm not sure I could really say that. There were a couple of those winter storms, but I didn't hear a lot of problems among our locations with deliveries and that sort of thing. So there's always a little bit of that in the third quarter in different parts of the country, but nothing out of the ordinary.
Nathan Brochmann - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: Okay, that's great. And then in terms of adding some of the route capacity back to handle the new business, would it -- I mean, how do you feel about where you are with that right now? Do you have more to go based on the level of business that you have right now? And then also, would it be fair that if we did see some pick-up in the economy and the employment rate, and that add/stop metric kind of shoot up a little bit at, hopefully, some point, that we could see even a little bit greater route density than we normally would see in a rising environment like that?
William C. Gale: Well, Nate, that's certainly our hope. What we have seen, we've had just some really nice new business over the last year or so. And as we spoke in the last couple of quarters, we've had to add some routes because we have more stops and we just needed to have the capacity in order to handle that new business. And there's no doubt that when we see adds consistently taking place at our existing customers, that is going to be very beneficial to route density, and thus, it's going to have a nice marginal impact positively on our results because not only will we get more revenue from a stop, but we'll be able to utilize with adds more of our existing stockroom inventory as customers do add employees to their headcount. Now is that going to necessarily happen in the fourth quarter? I don't know. I hope that we'll begin to see some of that, but it's still been a pretty sluggish employment growth, especially in the uniform rental wearing sectors. But with the little bit of uptick we saw at the end of February, maybe that will continue. I know there's been a few analysts who had put out some reports of their surveys with private customers that indicate there might be some trends of that. So we'll have to wait and see, but we'll certainly going to have the capacity on our routes to handle that, those adds if they do occur.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Joe Box with KeyBanc.
Joe Box - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: So you put up 2 consecutive years of solid SG&A leverage, and obviously, that abated this quarter. And I get it, the medical cost and liability were up a combined 110 basis points. I guess I'm just curious, do you see those headwinds reversing in the coming quarters or could we be looking at an ongoing drag? And then I guess, more importantly, how should we think about SG&A leverage going forward?
William C. Gale: Joe, I don't think we expect those type of spikes to continue. Of course, we're self-insured for medical benefits and you are going to have quarters when you'll have some relatively expensive cases and this happened to be one of them that we had several that must have hit, but I'd say that we would expect, if you look over the average cost of our medical benefits over the past year or so, it's been lower than what we saw this most recent quarter. So I've no reason to expect that to increase, at least this year. Obviously going into '14, all companies are going to face some additional costs associated with some of the requirements of the Affordable Care Act. But that's going to be -- every company is going to feel that. As to these cases, again, I think that's kind of an aberration. I can't say that it won't happen again, but it's more likely not to happen than to happen. So with all that said, I'd say as long as we continue to see that top line growing, we're going to see some additional SG&A leverage, not necessarily to the same degree we've seen over the last 2 years, but some marginal continued leverage improvement in the SG&A line.
Joe Box - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: Okay, good. That's helpful, Bill. And then maybe switching gears to the merchandise amortization component, can you maybe just help us understand the different moving pieces? Was there a benefit from lower cotton, but yet that was more than offset by newer uniforms going out? Just kind of curious for some color there.
J. Michael Hansen: Sure, Joe. When we look at material costs, as we mentioned, it was higher this year than last year. But what we did see is that the increase in the third quarter over last year was less than the year-over-year increase in our second quarter. And we talked numerous times in the past about how we expected cotton to peak mid-fiscal '13. And so we probably did get a bit of a relief coming off of that. But also, just saw a little bit of a decrease in the rate of the material cost increase. So it was a positive sign during the quarter.
Joe Box - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: And maybe can you just talk about some of the garments that you put out into service post recession? And we're coming up against a couple of years of pretty good growth. Are you starting to replace some of those uniforms and products now or is that not really coming up yet?
J. Michael Hansen: So I think that certainly can come up. And it just depends on the type of the customer and how they use their garments. And we will always be replacing garments. But I wouldn't say that it's -- we've seen a serious uptick in the amount that we're pulling from the stockroom based on these new accounts put in service over the last couple of years. I would say more of the impact has been we're just continuing to sell new accounts.
Joe Box - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: Okay, got you. Last question then I'll turn it over. On the direct sales side, clearly, you stand out. Can you just talk to the longevity of some of these programs? I mean, are they meant to last a few quarters, last a year or are they generally more seasonal in nature?
William C. Gale: Well, I wouldn't say they're seasonal, but they're more related to a specific customer requirement to do the rollout. So our sales organization is constantly working on replenishing these type of big account rollouts, but obviously, it's dependent somewhat on the customer themself. So what you saw this quarter is probably not repeatable in the short term. We would expect there still will be positive growth in the direct sales segment in our fourth quarter, but this certainly was kind of an unusual event, one that we knew was coming. And that's the nature of direct sale. We see this all the time where we can have these very, very high-growth quarters followed by flat to somewhat down quarters. And it's just the nature of the business.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Andrew Wittmann with Robert W. Baird.
Andrew J. Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: So you talked about the extra workday setting up for comparisons on the revenue side. It's kind of harder to peel out what the margins would be adjusted for that. Is it fair to kind of gross up the revenue from this quarter by that extra day, look at the same cost structure and then compare that to last year? Is that a fair way to look at it or if we do that, are we missing something?
William C. Gale: Well, that's a little too simplistic, I think, Andy. I mean, you can do a little bit of that, but -- like when you look at maybe some of the rental gross margins. But the problem we have is the quarter gets kind of complicated when you have some of these things that we talked about in SG&A. When you have a different mix percent of the direct sale business than you had in previous quarters versus the rental business, and the direct sale business tends to have a little less margin. So you just have -- you have to be low-cost or something. Suffice it to say, that we certainly are impacted negatively on a margin standpoint when we have fewer workdays. Because as Mike mentioned, with material cost, depreciation, amortization all being done on a monthly basis, that can have 50, 60 basis point differential just on the margins. And then you get other things that are being factored in there.
Andrew J. Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: Okay. I guess that makes sense. But it sounds like if you were to do it, the only segment that you'd even have a chance would be the core rental segment. And I guess if I do that math, I see kind of a 20 basis point gross margin hit and a 30 basis point rental hit, which it's not up, but it's not -- there's clearly a very big impact from the extra day.
William C. Gale: Yes, but I think I wouldn't make too much out of a 20, 30 basis change. I mean your mix of new business, the mix of the types of the business, that's -- those type of variations are going to happen quarter-to-quarter.
Andrew J. Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: Yes, okay. That's good. And just in terms of the routes, you kind of talked about this a little bit, but you've split some routes. Is the business supportive of a continuation of that or is it now, have you done the splitting of the routes and now it's just making those happen? Or should we see the kind of the routes splitting as maybe an ongoing headwind to near-term leverage with the long-term benefits?
William C. Gale: Well, I think -- let's keep in mind. I think the splitting of routes is a good long-term strategic move to enable us to serve more customers. And we will continue to, I think, be very successful in selling new business, and therefore, we need to stay ahead of the game and having the routes available to handle that new business so we can properly take care of our customers. So I see it going on. What I hope will happen is obviously, we'll see some improvement in the attitude of businesses to hire additional people at existing stops and just increase the amount of revenue without increasing the number of stops in all our routes, but with a very large sales force that is very productive, and what we think we have a -- some competitive advantages with product and with service systems, we'll continue to see robust new business. And when you have new business, you have to have the route capacity to handle it.
Andrew J. Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: Is there any one of your segments that's getting a disproportionate amount of new routes still?
J. Michael Hansen: The rental -- no, I'd say any of our route-based businesses were all adding routes.
Andrew J. Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: Okay, great. And then just final question. Mike, document kind of some currency x paper. What was that for the quarter?
J. Michael Hansen: We had a nice improvement in the quarter to 7.1%.
Operator: Moving next to James Samford with Citigroup.
James Samford - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: I just wanted to touch on a few things. Fuel prices, natural gas, they're on the rise here. You're still seeing some leverage on the energy cost side. I just wondered if you could comment on whether -- how we should think about Q4 in terms of energy cost with the current levels of commodity prices. And how does adding new routes impact the sort of energy cost line and just in general?
William C. Gale: Right now, our energy cost as a percent of revenue were relatively consistent with what we saw in the second quarter. We're a little over 3% of revenue. And the natural gas prices, they have shown a little bit of uptick, but not significant enough that I would think there would be a big change. Quite honestly, James, it's the price of the gas and diesel that the more dramatic change in those prices have a bigger impact on our energy cost overall, because that's the biggest percentage of our energy cost by far. As to the route capacity, well, the more trucks you have on the road, the more gas you're going to use. So you certainly will see an increase in utilization of gasoline and diesel by -- because you have more trucks, and therefore, we'll have that cost going on. We won't get the leverage necessary on the revenue line that we would if we were not adding route capacity. We're just seeing revenue increases at existing accounts.
James Samford - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: That's fair enough. That's what I was trying to get at. But on a -- from a capacity perspective, where do you stand right now in terms of your total wearers versus prior peak, and maybe comment on what the mix of rental wearing versus other products is at this point.
William C. Gale: Well, we still have fewer wearers today than at the peak. I won't get into the details anymore than that. But because of that, we still have capacity, generally speaking, and more than we did in '08. Now capacity is certainly a local issue and there are some spots that have grown faster than others in the last couple of years, and we may have some capacity needs from a plant standpoint in the next few years. But generally speaking, we have some pretty good capacity, and the -- when I talked about the fewer revenues -- fewer wearers today, our revenue is higher than it has ever been, and that is because we've replaced those, the revenue, from those lost wearers with other things like cleaning chemical solutions and hygiene products that don't require a lot of capacity. So to answer your question, plant capacity is still pretty good.
James Samford - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: I guess one quick question on the Affordable Care Act. I know that you've talked about sort of some impact on your business. Any sort of update on where you're thinking as the impact in 2014 might be and what kind of offsets you have or leverage you have to change, to absorb some of that cost?
William C. Gale: Well, I think everyone is aware that it's getting a lot more press. There was an article on the journal about a week ago that talked about the $63 charge that everyone is going to have to pay for every covered individual and their dependents. And so the rules are just getting announced and written. There is certainly going to be an increase. So what is our strategy? Well, our strategy has got to be to provide our employees with a decent medical program, but because of the significant increases in cost, they're going to have to share in some of that through higher weekly cost of their share of the cost. Maybe higher co-pays. We're offering some high deductible plans and inducing employees to get into those that we think would help us control our costs. And we continue to work with our various suppliers in trying to get the best deal possible in terms of the amount we have to pay for prescription drugs, for medical coverage, et cetera. There is just no doubt that there's going to be some increase in overall cost, both to the employee and to companies, and we'll do our best to keep that cost to a minimum. But there's still a lot to be resolved yet in terms of what the government is going to be forcing companies to do, and we're just watching it and then we'll try to react accordingly.
Operator: We'll go next to Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan.
Andrew C. Steinerman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: I wanted to ask about the rental gross margin line, which is down 120 basis percentage. Explain the reason. If it was not for the 1 less day, how close to even would rental gross margin be in the third quarter? And is there a shot that rental gross margin will be up in the fourth quarter given your comments about add-stop and even days?
J. Michael Hansen: Well -- if you would adjust for the workday in the third quarter, as Bill mentioned, we would see the rental gross margins likely go up about 50 basis points because of that 1 less workday. It was about a 50 basis point impact. Last year's fourth quarter gross margin and rental was 43.3%. And do I think we can get to that? It depends a bit, again, on how our revenue comes back. If we continue to see a movement, a positive trend in add-stops like we saw at the end of this quarter, then certainly, we can see a very good gross margin in the fourth quarter. If, however, that doesn't play out and we turn to a negative trend or a flattened trend, then because of the increase in routes, we may have a little bit more difficultly matching that gross margin from last year's fourth quarter.
Andrew C. Steinerman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Good. That's very helpful and promising. And if you could go over the acceleration of rental revenue growth in the third quarter, which pieces your revenue growth accelerated year-over-year?
William C. Gale: It really came through both the uniform wearer, as well as the facility services. It was kind of consistent. We're seeing some very nice growth continuing albeit from a relatively low base in the chemical dispensing and the tile and carpet cleaning. But I was encouraged with seeing kind of an across the board improvement with pretty much the core business, the dust business, the rental garment business. We've expanded into some different segments like healthcare with some microfiber mops and wipes and scrub rental, and I think that has been somewhat of a benefit for us also. Again, it was not consistent through the whole quarter. We had a tough, as I've mentioned earlier, we had a tough December, but we began to see a little life in mid-January and then it kind of picked up as we moved through the end of February. So I am -- I like to say I'm very optimistic for the fourth quarter but I can't because I just don't know what's going to happen. But at least the trend was more positive as we exited the third quarter.
Andrew C. Steinerman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Great. And, Bill, often, you described that same thing in terms of new business, loss business. So if you take the third quarter as a whole, did new business accelerate, did loss business ebb?
William C. Gale: Loss business ebbed a bit. New business, again, was very strong especially in the second half of the third quarter.
Operator: We'll go next to Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer.
Daniel Hultberg - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division: This is Daniel Hultberg filling in for Scott. Can you take us a little bit deeper on the strategy employed to drive some of that cost leverage in the business, please?
William C. Gale: Well, the strategy has been always to get as much capacity revenue on our routes. And as we mentioned earlier, route density is a key to that. Utilization in our plants is certainly something that we're always looking for and then the SG&A leverage. So our strategy had always been add routes as needed to handle additional stops and then do whatever we can to increase revenue at those stops.
Operator: Moving next to Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel Nicolaus.
Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: Bill, is there anything that is different about the add-stop change at the end of the quarter? We've had a number of head fakes with the add-stops. It was clearly the biggest lever potential for your business. Is there any sense that you have yet at this point in time, we might be feeling the real thing as opposed to kind of the head fakes we got a couple of times in the last few years?
William C. Gale: I can't. I couldn't tell you that convincingly. I wish I could, but I can't. I agree.
Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: And how long -- I guess when you talk about the end of the quarter, I guess how long did you see it for? You guys manage your business, I assume, on kind of more of a weekly basis. So how -- what part of the quarter did you see that in?
William C. Gale: The last 2 to 3 weeks.
Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: And did that continue going into this quarter?
William C. Gale: We looked -- we really don't have anything yet. It's pretty early in March, so I would say I don't have anything that I could really look at and tell you whether it did because it's just difficult that we're so early in the month.
Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: And then the trends in the business have been improving. I'm trying to bridge that with the EPS guidance kind of being narrowed down to the lower half. Like what are you expecting to change in the fourth quarter?
William C. Gale: Well, a couple of things. One is, of course, the paper price. As Mike alluded to, we've now reduced our expectation on paper price in the fourth quarter from what we had assumed back in December when we gave you that updated guidance. And that probably cost us, in that quarter alone, $0.015 or so. We're also a little bit concerned that maybe we will not have a repeat performance of the medical -- the lower medical expenses that we saw last year. And therefore, based on what we saw in the third quarter, we picked that up a little bit. We continue to expect there to be more impact, the material cost impact, although we've seen that trend come down a little bit. We still think that will be higher than last year's fourth quarter. And so I think the tax rate's a tad bit higher. So I'd say those are the major factors. But with all that said, we're still looking at fourth quarter, our guidance still indicates a fairly nice improvement in operating income in the fourth quarter over last year, even looking at the low end of the guidance. So I feel pretty good that it's going to be a decent quarter assuming that the revenue comes in.
Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: So just to quantify some of that, is it fair to say that the tax rate in total is $1.05 per quarter, so like $0.03 the differences, and not the tax rate, I'm sorry, the paper pricing?
William C. Gale: The paper price was, yes, based on what we thought it was going to be in December, it's like $0.015, yes.
Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: So $0.015 per quarter or $0.015 per...
William C. Gale: Per quarter.
Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: Okay. So $0.03 out of the $0.04...
William C. Gale: Right, $0.025 to $0.03, Shlomo.
Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: Okay. And then tax rate is kind of a fraction of a cent?
William C. Gale: Yes. Okay. You're getting into the minutia. I...
Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: [indiscernible] that. The bulk of it, it sounds like it's the -- the paper pricing is what it sounds like.
William C. Gale: The bulk of it, I would say, is the paper prices and a little less -- a little more concern on some of these expenses like medical benefits, liability claims, that sort of thing, that we just -- because we saw a little uptick in the third quarter.
Operator: We'll go next to Gary Bisbee with Barclays.
Gary E. Bisbee - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Can you -- you were kind enough to give us the impact of the 1 less workday and the rentals gross margin. Can you give us a sense, either the actual numbers or directionally, the other 2 issues, how much they contributed, the new customer impact and the route investments?
J. Michael Hansen: No, Gary, we haven't gotten into those, to that level of detail and would prefer not to.
Gary E. Bisbee - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Okay. That's not very helpful, but I'll move on to the next one. How about some color on how the new business has trended over the last 12 to 18 months, and in particular, what I'm getting at is when will some of those amortizations start to roll off? And this really picked up a lot like in the quarter, so that expense is going to be there for a while or is this the combination of new business having improved over the last year? And so as you're rolling out quarters where it wasn't as strong and adding in several where you've had good growth, that's sort of the impact. I'm trying to think how long is this a headwind is really the question.
William C. Gale: Well, I guess I would answer that question by saying if we were to stop selling new business, it wouldn't become a headwind. But the fact is we still have an awful big sales force and they're continuing to be very productive. So we're always going to have new business. And as a result of that, you're always going to have that kind of injection of products. So I'm not sure you're going to see a significant drop in the material cost because the amortization drops.
J. Michael Hansen: As I mentioned, Gary, though, the rate of increase year-over-year in our third quarter was less than our second quarter. And so we started to see a bit of that start to happen. In other words, the headwind was a little bit less in the third quarter than in the second quarter. And if we get a little bit of help with net add-stops in the fourth quarter, we might get a little bit more help in the fourth quarter. We did see some of that with cotton from the second quarter to the third quarter. But again, we saw a little bit of an improvement in the rate of increase, and I would say, rather than all of a sudden the headwind going away, it's probably going to be something that goes away very slowly over time, unless we see a real change in net adds-stops.
Gary E. Bisbee - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Okay, all right. Fair enough. Can you give us any color on where the improvement in add-stops came from? Was it more the wearers or more potentially bad weather leading to more jackets, which I've heard you referenced in the past, or anything like that just to help us understand exactly where it improved?
William C. Gale: It was more wearers and more facility services product adds.
Gary E. Bisbee - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Okay. And then just one last question for me. I know I've asked you this a lot over the last couple of years, but at what threshold do you think about breaking out the hygiene and facility services business into its own segment? I think with the fourth quarter of last year when you gave us the mix, it looks like it's getting close to that 10% threshold at which companies start to do that. Is that something you might do next fiscal year? And if not, why not?
William C. Gale: No, because we cannot properly split out the costs since they are housed in the same facility and often on the same route. So there's -- it would be a beset with a tremendous amount of allocations in order to split out the cost side. And as a result of that, we are not going to do that in the near-term.
Gary E. Bisbee - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Is there -- I thought the Sanis business, when you acquired that many years ago, had its own route. And a lot more of that was going off on different trucks. Is that not the case?
William C. Gale: It's a mix. There's a lot of trucks that are mixed trucks. There's trucks that are exclusively facility services, but it's not that clear cut.
Operator: And our final question comes from Jason Rogers with Great Lakes Review.
Jason Rogers: I just wanted to get an update on your business internationally, as well as growth opportunities there, currently.
William C. Gale: Well, our business internationally right now is, I think we've said about $40 million, a little over $40 million of revenue in document management in Europe and not doing very well. They have experienced some difficulties in growing the business over there. In fact, they shrunk a little bit from the third quarter last year. Profitability has improved somewhat, and we've been spending resources trying to improve the profitability, but we've had some issues with that and I think it really caused more by the macro issues of Europe in total than by anything else. As far as other international business, we do sell uniforms into many of our U.S.-based customers, our North American based customers throughout the world. We are seeing a pickup in that, more interest in having to service them. But again, it's a relatively minor piece of our overall business. Our focus continues to be, in North America, 95%, 98% -- between 95% and 98% of our business is North America, and that's really what our ongoing focus is going to be.
Operator: That does conclude our question-and-answer session. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference back over to you presenters for any closing comments.
William C. Gale: Thank you, again, for joining us. Mike and I appreciate everybody's interest and we will look forward to speaking with you on our fourth quarter earnings release sometime in mid to late July, and we look forward to talking to you then. Good night.
Operator: This does conclude today's conference. We thank you for your participation.

Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Cintas quarterly earnings results conference call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Bill Gale, Senior Vice President of Finance and Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead.
William C. Gale: Good evening, and thank you for joining us as we report our second quarter results for fiscal 2013. With me is Mike Hansen, Cintas's Vice President and Treasurer. After some commentary on the results, we will be happy to answer questions. The Private Securities Litigations Reform Act of 1995 provides a Safe Harbor from civil litigation for forward-looking statements. This conference call contains forward-looking statements that reflect the company's current views as to future events and financial performance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those we may discuss. I refer you to the discussion on these points contained in our most recent filings with the SEC. We are pleased to report second quarter revenue of $1,060,000,000, which represents growth of 4% from last year's second quarter. Second quarter net income increased by 4.9% to $78 million, and earnings per diluted share were $0.63, a 10.5% increase over last year. Our operating income for the second quarter was $139 million or 13.1% of total second quarter revenue. The effects of Hurricane Sandy did have some adverse effect on our second quarter results, but the effect was not material. Our second quarter operating income included an $8.5 million gain on the sale of stock of an investment and a $1.6 million write-off of a garment processing system used in one of our rental locations. The operating income was also negatively impacted by recycled paper prices. The average price for the second quarter was slightly over $150 per ton, representing a 32% decrease from last year's second quarter average price of just over $220 per ton. This year-over-year drop in paper prices resulted in a negative impact in the second quarter of $5.5 million. Keep in mind that this negative impact affects both revenue and operating income. We expected the second quarter recycled paper price to be $170 per ton, so the actual average second quarter price created a $1.5 million negative variance for the quarter versus our expectations. Mike will give more details on the operating results by segment in a couple minutes. Throughout our second quarter, our customers have continued to tell us the -- that the economic uncertainty in the U.S. caused them to be very cautious in spending, hiring and investment decision making. Unknowns concerning U.S. tax policies and the impact of changing health care regulations have created a pause in many of their business activities. In addition to this feedback from our customers, we continue to see GDP forecasts below 2% for calendar 2013. With these in mind, we are updating our fiscal 2013 revenue expectations to be in the range of $4.275 billion to $4.325 billion. We are not changing our earnings per diluted share guidance, which is an expectation of fiscal 2013 earnings per diluted share to be in the range of $2.50 to $2.58. The guidance assumes the current U.S. economic environment continues and does not worsen going forward. We are bringing down our recycled paper price expectations for the remainder of the year to be approximately $160 per ton in the third quarter and $170 dollars per ton in the fourth quarter. And finally, this guidance incorporates the 1.9 million share buyback from our second quarter but does not contemplate any additional buybacks. Now I would like to turn the call over to Mike Hansen for more details on the second quarter.
J. Michael Hansen: Thanks, Bill. As Bill mentioned, total revenue increased 4% from the second quarter of last year with total company organic growth being 3.4%. Total company gross margin for the second quarter was 40.7%, which is down from last year's second quarter gross margin of 42.2%. I will discuss these items in more detail by segment. Before doing so, let me remind you that there were 65 workdays in our second quarter, which is the same as last year. Looking to the remainder of fiscal 2013, we will have 64 workdays in the third quarter and 66 in the fourth quarter. Keep in mind that the third quarter has 1 less workday than last fiscal year, where there were 65 workdays in the third quarter of fiscal 2012. We have 4 reportable operating segments: rental uniforms and ancillary products; uniform direct sales; first aid, safety and fire protection services; and document management services. Uniform direct sales, first aid, safety and fire protection services and document management services are combined and presented as other services on the face of the income statement. The rental uniforms and ancillary products operating segment consists of the rental and servicing of uniforms, mats, towels and other related items. This segment also includes restroom supplies and other facility products and services. Rental uniforms and ancillary products revenue accounted for 71% of company revenue in the second quarter. Rental revenue for the second quarter was $755.8 million, which is up 4.6% compared to last year's second quarter. Organic growth was 4.5%. As Bill mentioned, our customers continue to be affected by a business environment filled with uncertainties. And this showed in our second quarter net add stops, which was lower than each of the last 2 years. The pricing environment remained very competitive, and the absence of rising energy and commodity prices made the implementation of customer price increases very difficult. The productivity of our sales force, though, continued to be strong, and our lost business metric improved from last year. Our rentals segment gross margin was 41.9% for the second quarter, a 130-basis-point decrease from last year's second quarter gross margin of 43.2%. Energy-related costs were consistent with last year's second quarter. As Bill mentioned, we wrote off a garment processing system during the quarter that totaled $1.6 million. This system represented new technology that did not provide the required operational improvements. In addition, material costs continued to rise as a percent of revenue due to garment injections associated with our new business. We have not been able to take advantage of our stockroom inventory due to the absence of any consistent customer hiring. Finally, as we mentioned in our last call, we began to expand our route capacity in the second quarter due to the new business and the number of new stops added over the past year. The second quarter gross margin of 41.9% was lower than the 43.3% in this year's first quarter due to the garment processing system write-off, one less workday in the second quarter compared to the first quarter and the cost of adding some route capacity. Our uniform direct sales operating segment includes the direct sale of uniforms, branded promotional products and other related products to national and regional customers. Uniforms and other related products are also sold to local customers, including products sold to rental customers through our direct sale catalog. Uniform direct sales revenue accounted for 10% of company revenue in the second quarter. Uniform direct sale revenue was $110.2 million, representing a decrease of 1.6% compared to last year's second quarter. Although our hospitality business continues to perform well, we saw weakening in our Fortune 1000 business. However, we expect that to change in the second half of the year due to several large rollouts scheduled to occur. Uniform direct sales gross margin was 27.4% for the second quarter, down from last year's second quarter gross margin of 29.6% and this year's first quarter gross margin of 29.4%. This segment's gross margin can move from quarter-to-quarter due to changes in mix of product and timing of program rollouts. In addition, we did start to incur some expenses associated with the scheduled rollouts just mentioned. Our first aid, safety and fire protection services operating segment includes revenue from the sale and servicing of first aid products, safety products and training and fire protection products. First aid, safety and fire protection revenue accounted for 11% of company revenue in the second quarter. Revenue was $111.5 million, which is up 9.7% over last year's second quarter. Organic growth was 4.8%. Our first aid and safety business in particular continues to perform very well. This segment's gross margin was 42.4% in the second quarter, which is down 70 basis points from the 43.1% in both last year's second quarter and this year's first quarter. This decrease is primarily due to a heavier mix of National Account fire business in the second quarter compared to the other quarters, as well as the impact of some acquisition-related costs incurred during the quarter. Our document management services operating segment includes document destruction, storage and imaging services, and it accounted for 8% of second quarter total company revenue. Document management revenue was roughly flat compared to last year's second quarter. Revenue decreased organically by 1.8% compared to last year. As Bill mentioned, recycled paper prices had a negative $5.5 million impact on second quarter sales and gross margin compared to last year's second quarter. The average recycled paper price during the second quarter was roughly $150 per ton, which was down from last year's second quarter average of roughly $220 per ton and less than the first quarter average of roughly $170 per ton. This lower recycled paper price was one of the main drivers of the lower gross margin in the second quarter compared to last year's second quarter. In addition, energy-related expenses were 30 basis points higher than last year, and our shredding service labor was higher due to the addition of some route capacity in anticipation of several new national accounts. Lastly, we also incurred some acquisition-related costs during the quarter. Switching to selling and administrative expenses. SG&A was 27.6% as a percent of revenue in the second quarter. This is an improvement from last year's second quarter of 29.2%. As Bill mentioned, second quarter SG&A includes a gain on the sale of stock of an investment. Aside from this item, amortization of deferred charges relating to prior year acquisitions and medical expenses were both lower than last year. Second quarter SG&A of 27.6% of revenue was lower than the 29.2% in this year's first quarter due to the gain on the stock sale and lower payroll taxes. Our effective tax rate was 36.5% for this -- for the quarter compared to 35.5% last year. The effective tax rate can fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter based on tax reserve builds and releases relating to specific discrete items. For the full fiscal 2013 year, we expect our effective tax rate to be 37.3%, which is slightly higher than last year's 36.8%. Last year's rate was impacted favorably by the resolution of federal audits. Turning now to the balance sheet, our cash and marketable securities were $276 million at November 30, down $54 million from the $330 million in cash and marketable securities at August 31 due to the share buyback of $81 million during the second quarter, offset by cash generated from operations. Included in the $276 million at November 30 was $54 million of cash located outside of the U.S. Accounts receivable increased by $20 million since August 31. We did experience some slowing of collections in the second quarter but nothing that concerns us from an ultimate collection standpoint. New goods inventory at November 30 was $236 million, down $6 million from August 31. We're pleased with our inventory performance since the implementation of SAP. Given the scheduled rollouts that will occur in the second half of the fiscal year, our new goods inventory level will likely fluctuate in the next few quarters based on the specific timing of shipments to customers. Accrued liabilities increased $112 million compared to August 31 primarily due to the accrual of our annual dividend, which was paid on December 12, and due to an increase in bond interest accrued. Long-term debt at November 30 was $1.3 billion. As of November 30, our total debt-to-EBITDA remains slightly below 2x. Moving on to cash flow, cash provided by operating activities in the second quarter was $132 million, which is up from last year's second quarter amount of $119 million. In addition to higher net income, the decrease in new goods inventory contributed to the improvement in operating cash flow. CapEx for the second quarter was $51.6 million. Our CapEx by operating segment was as follows: $38.2 million in rental; $1.6 million in uniform direct sales; $2.4 million in first aid, safety and fire protection; and $9.4 million in document management. We expect CapEx for fiscal 2013 to be in the range of $190 million to $210 million. That concludes our prepared remarks, and we will now take any of your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And we will take our first question. Ms. Sara Gubins, your line is open. Please check your Mute function.
Sara Gubins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: I was wondering if you could start by maybe giving a little bit more color around the net add stops? You've seen a bit of fluctuation there with the fourth quarter having been negative, first quarter turning positive and I guess second quarter now being negative. So any more color about the nature of the decline that you're seeing either in -- more details on the type of product or the type of clients?
William C. Gale: I'm sorry, I didn't catch who was asking the question.
Sara Gubins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: I'm sorry, it's Sara Gubins from BofA Merrill Lynch.
William C. Gale: Okay. Yes, we -- what we saw was a slight weakening on the add stops versus the first quarter in terms of the trend. You have to be very careful. When you look at add stops, you got to look at it on a year-over-year basis, not necessarily on a sequentially quarter basis. But what we think that is certainly evidence of is what I mentioned earlier, is the lack of any momentum on -- in employment in our type of industries. There was a slightly better employment report last month. However, it really didn't impact the traditional rental business at all. So what we are seeing basically is just a lack of any real momentum with existing customers, and I think everybody's just taking a wait-and-see attitude to see what happens.
J. Michael Hansen: Sara, just a point. I didn't say it was negative for the quarter. But I did say it was lower than the last couple years. Typically, in the second quarter, we tend to pick up jacket rental and some match for the winter season. But it was not negative.
Sara Gubins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Okay. Second question. If I look at the revenue guidance, it would suggest a pickup in the year-over-year growth rate in the second half kind of in the 5% to 7% range versus a little less than 4% in the first half. Comparisons do get easier, so that probably helps. Can you talk about what's driving it? Is it just easier comparisons? Or is there something else happening?
J. Michael Hansen: Well, there are certainly 2 easier comparisons. One is the -- from the first half of the year, we start to lose that significant headwind of the year-over-year paper prices. So our second half of the year paper guidance that we gave you is in line or slightly ahead of last year's second half paper prices. And the other item is our direct sale. We expect to have a better second half certainly than the first half of this year. Our first half ended, in uniform direct sale, down 1.5% or so, and we expect to have growth in the second half of the year.
Sara Gubins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Okay, great. And then just last question. Are you expecting any impact for your company regarding the new health care bill that's going into effect? Does it impact your costs at all?
William C. Gale: Well, we certainly are very concerned because it will increase our costs. There's no question about that. We just don't know to what extent at this point in time, and so we're monitoring it. But there are still so many unknowns that it's difficult to predict.
Operator: And we will take our next question from Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel.
Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: Can you -- Bill, can you talk a little bit about the pricing? I think last quarter, you talked about the competitive pricing environment for, I think, it was National Accounts. Can you just give us just a broader overview of what you're seeing on a trend? Is this pricing competitively getting better, worse or the same?
William C. Gale: It is -- still remains very competitive and relatively aggressive on the part of many of our competitors, especially with National Accounts and large regional accounts. I think, again, it is due in part to the lack of the ability to grow existing customers because customers are reluctant to add employees. So as a result of that, new business is very competitive, and we have to be aggressive in obtaining new business. Additionally, as Mike mentioned in his comments, price increases on existing customers have been also somewhat difficult given the lack of any real increase in costs. The general low inflation rate has not enabled us to really be enabled to increase prices on existing accounts either to any great extent.
Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: Okay. And then you recent -- and you had talked about splitting apart some of the routes to create new routes. Can you talk about how -- there's -- I assume there's an initial inefficiency. Can you talk about how that impacted your numbers? And how long does it take until you kind of grow into that and overcome that?
William C. Gale: Well, I'm sorry, I'm not going to give the qualitative amount because it'd be difficult really to do it. But when you add new routes, they certainly aren't full. And we were in a position where we were forced to add new routes in a couple of our businesses because so much of our growth has come from new accounts and, therefore, new stops. And so while we tried to efficiently add them, there comes point in time when you have more route capacity and therefore you have greater costs on a -- and not getting quite the efficiency. However, over time, that gets eaten up, and would really be benefited if we could see some additional headcount at existing customers. We've been talking about that for the last couple of years. But what we need to do is continue to invest in the routes to handle the new business, and then position ourselves to be able to handle growth in existing customers. So I think over time, it will come back and we will continue to -- we'll get back to improved margins. But new -- you add a new truck, new depreciation, another driver, and those costs start mounting up as you run them across the country.
Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: And then just in general, can you comment a little bit about where you thought the jobs were -- the "better than the expected" jobs report, where were those jobs happening vis-à-vis where we need to see jobs happening in order -- improving in order for you guys to see any pickup in your business?
William C. Gale: Shlomo, you got to be so careful with these job numbers because when you look just the total number, one might think, oh, well, they -- this should be positively impacting a company like Cintas. But when you delve into the details of the jobs number, they -- it paints a different picture. Now the most recent one, for example, the increase in jobs was due to primarily in the professional arena, and that really doesn't help us in the uniform rental business at all. So you just -- you have to go through and look at the different areas where jobs are being added. One of the analysts that follows Cintas recently put out a report, and he made the same comment. He said after you delve into the details, you begin to realize that any big increase in jobs did not have a positive impact on the uniform companies. So to answer the question, I think if you could see job growth in the 250,000-plus level, that you would expect that, that should start impacting our types of customers. And hopefully, we'll see that as we get into '13, but I think it's not a sure thing by any means right now.
J. Michael Hansen: I think when you look at this last jobs report from a typical uniform rental standpoint, it was probably the poorest of the year. There were -- that 146,000 included over 100,000 jobs in motion pictures, administrative positions, clothing -- retail clothing stores. So it was really a weak jobs report as it relates to our businesses.
Operator: We will take our next question from Nate Brochmann with William Blair.
Nathan Brochmann - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: Just one quick housekeeping thing. I just want to make sure I got this right. But on the write-off, that came in the cost of goods sold from the rental side, is that correct?
J. Michael Hansen: Yes.
William C. Gale: Yes, correct.
Nathan Brochmann - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: And then if I net that out with a gain, that feels like, at least quick math using the same tax rate, it's about $0.04 per share?
William C. Gale: Yes. For the gain...
J. Michael Hansen: Well, the gain was about $0.04, the write-off was offsetting that. Then if you really take into account some impact of Hurricane Sandy as well as then the difference in our paper expectation, you kind of wash out.
Nathan Brochmann - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: Okay, fair enough. And then kind of getting to some real results on the revenue side, and I know that there's a little bit of pressure just in the add stop sequentially. But, I mean, I'm -- continue to be pretty impressed that despite all the uncertainty from your customers out there, that you guys are still putting up pretty solid revenue growth relative to expectations, and I know you said you have some increased productivity. Can you talk a little bit further in terms of where you're really getting that if everybody's so cautious out there?
William C. Gale: Well, it's very similar to what I said at the -- in this first quarter, that where we're getting the new business growth is coming from the fact that, one, customers who have never had the program before recognized the value of the program because it is so cheap to provide your employees with just a tremendous service by providing their uniforms every day, cleaning them, repairing them, replacing them, et cetera. So that really helps our no programmer [ph] sales efforts. Additionally, the FRC business, or flame-resistant clothing business, continues to be a star with us because of the growth and the strength of the energy business in the U.S., which requires many of their workers to wear FRC garments. And third, I would say is the new product offerings like Carhartt, the chemical dispensing, again are attractive-type services and/or products to customers. And therefore, businesses again are signing up for that new business or converting over from one of the competitors because the competitors cannot offer some of those things.
Nathan Brochmann - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: Okay, fair enough. I mean, I think that's obviously really positive that you guys keep showing that.
William C. Gale: We agree.
Nathan Brochmann - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: What's that?
William C. Gale: I said we agree.
Nathan Brochmann - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: Yes. And then just finally, you guys talked about having some more uniform injections, obviously, as you brought some of that new business on. Can you talk right now in terms of just in general numbers how you feel you are with inventory in terms of utilization levels, et cetera?
J. Michael Hansen: Nate, you mean utilization in our -- from our stockroom?
Nathan Brochmann - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: From your stockroom, correct, yes.
J. Michael Hansen: Well, our utilization, when we -- when our customers aren't hiring and adding people, our utilization in our stockroom goes down because we're not pulling garments, similar garments out of our stockroom to put onto new hires within existing customers. Aside from that, our what we call pull percentages, the amounts that we pull for lost garments, replacement garments, are very good. But we just need to be able to use that asset, that stockroom asset, much better by our customers hiring. So it certainly is down because our customers aren't hiring as much.
William C. Gale: But keep in mind, for those of you who may not recall, a new customer gets new garments, does not get used garments out of the stockroom.
Operator: Our next question is from Andrew Wittmann with Baird.
Andrew J. Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: I wondered, just I have a couple just clerical ones here. I think I heard you said, at least in one of the segments, that energy was flat year-over-year. Does that go for the company as well? Or what was the percentage of revenue for energy?
William C. Gale: Yes. It was pretty much flat year-over-year, just slightly over 3%.
Andrew J. Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: Right. And then in document management, what was the organic x paper? We might be able to get there with a 5.5%, but just to clarify with you guys.
J. Michael Hansen: It was about 7%, Andy. It was a nice improvement over what we saw in the first quarter. Our businesses in most areas of document management improved, but the -- but that increase was really led by our shredding business. So we had a nice quarter x the recycled paper.
Andrew J. Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: And then as you look at that 7%, is that -- can you give us a feel for volume versus new customer? I mean, new customers typically have been a pretty big driver for you guys but just color there would be helpful.
William C. Gale: Yes.
J. Michael Hansen: Yes, so the -- yes, the bulk of that -- just like in the rental business, the bulk of that growth is coming from new customers. We certainly do get some benefit from increased volume, but more -- much more of it is from the added customers.
Andrew J. Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: Right. And then just moving over to the core rentals segment, guys. I wanted to just get a sense for the relative growth rates between kind of core uniform and the facility services side. Is it still fair to kind of think of that business growing at 1.5 to 2 -- the services side being 1.5, 2x faster than kind of the core rental business? Is that a fair approximation?
William C. Gale: No, no. I think -- I remember saying this in the first quarter. It's -- they're growing at relatively comparable rates right now.
Andrew J. Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: Yes, great. And then so just kind of touching on an earlier question, I think the impact of the health care legislation, and now we've got some clarity that apparently, that will happen. I know that Scott wrote a letter and kind of quantified a $58 million cost with that. Is your earlier comment saying that it's maybe not as certain just due to the fact that we're not there yet? Or has something changed from Scott's earlier comments?
William C. Gale: No, I think that was a -- there still is a lot of unanswered questions, Andy, with regard to what the regulations are going to be and what the provider costs are going to be, et cetera. So I wouldn't say that I have any better information than what Scott put in his letter, but I think it's important to understand that there's an awful lot of things that have yet to be decided and resolved between now and when that thing goes into effect. And I was just looking at something or reading an article the other day that the CEO of one of the huge insurers talked about just doubling the premiums to companies. Now we're self-insured. But obviously, if an insurance company is going to double premiums, that's going to have an impact on those of us who are self-insured also. So I think it's definitely going to be a higher amount of expense. Whether it's $58 million, $75 million, I think it's too early to tell.
Andrew J. Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: Okay. But in terms of when that would theoretically hit as of right now, that big bump is really January 1, 2014, correct?
William C. Gale: The biggest bump is then. But I think we're going to begin to see some cost pressures as we move through '13.
J. Michael Hansen: Yes, there are additional reporting requirements that happen in '13. But you're right, the '14 is when we're going to see quite a bit of impact.
William C. Gale: Yes, Andy, keep in mind that all companies are going to face an issue in 2014, or shortly thereafter, of whether or not they want to incur these tremendously more expensive items to provide health care or they can pay this penalty that, at the current time, is like $2,000 per employee. Now I don't think Cintas has any intention of necessarily dropping its health care coverage unless we see all companies begin to drop it because then, that puts us in a noncompetitive situation. So I think there's so much yet to be decided and resolved and determined on what the impact of this thing is going to be. That -- it's just too early to tell.
Andrew J. Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: Yes, it will be very interesting to watch that unfold. I guess final question, guys. I wanted to understand a little bit about the acquisitions. It looks like about $50 million of deals in the quarter. Can you just give us really a couple of things related to that? What segments primarily can you give us kind of like a maybe a percentage or some way to understand what the revenue contribution might be to the -- each segment for the year and the impact that, that had on your guidance? Because it looks like -- obviously, revenue guidance is up some, but I got to think that acquisitions were at least a part of the factor that went into that.
William C. Gale: Andy, acquisitions are primarily in the document management space, primarily shredding, and in the first aid and safety and fire segment. And I would tell you that it still was a little less than what I had hoped to see. I thought we -- as we got closer to the end of the calendar year, we would see a little bit -- more acquisition activity, but we really didn't. It is going to have a marginal impact on the revenue for the remainder of this fiscal year, if you think about it. And I don't have the detail and I don't think we will give the detail of the exact revenue, but it is not significant relative to the amount that was spent and relative to the size of the company.
Operator: Our next question is from John Healy with Northcoast Research.
John M. Healy - Northcoast Research: I wanted to ask a question about the SG&A expense going forward. I know there's been a couple of quarters where you've benefited from some of the amortization rolling off some prior deals. And looking at the cash flow statement, it looks like it's helped to buy about $8 million or $9 million this year, and I was just wondering if that starts to accelerate going forward even further or if we start to lap comparisons in the next quarter or 2, and how we should think about that cadence.
William C. Gale: Well, I think it'll -- won't be really anniversaried until next -- first quarter of next fiscal year on the amortization. There are some minor changes. But the big impact was when we came into this fiscal year and it's -- well, it wasn't big, but the impact was coming into this fiscal year and will kind of anniversary next June. The thing in SG&A that fluctuates quite a bit, of course, that was things like payroll taxes. Keep in mind the third quarter, 64-day quarter and yet our payroll taxes are at the highest of any of the quarter because everything resets January 1. We have fluctuations in our medical expense and in workmen's compensation-type costs. And of course, in this quarter, we have the positive variance associated with the sale of the investment that Mike alluded to.
John M. Healy - Northcoast Research: Got you. No, that makes sense. Then Mike, I think last quarter, you had kind of laid out some expectations of how you thought paper would fluctuate throughout the year. And I know it's awfully difficult to predict the paper market, but is there a way to think about what your expectations are for the third and fourth quarter so we can make sure our models maybe more accurately reflect the potential headwinds or tailwinds?
J. Michael Hansen: Sure. Our guidance in -- so we -- for the second quarter, we had a price of about an average of $150 per ton, and our guidance incorporates a $160-per-ton average in the third quarter and $170 in the fourth quarter.
John M. Healy - Northcoast Research: Okay, great. And then just wanted to ask just a final question just on the balance sheet. It continues to remain very underlevered, and you guys continue to generate great cash flow. Any updates on -- I know you've been active as the previous question mentioned there were some acquisitions. But are you seeing any movement on maybe some of the more regional or larger properties that might be out there on the document side or on the uniform side or some of these odd businesses that have been out there for a while?
William C. Gale: John, I really can't comment on any specific acquisition. I can just tell you that we obviously would be interested at the right price.
Operator: Our next question is from Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer.
Scott A. Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division: Bill, just following up on an earlier question real quick. You mentioned you had anticipated perhaps some more acquisitions at the end of the year and, obviously, the quarter ended in November. And -- but perhaps some incentive for sellers to sell before year end. I don't imagine you're going to give more color, but that disappointment, should that trickle through to early into this quarter? And just thoughts on -- just incrementally on the acquisition environment, should we -- would we expect to see a pickup from you guys?
William C. Gale: I -- Scott, you know I can't tell you that. I can just tell you that yes, I was disappointed on the lack of acquisitions as we got closer to year end. And of course, we're only reporting what we did through November. If we had made anything material, we would certainly be telling you at this point in time. But I was a little surprised. I thought sellers would be looking at the possibility of much higher tax rates and would be a more willing seller. But obviously, through our November -- end of November, that did not happen.
Scott A. Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division: Understood. The -- you guys had mentioned strong productivity in the sales force. And a few years removed Project One, could you elaborate on that a little bit? How's -- I know you don't speak to headcount in sales, but could you speak to your favorable trends there, please?
William C. Gale: Scott, I think our favorable trends have been what we've seen for the last couple of quarters. Let's -- give a little -- go back in time a little bit. We did start increasing our headcount in sales back in calendar '10 as we began to gain confidence that the financial difficulties that were facing the country and the severe recession we were in were beginning to dissipate. And it took a while for those salesmen to achieve productivity, but they began to really do that in -- late in our fiscal '11 and it has continued through this latest quarter. What's caused it is a more tenured workforce, our sales force; a -- certainly, an increase in the headcount from what we had back during the recession; but third is a great selection of products and offerings that we think have contributed to their productivity improvements and have resulted in at least giving us the growth that we're getting because we're getting it from the new business.
Scott A. Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division: And one more housekeeping, and I apologize if I missed it. But your -- I believe your prevailing tax rate guidance for the full fiscal year is 37.3%. Is that still a good target for us to think about modeling?
William C. Gale: Yes.
J. Michael Hansen: Yes.
Operator: Our next question is from Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan.
Andrew C. Steinerman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: When you look at your S&A line without the gain, it comes out to 28.4% of revenues, which shows some decrease sequentially and year-over-year. And you did speak somewhat about this line. But my question is, do you feel like some of the efficiencies gained on this line are permanent, meaning that over time, it could go down from this percentage? Or do you feel like you've held back on some costs, and so you're going to really have to be additive to this line as business grows?
William C. Gale: Andrew, absent the quarterly fluctuations, I think there is still some potential for marginal improvement in the SG&A line. I don't think we've held back on costs. I think that we're continuing to get leverage. And so when you look at it on an annualized basis, I think you'll -- you should continue to see some modest improvement, not to the extent we've seen over the last few years, but I think that it still can get slightly better. Now I just want to just make the point again, the third quarter for us...
Andrew C. Steinerman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: 64 days.
William C. Gale: Is 64 days, resetting of payroll taxes, et cetera. So keep that in mind, those of you who put out your expectations.
Operator: Our next question is from Gary Bisbee with Barclays.
Gary E. Bisbee - Barclays Capital, Research Division: I guess my first question. Bill, you mentioned that -- it's a line we've been hearing a lot but just about companies, the uncertainty and it impacting them. I guess I wondered if that's -- do you feel that more this quarter? Or is that just a continuation of what's been going on for 6, 9 months?
William C. Gale: I think it was maybe a little bit more in this quarter, slightly more than what we saw maybe in our first quarter just because we were in the height of the election and a lot more people were focusing on all the different viewpoints and what should happen on January 1. It was a headwind in the first quarter, maybe a bit more of a headwind in the second.
Gary E. Bisbee - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Okay, all right. And then what -- can you be any more specific about what impact you think Hurricane Sandy had on the business and if that impact will linger for a while? I see so many of your trucks rumbling around New York City, and I was one of the unfortunate ones without power for a week downtown. So I have to imagine there was an impact in the Northeast. And any sense of what it was?
William C. Gale: It was really difficult to come up and give you an exact number. Our commentary was it did have an impact. It wasn't material. What happened is as those of you who had to go through it without power, our facilities were down for a few days. Our customers were down even longer. We've got customers that haven't returned to business. And it doesn't impact just uniform rental, it in fact impacted all of our businesses: the fire business, the first aid and safety. Some of that you get back, and it's just a delay on when you get it. But some of it may never get -- you may never get back. It had a modest but not a material impact on the quarter.
Gary E. Bisbee - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Okay, fair enough. And then you mentioned in a couple of your businesses some reasons for optimism. Obviously, the paper comparison is important. But I think I heard in uniforms sales the few rollouts you're expecting. You said adding capacity in documents because of some recent National Account wins. And is this sort of normal course of business, normal trends? Or have you seen some things, despite the weak environment, that are actually getting somewhat better in the last few months or quarter or 2?
William C. Gale: Well, no, I do see some positive. We know we're going to have -- we -- or what we -- due to these rollouts, we should have a much better results in the direct sale business. And that's -- the direct sale business is going to do that. It's going to fluctuate. But I'm very pleased with some of the new customers that we're getting in the direct sale business. And hopefully, even after the initial surge of the rollout, we'll see some ongoing business as a result of that. As far as some of the other businesses, as Mike alluded, the shredding business saw a nice pickup. I think that, that's positive. And the first aid and safety revenue looked very good. Some of the fire National Account businesses that we're getting. So overall, yes, I am -- I think in a very tough economic environment, I'm pleased with our results. And I feel very good about, going forward, that we've got a very strong sales force and a great -- great businesses that we're in that should continue to do well. We just are obviously at the mercy somewhat of what the economy does.
Gary E. Bisbee - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Yes. And then just one last one. I was looking at your website the other day and looking at what continues -- it seems to be you continue to expand the offerings in facility services. I guess I've also seen a few press releases talking about -- more about the chemicals business and whatnot. According to the mix you gave us at the end of last fiscal year, it looks to me like it was at that point, 11% of total company revenue. I guess at what point do you break that out from rentals? They're -- they were on a different fleet, a different network, and it would certainly aid all of our ability to think about how the business is doing if we could see that separately. And I think the SEC standard is like 10%. It's something normally then would make sense to split off. Is that something you could do at the end of this fiscal year?
William C. Gale: Well, the problem we have is while the revenue side is relatively easy to split out, it's impossible at this point in time to appropriately split out the costs because they are housed in the same physical facility. There is often a route that will carry both products, both facility services and uniforms. So at this point in time, we have no way to properly be able to split that out separately.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question is from Greg Halter with Great Lakes Review.
Gregory W. Halter - LJR Great Lakes Review: One quick, easy one. I missed the organic growth for the uniform direct business in the quarter.
J. Michael Hansen: It was the same as the total growth, a decrease of -- I believe it was 1.6%.
Gregory W. Halter - LJR Great Lakes Review: That's easy. And then second relative to capital allocation. Obviously, you just raised the dividend 18.5%, then bought back, I think, 1.9 million this quarter, 1.8 million last quarter, made some acquisitions, $51 million in the quarter. Just wondered what your appetite is for -- and I guess from the standpoint of looking at the share repurchase, what your appetite is in that regard.
William C. Gale: Well, I would just say if past practice is any indication of future, we continue to be hungry with -- at the appropriate use of our cash and keeping our options open for other things. So it would not surprise me that we would not see additional share buybacks depending what else -- what other opportunities we might see for cash.
Gregory W. Halter - LJR Great Lakes Review: All right. And what's the rate that you're paying on your debt now? And is it fixed or variable?
William C. Gale: It is all primarily fixed.
J. Michael Hansen: I think the...
William C. Gale: A little less than 5%.
J. Michael Hansen: The all-in rate is in the mid-4s, I believe.
Operator: Our next question is from James Samford with Citi.
James Samford - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: One question for you, on cotton prices. It looks like cotton prices have been coming down. I know that it'll -- it takes time for that to work through your inventory. I just wondered if you'd comment on if and when we could see some kind of benefit from lower cotton prices working through.
J. Michael Hansen: James, we had talked about cotton peaking in our second quarter of this year. What will be very difficult to see is the -- is any change in that because as you know, the cotton impact rolls through so slowly. And also, running through our material costs are all of the injections of new garments for all of the new accounts that we've sold. And so it's going to be very difficult to spot a trend in the changes due to cotton.
James Samford - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: I guess on the rental side, I believe you said in the past that typically, your clients won't put uniforms on temporary workers. And one of the areas of growth in terms of hiring has been in the Tampa area, and I think there's even a thesis out there that with the Affordable Healthcare Act (sic) [Affordable Care Act], companies, particularly smaller companies, might use temps even more than before. Are your clients talking about it that way? And -- or is there a possibility that they may change the way they think about temps over time?
William C. Gale: Well, I think the idea of putting a uniform on a temp worker depends what that temp worker is doing. If that temp worker has customer-facing responsibilities that require the image of the -- of their employer to be properly represented, they're going to put a uniform on a temporary worker. If they're trying to protect the product from contamination from an employee regardless of it's a temporary or a permanent worker, they're going to have a uniform. So I would tell you that it all depends on what the buying motive is for the customer on the uniforms side. To provide a uniform for a temporary worker as a perk has not necessarily been the practice. But if we do go into a new world where many companies decide to have a lot of temporary workers as opposed to full-time workers in order to avoid potential costs, if they need that employee to be in a uniform for image or for protecting the product, I think you will see them use uniforms.
J. Michael Hansen: Yes, I think we may see a change in the way -- because of the health care, we may see a change in the way our customers view their employees. And there's a -- you can think of temporary as being temporary until we can find a full-time replacement. And there may be less need to put that kind of worker in a uniform versus a part-time worker where in the future, there may be more part-time workers that are kind of a permanent part time, and we may see a shift of putting more of them into uniform. So I think we're going to keep our ears close to our customers and see how this health care act changes their perception of their employees.
James Samford - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: I guess just a housekeeping. Where is the -- where does the gain from a sale flow through? Is that in rental operating income as well?
William C. Gale: That is primarily in rental. There's -- it's a bit of a spread between all 4 segments but mostly in rental.
Operator: And that does bring us to the conclusion of our question-and-answer session. I'll turn the conference back over to Mr. Gale.
William C. Gale: I would like to thank everyone for joining us this evening. And on behalf of all of the Cintas partners throughout the world, we want to wish all of you a very happy holiday and a prosperous new year.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's presentation. We appreciate your participation.

Operator: Good afternoon, everyone and welcome to the Cintas Quarterly Earnings Results Conference Call. Today's presentation is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Bill Gale, Senior Vice President of Finance and Chief Financial Officer.
William C. Gale: Thank you for joining us this evening as we report our first quarter results for fiscal 2013. With me is Mike Hansen, Cintas' Vice President and Treasurer. After some commentary on the results, we will be happy to answer questions. The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a safe harbor from civil litigation for forward-looking statements. This conference call contains forward-looking statements that reflect the company's current views as to future events and financial performance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ materially from those we may discuss. I refer you to the discussion on these points contained in our most recent filings with the SEC. We are pleased to report first quarter revenue of $1,051,000,000, which represents growth of 3.4% from last year's first quarter. First quarter net income increased by 11.8% to $77 million and earnings per diluted share were $0.60, a 15.4% increase over last year. Our operating margin for the first quarter improved to 13.2% from last year's first quarter operating margin of 12.6%. Energy-related costs were 40 basis points lower in last year's first quarter. However, this positive impact from energy was more than offset by the $8.3 million negative impact of lower recycled paper prices this year. Keep in mind that in addition to negatively impacting revenue, lower recycled paper prices directly impact operating income as well. Aside from these 2 items, the improvement in operating margin was mainly due to continued efforts to manage our cost structure. When we announced our fiscal 2013 guidance in July, we commented that the absence of momentum in the U.S. economy, as well as numerous sub-2% GDP forecasts for the remainder of 2012 and 2013 caused us to view fiscal 2013 with caution. Our assessment of the economic climate has not changed since then. The disappointing employment picture has continued and various reported economic data during the past 2 months have not been encouraging. However, despite this negative climate, we continue to be pleased with the performance of our businesses, and as a result, we reiterate our fiscal 2013 revenue expectations to be in the range of $4.25 billion to $4.35 billion. We are updating our fiscal 2013 earnings per diluted share guidance for the impact of our first quarter share buyback. While the 1.8 million share buyback had no impact on the first quarter results, it will benefit the remainder of the year by $0.03. As a result, we now expect earnings per diluted share to be in the range of $2.50 to $2.58. Let me make a few comments about this guidance. The guidance assumes no further deterioration in the U.S. economy. Mike generally comments on the workdays by quarter. The number of workdays does affect revenue and operating income levels. Keep in mind that our second quarter workdays are 65, 1 less than the first quarter, but the same as last year's second quarter. The third quarter however, has only 64 workdays, 2 less than this first quarter and 1 less than last year's third quarter. This third quarter workday impact, coupled with the uncertainty surrounding a fiscal cliff impact, may result in a difficult year-over-year comparison for the third quarter. While the first quarter recycled paper prices were significantly lower than last year, those prices were generally in line with our expectations. Our expectations for the remainder of the year have not changed since July, roughly $170 per ton in the second quarter, followed by a $10 increase in the third and fourth quarters. And finally as I mentioned, the guidance incorporates the share buyback from our first quarter but does not contemplate any additional buybacks. Now I would like to turn the call over to Mike Hansen for more details on the first quarter.
J. Michael Hansen: Thank you, Bill. As Bill mentioned, total revenue increased 3.4% from the first quarter of last year, with total company organic growth being 3.2%. Total company gross margin for the first quarter was 42.4%, which is down from last year's first quarter gross margin of 43.2% due to lower recycled paper prices and higher material cost. I will discuss these items in more detail by segment. Before doing so, let me remind you again that there were 66 workdays in our first quarter, which is the same as last year. Looking to the remainder of fiscal 2013, our workdays will be as follows: 65 in the second quarter, 64 in the third quarter and 66 in the fourth quarter. The workdays in the second and fourth quarters are the same as last year. The third quarter has 1 less workday, as Bill mentioned, than last fiscal year, where there were 65 workdays in the third quarter of fiscal 2012. We have 4 reportable operating segments: Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products; Uniform Direct Sales; First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection Services; and Document Management Services. Uniform Direct Sales, First Aid Safety and Fire Protection Services and Document Management Services are combined and presented as Other services on the face of the income statement. The Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products operating segment consists of the rental and servicing of uniforms, masks, towels and other related items. The segment also includes restroom supplies and other facility products and services. Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products revenue accounted for 72% of company revenue in the first quarter. First quarter Rental revenue was $754.8 million, which is up 4.9% compared to last year's first quarter. Organic growth was also 4.9%. We are pleased with our revenue performance for the quarter despite the sluggish economic environment. Our sales reps continued to perform at relatively high productivity levels and our lost business improved from last year's first quarter. During our July earnings release call to report fourth quarter results, we indicated that our net adds stops trend worsened in that fourth quarter. That trend did not continue to worsen through the first quarter. Historically, we have experienced a seasonal pickup in net adds stops from the fourth quarter to the first quarter and we did, in fact, see that normal pickup during the third quarter. Our Rentals segment gross margin was 43.3% for the first quarter, a 60-basis-point decrease from last year's first quarter gross margin of 43.9%. Energy-related costs were down 50 basis points compared to last year's first quarter. This benefit though, was primarily offset by an increase in material costs due to the high level of new business from the past several quarters and the expected greater cotton impact. High levels of new business require incremental injection of new inventory. The first quarter gross margin of 43.3% was consistent with the fourth quarter of last year. Our Uniform Direct Sales operating segment includes the direct sale of uniforms, branded promotional products and other related products to national and regional customers. Uniforms and other related products are also sold to local customers, including products sold to rental customers through our direct sale catalog. Uniform Direct Sales revenue accounted for 10% of company revenue in the first quarter. First quarter revenue of $100.3 million represents a decrease of 1.4% compared to last year's first quarter. We have seen some softening in our Rental catalog business which is consistent with the general cautiousness of our customers, but this revenue level was consistent with our internal plan. We are currently gearing up for several large rollouts scheduled for the second half of the fiscal year and expect this operating segment to have a good year. Uniform Direct Sales gross margin was 29.4% for the first quarter, which is up 80 basis points from last year's first quarter gross margin of 28.6%. This segment's gross margin can move from quarter-to-quarter due to changes in mix of product and timing of program rollouts. Our First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection Services operating segment includes revenue from the sale and servicing of first aid products, safety products and training and fire protection products. First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection revenue accounted for 10% of company revenue in the first quarter. Revenue was $110.8 million, which is a record quarterly revenue level for this operating segment. It was an increase of 6.8% versus last year's first quarter revenue, with organic growth being 6.6%. We're pleased with the performance of both the First Aid and Safety business and the Fire Protection business. This segment's gross margin was 43.1% in the first quarter, which is about the same as last year's first quarter of 43.2%. Improvements in warehouse capacity utilization and lower energy related costs were offset by expanded route capacity due to this operating segment's growth over the past year. The first quarter gross margin of 43.1% was an improvement over the 42.4% in last year's fourth quarter. Our Document Management Services operating segment includes document destruction, storage and imaging services and it accounted for 8% of first quarter total company revenue. Document management revenue decreased 7.5% compared to last year's first quarter. Revenue decreased organically by 8.3% compared to last year. Year-over-year Document Management results continue to be negatively affected by lower recycled paper prices and difficult operating conditions in Europe, including a weaker euro. The average recycled paper price during the first quarter was roughly $170 per ton, which was an improvement from last year's fourth quarter average of roughly $150 per ton. However, the first quarter average of $170 per ton was a significant drop from last year's first quarter average of $275 per ton. This lower year-over-year price negatively impacted revenue for the first quarter by $8.3 million and this impact also directly affects the gross margin and operating margin of the business. Europe continues to be a challenging operating environment. Revenue growth has been difficult and the weaker euro relative to last year's first quarter level negatively impacted the results. Switching to selling and administrative expenses, SG&A was 29.2% as a percentage of revenue in the first quarter. This is an improvement from last year's first quarter of 30.5%. This 130-basis-point improvement from last year is due largely to improved worker's comp claims experienced and lower amortization of deferred charges related to prior year acquisitions. First quarter selling and administrative expenses of 29.2% of revenue were higher than the 28.8% in last year's fourth quarter, in part due to normal first quarter expenses as we began our fiscal year. Our effective tax rate was 37.5% for the quarter compared to 38.5% last year. The effective tax rate can fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter based on tax reserve builds and releases relating to specific discrete items. For the full fiscal 2013 year, we expect our effective tax rate to be 37.3%, which is slightly higher than last year's 36.8%. Last year's rate was impacted favorably by the resolution of federal audits. Turning now to the balance sheet, our cash and marketable securities were $330 million at August 31, down $10 million from the $340 million in cash at May 31, primarily due to the share buyback of $71 million during the first quarter, offset by cash generated from operations. Included in the $330 million at August 31 was $49 million of cash located outside of the U.S. Accounts receivable increased by $8 million since May 31. DSOs on accounts receivable were 40, which is the same as at May 31. New goods inventory at August 31 was $242 million, down $9 million from May 31. Inventory continued to normalize during the quarter from higher post-SAP conversion levels. We're now seeing some efficiency gains from SAP. We do expect an increase in the remainder of the year due to the large rollouts in Uniform Direct Sales mentioned earlier. Accrued liabilities decreased to $43 million compared to May 31, primarily due to lower accrued bond interest and accrued profit sharing. Long-term debt at August 31 was $1.3 billion. We had $225 million of 6%, 10-year debt mature on June 1 and we refinanced that with a new issue of $250 million, 10-year debt on June 5, with a coupon of 3.25%. As of August 31, our total debt to EBITDA remains slightly below 2x. Moving on to cash flow, cash provided by operating activities in the first quarter was $95 million, which is up from last year's first quarter amount of $57 million. In addition to higher net income, the decrease in inventory during this year's first quarter and an increase in accounts payable added to the improvement over last year. CapEx for the first quarter was $47.4 million. Our CapEx by operating segment was as follows: $32.1 million in Rental; $2.4 million in Uniform Direct Sales; $3.9 million in First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection; and $9 million in Document Management. We expect CapEx for fiscal 2013 to be in the range of $190 million to $210 million. That concludes our prepared remarks and we will now take any of your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from Sara Gubins with Bank of America.
Sara Gubins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: In your prepared remarks, you mentioned that add/stops, that the trend had gotten better. Last quarter, you had mentioned that they both worsened but also turned negative. Could you talk about what you saw in the first quarter? Was it still negative or did it turn back positive?
J. Michael Hansen: We generally see, Sarah, a positive movement in the first quarter from the fourth quarter of seasonal impact and it did, in fact, turn positive.
Sara Gubins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: And then I think you had talked about expectations of SG&A being flat as a percent of revenue for the full year. Is that still what you're expecting?
J. Michael Hansen: I think we would expect a slight improvement in SG&A for the year, Sara.
William C. Gale: [indiscernible] that was consistent with what we said before.
Sara Gubins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: That it should be down year-over-year as a percent of revenue?
William C. Gale: Correct.
Operator: We'll go next to Nate Brochmann with William Blair & Company.
Nathan Brochmann - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: It would in fact, a little bit, I mean, obviously, you guys stressed with the economy, it's still pretty weak and the unemployment rate certainly hasn't gotten better and the jobless claims kind of see-saw from week-to-week. But I mean you guys are still doing a really great job in terms of winning new business. Could you talk a little bit in terms of one, what you're doing there? And two, just the general kind of feedback from your customers as you're going out and winning that new business in terms of why they're investing now in the face of an uncertain economy?
William C. Gale: Nate, I think the reason that the new business efforts continue to show decent results is a combination of a couple of things. First off, it's the value of the program itself. We've talked a lot about that. The fact that you can get 5 changes each week of uniforms, no investment by the company or the employee in the uniforms and get them all taken care of for a relatively modest price is a phenomenal value. And I think that more and more companies continue to see that and that's why our business results, new business results, primarily the majority of it is the no programmer segment. I think the second reason is some of the product offerings that we have. We've talked a lot about our relationship with Carhartt. We continue to see very nice results in the FRC garment, the flame-resistant garment, especially in the energy sector, which is a growing sector in the U.S. economy. And then I'd say that next thing is in the Rental business, our Facility Services business, which is over 1/2 -- or which is about 1/2 of that total Rental segment. We continue to have very nice offerings for resolving some of the problems that companies face in such things as the floor care solutions, which includes the tile and carpet cleaning, the hygiene solutions, the restroom supplies and then the addition of the chemical cleaning systems that we have out there I think have all helped on that side of the business. So with all that said, I think our new business results continue to be good. Lost business continues to show some modest improvement year-over-year. We're just not getting the adds yet from existing customers. Maybe when the economy turns around after there's some certainty, we'll begin to really see that and see our growth accelerate.
Nathan Brochmann - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: So it kind of sounds like, at least in terms of what you've been doing on the new business and the penetration with some of the newer service offerings, it sounds like there's still pretty decent runway to go on that, then.
William C. Gale: Yes, I think there certainly is and we are continuing to invest in our sales force. We believe we've got some compelling product offerings for customers and we continue to feel very bullish about it. Just a pickup in the economy will just really accelerate some of that growth rate and improve profitability, certainly.
Operator: We'll go next to Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel, Nicolaus.
Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: I want to piggy back to the last question. You guys are certainly growing very respectively in the Rentals business way above what the overall GDP is growing. Is there growth coming on the Rental side more? Is it coming more from the Ancillary businesses? Can you just give us a little bit more detail on that?
William C. Gale: Good question, Shlomo. Mike and I looked a lot at that in preparation for this call and it's really comparable growth, both in Uniforms and in the Facility Services side. So while it may be a little bit of surprising to people, the fact that our new business efforts are successful in both sides of that Rental business, I think it's encouraging and I think what it tells us is that it's still a good value, as I was just mentioning to Nate, for a company, for both the Uniform as well as the Facility Services side. So I'm encouraged by that.
Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: And then in terms of the growth, you said it's primarily no new programmers. Is there a trajectory there that more and more of your businesses, new programmers versus takeaways from competitors or is there any change in that over the last year or so?
William C. Gale: The last year or so, it's been about almost 2/3 of our new business has been no programmers. And that was -- if you went back prerecession, that was what we were experiencing pretty much on an ongoing basis. Then during the recession, we saw less of that and more competitive wins. I think our salespeople continue to find that given the fact that many of our -- that all of this business is contractual business, it's difficult to take it away from a competitor until it gets to the end of the contract and I think that we continue to see a lot of focus on the no programmers side because that's much easier to get than waiting for a contract to expire.
Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: That makes sense. And then what are you seeing on the competitive side? Are you seeing in deals where you are in competition, is it rational? Are you seeing competitors feeling that they have to hold the line on price more? We hadn't seen more of that going through the last of the year, last year.
William C. Gale: Yes. Unfortunately, I think what we're seeing right now is with the slowdown in the economy over the last several months, I'd say competitors have returned to a little bit more aggressive pricing. Hopefully, that will be a short-term situation. We don't think that's the good way to go. That's why we continue to focus on profitable business. But I would say that's all dependent on how the economy -- when it picks up.
Operator: We'll go next to Thomas Allen with Morgan Stanley.
Thomas Allen - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Can you give us more color on how the different segments of the Document Management business did? So the shredding, recycled paper sales volumes, storage and then also imaging?
J. Michael Hansen: Thomas, we've not necessarily gotten into that level of detail but I can tell you, I mentioned on last quarter's call that the Document Management growth, without Recycling, was about 1%, mainly because of the issues in the European operating environment and our storage and imaging, which is such a project-based business, was down. In the first quarter, we saw that improve to over 2% and while we're still seeing a good performance in our shredding business, the project-based business in storage and imaging is still not strong and the European business is still in an environment where it's very difficult to grow. And the euro, the weaker euro, really had a negative impact on the quarter, too.
Thomas Allen - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: And then just a numbers question here, D&A dropped pretty significantly this quarter. What drove that and is this the right run rate going forward?
J. Michael Hansen: We had a decrease in our amortization due to some intangibles related to prior acquisitions. So that rolled off and so I think that the run rate is a good one from going forward, anyway.
Operator: We'll go next to John Healy with Northcoast Research.
John M. Healy - Northcoast Research: Bill, I was hoping you could just run past on some of -- over again, some of the comments you made on the SG&A line, the sources of it being down. I understand the amortization point, but I don't know if I caught it all but I thought you mentioned something on worker's comp and I just want to make sure I understood it.
William C. Gale: We had a little bit better experience in workers' comp in the quarter than what we some in the first quarter last year. That will fluctuate, John, depending on what happens, what cases get resolved, et cetera. So there was some minor improvement in our medical expense but generally speaking, as Mike alluded to, a more significant impact would have been the drop off of the amortization of the deferred charges.
John M. Healy - Northcoast Research: And Bill, I was hoping you could maybe take a step back and maybe talk philosophically in terms of how you're thinking about the business today. When I think about your company over the last 5 to 7 years, it's always been about building a sales organization and building a sales structure that would take you into new business lines and really propel the growth of the company. And that for a while caused the SG&A line, at times, to grow faster than the revenues and for a number of quarters, we've seen revenues grow faster than SG&A and SG&A come down. What is the new normal for you guys in terms of the investments you need to make into the salesforce and how should we think about sales growing relative to revenue because you keep outperforming, I think, everybody on the SG&A line? And I'm trying to understand how we should be thinking about how you should be performing there.
William C. Gale: Well I think philosophically, we always believed that we need to get leverage in our G&A portion of the company. And given the fact that we are now growing that top line again over the last couple of years versus what we did during the recession, we're able to do that. We also have seen some better performance on the part of our -- in our workman's comp and our medical expenses, which have helped. The union bite is, for the most part, over. So that has certainly helped some of the legal expenses that we were incurring. So I think that we're back to where we want to be with a growing top line and leveraging that G&A. On the sales side, we believe that we have staffed appropriately for all of our businesses in order to grow those businesses and I think our new business results have been very good over the last couple of years, reflecting this high productivity level we're getting from the salesforce. We continue to increase appropriately in the correct markets the number of salespeople we have, but I don't think we're going to need to do a significant step up in that in order to get our growth. We feel that where we're at is appropriate and it will be modest growth going forward. What we would like to see again, as Mike mentioned, is some existing customer growth when they add back employees. And if we can get that, then we'll return to double-digit company growth that we've been talking about for years.
Operator: We'll go next to Andrew Wittmann with Robert W. Baird and Company.
Andrew J. Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: I wanted to just dig into the guidance a little bit. I guess my calculations suggested for the back half, for the last 3 quarters of this fiscal year that revenue growth was in the 3.7% to about 6.9% range. When we look at this quarter, even adding back the paper price headwind that you faced, you're looking at about a 4% growth for the quarter. So looks like the top end would imply some acceleration. I just want to maybe, Bill, to get a little perspective from you. What are some of the variables that could suggest what -- in what you're seeing today, what are some of the variables that could help you get to that high end of the guidance range?
William C. Gale: Well, a couple of things. First off, it will be -- we're pretty certain on the direct sale business, as Mike mentioned, that you're going to see an acceleration in that because we've got some large rollouts and that's in the plan and embedded in the guidance. But to get to the top end of the guidance, what I would say you would see is a better economy. Therefore, an improvement in the confidence level on the part of business owners to either add employees or to make discretionary spends. As we've talked, our catalog business was relatively flat. We think a lot of that is just caution on the part of the business owner. We could see getting to the top end of that range caused by the better-than-expected increase in paper prices than what we've embedded in there. And I would just say, employers just willing to add an employee here or there is going to have a positive impact on that. With all that said, I want to reiterate a point that Mike made and I try to make is, as you guys lay out your guidance, keep in mind this third quarter has these fewer number of workdays, and also I think the most difficult period we may have is right around the end of the calendar year. So our guidance anticipates that the fourth quarter should be pretty decent, third quarter is not going to be quite as good just because of all these other factors that are going on. But I'd say we have pretty good confidence in the guidance that we gave you and hopefully, we'll be able to achieve that top end of the things that I've mentioned earlier, happen.
Andrew J. Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: I wanted to dig also a little bit into the Rentals segment's gross margin. Maybe I missed a number, some of them I got. It sounds like for the segment, energy was a 50 basis point benefit. Mike, what was the garment, both through cotton and new injections, headwind that you experienced there? I'm just trying to understand kind of the delta on year-over-year basis to understand what some of the pieces were.
J. Michael Hansen: Well, you're correct about the 50 basis points of energy. Material cost was a headwind, like it had been in the previous couple of quarters. We haven't gotten in publicly to the details of the increase in material costs but that wasn't the entire piece. There were other things here and there, none of which were significant. But generally speaking, we saw -- I think if you look at the rental gross margin in our first quarter, it was pretty consistent with the previous 3 quarters. And I'll tell you, last year's first quarter was a pretty good quarter. That 43.9% was a quarter we hadn't seen in the last 3 or in the previous couple. And part of that was due to we started to see an acceleration in our Rental business. We were getting a lot of leverage and the growth is causing us to now add some routes and to add some resources. And so, our first quarter was consistent with the previous 3. We just had a really nice quarter in the first quarter of '11.
Andrew J. Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: You didn't talk really about price in that response. I'm just trying to understand. It sounded like your commentary already said it's kind of heated up and gotten a little bit more competitive. Is price at least, from the delta that we saw?
J. Michael Hansen: I'm not sure that I would say it was much of a delta, Andy.
Andrew J. Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: And then just final question, if I might, on the Document business. If you're in the 1% or 2% range from last couple of quarters, last year it was kind of mid-single digits. Just wondering kind of what was the change primarily? Is it a volume thing, is it a pricing thing there, competition, retention rates? Just some sort of color to understand a little bit what's happening in the last couple of quarters versus maybe last year.
William C. Gale: Well, I think it's project-oriented business that really impacts the imaging business. And as we've mentioned last in the fourth quarter recall, one of our strategies is to get more recurring business there but we had a lot of kind of what I'd call onetime project, especially in the financial institutions. So that added impact on it. We're just not seeing much growth at all in storage and therefore, that's one of the reasons we've always said that our preference is more on the treading side. The European businesses, we beat that quite a bit with the euro and with just the lack of growth over there. While it's only 1% of our overall company's revenue, it's a little bit bigger piece of the Document Management segment. And then I would say that in the shredding side, the focus has been selling good business. There has -- there were some aggressive companies out there in the business that we don't think are necessarily long-term committed to the business that were getting pretty aggressive in the fourth quarter last year and even into a little bit of the first quarter this year. But that seems to be stabilizing a bit because they're seeing the result of the lower paper prices and it's impacting their profit margins. We've got some nice customer rollouts in place, are going to be in place here in the next couple of quarters that are really good wins for us. So we expect this growth rate, especially on the shredding side, to really start picking up. And then the comparables, of course in paper are going to become much easier as we go through the year.
Operator: We'll go next to James Samford with Citigroup.
James Samford - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Just wanted to dig in a little bit into the sort of no programmer trends that you've added over the last couple of years. I was wondering, how are they trending relative to some of the programmers that you had prior to or during the recession that have not been adding people? Have you basically been adding more healthy businesses relative to what you had before so the mix is changing a little bit to the better?
William C. Gale: Well, I would tell you that even when we add a no programmer, you typically don't see a lot of increase in their headcount. So we get a no programmer but just as we're seeing across the general economy, they're staying with their workforce and not adding a lot to their workforce, that's a general statement. There's been a little pickup, as I mentioned, in the Energy segment in the U.S. So we picked up some more of that business. But even -- the new no programmer customers we get are not really growing their companies any more than the programmers are.
J. Michael Hansen: The one thing that I would add is in those no programmer accounts, when we're talking about energy-related, it's generally fire-resistant clothing and we've sold our Carhartt business and that generally equates to a higher-priced item than our normal workwear. And so that has certainly helped in the last couple of years.
James Samford - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: I guess on the direct sales side, is it fair to assume that we should pretty much expect sort of negative growth through most of the year up until probably Q4, to give a tough comp in Q3? So is negative sort of the right way to think about it?
William C. Gale: No, no. I think it's going to turn positive before the year's out.
James Samford - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: And I guess one quick question on M&A activity. Still pretty solid balance sheet and last quarter you talked about them. So not seeing too many interesting opportunities, just wondering if you could comment on how things are today.
William C. Gale: I guess I'm a little disappointed we didn't have more activity in the first quarter. You see it was just practically insignificant. I'm encouraged a bit that there seems to be a little bit more activity now. So I would expect there to be more acquisition activity over the course of the next couple of quarters. But with that said, it's certainly not at levels that we could actually do given our balance sheet and our access to capital. There still doesn't seem to be the kind of deals out there that would make sense of any size.
Operator: We'll go next to Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan.
Andrew C. Steinerman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: I heard mention of adding some routes and I assume that's because a lot of our growth has come from new customers and new businesses and necessitated subdivided routes. The question is how long do you think those types of inefficiencies are going to remain and how much of an effect does that have on Rental gross margin?
William C. Gale: Well, that's a difficult question to answer because as you know, Andrew, it's all local business. So one operation may have -- be able to put a lot more business and move it to a route without much margin impact than another operation. But generally, let me say this. We have decided that it is necessary to have more route capacity in order to properly take care of our customers and to give our service providers incentive to continue to maintain their business, work with their customers, treat them in a way that Cintas wants to treat their customers. And so we think that while there might be a short-term margin impact in some operations, it will quickly be overcome by better lost business results and better improvement of growth with existing customers with other products and services.
Andrew C. Steinerman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: And with that in mind, do you have a sense of how much spare capacity you have in the routes?
William C. Gale: Boy, there's no way I can -- we've got so many thousands of routes, I do not know. I would say that up until the last couple of quarters, there was very little capacity because we were trying to do everything we could to maximize our routes and trying to get our return to better margins. It's only because we've been able to do that and now we're seeing the top line growth. I would say we freed up a little bit of capacity. And then you're going to see some -- the CapEx, as Mike said, is $190 million to $210 million. A lot of that is trucks to basically create that capacity. So I'd say we're getting to more normalized levels that we would want to have in order to properly take care of customers and allow for more growth on existing routes.
Operator: And our next question comes from Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer.
Scott A. Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division: Just a couple of clarification questions. In responding to, I think it was Shlomo's question on the aggressiveness in pricing, when you said that, that had picked up, Bill, were you responding to just in the Rental or in the uniform Rental category or was that more broad? I guess could you take us around the horn a little bit with regard to pricing, please?
William C. Gale: I think it's primarily in the Uniform and Facility Services business and a little bit in the Direct Sale business. I would say we've actually seen a slight improvement in pricing environment in the Document Management business and we've never really had too much of an issue with First Aid and Safety and Fire, that has been fairly steady.
Scott A. Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division: And on this concern over the third quarter, the fiscal cliff, the fewer days. I guess, could you remind us what type of impact, rule of thumb on the numbers 2 less days would have year-over-year to help us with the models? I see that the consensus has you going down in revenue 2Q to 3Q, but EPS up. Just wanted to discuss that dynamic to the extent you can a little bit more.
William C. Gale: I can't come up with it off the top of my head. But basically, just take that kind of a revenue run and divide it over the fewer days and it's a little less around 1% or so and then that certainly has an impact on the margins.
J. Michael Hansen: I think if you go back, Scott, last year, we saw some nice improvements in the second and the third quarter because we were really getting some good leverage. I think if you go back a couple of years, though, and look from first to second to third, you would see some overall margin drop. And I think that those years, '10, '11, are probably some good indications of the drop. Generally speaking, when you have 2 less workdays in the first quarter but you've got that depreciation and amortization that are the same per month, because those are kind of a monthly number, you've got material costs that's generally on a monthly basis. And so it certainly is an impact. In the third quarter, you've also got a resetting of payroll taxes.
Scott A. Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division: And then lastly, if I could just ask because you brought it up a couple of times and it was discussed last quarter. Energy and in the Carhartt products, in Fire Resistance, it sounds like that's really moving. Can you give us a feel for what type of contribution that's been, maybe as mix or contribution points to the growth? Just wanted to get a feel for magnitude to the extent you can share.
William C. Gale: We're not going to give you the components of it. The FRC business is a piece of our Rental business and it is certainly been growing a little faster than the other Rental business, but the standard Rental product line and facility services line also have been growing. So I'm just not going to get into the habit of producing all the different pieces for competitive reasons.
Scott A. Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division: But the trend is still favorable? You see that momentum?
William C. Gale: Yes, the trend is still favorable.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We'll go next to Joe Box with KeyBanc.
Joe Box - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: I just want to flush out a comment from earlier. I think, Mike, you mentioned that there are several new brochure rollouts that you're planning for the second half in your direct uniform business. One, can you just put some color around what those might be? And two, I think you mentioned that you're looking for some positive growth in that business later in the year. Are we looking for kind of a normal low to mid single-digit growth rate or could it potentially be more?
J. Michael Hansen: I'd rather not get into the customer-specific information, but we have a couple of multimillion dollar rollouts in that business. Generally, in the Uniform Direct Sale business, we expect, although bumpy, we expect generally, a mid-single-digit growth rate and I would expect it will be in that neighborhood for the year.
Joe Box - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: For the full year?
J. Michael Hansen: For the full year.
Joe Box - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: And then switching gears over to merchandise amortization and just uniform rental margins, I think last quarter, you guys were thinking that the cotton headwind could persist through the first half. Obviously, it was a factor this quarter. But potentially, that could switch to a tailwind in the second half. I guess with patents still trending below the 5-year average and maybe as you move to more of a normalization in new account sign-ups, could we be looking at maybe more of a benefit in the second half of this year than what you were previously thinking?
J. Michael Hansen: I don't think so, Joe. And you're correct, we said that the cotton headwind would go through mid-fiscal '13. But as it rolls off and some lower cotton prices roll on, from quarter-to-quarter, it's a pretty small impact. And the fact that we continue to add new business at pretty good clips means we'll continue to inject inventory. And so I wouldn't expect that the change in the cotton would offset or really reduce the material cost from the continuing new business efforts.
Operator: And we'll go next to Gary Bisbee with Barclays Capital.
Gary E. Bisbee - Barclays Capital, Research Division: I just wanted to follow-up on 2 things. The comment around or the commentary you gave around expanding the routes. Is there any way to think about where the footprint is in all the offerings? I mean, I know you offer uniform rentals everywhere but where are you in shredding? Where are you in the various First Aid, Fire Safety? And maybe the one I feel like I have less understanding of, where are you on the various Facility Services business in terms of North American geographic coverage?
William C. Gale: Well, the Facility Service business pretty much coincides with the Rental business in North America. So when we have an operation, a Rental plant in a city, we typically are providing a similar level of all the facility services. So I would say that, that coverage kind of coincides with each other. The Document Management business, the shredding side, I think the latest count we're in probably around 80% of the top 150 MSAs. So there's still some room to grow there. Storage is much less than that. I mean, it's only in a select few markets. And then as far as the First Aid and Fire business, I would say the First Aid business is in the majority of the MSAs, in the top 100 MSAs in the country. The fire is at about 60%, maybe of the top 100 MSAs. So that's why our continued acquisition focus will be with filling out the footprint in fire and document shredding.
Gary E. Bisbee - Barclays Capital, Research Division: And then I guess that was the next question. Just what type of assets are you looking for on an M&A front? I mean, is there anything of scale at all out there? Or is part of the problem just that there aren't? I know for years in uniform, you've talked about a number of midsized assets that were family-run and you would be an obvious acquirer if the next generation wanted to sell. Do you see the market like that or is it just that this is such a mom-and-pop market? There's not much that can move the needle?
William C. Gale: Oh, no. Well, it depends. Let's talk about the businesses again. So in the Uniform side, there are still a lot of nice sized companies out there. In addition to the public companies, there are some very good regional players that would be wonderful acquisitions if the price were right. There's still a lot of good tuck-in acquisitions, smart to small markets -- not small market but 1 or 2 market operations that would be very nice additions to Cintas and we continue to pursue those, that just hasn't been a meeting of the price expectations. In document shredding, there certainly are some big players there and I think most of you know who those are. Iron Mountain, Shred-It, Recall, all have very good sized shredding operations. There still are hundreds and hundreds of small and some moderate, regional-type players there that we continue to have some discussions with. So I think there'll be some opportunities presenting themselves there. In the Fire business, boy, once you get beyond, you got your -- the big guy out there with Tyco's, SimplexGrinnell business, I think they're getting ready to spinoff, but there really are not a lot of big sized players. They're mostly small companies, a couple of little regional guys, but that is more of a -- there's going to be a lot of little acquisitions that we'll probably be making in that space.
Operator: And we have no more questions in queue.
William C. Gale: Thank you all for joining us. We appreciate all the interest in Cintas. The next release will be the latter part of December, right before the holidays and we would expect to have the earnings call at that time. So we'll look forward to speaking to you then.
Operator: This concludes today's call. Have a wonderful day.

Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Cintas Quarterly Earnings Results Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Mr. Bill Gale, Senior Vice President of Finance and Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead, sir.
William C. Gale: Good evening. Thank you for joining us as we report our fourth quarter results for fiscal 2012. With me is Mike Hansen, Cintas' Vice President and Treasurer. After some commentary on the results and our fiscal 2013 guidance, we will be happy to answer questions. The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a safe harbor from civil litigation for forward-looking statements. This conference call contains forward-looking statements that reflect the company's current views as to future events and financial performance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those we may discuss. I refer you to the discussion on these points contained in our most recent filings with the SEC. We are pleased to report record fourth quarter revenue of $1,054,000,000. In an increasingly sluggish U.S. economy, fourth quarter revenue grew 4.1% from last year's fourth quarter. Fourth quarter net income increased by 11.1% to $79 million, and earnings per diluted share were $0.60, a 22.4% increase over last year. Mike will provide more details shortly on the fourth quarter performance. This fourth quarter concluded a very successful fiscal 2012 year for Cintas in which our revenue topped the $4 billion mark for the first time at $4,102,000,000 and our earnings per diluted share hit a record level of $2.27. Our employees, who we call partners, did a great job of executing our game plan throughout this past 12 months. Congratulations to our partners on their achievements this year. We remain confident in our business' opportunities and our ability to execute our game plan. As such, during our fourth quarter, we purchased 3.3 million shares of Cintas stock at an aggregate cost of $129.6 million. Since these purchases were made so late in the fiscal year, they had no impact on our fourth quarter results. However, we expect it will positively increase fiscal 2013 earnings per diluted share by about $0.06. This impact is incorporated into our fiscal 2013 guidance. Our board authorized a $500 million share buyback program in October 2011, so we now have $370.4 million remaining of that authorization. Now I would like to turn the call over to Mike for more details on the fourth quarter, after which I will provide additional comments on our fiscal 2013 guidance.
J. Michael Hansen: Thank you, Bill. As Bill mentioned, total revenue increased 4.1% from the fourth quarter of last year with total company organic growth being 4%. Total company gross margin for the fourth quarter was 42.1%, which is down from last year's fourth quarter gross margin of 42.8% mainly due to lower recycled paper prices. I will discuss these items in more detail by segment. Before doing so, please let me remind you that there are 66 workdays in our fourth quarter, which was the same as last year. Looking forward to fiscal 2013, our workdays will be as follows: 66 in the first quarter, 65 in the second quarter, 64 workdays in the third quarter and 66 in the fourth quarter. The total workdays in fiscal 2013 will be 261, which is one less than fiscal 2012. The difference occurs in the third quarter, where there were 65 workdays in fiscal 2012. The one less workday in fiscal 2013 will negatively impact fiscal 2013 total revenue growth by about 40 basis points. We have 4 reportable operating segments: Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products; Uniform Direct Sales; First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection Services; and Document Management Services. Uniform Direct Sales; First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection Services and Document Management Services are combined and presented as Other Services on the face of the income statement. The Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products operating segment consists of the rental and servicing of uniforms, mats, towels and other related items. This segment also includes restroom supplies and other facility products and services. Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products revenue accounted for 71% of company revenue in the fourth quarter. Within Rental, based on fourth quarter revenue levels, uniform rental accounted for approximately 52% of the revenue; dust control, which is mainly entrance mats, accounted for 19%; hygiene and other services, which is restroom supply, cleaning services and chemical services, was 16%; shop towel revenue was 5%; and linen and other, which is mainly nonperson-specific garments, such as aprons and butcher coats, was 8%. Fourth quarter rental revenue was $749 million, which is up 5.2% compared to last year's fourth quarter. Organic growth was also 5.2%. Growth continued to come in the form of new business, and sales rep productivity continued to be good. However, just as we have seen worsening trends in U.S. employment and in the general U.S. economy, our net add/stops trending worsened throughout the quarter. This worsening trend contributed to a slowing of the revenue growth rate from 6.5% organic growth in our third quarter. Our Rental segment gross margin was 43.3% for the fourth quarter, a 30-basis-point decrease from last year's fourth quarter gross margin of 43.6%. Energy-related costs were down 50 basis points compared to last year's fourth quarter. This benefit, though, was offset by an increase in material costs due to the high level of new business during the year, as well as the expected higher cotton impact. The worsening trend of net add/stops resulted in a greater percentage of revenue coming from new business, which requires injection of new inventory. Our Uniform Direct Sales operating segment includes the direct sale of uniforms, branded promotional products and other related products to national and regional customers. Uniforms and other related products are also sold to local customers, including products sold to rental customers through our direct sale catalog. Uniform Direct Sales revenue accounted for 11% of company revenue in the fourth quarter. Fourth quarter revenue of $111.2 million represents an increase of 2% compared to last year's fourth quarter. There were no acquisitions in this segment. Uniform Direct Sales gross margin was 30.7% for the fourth quarter, which is down slightly from last year's fourth quarter gross margin of 30.9%. The gross margin of 30.7% was a slight improvement over the third quarter gross margin of 30.5%. This segment's gross margin can move from quarter-to-quarter due to changes in mix of product and timing of program rollouts. Our First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection Services operating segment includes revenue from the sale and servicing of first aid products, safety products and training and fire protection products. First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection revenue accounted for 10% of company revenue in the fourth quarter. Revenue was $108.9 million, an increase of 9.3% versus last year's fourth quarter. Organic growth was 9%. This segment had a very good fiscal year, growing 10.1% and topping $400 million for the full fiscal year. This segment's gross margin was 42.4% in the fourth quarter compared to 41.7% in last year's fourth quarter. Energy-related expenses were 20 basis points lower this year compared to last year. In addition, improved capacity utilization from the higher volumes continue to drive the gross margin expansion. Our Document Management Services operating segment includes document destruction, storage and imaging services, and it accounted for 8% of fourth quarter total company revenue. Document Management revenue decreased 8% compared to last year's fourth quarter. Revenue decreased organically by 8.2% compared to last year. Our Document Management fourth quarter performance was adversely affected by 3 things. First, the recycled paper prices stayed at roughly $150 per ton during the quarter. This resulted in a decrease of over 30% compared to last year's fourth quarter. This lower price negatively impacted revenue for the quarter by $7.4 million, and this impact also directly affects the gross margin and operating margin of the business. Bill will discuss our fiscal 2013 recycled paper price assumptions in his guidance discussion. The second item to negatively affect performance was continuing difficulty in Europe. We have made operational and efficiency improvements in our businesses during this fiscal year, but revenue growth in the current environment is a challenge. And the third item to negatively affect fourth quarter results is the performance of our imaging business. The imaging business is largely a project business, and last year's fourth quarter benefited from several large onetime projects that did not reoccur this year. Despite the challenges of lower recycled paper prices, we continue to be pleased with the North American document shredding side of the business. We continue to move forward with our game plan of managing the business for the long-term benefit of our customers, selling profitable business and creating efficiencies from off-site shredding opportunities and from process improvements. Since the impact of lower recycled paper prices falls directly to the bottom line, the Document Management gross margin dropped to 46.8% in the fourth quarter compared to 51.4% in last year's fourth quarter. Switching to selling and administrative expenses, SG&A was 28.8% as a percentage of revenue in the fourth quarter. This is an improvement from last year's fourth quarter of 30.1%. This 130-basis-point improvement from last year is due largely to managing our cost structure while continuing to grow revenue. Fourth quarter selling and administrative expenses of 28.8% of revenue were higher than the 28.5% in this year's third quarter due to a 50-basis-point increase in the cost of providing medical benefits to our employees. Our effective tax rate was 36.2% for the quarter compared to 39.5% last year. The effective tax rate can fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter based on tax reserve builds and releases relating to specific discrete items. For the full fiscal year, our effective tax rate was 36.8%, which is slightly lower than our expected rate of 37% due to the resolution of federal audits of our fiscal 2009 and 2010 years. Turning now to the balance sheet, our cash balance was $340 million at May 31, down $13 million from the $353 million in cash and marketable securities at February 29 primarily due to the share buyback of $130 million during the fourth quarter. Included in the $340 million at May 31 was $52 million of cash located outside of the U.S. During the fourth quarter, we took advantage of a onetime opportunity to bring $110 million back into the U.S. Accounts receivable increased by $11 million since February 29. DSOs on accounts receivable were 40, which is the same as at February 29. New goods inventory at May 31 was $251 million, down $25 million from February 29. This decrease was expected as the relatively high levels of the past year due to the SAP conversion normalized. Accrued liabilities increased $33 million compared to February 29 primarily due to higher accrued bond interest and higher accrued profit sharing. Long-term debt at May 31 was $1.3 billion, of which $226 million was in current liabilities. We repaid $225 million of 6%, 10-year debt that matured on June 1, 2012. And we issued new 10-year debt on June 5 with a coupon of 3.25%. We issued the new debt due to the attractiveness of the interest rate levels. As of May 31, our total debt-to-EBITDA is slightly below 2x. Moving on to cash flow, cash provided by operating activities in the fourth quarter was $162 million, which is up from last year's fourth quarter amount of $133 million. In addition to higher net income, the decrease in inventory during this year's fourth quarter added to the improvement over last year. CapEx for the fourth quarter was $43.1 million. Our CapEx by operating segment was as follows: $31.2 million in Rental; $1.6 million in Uniform Direct Sales; $2.7 million in First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection; and $7.6 million in Document Management. We expect CapEx for fiscal 2013 to be in the range of $190 million to $210 million. I'll now turn the call back over to Bill for comments on our fiscal 2013 guidance.
William C. Gale: Thanks, Mike. Our fiscal 2013 guidance is for revenue to be in the range of $4.25 billion to $4.35 billion and earnings per diluted share to be in the range of $2.47 to $2.55. Let me walk through a few assumptions so you can better understand the guidance. This guidance certainly considers the current economic climate, which is not healthy. We have had 3 consecutive months of poor job creation. In fact, only 225,000 jobs were created in that time, about half of which were professional and administrative positions. The Institute for Supply Management indicated in June that exports fell and new factory orders dropped at the fastest pace since 2001. We've seen numerous U.S. GDP forecasts that show growth of less than 2% during the next 18 months. As Mike mentioned, our net add/stops trending worsened during the -- our fourth quarter, a reflection of our customers' concern and uncertainty at this time. Clearly, there is little momentum in the economy. Despite this lack of momentum, though, we remain encouraged by our business' performance and continue to expect our revenue to grow organically in the mid-single digits in this type of environment. As we have discussed on the last few calls, recycled paper prices have been quite a headwind during the last 2 quarters. We expect it to remain this way for the next 2 quarters. We have assumed that recycled paper prices increase about $10 per ton each quarter in fiscal 2013 from the $150 a ton level at May 31. Last year's first quarter average price was roughly $275 per ton, and the second quarter average price was roughly $225 per ton. Keep in mind that this pricing difference impacts both revenues -- both revenue and falls directly to operating income. Our energy-related expenses for fiscal 2012 were roughly 3.3% of sales. Our guidance assumes that fiscal 2013 energy-related expenses remain at this level. We recently issued $250 million of 10-year debt with a 3.25% coupon that essentially replaced the $225 million of debt that matured on June 1. Including all fees and the impacts of interest rate locks, this new debt will reduce overall interest expense by about $3.5 million. However, much of this benefit will be offset by a higher effective tax rate. We expect our fiscal 2013 effective rate to be 37.3%, which is higher than the 36.8% in fiscal 2012. As Mike discussed, the fiscal 2012 effective rate benefited from the resolution of audits. And finally, keep in mind that the guidance incorporates the share buybacks from our fourth quarter but does not contemplate any additional buybacks. As I mentioned earlier, this will benefit fiscal 2013 earnings per share by approximately $0.06. Hopefully, this additional color adds perspective to our guidance. With that, we will now be glad to take any of your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from James Samford with Citi.
James Samford - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Just a couple of questions on the guidance. It looks like you're still guiding to margin expansion for next year, if I back into it, of roughly 40 to 50 basis points. Just trying to understand, how much of that is a function of increasing paper prices that you sort of built in there? And what gives you confidence that paper prices can be up $10 per quarter going forward?
J. Michael Hansen: Well the -- James, if you take a look at that, the guidance for our paper prices were actually -- including guidance, that would be a 13% -- almost a 13% reduction in year-over-year paper prices. So that -- our guidance assumes about an average of $175 per ton, and fiscal '12 was about $200. So we will see a negative impact for the full year. That will certainly be front-end loaded. The first 2 quarters, as Bill mentioned, will be negatively affected by paper. And in the back half of the year, we should see a small benefit. And we're basing this assumption on talking with our partners in the industry and other people who are familiar with the paper.
William C. Gale: But with that said, James, our margins are anticipated to expand overall in the company primarily as a result of the improved margins in the Rental, First Aid and Safety and Uniform Direct Sale divisions but just being offset by the Document Management segment.
James Samford - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Yes. And I guess on that Rental piece, are you assuming some sort of return to normalcy or at least some hiring occurring? Or is that still taking into account an increasing mix of new versus the additional new wearers from existing accounts?
William C. Gale: We're actually continuing to expect most of that growth primarily coming from new business. We do not expect to see much growth in our existing customers' headcount.
Operator: Our next question comes from Sara Gubins with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Sara Gubins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Could you talk about what you're seeing in Uniform Direct Sales? The year-over-year growth rate slowed in the fourth quarter and I'm wondering what the tone of your client base is there.
William C. Gale: Sara, the growth rate was lower, as you point out. But that segment, we've always said, will grow over time in the mid-single digits. So if I could remind you, last year, the growth rate was over 8%. This year, it's a little around 3%. Therefore, it's not unusual for that to fluctuate. We have not seen a lot of, I guess, communication from customers indicating any big concern in the environment. But on the other hand, as a result of lack of orders in the quarter, I would say they're being cautious just pending the outcome of what's going to happen in the economy.
Sara Gubins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Okay. And then within the guidance for next year, how are you thinking about SG&A? You've gotten great leverage recently.
William C. Gale: We're seeing SG&A being approximately at the same levels that we saw this year.
Sara Gubins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: On a dollar basis?
William C. Gale: On a percent of sales basis. It did increase in dollars, but percent of sales should be roughly the same levels.
Sara Gubins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Got it. And then if you could just provide us with the ending share count at the end of the year, that would be great.
William C. Gale: Yes, it's on the face of the balance sheet. And if you'd just give me a second, I can...
J. Michael Hansen: 126,000,519 is the outstanding -- that's the outstanding shares at May 31.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Andrew Wittmann with Robert W. Baird.
Andrew J. Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: I just wanted to dig in a little bit more on the Rental segment, just kind of talking about the amount of new business that's out there and the pricing for these new customers, how maybe that's changed here over the last couple of months or quarters, if at all.
J. Michael Hansen: I would say that pricing, while it hasn't changed much in -- from the third quarter to the fourth quarter, remains competitive. And we're seeing our competitors be very aggressive, particularly at national account levels.
Andrew J. Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: Okay. Just digging more in the Rental segment, by some of the end markets that you break out here annually, it looks like there was a pretty material step up in the hygiene segment. It also looks like the core uniform rental portion of the core segment was also up just modestly. Is that the right way to think about it? Is that, first of all, accurate? And then second of all, can you just talk about the traction you're getting in the hygiene segment there and kind of what your outlook is for what appears to be outsized growth there for the year ahead?
J. Michael Hansen: Andrew, the hygiene number includes some of our newer products and services, like our chemical services and tile and carpet. And so we're getting a boost by some of our newer products and services in that hygiene bucket. And we continue to be very pleased with the rollouts of those items and continue to expect very good growth in those. The uniform rental had a very good year. We saw some great performance in our fire-resistant clothing line. We also saw very good performance in other lines like our women's wear, and our Carhartt continues to perform well. So we did see a very good year out of uniform rental.
Andrew J. Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: Okay. I guess maybe one final question on the Document side. There's been some talk in the industry that there's maybe a modest expectation of enhanced M&A activity. Just wanted to get your thoughts on are you seeing that? And do you expect that segment is probably more active than maybe other segments for you in terms of potential M&A?
William C. Gale: I would say it is more active than other segments at this point, but I am not really sure that the expectations of sellers and buyers have yet reached the level to generate a lot of dealmaking.
Andrew J. Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: Okay. And any change in terms of the way you're thinking about that business? Are you still very, very focused on the shredding side? Or are you becoming increasingly open to the storage business maybe?
William C. Gale: I would say we're primarily continuing to focus on the shredding side. The storage side is less attractive to us.
Andrew J. Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: No change, it sounds like.
Operator: Our next question comes from Joe Box with KeyBanc Capital Markets.
Joe Box - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: Can I just follow up on the guidance? Of the mid-single digit growth that you guys are expecting, can you maybe just give us a sense of where you expect this to come from relative to your different businesses?
William C. Gale: Well, our expectation is all the businesses will grow. Even the Document Management business will grow on the service side, albeit at relatively modest rates due to the economy. The Document Management, though, will still have the headwind, as Mike mentioned, on the paper prices. So if you pull out the change in paper price, you'll see growth in the service side of the business. But none of the businesses are expected at this time to grow robustly because of the economic environment that we anticipate will be in place now for the next 9 to 12 months.
Joe Box - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: Okay. And can you just maybe give us a little bit more color on the end markets that drove the add/quit metric into the negative territory for the quarter? And then maybe highlight some areas where you're actually seeing some positive momentum?
William C. Gale: Well, the positive momentum is primarily coming in the energy sector from a lot of the oil and gas exploration that's going on in this country, and we're servicing many big customers there. So there -- that's the positive side. I would say the deterioration in the add/stop ratio was really outside the energy industry, everywhere else. There was really no one area that's causing it. I just think you have seen a real pullback on the part of [Audio Gap] continue to be a focus of ours going forward.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Gary Bisbee with Barclays Capital.
Gary E. Bisbee - Barclays Capital, Research Division: What was the Document Management organic growth excluding the recycled paper? Did that dip negative this quarter because of those other 2 things you mentioned? Or was that positive?
J. Michael Hansen: It was about 1%, Gary. So it did not dip negative. But it certainly continues to be affected by the European economic environment and, in this case, in the fourth quarter, the imaging projects.
Gary E. Bisbee - Barclays Capital, Research Division: How do the imaging comps look over the next couple of quarters? Is that one-off a year ago? Or is that likely to be an area that just economic weakness will hurt demand for a while?
J. Michael Hansen: Well, it's difficult to predict. We're actively pursuing opportunities. We would like to focus on more recurring-type revenue. We've had some success with that with some companies. But we certainly will also take advantage of projects as they come about. Most of our project work had -- a lot of it had come from the banking side. We continue to think that we've established a strong reputation in this area and that we'll continue to look for those projects. We just are having difficulty predicting exactly when they will come, but I know our salespeople are actively pursuing several things right now.
Gary E. Bisbee - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Okay. And then how much of the cautious tone that you're giving around the guidance is impact that you're already actually seeing in the business versus feeling it's prudent to take a cautious tone? I hear you on the add/stops, but that was never a big driver of the revenue growth acceleration, as I understand it, over the last year or so. It was much more new business was getting better as opposed to existing customers adding products and employees. So are there other signs than that? Is it getting tougher to sell new business? Or is a lot of this just cautiousness because you're reading the tea leaves of all the data having weakened?
William C. Gale: Well, I'd say it's a combination of both. But certainly, we're reading the tea leaves and looking at things. But we saw a trend in our fourth quarter that caused us to have some concern on the overall economic environment. And as a result of the -- yes, the add/stop ratio going negative is not as significant, but we also see the caution just in the economy on doing anything. So as a result of that, that's why we felt it prudent to basically give guidance that we think is achievable, and we'll certainly adjust it upward if we prove to be a little too conservative as we move through the year.
Gary E. Bisbee - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Okay. And then just can you -- you had commented a year ago or so that cotton prices would remain a headwind in fiscal '13. Given the pullback there, is that still the right way to think about the gross margin? Or is it likely to be more of a push and maybe even a positive later in the year?
J. Michael Hansen: Yes, Gary, we expect that it will continue to be a slight headwind for the first half of fiscal '13, after which we may start to see a bit of a benefit. But keep in mind, that moves very slowly as we amortize.
Gary E. Bisbee - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Right, okay. And then just last question. Does a weaker economy in your mind mean that M&A would be -- there'd be more opportunities? Or have you historically seen more that people don't want to sell when they feel like things are getting a little more difficult? I ask mostly just because with the -- a quarter ago, I think you said you were optimistic that maybe the environment was filling out a bit, and certainly you're very well capitalized to pursue something.
J. Michael Hansen: Gary, I think there's 2 factors here that I think will be interesting to see how they play out. One is, yes, in a deteriorating environment, some of the people who were interested in selling their businesses are seeing top line reductions and, therefore, they feel like they can't get as much value for their business. So they might tend to hold out until things get better again. At least that's what we saw in the last couple of recessions. So that would say there'd be less M&A. On the other hand, I don't know what people's expectations are with regard to the change in the tax laws and how that will play out. But there certainly would be some benefit of people wanting to sell now before the end of the calendar year based on what seems to be the prevailing opinion of what's going to happen with tax rates.
Operator: Our next question comes from Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan.
Andrew C. Steinerman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: To go over Rental gross margins again in the quarter, it sounded like merchandise amortization, which includes a cotton contribution there, was a larger drag than the energy benefit in that to minus 30. Was there anything else that influenced the Rental gross margin? And then my question is for fiscal year 2013, since you expect the mid-single digit growth to be primarily driven by new business, so what does that mean that Rental gross margin will be down for 2013 with that assumption?
J. Michael Hansen: Well, in the fourth quarter, the energy impact and the material cost movement generally offset each other. It was pretty close. And there were a couple of other things, very minor. But generally speaking, it was material cost that was moving towards the negative. Going into fiscal '13, if we continue to see new business as the driver, then we would expect that material costs may continue to be a bit of a headwind. Our challenge will be, can we offset that with operational improvements and routing improvements like we have over much of the last couple of years?
Andrew C. Steinerman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Right. And so in your guidance assumption, are you expecting Rental gross margin to be down? Or do you expect that you could offset it and it could be closer to flat?
William C. Gale: Well, with the range of guidance, I would tell you that it's probably a little bit of both. I mean, we're -- we got a range there, and if -- depending on what happens with our assumptions that we've made on new business versus growth in existing accounts, the material costs that Mike mentioned, energy, I think you're going to see either a slight reduction in gross margins or a slight improvement in gross margins depending on what happens.
Operator: We'll take our next question from John Healy with Northcoast Research.
John M. Healy - Northcoast Research: Bill, I want to ask you a little bit more about the paper prices. To the degree that those move in the spot market, is there a lag in terms of how they impact your P&L? And is there any sort of hedging or in terms of contract price that you guys get from buyers out there? And have you used contracts in the past? And has the -- if you have, has that changed materially in terms of the price points and then whether it impacts your business?
William C. Gale: Our contracts with the companies that we sell our paper to basically are all pegged. The price we receive is all pegged off the spot price. So generally, we receive what the spot price is plus whatever contract premium that we have negotiated. We've been with contracts with the paper consumers for some time. So that's nothing new for us. We continue to do that. As far as hedging, we've looked -- we're looking at it. We have looked at it. To date, we have not determined that it was beneficial for us to do so, but we'll continue to evaluate it. It is not a very robust hedging market. But as a result of that, you're really taking more of a gamble than really hedging anything based on what we're seeing so far. But we continue to evaluate it, and we've got some potential opportunities to do so with parties outside the U.S. and we're looking at those.
John M. Healy - Northcoast Research: And then I wanted to ask from an M&A perspective. When you guys look at returns on capital or returns on the business, what business unit, whether it's the uniform business or the Document Management business, do you think you get the best returns on in terms of the deals you look at? And where are the most -- what business has a better synergistic value to you in terms of deploying -- maybe looking at some M&A deals?
William C. Gale: I would say, well, our criteria for evaluating an M&A opportunity, we have the same basic expectations regardless of the business unit. So we're not going to take necessarily a lower return on one unit versus another. As far as synergies, it so much depends, John, on the nature of where the customers are coming from, the size of the customers. If we have a deal whereby we have capacity in existing facilities in a region and we buy a local competitor that perhaps serves multiple cities, we can get a lot of synergies because we can deploy that new volume pretty easily in multiple facilities. The more concentrated the volume is that we get, the more likely it'll take a little longer to get those synergies because we'll have to maybe build some capacity or take over their capacity and then bring it up to our standards. So I would tell you, though, we really believe that when we use M&A capital, our shareholders are expecting a certain return. And by and large, we stick to those requirements regardless of the business unit.
Operator: Our next question comes from Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel Nicolaus.
Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: I want to focus a little bit more on the paper and shredding business. Usually, the market dynamics are when you have a collapse in the paper prices, that the actual price that you are able to charge your customers for the shredding, at some point in time, you should be able to go up in the smaller competitors that are giving away the services in order to get the commodity paper start to pull out of the market. Are you starting to see that happen and that was contributing to your expectation in the increase in paper prices during next year?
J. Michael Hansen: We're starting to see a little bit of that. We've had some price increases that we've been able to institute, and they have stuck. I think there's a couple of other dynamics that are going on in the industry, though, that may be unique. We've got a couple of large players that perhaps are not as committed long term to the business based on some recent items that they've been involved with. So I'd say that there's a little disruption due to that. I think also that the time frame -- it takes a little longer for that dynamic to work through, Shlomo, where you'll see prices really balance themselves out. I think we're still a little early in the process. When we gave guidance back in March for our fourth quarter, I think several people thought that we were being overly conservative with what we thought the paper price was going to be. So the expectation in the market was that it was going to increase a little quicker. Well, it didn't turn out to do so, at least through our fourth quarter. We've seen some improvement here in June and July. So perhaps, the paper price will start rising a little bit, and that will perhaps temper people's willingness to raise their service price until they see what really shakes out.
Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: So the sequential $10 a ton that you're expecting through the year, you say you talked to people in the industry, what exactly is it based on? Is it based on the fact that you're already getting some pricing lift? I mean, can you just give us some color on that?
William C. Gale: Well, I think it's an estimate or prediction of demand primarily from overseas. When the demand's going to come, when it's going to pick up, that's what's going to increase the price. And that's what we're hearing from the various brokers, that there is a lot of talk that the demand will be picking up as the year progresses, thus increasing the price.
Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: Okay. Then last quarter, you guys talked a little bit about rep turnover was normalizing. And has that continued? Or has the trend towards more normalized rep turnover kind of slowed down with the economy slowing down?
William C. Gale: No, it's basically been about the same level. It certainly is worse than what we were seeing in '11, but it didn't get any worse nor much better than where we saw in the third quarter. The difference in the fourth quarter is that we were able to replace some of those turned reps that we had in the third quarter and the normal rep turnover that happened in the fourth. So our actual headcount on sales reps was higher at the end of the fiscal year than it was at the end of our third quarter, which positions us better going into this current year for new business growth.
Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: How much time do the new reps that replaced the ones that were leaving -- how long does it take till they -- you believe that they're fully productive? Is it 9 months? Is it 12 months? What is it?
William C. Gale: Yes, 9 to 12 months is generally the time frame it takes for a new rep to get up to average productivity.
Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: Okay. Then on the more competitive pricing on rentals in national accounts, this seems to me to be kind of a change in tone from the last few quarters when in general, you guys were talking about a little more stability in the marketplace from the competitors. Is this a factor of the competitors looking at cotton pricing coming down and saying, oh, we're going to start to get more profitability, we can become more aggressive? I mean, what do you attribute this to?
J. Michael Hansen: Shlomo, neither Mike nor I really recall a difference in our commentary. I apologize if we left that impression. I thought we had been saying that pricing had stabilized except on large national accounts where we continue to see aggressiveness on the part of several big players. I'd say we certainly saw an improvement in the pricing environment from fiscal '10 and '11, but I'd say it's always been very competitive and the national account business is very much sought after by several of the large players.
Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: So just to make sure I understand then, there is no change and it has been competitive and it remains competitive in the large national accounts?
William C. Gale: Yes, it does, yes. It remains ...
Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: And what about the accounts outside of those large national accounts where you guys were noting through last year that there was more stability? Has that remained the same?
William C. Gale: It has remained the same. There has been no improvement but no real deterioration either recently.
Operator: Our next question comes from Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer.
Scott A. Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division: Just following up on the last question with regard to rep turnover. So I guess interesting time in a fiscal year end. Could you update us, just going back to projects won and I don't recall how many years ago that was but just what you've seen over the past, I guess, 2 or 3 years now that you've gone through that transition, what's different, what worked, what didn't out of that?
William C. Gale: Well, I think it's worked very well in that we've got a cohesive sales group now that works together well, is not siloed by business unit, is under one management structure. And so I think that has been a big success. The turnover rate that we talked about was really more due to the economy. We have very attractive, trained sales reps that are of interest to other industries. And therefore, that's what caused that turnover. But I thought -- but I think what we have been able to at least accomplish is stem the turnover in that there is no further increase in it and we've been successful in replacing some of those turned reps, especially in the fourth quarter.
Scott A. Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division: Shifting up a bit. In an earlier question, you mentioned energy industry and exploration as a boost. I think the scope of that question was on add/stop. I assume you're seeing a lot of activity in new there as well. And I'm just curious. And I think you touched on this, but I wanted to be clear. It sounded like that's one of the only end markets that's really producing. I'm just curious, within the guidance, is it a maintained level? Is it an increased level? You had mentioned you weren't sure what the forward persistence would be, but I'm just curious how you think about it within the guidance.
William C. Gale: I think we'll see energy continuing to be one of the positive spots in the U.S. economy and the Canadian economy. I mean, it's up -- going on up there, too, and we're participating in that. I would say that the level is not a significant increase in the headcount. It's just that as you have more exploration and frac-ing going on, more companies are doing it. And therefore, it's not necessarily adding to an existing operation but rather just increase in number of locations where this energy exploration is occurring. So we being the largest provider of FRC garments in the country and in -- I think we will participate as that segment of the economy continues to do well.
Scott A. Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division: And just for clarification, I think it's probably obvious. But curious, maybe it's hitting something of which we're not aware, is that predominantly just uniform rental, Carhartt? Or are you -- is oil and gas exploration helping in other areas of the business as well?
William C. Gale: Well, it's probably helping in our First Aid and Safety business also. Is that what you mean?
Scott A. Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division: Yes, yes. Just -- yes, I mean...
William C. Gale: Yes, I think there's some benefit we'll get from that side, from that industry and that business also.
Scott A. Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division: And one more from me real quick. On cash availability, for any type of transaction, could you update us where -- what is abroad, what is domestic as far as cash balances?
William C. Gale: I think Mike mentioned in the comments that we have about $50 million now outside the U.S. So the remainder of the cash is here in the U.S. We still have access to the debt markets. We have significant capacity available to us should a transaction make sense. We've got a untapped commercial paper line of credit. And so I would say that we would have no problem making a big deal if it makes sense for us.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Nate Brochmann with William Blair & Company.
Nathan Brochmann - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: Wanted to kind of just ask a little bit. Obviously, we can clearly see with the add/stop metric kind of declining here sequentially over the last couple of months in line with the general macro numbers. But just wondering, in terms of your conversations with your customers, whether they're still kind of upbeat potentially on their business opportunities but just are really reluctant to do anything right now and backing on certain environment, or whether it's gotten really a lot more pessimistic than that in just kind of the general conversations you're having.
William C. Gale: Nate, I have to be honest, I don't have many conversations with our customers. You talk to our operating …
Nathan Brochmann - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: Well, with the salespeople.
William C. Gale: Yes, well, I haven't specifically asked that question. I would tell you the tone that I hear is more one of caution, and I think there's just a lot of uncertainty right now. And until that gets resolved, I'm not sure we're going to see much activity.
Nathan Brochmann - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: Okay, that's fair. And then if things did get a little bit worse, and this just as a kind of a pause and caution but there's an underlying current of some broader issues at work, are there more levers that you have left in your firepower on the cost side after doing such a great job during the downturn of really kind of making your overall business a lot more efficient?
William C. Gale: I think every company always has some things that can be done depending on what the circumstances are. I think you -- we have continued to operate at headcount levels that are significantly below where we were at the peak even though our revenues now exceed where we were previous. So we've gained a lot of efficiencies in our operations. But if there were another significant recession and the loss of a lot of revenue, we would have to take another look at how we do things and see if we could even make more efficiencies. So I think it's incumbent upon all management to always be ready to adjust depending on what the environment is.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We'll take our next question from Greg Halter with Great Lakes Review.
Gregory W. Halter - LJR Great Lakes Review: I don't know if I heard an estimate for your capital spending or your plans there for fiscal '13.
J. Michael Hansen: Our CapEx, we expect to be in the range of $190 million to $210 million.
Gregory W. Halter - LJR Great Lakes Review: That sounds like a decent uptick from the $161 million for this -- or fiscal '12. Anything specific in there?
William C. Gale: We had a few -- we actually thought we'd spend a little bit more in fiscal '12, and we've now moved a few things into fiscal '13. So that's our expectation is, is that really, it's just a little delay of some things that we were going to do that now we're going to do in '13.
Gregory W. Halter - LJR Great Lakes Review: All right. And you had commented with the new debt where your interest expense should be about $3.5 million lower, and I presume that's over the full year fiscal '12. And is that net interest expense? Or is that broken out just by the interest expense, not factoring in the -- any interest income?
William C. Gale: Yes, well, there's basically hardly any income. I don't think we -- you've got any good investment safe, we'll look at it. That's the reduction in the interest expense or interest cash outlay in fiscal '13 versus what we had in '12.
Gregory W. Halter - LJR Great Lakes Review: All right. And for the quarter, you had $18.3 million in interest expense. For the prior 3 quarters, it was in the $17 million range, and I'm just wondering why the step-up in the quarter. Were there some kind of fees associated with the...
J. Michael Hansen: Well, in the fourth quarter, the only difference was we had an extra day of accruing. So otherwise, nothing.
Gregory W. Halter - LJR Great Lakes Review: Okay. And the figures you gave on the dust control and hygiene and shop towels and linens and so forth, was that for the quarter or for the full year?
J. Michael Hansen: That was for the quarter.
Gregory W. Halter - LJR Great Lakes Review: Do you have those for the full year?
J. Michael Hansen: No. We have -- in the last couple of years, we've been updating based on fourth quarter levels. And so we've not provided the full year.
Gregory W. Halter - LJR Great Lakes Review: Okay. Similar question but relative to your vertical markets served for fiscal '12. Would you have those available or at least maybe the top couple?
J. Michael Hansen: We have not provided that other than to say we don't have any verticals that account for more than 10% of our business. So we've got a pretty spread -- a pretty diverse customer base.
Gregory W. Halter - LJR Great Lakes Review: And that would be like the car parts or car repair would probably be one of the largest?
William C. Gale: Automotive certainly is one of our larger verticals. Hospitality is a big vertical for us. Health care is becoming a larger vertical for us, and it certainly is an area of focus. Specialty trade contractor-type is a good vertical for us, maintenance-type positions.
Gregory W. Halter - LJR Great Lakes Review: Okay, that's helpful. And when I do a calculation on your net income divided by the diluted share count, I get $0.61 or $0.609 for the quarter and $2.29 for the year. Can you explain the difference there?
J. Michael Hansen: You have to take into account the participating securities. So a couple of years ago, some new accounting guidance came out that requires an adjusted EPS calculation to incorporate the impact of participating securities like restricted shares. If you went to our Q for the third quarter and looked at our EPS footnote, you'd see the calculation that I'm talking about. So we have to essentially allocate some of our net income to those participating securities.
Gregory W. Halter - LJR Great Lakes Review: Okay. And one last one. We've noticed that Uniforms To You has opened up a second retail store in the Chicago area, and just wondering what the prospects are for that particular area, if you want to call it that, to expand in other parts of the country.
William C. Gale: No. No plans to do that, Greg. But that store was basically part of the original company that we purchased. It was under a different name there. They've reopened it now to service the North Side of Chicago, but it's very small. It's just locally driven and it's really just more of a legacy from the old company that was bought. We have no intention at this point of rolling out any retail operations anywhere else in the country or expand in Chicago beyond the 2 we already have.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel Nicolaus.
Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: Just a few stragglers here. Just you talked about oil being a kind of a bright spot out there. Do you have a -- can you give us any sense as to how big the oil industry is for you guys?
William C. Gale: Shlomo, I don't have that at this point. We'll look into it and see if we can provide it as part of our overall review of what we have by industry.
Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: Yes, I'm just trying to get a sense. Does it stand out because it's large? Or does it stand out because it's the only one that's doing well?
William C. Gale: I'd say the latter. Not so much that it's large. It's one of the only bright spots in the economy.
Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: Okay. And then can you remind us, as of the last quarter, how big is Europe as a percentage of revenue? And is it primarily all in the Document Management area?
William C. Gale: It is all Document Management, primarily storage and imaging. And it's about 1% of our overall revenue.
Operator: Our next question comes from James Samford with Citi.
James Samford - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: I'll make this a quick one. If I just take some of your mix in the uniform rental segment, it looks like the Rental Uniforms are sort of high-single digits, 7%. But you've got a pretty dramatic difference here between hygiene and actually shop, the aprons and such being actually down negative for the quarter. I was wondering, what are you doing to turn that around. Or is it -- is there something in that industry in particular that's a drag on the overall growth of the segment?
J. Michael Hansen: Well, I'll say that all of those areas that I mentioned have grown. It's just that some have grown faster than others. And when you take a look at that hygiene bucket, that includes our newer products and services, which have grown very well in the last year. That growth is certainly exceeding the shop towel growth as well as the linen growth. But those areas are still growing, and we expect them to continue to grow.
James Samford - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Okay. I guess just looking at them -- I think shop or linens was 11% of revenues last year. Maybe there's something else that's mixed in there that just makes it look not apples-to-apples. It's the only thing that caught my eye, but I'll go off-line with you on that.
Operator: It appears there are no further questions at this time. I'd like to turn the conference back to our speakers for any additional or closing remarks.
William C. Gale: Just would like to thank you all again for joining us this evening, and we'll look forward to speaking with you in late September when we report first quarter results.
Operator: That concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation.

Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Cintas Quarterly Earnings Results Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Bill Gale, Senior Vice President of Finance and Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead.
William C. Gale: Thank you for joining us this evening, where we will report our third quarter results for fiscal 2012. With me is Mike Hansen, Cintas' Vice President and Treasurer. After some commentary on the results, we will be happy to answer your questions. We are pleased to report that our third quarter revenue grew 7.9% from last year's third quarter to revenue of $1,012,000,000. Net income increased by 28.7% to $76 million, and earnings per share were $0.58, a 41.5% increase over last year. I would like to make a few comments on this quarter's revenue growth. This year's third quarter had one more work day than last year's third quarter, which benefits our overall revenue growth. On a same-workday basis, our revenue growth was 6.3% over last year's third quarter.  Our organic growth, which accounts for both workday adjustments and the impact of acquisitions, was 5.9%. Keep in mind that the recycled paper prices remained at approximately $150 per ton throughout the quarter, and this lower price negatively impacted our consolidated revenue growth over last year's third quarter by 0.6%. Our operating margin continues to reflect our focus on high quality growth. The operating margin of 13.6% was an improvement over both the third quarter of last year and this year's second quarter. We also benefited this quarter from lower-than-expected energy-related costs and medical costs. Energy-related costs for the third quarter were 3.3% of revenue, which is slightly better than the expected level of 3.5% assumed in our guidance. In addition, medical-related expenses were 30 basis points lower than last year due to better than expected experience. As a result of the better-than-expected results in the third quarter, we are updating our guidance for fiscal 2012. We now expect fiscal 2012 revenue to be in the range of $4.09 billion to $4.12 billion, and we expect earnings per diluted share in the range of $2.24 to $2.27. This guidance assumes no deterioration in the current U.S. economy and effective tax rate of 37% for the entire 2012 fiscal year, and recycled paper prices to continue to be approximately $150 per ton. It also assumes that energy-related costs will increase to approximately 3.5% of revenue and medical expenses to increase to normalized levels. The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a Safe Harbor from civil litigation for forward-looking statements. This conference call contains forward-looking statements that reflect the company's current views as to future events and financial performance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those we may discuss. I refer you to the discussion on these points contained in our most recent filings with the SEC. Now I would like to turn the call over to Mike Hansen for more details on the third quarter.
J. Michael Hansen: Thank you, Bill. As Bill mentioned, total revenue increased 7.9% from the third quarter of last year, with total company organic growth being 5.9%.  Total company gross margin for the third quarter was 42.1%, which is up from last year's third quarter gross margin of 41.8% despite a steep drop in recycled paper prices. I will discuss these items in more detail by segment. Before doing so, please let me remind you that there were 65 workdays in our third quarter, which is one more than last year; and there are 66 work days in our fourth quarter, which is the same as last year. As a planning note for fiscal 2013, our workdays will be as follows: 66 in the first quarter, 65 in the second quarter, 64 workdays in the third quarter and 66 in the fourth quarter. The total workdays in fiscal 2013 will be 261, which is one less than fiscal 2012. We have 4 reportable operating segments: Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products; Uniform Direct Sales; First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection Services; and Document Management Services. Uniform Direct Sales, First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection Services and Document Management Services are combined and presented as other services on the face of the income statement. The Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products operating segment consists of the rental and servicing of uniforms, masks, towels and other related items. This segment also includes restroom supplies and other facility products and services. Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products revenue accounted for 71% of company revenue in the third quarter. Third quarter rental revenue was $721 million, which is up 8.4% compared to last year's third quarter and up 6.5% organically over last year. All areas of our rental business grew in the third quarter, and we continue to focus on selling profitable business. Our rentals segment gross margin was 43.1% for the third quarter, an improvement of 30 basis points over last year's third quarter gross margin of 42.8%, primarily due to lower energy-related costs. The impact of cotton continued to be at the expected level. Our Uniform Direct Sales operating segment includes the direct sale of uniforms, branded promotional products and other related products to national and regional customers. Uniforms and other related products are also sold to local customers, including products sold to rental customers through our direct sale catalog. Uniform Direct Sales revenue accounted for 11% of company revenue in the third quarter. Third quarter revenue of $109.1 million represents an increase of 6.4% compared to last year's third quarter. There were no acquisitions in this segment. Uniform Direct Sales gross margin was 30.5% for the third quarter, which is up from last year's third quarter gross margin of 29.5%. The increase is mainly due to better capacity utilization from the higher volume, slightly offset by the expected cotton impact. The gross margin of 30.5% was an improvement over the second quarter gross margin of 29.6%, mainly due to a better mix of higher margin products. Our First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection Services operating segment includes revenue from the sale and servicing of first aid products, safety products and training, and fire protection products. First Aid, Safety and Fire protection revenue accounted for 10% of company revenue in the third quarter. Revenues were $101.4 million, an increase of 11.2% versus last year's third quarter and organic growth was 9.1%. We continue to see good revenue performance out of this segment, as both First Aid and Safety and Fire Protection grew nicely for the quarter. This segment's gross margin was 43.2% in the third quarter compared to 41.5% in last year's third quarter. Energy-related expenses were 10 basis points lower this year compared to last year. However, improved capacity utilization from the higher volumes in both our facilities and on routes was the driver of the gross margin expansion. The third quarter's gross margin of 43.2% was roughly consistent with the second quarter gross margin of 43.1%. Our Document Management Services operating segment includes document destruction, storage and imaging services, and it accounted for 8% of third quarter total company revenue. Document Management revenue increased 2% over last year's third quarter. Revenue decreased organically, though, by 1.3% compared to last year. As we mentioned in the press release, our third quarter Document Management revenue growth was adversely affected by lower recycled paper prices. The recycled paper prices stayed at roughly $150 per ton during the quarter, which is the same level we saw at the end of our second fiscal quarter. This results in a paper price that is roughly 30% lower than last year's third quarter and close to 50% less than the first quarter of this fiscal year. While it is difficult to predict this price for the fourth quarter of our fiscal year, as Bill mentioned, our updated guidance assumes the prices will stay at $150 per ton. The Document Management gross margin is also adversely affected by the drop in recycled paper prices as the change in the prices generally drops to the bottom line. The third quarter gross margin was 47% compared to last year's third quarter gross margin of 49.4%. The negative impact of lower recycled paper prices was somewhat offset by better capacity utilization from higher service volumes. Moving to selling and administrative expenses, we are pleased with our continued leveraging of the consolidated selling and administrative expenses. Third quarter selling and administrative expenses were 28.5% of revenue, a 170 basis point improvement from last year's third quarter of 30.2%. Selling expenses continued to be lower as a percent of total revenue due to higher revenue levels and continued rep productivity improvements. And administrative expenses continued to be lower as a percent of revenue due to lower medical expenses and administrative labor. Third quarter selling and administrative expenses of 28.5% of revenue were also lower than the 29.2% in this year's second quarter. Although payroll taxes increased due to resetting at the beginning of the calendar year, decreases in medical expenses and workers’ comp related expenses and continued cost control initiatives more than offset that increase. Our effective tax rate was 37% for the quarter compared to 38.9% last year. The effective rate can fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter based on tax reserve builds and releases relating to specific discrete items. As noted in our press release, we expect the effective tax rate for the entire 2012 fiscal year to be 37%. Turning now to the balance sheet. Our cash and marketable securities were $353 million at February 29, up $15 million from the $338 million at November 30. Please note that about $170 million of this cash and marketable securities is located outside of the U.S. Accounts receivable decreased by $8 million since November 30. DSOs on accounts receivable were 40, which is the same as at November 30.  New goods inventory at February 29 was $276 million, down $12 million from November 30. This decrease was expected, as the relatively high levels of the past year due to the SAP conversion normalized. Accrued liabilities decreased $95 million compared to November 30, primarily due to the December payments of the annual dividend and accrued bond interest. Long-term debt at February 29 was $1.3 billion, of which $226 million was in current liabilities. We have $225 million maturing on June 1, 2012. We intend to pay this off -- pay off this amount with a combination of cash on hand and short-term borrowings under our commercial paper program. However, if longer-term borrowing rates remain at the attractive low levels they are currently, we may reevaluate and decide to refinance the amount. The average rate on the outstanding debt is 5.1% and total debt-to-EBITDA is roughly 2x. Moving on to cash flow. Cash provided by operating activities in the third quarter was $131.8 million, which is up from last year's third quarter amount of $98.7 million. In addition to higher net income, the decrease in inventory during this year's third quarter added to the improvement over last year. CapEx for the third quarter was $37.9 million. Our CapEx by operating segment was as follows: $26.8 million in rental; $1.9 million in Uniform Direct Sales; $3.4 million in First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection; and $5.8 million in Document Management. We expect CapEx for the fiscal 2012 to be in the range of $160 million to $170 million.  That concludes our prepared remarks, and we will now take any of your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And right now we'll go to the James Samford with Citigroup.
James Samford - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Just wanted to touch on your guidance, and if I just sort of back in to what Q4 is implying, it seems like you're implying some modesty sell [ph], and perhaps even sort of flat margins year-over-year. Is that your intention or is that really conservatism that I should read into that?
William C. Gale: Well, that was certainly thought through when we provided that guidance, so let me give you a little more color on that. We are a -- we tend to be a bit conservative, but I also think a few things deserve mention that Mike brought up in his comments. We did see our medical expenses be lower in the third quarter than what is typical, so we expect those to rise to more normalized levels and thus impact SG&A. We do expect energy costs to be back up about 20 to 30 basis points from what we saw in the third quarter. We still have some concerns about the economy in terms of job growth and just overall confidence. The paper price has a big impact on us, and we continue to expect that to be low. And keep in mind, last year's fourth quarter, we were seeing rising paper prices from the third quarter of last year. And therefore, if the paper prices do not increase, which we don't really expect them to do at this point, the impact of the lower paper prices this year is going to have a bigger impact than what Mike talked about for the third quarter. And then, finally, I think another thing to -- that's worth some mention here is that we have seen a pickup of our turnover in our sales force to more normalized levels over the last few months. And as we replace these more productive salespeople with newer salespeople, we tend to think that the impact on new business might be impacted a bit. So that's why the guidance was as we provided it.
James Samford - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: That's fair enough. One quick follow-up on the rental gross margin. I think that came in just slightly below where we thought. Just wondering how much of fuel costs versus I guess the natural gas benefit that you probably got, how much of that was a factor in the quarter?
J. Michael Hansen: The energy-related costs in total were down from last year by about 30 basis points. But some of the leveraging that we have seen was offset by some rising -- rise in material cost. Our cotton impact has accelerated as we expected it to from the first and second quarter. And so we're seeing a little bit of that as well.
Operator: Moving forward, we will go to Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer.
Scott A. Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division: I just wanted to pick up on something just mentioned. With this increased turnover of salespeople, where are they going? Is it a product of an improving economy and they're seeing opportunities elsewhere? What's the dynamic there, guys?
William C. Gale: We have -- first off, I don't want to make a big deal about this, Scott. I just wanted to mention that it is going to have a slight impact on the growth rate. But as the economy improves, our salespeople are in great demand for other industries. And they also -- there's a burnout in some of our salespeople because it's all new business. They're hunters, basically. So I don't think it's anything that we're alarmed about. It's just a fact that it's a reflection of what's the strength of our sales force, and that the economy is picking up a bit.
Scott A. Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division: And that segues well into the -- you guys are seeing nice revenue growth. You're obviously getting leverage from that. You talked about energy and medical and getting benefits there. But it appears that you’re operating quite effectively. Could you talk about some of the initiatives you have occurring and where you think you're seeing success among expense management?
William C. Gale: Well, I think we're seeing success in many areas. Let me give a commentary in a few. In our plants, our rental plants, we've implemented quite a bit of automation, and we have been able to incentivize our workforces in the plants that have enabled us to improve productivity. We're seeing in our routes -- the impact of the portable route computer certainly have helped the productivity of our service sales reps. And the fact that a significant number of our rental routes and some of our other services routes have gone to 4-day workweeks instead of 5, and that's improved our fuel efficiency, as well as the productivity of our workforce. The G&A area has certainly been benefited by our CEO's initiative of looking -- making sure that everything we do is of value to our customers, and that they recognize it, and they're willing to pay for it. So we've been able to streamline a number of our processes. Plus we're getting some of the benefits of the SAP conversions as we roll those out to some of our functional areas like all of our finance activities in our global supply chain. Continuing at Cintas to always do improvement of what we have and the fact that we're seeing some top line growth is enabling us to get some leverage in all the different areas.
Scott A. Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division: Great. One more before I turn over. The pricing environment, this is broad for all the segments, but particularly for rental. Are you able to take advantage of the approving environment right now? And could you speak to how much of the organic growth you're seeing is price related?
William C. Gale: Well, we're -- we actually -- we saw some pickup on pricing earlier this fiscal year. And as Mike and I were analyzing the results for this during this quarter, I would say that pricing hasn't deteriorated, but it hasn't improved at the same rate that we were seeing earlier in the fiscal year. So we didn't really get a whole lot of benefit in this quarter on pricing but -- nor did we really get any deterioration.
Operator: Moving forward, we'll hear from Nate Brochmann with William Blair & Company.
Nathan Brochmann - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: I know you don't disclose it precisely, but I'm just wondering if anecdotally you could talk a little bit about the add/stop metric kind of trend during the quarter, and how that's kind of trending overall throughout the year.
William C. Gale: We have not seen a significant improvement in add/stops. As we mentioned a year ago, we finally saw a stabilization in that. As we look at the numbers week to week, you'll get a few weeks where you'll see some positive impact. And then that same trend won't necessarily continue into the next week. It doesn't go negative, but it's just not as robust. So I'm not willing yet to say that we're really seeing any real impact of adds. It's just -- it's kind of a just a very, very modest improvement over what we saw earlier this year.
Nathan Brochmann - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: That's helpful. I mean, it sounds like pretty much the same that's been going on. In order to, like, continue to support the new services and the new business wins that you've been getting, how do you feel about your current net level of hiring? Is it still to the point where you can continue to get several productivity improvements still there, or is it to the point where you're starting to have to hire again net-net to support the service levels?
William C. Gale: Well, certainly on the routes, to the extent you add new stops in any of our businesses, you have to quickly add capacity, because we have rightsized the routes during the downturn, and we continue to be focused on keeping our service sales reps pretty full and productive. So there's not a lot of additional capacity for new stops. There's capacity for additional business on existing stops, especially in the rental division when you have additional wearers at a stop, the effort to take the uniforms in for the new wearer are really not that significant over what you were doing anyway. So we -- you get some nice revenue growth there. But generally speaking, the impact of new business does require us to continue to expand the routes. On the production side, I think we've been saying this for some time, and we continue to feel pretty confident that we have adequate production capacity in most areas of the country. Therefore, we will not need to invest in a lot more plant capacity as our revenues continue to increase. And then on the other businesses, the Document Management business is primarily route-based. We have a little bit of storage business. And of course, the storage revenue continues to increase. You got to make sure you have capacity and racking to put those boxes in storage. But since most of our -- the bulk of our business is shredding, that's a route-based business, and again it depends on is it additional stops or is it just additional volume within the stop that determines what kind of capacity you need to have.
Operator: Next question, we'll hear from Andrew Steinerman from JPMorgan.
Andrew C. Steinerman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: I wanted to talk about the selling administrative line, where it's been coming down remarkably as a percentage of revenue all year long. And I definitely heard your comment, Bill, about the sales force. So my question is, is near term, are we going reverse? Are we going to go much higher than we are now, 28.5%? Are we going to head back towards 30%? What is kind of the near-term kind of level of efficiencies for the S&A line?
William C. Gale: Andrew, near term, you're not going to see a significant change from where we're at today. Our only -- I don't see any impact really on the selling expense. It's more some of those items Mike mentioned like on the medical costs. They may rise modestly from what we saw in the third quarter. Sometimes you have a little bit of bad debt expense that will fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter. But you're not going to see a materially -- material change in that line. I think the overall longer-term trend will continue to be pointing downward, although as not quite as rapid a pace as what we've seen over the last year or so.
Andrew C. Steinerman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Great. And that's true for the fourth quarter as well, S&A as a percentage of revenues will be down but not to the extent that it had.
William C. Gale: Well, no, no. I said medical expenses could impact that modestly. It could be...
Andrew C. Steinerman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: That’s 30 bps, right. But now I'm talking year-over-year, so if...
William C. Gale: Yes, it will be down year-over-year, yes.
Operator: Next question is from Gary Bisbee with Barclays Capital.
Gary E. Bisbee - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Let me just follow on that with one quick one on the SG&A. If the -- can you give us any sense of the magnitude of those likely sales hires. I'm not even so concerned with, like, the fourth quarter, but if we think over next year, the SG&A expense has decelerated. You've lapped the easier comp, and it still stayed incredibly low growth in the number. I understand the medical comment and all the other comments you made. But are we talking mid-single-digit growth in the headcount? Or what types of numbers are we going to need here?
William C. Gale: No, Gary, I think you misunderstood. It's primarily the result of replacing headcount that we had. It's not a significant increase in headcount that we're anticipating right now. It's more or less just continuing -- we'll be getting back to a level that we may have seen in the second quarter or so. That's all I'm trying to imply.
Gary E. Bisbee - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Okay. Well then, so let me take another cut at that. I mean you've obviously had good revenue growth, and you're starting to comp the real time on revenue growth accelerated, but you continue to have good growth. Don't you need to layer in more salespeople to keep that going? Or is there much more productivity that can come out of the system other than, I understand, the short term comment about replacing people that left?
William C. Gale: It would be a modest increase that would be not that significant.
Gary E. Bisbee - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Okay, all right. Let me move on then. The uniform rental pretax margins were excellent, I don’t -- I think a level we haven't seen in a couple of years. And how should we think about the trending here over the next couple of years? Is there a chance to get back to the prior highs of many years ago in this business? Or is the -- has anything changed that would make that not possible if we had several more years of revenue growth?
J. Michael Hansen: Well, from a gross margin standpoint, Gary, the good news is we're still -- we still have fewer wearers today than we have pre-recession, which means we have more processing capacity than we did before. We also...
William C. Gale: Gary, just a clarification. Were you talking about direct sales or the rental business?
Gary E. Bisbee - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Oh, no, the rental business. I guess, when you look at it, it's been 2.5 years since you had -- and I guess I was looking at the pretax margin, but since you had a level this high. I guess I'm trying to understand how much more -- on both margins, how much more of this can go over time. I mean is the business potentially get back to where the margins were 5, 8 years ago when they were a lot higher or...
J. Michael Hansen: Gary, to kind of finish the thought I had before, we've got a lot of production capacity. And a lot of the revenue that we're adding like hygiene services, chemical business, tile and carpet cleaning does not require any laundry facility capacity. And so we still think that we can get leverage going forward from a gross margin standpoint. Now there may be ups and downs because of material costs ups and downs, maybe due to cotton, but we still think there is some leverage opportunity in our gross margin and in our production facilities. And if you think about the fact that we still haven't seen a significant amount of customer hiring, if our customers start to hire and we get a lot of adds at existing stops, we're going to see even better margin impact there. So keep in mind a lot of that higher -- some of the highest margin revenue left us during the recession and has yet to come back. So we still have some gross margin opportunity. In the SG&A, if you think about some of the cost that maybe we didn't have in the earlier part of the 2000s, which were stock option expensing, medical wasn't as high, there may be some reasons for not getting all the way back to the SG&A levels that we saw, but still some leverage over the next couple of years.
Gary E. Bisbee - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Okay. And then just one more on a point you just made. I guess, why do you think you haven't seen job growth among your customers? I realize that part of the customer base maybe has a bit more industrial manufacturing slant, but we've even seen some growth in recent months in that. We're seeing small businesses, which I know you skewed toward growth faster than the total job market. I guess I'm struggling to understand why you haven't seen that yet. Do you have any insight into it or any thoughts as to when that may happen our why it's not happening?
William C. Gale: I think we're going to have to see more robust job growth, 200,000 or whatever jobs a month. I don't think it really is going to show up too much on our numbers yet. When we get up to 400,000, 500,000 job growth in -- especially in our sectors, I think you're going to begin to see a little bit more of that. It just -- it really hasn't been that significant yet.
Gary E. Bisbee - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Okay. And actually, I thought of one more I'd love to sneak in. The European Document Management, I think you said that lost money a quarter ago. Is that still operating at that weak level?
J. Michael Hansen: We haven't seen any further deterioration in the European business. It's still a very difficult operating environment. And we expect improvements going forward, but it wasn't quite as bad as the second quarter, but still not where we want it to be.
Operator: Next question in queue will be from Shlomo Rosenbaum from Stifel, Nicolaus.
Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: I actually want to continue beating the SG&A horse. Just in terms of understanding sequentially why the SG&A is going down, if I take the 50 basis points between medical and energy, that's about $5 million sequentially. And then can you just give us a little bit of an insight what the other, maybe $4 million of decline sequentially was in the SG&A?
William C. Gale: Shlomo, there are numerous items in there. I really don't have the detail in that, I mean, but there are so many different things that go through there: insurance costs, workmen's compensation cost, bad debt expense, legal expenses, professional fees, et cetera, et cetera. So we try to highlight for you some of the big ones, but we really -- we don't have the detail to provide publicly on the rest of it.
Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: Let's take from 2 quarters ago then and -- where the revenue was down $5 million from 2 quarters ago and the SG&A is down $22 million. Can you talk about some of the difference from, say, just 2 quarters ago and highlights on that?
J. Michael Hansen: Shlomo, some of the -- it gets a little bit problematic to compare different quarters. So for example, in our first quarter, we have some expenses that don't normally occur throughout the year like some management meetings, some sales meetings. And so there are some things that cause maybe first quarter SG&A be a little bit higher than third quarter. But generally speaking, we are -- we continuously look at all of our processes, particularly in our G&A area. And we continue to ask, is it value-added? In other words, is it something that the customer wants? And if not, then we look for new ways of doing things where we eliminate things. And that can go towards processes, all different kinds of expenses that we have in SG&A. So we're always looking just for every line item.
Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: Can you just give an example for something like that then? Just talk about one example where as a process the customer wasn't paying you for that you decided to eliminate just...
William C. Gale: Well, a good example is just you have staff people creating reports for -- that are needed for some reason a couple years ago, and all of a sudden you find out 50% of somebody's time is producing these reports and the need for those reports are no longer there. So that could be one. Or the reports get replaced by some sort of automation. That would be an example of things that you basically get rid of.
Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: Is there something directly related to the SAP implementation that's allowing you to take some of those costs out?
William C. Gale: Sure, we're basically -- one of the benefits we're getting from SAP in the financial arena is we now have the ability for our accounting organization to handle more locations than they previously were able to handle and produce information that previously they had to go to our IT organization to get, and they can do it themselves. So there are savings that happens as a result of just improved systems.
Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: Okay, no, I appreciate the color on that. And then just -- I know you're just highlighting some of the change in the sales force, but you're not alarmed by it. I'm just wondering you're starting to see some change over there, but usually that's indicative of a change in the economy. Yet, you're not seeing any changes with regard to your customer base in terms of employment within your customer base. Is that what you're saying?
William C. Gale: That's what we're saying.
Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: And the salespeople that are leaving, is there any -- do they hit ceilings? Or is there anything else that's indicative of why they would want to leave what's considered a very good organization out in the...
William C. Gale: I think some people just tend to -- the job design itself, they get tired of doing it the way they were doing it, and they have an opportunity at another company. With our -- the society that we have today, we see more and more people -- 2 couples both with careers, and sometimes there's an impact of people leaving because they -- their significant other has another opportunity somewhere else. So it's just a myriad of things. I think the fact that the economy for professional-level people seems to have picked up a little quicker than for the more of the blue-collar workforces is enabling some of this mobility, too.
Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: And are they moving -- in your sense, are they going to competitors or just doing something different?
William C. Gale: No, they're not going to competitors, Shlomo. They're basically maybe going to other industries or leaving the sales profession. I think, again, I'm going to make the point, you guys are making a bigger deal out of this than I think is necessary. All we're getting -- all we're seeing is approaching our more historical turnover levels that we saw back before the recession.
J. Michael Hansen: Okay. Well, that fair color on that then.
J. Michael Hansen: Shlomo, just one last point on the SG&A. One thing to keep in mind, if you compare first quarter to third quarter, for example, is we do have one less workday. And that means one less day of labor and other related expenses. So just keep that in mind as you kind of analyze quarter-to-quarter.
Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: And, Mike, how much of your SG&A pushes the clock versus being salaried?
J. Michael Hansen: Well, that's something we haven't disclosed publicly.
Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: I would expect that they would primarily be salaried labor.
William C. Gale: A lot of clerical people in SG&A, also.
J. Michael Hansen: But it doesn't -- from the standpoint of a workday, it doesn't matter, Shlomo. If you've got fewer workdays, you're paying less.
Operator: Next question in queue will be from Joe Box of KeyBanc Capital Markets.
Joe Box - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: I just wanted to ask you a quick follow-up question on Document Management. Can you just give us a sense of what the organic growth rates and maybe the margins were in Europe versus the U.S.? And can you maybe just talk about what you're doing in Europe to rightsize the cost structure over there?
William C. Gale: Joe, we do not separately break out the growth rates in Europe versus U.S. We just keep it in Document Management in total. Our strategy in Europe, as we mentioned at the last call, was basically to assimilate these acquisitions we've made, to implement some of the techniques that we've been successful with in the U.S. in those businesses over there and focus on improving the profitability of the business. And at this point, we are still encouraged by the potential that exists there. We did not see a deterioration from the second to the third quarter, nor have we seen a significant improvement yet.
Joe Box - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: Okay, and maybe just changing gears. Question on the inventory front, you guys got a bit of a benefit this quarter. Was that a onetime correction that was primarily related to the SAP implementation? Or could we potentially see inventory being a source of cash over the next couple of quarters?
William C. Gale: We hope to see it continue to be a source of cash for the next couple of quarters because we did see a significant increase in the inventory about over a year ago when we implemented SAP. So at this time, we would expect there to be a reduction in the overall inventory levels, barring some significant new customer rollout program. But at this point, I don't anticipate increased inventories.
Joe Box - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: Okay, and just one last question for you. How should we think about the timing of lower cotton costs rolling through your Direct Uniform business? And obviously, you talked about a headwind this quarter, but should we start to see that benefit roll through over the next couple of quarters?
J. Michael Hansen: I -- we wouldn't expect a benefit. You mean a benefit from the fact that cotton is a bit lower than it was a year ago?
Joe Box - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: Correct.
J. Michael Hansen: You know, Joe, we buy fabric all the time. And that's kind of entering our supply chain at varying levels, and I wouldn't say that we bought all of our fabric last year at the highest prices. We're kind of getting average prices, and they're rolling through at varying levels depending on the turns of the various inventory. But generally speaking, I would not expect to get a benefit in the next couple quarters from that in our Direct Sale business. And in our uniform rental business, we're going to continue to see kind of an accelerating number through probably midyear fiscal '13.
Operator: Next question we will hear from will be from Greg Halter, Great Lakes Review.
Gregory W. Halter - LJR Great Lakes Review: Just wondered where you stand in terms of the SAP implementation. Is it fully done, or are there still more components to roll out?
William C. Gale: We have several years left assuming that the system appears to be the correct alternative as we roll it into our business units. But it's a 3, 4 or more year project that we would have.
Gregory W. Halter - LJR Great Lakes Review: Okay. And I know about 5 to 8 years ago, there were some talk and discussion and experimentation with RFID and so forth and so on in terms of the facilities. With the prices and the cost of those chips and so forth coming down, has any more progress been made in that area?
William C. Gale: I'd say there's been some progress made. The issue we've always had is the chip, a multi-read chip that can withstand the industrial laundry process. And we have experimented with a number of different manufacturers. We made some progress, and then all of a sudden, they don't have the life we expected. So while it is continuing -- continued to be tested in a couple of our operations, we're a long way away from saying we have success and be able to roll it out across the company.
Gregory W. Halter - LJR Great Lakes Review: Okay. Regarding uses of cash, obviously, the stock has had a nice move upward here, which I would presume would not put you in a buying area, and you can only do so much with the dividend, and obviously, on a debt as well with the rates where they are. Just wondered what your uses or priorities for cash are given the strong cash generation?
William C. Gale: Well, there's really been no change from our philosophy before. This is a board level directive on how we utilize that cash. We just completed the third quarter where we paid our dividend, 10% increase from the prior year. We have a $225 million debt tranche coming due on June 1. The acquisition pipeline appears to be showing some life again, so there might be opportunities down the road there. And we just bought $500 million worth of stock less than 9 months ago. So the authorization, we've always completed our authorizations over time, and I would say that the board will direct us on what they think is in the best long-term interest of our shareholder.
Gregory W. Halter - LJR Great Lakes Review: Okay. And one last one for you, I think on the last call, you talked about the fire garments and Carhartt. I just wondered if you had any comments on how those 2 areas in particular are doing?
William C. Gale: They're doing well. The FRC, the flame-resistant garments continue to be successful as government mandates that different industries must put their employees in such garments, and we continue to be the leader in selling those type of customers. The Carhartt business -- or Carhartt relationship continues to be a very successful one. It is enabling us to provide uniform rental programs to companies that, in the past, may not have considered one because they didn't like their offerings, but they do like Carhartt. So while it is not a very, very significant part of our rental business, it is an important part, and we continue to feel very good about it.
Operator: Moving forward, we will hear from Sara Gubins from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
David Ridley-Lane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: This is David Ridley-Lane in for Sarah. As paper prices fall, I'd imagine that competition will increase among document management firms and shredding companies. How will the dynamic change if the paper prices linger at these levels?
J. Michael Hansen: Well, David, when paper prices are relatively high, so at this past summer's levels, the pricing for the service gets very competitive because some providers look at it as a paper collection. And so the service pricing gets very competitive. As we see the prices come down and stay at this $150 level, it will bring some discipline back into that service pricing, which we believe is a better long-term range for our business. So we would expect that some discipline will get back into the service pricing, and we can focus more on providing the security to this business that it really needs.
David Ridley-Lane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Okay. And on a totally different topic, if you did decide to refinance the $225 million in debt, I heard you on the uses of cash, but would you just sort of let the cash sort of sit on the balance sheet, or would there be a go-to use of cash if you did decide to refi that?
William C. Gale: Well, that presents an interesting dilemma, because you've got such what appears to be very cheap, let's say, very inexpensive debt available to you, and yet we also have a very strong cash flow business. So it becomes a point, well, how long are you willing to sit -- have that cash sitting on the balance sheet, waiting for implementation. So we'll have to consider all of that as we get closer to the summer and decide whether or not it makes sense, and determine whether or not we should refinance and get that cash or just go ahead and use some of the cash we have available and keep our debt capacity available for the future.
Operator: Next question will be from John Healy from Northcoast Research.
John M. Healy - Northcoast Research: Bill, I had a capital allocation question for you with some of the uncertainty regarding dividends going forward. I know the company has a very proud history of sustaining and increasing its dividend annually. How does the board or how do you feel about that scenario if legislation changes how dividends are taxed and would that be something that would make you guys think about capital allocation a little bit differently?
William C. Gale: I think the board will certainly consider those potential changes as it decides on the dividend. It also is very interested in listening to some of our long-term big shareholders and what their interests would be. But there are so many variables. Who knows what's going to happen, John? And we really don't have to face that since we don't pay a dividend until the end of the year anyway, and maybe there will be more clarity by that time. But I'm sure, it will be considered.
John M. Healy - Northcoast Research: Okay, great. And then I want to ask you a question, you made the comment regarding the acquisition environment maybe being a little bit more active. What part of the business is that on? And what level of leverage do you think would be the highest if you're taking the company up to if a more sizable acquisition presented itself?
William C. Gale: The acquisition -- I think they'll be -- the acquisition activity is picking up primarily in the Document Management business and a little bit in the rental business. I think there'll be some opportunities perhaps in our fire business also, down the road. The -- as far as -- what was the last...
John M. Healy - Northcoast Research: Regarding leverage, please, where you feel comfortable.
William C. Gale: It all depends. Because it depends on the type of acquisition you're getting, what kind of cash flow it's bringing to you, EBITDA. We absolutely could become more leveraged, but we also have to balance that with the ratings that we want to maintain with the rating agencies that give us access to a lot of capital. So I would tell you that it would all depend on what the use of the leverage would be as to how comfortable we are on getting to a certain level. If it's buying a company that's going to generate a lot of cash and that leverage will quickly come back down, we would take a much different view than if it's just a permanent leveraging up of the balance sheet.
Operator: The next question will be from Justin Hauke with Robert W. Baird.
Justin P. Hauke - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: One last question on the margins. I know we've kind of beaten the dead horse here, but just as we think about '13, I just wanted to clarify some of your comments. It sounds like possibly the additional margin leverage you're expecting to see over the next couple of years will be more gross margin as opposed to SG&A, a little bit of SG&A but more weighted to gross margin. Is that what you were trying to imply?
J. Michael Hansen: Yes. Without giving any particular timing and specific numbers, because we haven't really provided those, we think there is a fair amount of leveraging opportunity in our operations in all of our businesses. And so we do think that that’s still is an opportunity going forward. It may bounce up and down from quarter-to-quarter, but we think there's some good opportunity there. From an SG&A, you've seen that number come down pretty dramatically over the last 6 or so quarters. And that rate of improvement will likely not continue.
Justin P. Hauke - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: Okay, and then I guess just on that level, you mentioned structurally some of the things that are different in the SG&A line. So if I look back 6 or 7 years ago, the SG&A margins in '11 were 500 basis points higher than they were in 2004. How much of that is structural from the base of higher medical expenses?
William C. Gale: Somewhere between 100 and 300 basis points probably.
Justin P. Hauke - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: 100 and 300?
William C. Gale: Yes.
Operator: And at this time, we have no further questions in the queue. I'll turn things back over to our host for any additional or closing remarks.
William C. Gale: Thank you all for joining us this evening. And I just want to remind you, we will plan on releasing our fourth quarter earnings sometime in mid- to late July.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's conference call. Thank you all for your participation.

Operator: Good day, everyone and welcome to the Cintas Quarterly Earnings Results Conference call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Bill Gale, Senior Vice President of Finance and Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead, sir.
William C. Gale: Good evening, and thank you for joining us to report our Second Quarter Results for Fiscal 2012. With me is Mike Hansen, Cintas' Vice President and Treasurer. After some commentary on the results, we will be happy to answer questions. We are pleased to report that our second quarter revenue grew 8.8% from last year's second quarter to a record revenue of $1,019,000,000. Net income increased by 33.1% to $74.4 million, and earnings per share were $0.57, a 50% increase over last year. Our operating margin continued to expand as our second quarter operating margin of 13% was an improvement over both last year's second quarter operating margin of 10.9% and this year's first quarter operating margin of 12.6%. This improvement came despite significantly lower recycled paper prices. This margin expansion continues to be driven by better capacity utilization, our focus on selling profitable business and controlling our cost, particularly in our general and administrative area. At our last earnings call in mid-September, we spoke of our cautiousness toward the U.S. economy. Only about 100,000 jobs have been created during our first fiscal quarter, and 2011 and 2012 economic forecast were worsening while the stock market was declining. Despite our strong first quarter results, we were uncertain about how our business would be affected by the macro environment. Obviously, given this backdrop heading into our second quarter, we have been very pleased to see that our business continued to be strong throughout this quarter.  While we continue to be cautious regarding the U.S. economy, we do have more confidence about our ability to execute in this less than robust environment. As a result, we are updating our guidance for fiscal 2012. We now expect fiscal 2012 revenues to be in the range of $4.075 billion to $4.125 billion, and we expect earnings per diluted share in the range of $2.16 to $2.20. This guidance assumes no significant changes in the U.S. economy and effective tax rate of 37% for the entire 2012 fiscal year, assumes recycled paper prices to be approximately $150 per ton, which is our price for November and December, and energy-related cost to be approximately 3.5% of revenue. The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a Safe Harbor from civil litigation for forward-looking statements. This conference call contains forward-looking statements that reflect the company's current views as to future events and financial performance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those we may discuss. I refer you to the discussion on these points contained in our most recent filings with the SEC. Now I would like to turn the call over to Mike for more details on our second quarter.
J. Michael Hansen: Thank you, Bill. As Bill mentioned, total revenue increased 8.8% from the second quarter of last year while total company organic growth was 7%. Total company gross margin for the second quarter was 42.2%, which is up from last year's second quarter gross margin of 41.7% despite a 20 basis-point increase in energy-related costs and a steep drop in recycled paper prices. I will discuss these items in more detail by segment. Before doing so, let me remind you that there were 65 workdays in our second quarter, which is the same as last year. As a planning note for the remainder of fiscal 2012, we will have 65 workdays in the third quarter and 66 in the fourth quarter. The total workdays in fiscal 2012 are 262. We have 4 reportable operating segments: Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products, Uniform Direct Sales, First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection Services and Document Management Services. Uniform Direct Sales, First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection Services and Document Management Services are combined and presented as Other Services on the face of the income statement.  The Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products operating segment consists of the rental and servicing of uniforms, masks, towels [ph] and other related items. This segment also includes restroom supplies and other facility products and services. Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products revenue accounted for 71% of company revenue in the second quarter. Momentum continued for our rental business. Second quarter rental revenue was $722.8 million, which is up 9.9% compared to last year's second quarter, and up 7.9% organically over last year. The organic growth rate of 7.9% for the second quarter is an improvement from last quarter's organic growth rate of 7.3% and a very good improvement over last year's second quarter organic growth rate of 1.9%. All areas of our Rental business grew in the second quarter. The less-aggressive pricing environment that we saw in the first quarter continued into the second quarter. Our rental segment gross margin was 43.2% for the second quarter, an improvement of 60 basis points over last year's second quarter gross margin of 42.6%. Energy-related costs, as a percent of revenue, were consistent with last year's second quarter. Capacity utilization from higher volumes was the main driver of the improvement. The second quarter gross margin of 43.2% was slightly lower than the first quarter gross margin of 43.9%, but keep in mind that our second quarter had 1 one less work day than the first quarter. As a result, we have 1 less revenue day to cover costs that are expensed on a monthly schedule such as material cost, depreciation and amortization. One last comment on the rental gross margin, the impact of cotton on material costs equaled our expectation. Our Uniform Direct Sales operating segment includes the direct sale of uniforms, branded promotional products and other related products to national and regional customers. Uniforms and other related products are also sold to local customers, including products sold to rental customers through our direct sale catalog. Uniform Direct Sales revenue accounted for 11% of company revenue in the second quarter. Second quarter revenue of $111.9 million represent an increase of 2.9% compared to last year's second quarter. Organic growth was also 2.9%. The revenue from this segment tends to be a bit choppy based on the timing of new product rollouts, refresh programs and customer openings. Uniform Direct Sales gross margin was 29.6% for the quarter, which is down from last year's second quarter gross margin of 29.9%. The decrease is mainly due to the expected cotton impacts. The gross margin of 29.6% was an improvement over the first quarter gross margin of 28.6%, mainly due to higher volumes in the second quarter. Our First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection Services operating segment includes revenue from the sale and servicing of First Aid products, Safety Products and Training and Fire Protection products. First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection revenue accounted for 10% of company revenue in the second quarter. Momentum continued in this operating segment as we had another good quarter. Revenues were $101.7 million, an increase of 9% versus last year's second quarter. And organic growth was 7.8%. This segment's gross margin was 43.1% in the second quarter, compared to 41.1% in last year's second quarter. Energy-related expenses were 20 basis points higher this year compared to last year. Improved capacity utilization from the higher volumes in both our facilities and on routes continue to drive the gross margin expansion. The second quarter's gross margin of 43.1% was roughly consistent with the first quarter gross margin of 43.2%. Our Document Management Services operating segment includes document destruction, storage and imaging services, and it accounted for 8% of second quarter total company revenue. Document Management revenue increased 7.9% over last year's second quarter with organic growth of 4.6%. As we mentioned in the press release, our second quarter Document Management business was adversely affected by 2 things: First, there was a steep decrease in recycled paper prices after experiencing a fairly long stretch of prices in excess of $200 per ton, the prices quickly dropped to $150 per ton during the quarter. Although the average paper price for the quarter was relatively consistent with last year's second quarter, it was 15% below the first quarter average. As a result, growth of Document Management revenue and operating income slowed when comparing sequentially. While it is difficult to predict this price for the second half of our fiscal year, our updated guidance assumes that prices will stay at $150 per ton. The second item that adversely affected our Document Management results was the difficult economic environment in Europe. We experienced weakness in all locations of our European business. As a result, we turned the focus of our European business to rightsizing the organizations and improving operating margins. This resulted in added cost to this quarter, which should provide benefit moving forward. Our European businesses revenue run rate continues to be about $40 million annually, and in this quarter, we operated at a loss. To give more perspective on the North American Document Management business, its organic growth for the second quarter was 7%. Its operating margin was 9.9%, which was a 70 basis-point improvement over last year's second quarter. The North American operating margin is lower than the first quarter operating margin, due to the drop in the recycled paper prices. Moving to selling and administrative expenses. We are very pleased to see second quarter consolidated selling and administrative expenses decrease to 29.2% of revenue. This is a decrease of 160 basis points from last year's second quarter of 30.8%. Selling expenses continued to be lower as a percent of total revenue due to higher revenue levels and continued rep productivity improvements. Administrative expenses as a percent of total revenue also decreased, due to ongoing cost control initiatives. Our efforts of controlling costs have allowed us to increase revenue by 8.8% while only increasing SG&A by 3.1%. Our effective tax rate was 35.5% for the quarter compared to 38.3% last year. This year's second quarter rate was positively impacted by the resolution of several tax audits. The effective rate can fluctuate from quarter to quarter based on tax reserve builds and releases relating to specific discrete items. As noted in our press release, we expect the effective tax rate for the entire 2012 fiscal year to be 37%. Turning now to the balance sheet. Our cash and marketable securities were $338 million at November 30, up $61 million from the $277 million at August 31. While our Board of Directors approved a new $500 million share buyback authorization in October, we did not make any purchases under the program during the second quarter. Keep in mind that in early December, we made our annual dividend payment of $71 million and a semiannual bond interest payment of $25 million. Accounts receivable increased by $8 million since August 31, primarily because of the higher revenue levels. DSOs on accounts receivable was 40, which is the same as at August 31. New goods inventory at November 30 was $288 million, up $8 million from August 31. This increase is mainly due to continued high-demand levels in our Carhartt program, our flame-resistant clothing line, healthcare items and some build-for-winter seasonal wear. We continue to expect to see inventory levels decrease during the remainder of fiscal 2012. Accrued liabilities increased $94 million compared to August 31, primarily due to the $71 million accrual of the annual dividend and accrual of bond interest payments. Long-term debt at November 30 was $1.3 billion, of which $226 million was in current liabilities. We have $225 million maturing on June 1, 2012. We intend to pay off this amount with a combination of cash on hand and short-term borrowings under our commercial paper program. However, if longer-term borrowing rates remain at the attractive low levels they are currently, we may reevaluate and decide to refinance the amount. The average rate on the outstanding debt is 5.1%. Total debt to EBITDA is 2x. Moving onto cash flow. Cash provided by operating activities in the second quarter was $119.4 million, which is up from last year's second quarter amount of $73.9 million. In addition to higher net income, the rate of growth for working capital needs came down as we expected. CapEx for the second quarter was $35.4 million. Our CapEx by operating segment was as follows: $21 million in Rental; less than $1 million in Uniform Direct Sales; $4.3 million in First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection; and $9.5 million in Document Management. We continue to expect CapEx for fiscal 2012 to be in the range of $180 million to $200 million. That concludes our prepared remarks, and we will now take any of your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We'll go first to Vishnu Lekraj with Morningstar.
Vishnu Lekraj - Morningstar Inc., Research Division: Question here on your margin and your margin expansion. Looks like you expanded pretty good over the second quarter here. How should we think about this moving past 2012 and to 2013? And is this mainly because of cost restructuring? Or is this partly because of pricing increases or a combination of the both?
William C. Gale: It's a combination of both, Vishnu, as well as the additional revenue that we're obtaining. So we're getting the revenue growth. And obviously, we're not having to add as much capacity. And so, I would say, based on our expectations, we continue to expect margin improvement going forward. We've been saying that for some time. And I think, as you've seen this year, we've been able to accomplish that. And so, therefore, I continue to expect margin expansion going forward, assuming kind of economic environment that we're currently in and the rate of energy costs and other large costs that we're seeing at this time.
Vishnu Lekraj - Morningstar Inc., Research Division: Has there been a significant change in terms of the mix of customers in your current or in your core business?
William C. Gale: Not really. Our core business continues to be spread among businesses of all types. As we’ve talked about in last quarter or so, many of our new customers are coming from companies who had never used the programs before, and that continues. But it really crosses the traditional type of customers that we've always had, a lot of service sector type customers. We have a small amount of manufacturing, but it reall,y pretty much standardized than what we've seen in the past.
Vishnu Lekraj - Morningstar Inc., Research Division: Right. One more question here on your Doc Management business. How much would you say the headwinds there this quarter were related to the European worries? And how much was that attributable towards lower prices for recycled paper?
J. Michael Hansen: Vishnu, more of the impact in the second quarter, especially when compared to last year is due to our European business. The paper prices fell quite dramatically during the quarter, but primarily was towards the end of the quarter. The recycled paper price impact going forward will be larger than what we saw this quarter. And that is considered in our guidance.
Operator: We'll go next to John Healy with Northcoast Research.
John M. Healy - Northcoast Research: I wanted to ask a little bit about the organic growth in the Rental business. Continue to be quite impressive. I know you don't drill down to the components, but can you talk qualitatively in terms of maybe what are the sources of upside maybe relative to what you would expect in this type of economy or maybe coming from? Any color you can give in terms of the bright spots, in terms of the component of organic growth will be appreciated.
William C. Gale: Well, John, the bright spots are some of the things that we’ve talk about, the Carhartt program has been very successful, the fire-resistant clothing line has been very successful, and a lot of our new facility services programs have been very successful, our tile and carpet, our chemicals are growing well. And so, we've had some real good experience there. And I think the positive is that we've done this in a period of time where there hasn't been a lot of customer hiring. And so, if we can see some pickup in the hiring from our customers, we should see even more improvement.
John M. Healy - Northcoast Research: Helpful. And when I think about the SG&A level in the business, I think this is the fourth quarter where you've seen revenue significantly outpass SG&A growth. As we start to cycle against that building of leverage, what sort of relationship should we expect in terms of SG&A growth relative to revenue? And are we now at a point in terms of your investment into emerging business lines where the revenue should continue to outpace that? And how shall we think about those 2?
William C. Gale: Well, we still have -- in emerging businesses lines, we still have a lot of investment being made in the sales end as well as establishing appropriate levels of management in markets that don't have a lot of revenue yet, because we know we're going to grow into them. So that's going to continue for a while. I would say that we have done an excellent job with controlling our cost in the overhead areas. All of the management in the company have put a lot of effort into making sure that we don't add headcount unless absolutely necessary. We continue to see excellent productivity at the part of our sales force. I think a lot of that is attributable to the tenure, as well as the vast amount of products that we're offering and the quality of the products that we're offering. So I'd say we are -- the company continues to be committed toward letting SG&A increase at a slower rate than revenue to the extent we can. And I expect that to continue for the foreseeable future.
John M. Healy - Northcoast Research: Helpful. And then lastly, Bill, I think I ask this question every quarter but any thoughts on the M&A environment, buyer-seller expectations? Are they more aligned to what your appetite is as we start the new year?
William C. Gale: Well, I think as you can see, we really didn't do any appreciable acquisitions during the quarter nor we've done any for the year. I am not sensing there is a lot of activity out there. There's chatter and discussions, but nothing really seems to be happening on that front. And yet, as you see, we're continuing to grow very nicely. So we don't really need to make the acquisitions, but if they become available, we will certainly look at them, and do so at the appropriate profit values and to enhance our shareholder value for our shareholders. But right now, there doesn't seem to be a lot going on.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Andrew Steinerman from JP Morgan.
Andrew C. Steinerman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: My question is about add/stops. Could you make a comment sequentially year-over-year? And also, remind us how Cintas calculates its add/stops. I think we include kind of additional services to same customer, like cross-over [ph] mat to a uniform customer as an add. And if that's the formula, I wanted to know exactly -- not exactly but I wanted to know directionally how the core uniform business was doing without core sales.
William C. Gale: Well, the add/stops, as we I think said last quarter, continue to be slightly positive. The second quarter, they were a little bit more positive than the first quarter, but not appreciably so yet. There are some pockets of add of uniform wears, but by and large, the majority of the adds are coming from additional products and services into our existing customers.
Andrew C. Steinerman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Sure, that's good. And when you say a little more positive, you mean it's up year-over-year and the second quarter up a little bit more than it was in the year-over-year in the first quarter, right?
William C. Gale: Correct.
Operator: We'll go next to Gary Bisbee with Barclays Capital.
Gary E. Bisbee - Barclays Capital, Research Division: I guess let me follow-up on a couple of questions that have already been asked. On that last one, I know you've talked over the last year or so about having built out a broader customer base in the core uniform business than you've had historically. And you've talked about hospitality being one area that's grown. How do we contrast somewhat better jobs momentum overall in the U.S. with just not seeing any growth of uniform wears that exist in customers? Does that point that this is still goods producing and manufacturing heavy and given that we have not seen job growth there? Or is there some other reason? Are like customers not adding more and having people -- more employees, but not wearing uniforms? Why are we not seeing that? Do you have a view?
William C. Gale: I think the view is, is if you look at where the add/stop -- the employment growth is coming from, a lot of that is healthcare. And there's really -- we're not doing a lot of healthcare yet. Some of it's in the hospitality arena, which is more kind of a direct sale program, but it's like a lot of it's focused on fast food. We don't do a lot of fast food. So I think what you have to do, Gary, is you really have to look at where the job growth is at, and I think that you're going to find that there wasn't a lot that impacts our area, our traditional customers. Now we do not have a lot of manufacturing-type customers, it's less than 15%. Most of our customers are more in the service area, but we're not seeing a lot of job growth there.
Gary E. Bisbee - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Okay. And then following up on the question on SG&A. That continues to be a really good story. Does it get -- you're comping what had been double-digit SG&A growth for a year, I guess, with this quarter. And now, it would appear to be more difficult comps, just in terms of the growth rate of spend has slowed a lot. Can you continue to generate this type of revenue growth with a much more modest SG&A investment? Or should we think that because you've now lapped that and the comps would appear to be a little bit more difficult that the actual year-to-year growth in that spend might accelerate a little bit?
William C. Gale: Well, it's difficult to say. Obviously, we are up against a little bit more difficult comps, but I think we've -- we believe we will be able to continue to grow. And while maybe the rate of SG&A improvement won't be as great, we continue to expect there to be improved SG&A leverage as we go forward.
Gary E. Bisbee - Barclays Capital, Research Division: And then I just want to drill down a little bit in the First Aid Fire Safety business. The margin gains there have been terrific over, I guess, 1.5 year or so now. And you mentioned both factory utilization, both the facilities and in the routes. Can you give a little more color on both of those? I guess, I'm trying to understand where the facility is. Is that just driving more sales out of a distribution center for one of these? Or is there some other part of the facility where there's a real opportunity to get that kind of increased capacity utilization? And on the routes, is that just selling more customers? Or is it also more products on the truck?
J. Michael Hansen: Gary, in our first facilities, for example, our First Aid facilities, generally, they are warehouse with inventory. And we've got very, very much capacity. So in others words, there certainly is a specific investment in the warehouse. But as we continue to grow, we'll get more and more sales on top of that warehouse, as well as turn the inventory more. From a fire perspective, fire protection perspective, in our production facilities, we recharge portable fire extinguishers and do some other work, so that as we continue to add revenue on the fire side, we will continue to get leverage from those facilities. From a route standpoint, going back again to First Aid, we are adding more revenue to every customer because we are expanding product lines. We're adding training services. And as jobs get added, that, it results in more hands in the cabinet. So our routes are certainly becoming more efficient by more sales at each customer. We're also selling new business and adding new customers, but we're also expanding each customer. And from a fire standpoint, we're doing a lot of the same things. We're expanding our services and making each customer more valuable.
Andrew C. Steinerman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: And so, you made good progress there certainly in the gross margin. Is there a point where that gets more difficult to come by? It seems like you should still have on the pretax margin, some room to scale the business. Or is this a business that could well have gross margins nicely above Uniforms over time?
William C. Gale: I think it can have gross margins equal to the Uniform business overtime. I think we still have a lot of operations around the country that have not gotten to the stage where they're producing those margins, because they're just not large enough. So they have that ability going forward. So there certainly is room for improvement going down, over the next course of the next few years.
Operator: We'll go next to Andrew Wittmann from Robert W. Baird.
Andrew J. Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: Mike, I just want to dig in a little bit more into the Uniform segment numbers a little bit more, and try to, really just try to understand. Can you break out the growth rates that you saw maybe the quarter for Core Uniform, maybe that versus Hygiene and some of the other things? Can you just give us a sense as to what was kind of maybe really driving that segment versus maybe what's holding back a little bit?
J. Michael Hansen: Andy, we don't get into that level of detail. We will typically give the breakout in our fourth quarter, but we don't typically get into that level of detail. But I'll tell you, we had nice growth and improved growth rate in all of our business lines, in the Garments, Garment Rental, in the Facility Services. So it was a broad improvement during the quarter.
Andrew J. Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: And just as it relates to the chemicals, we're probably a quarter or so in now to the new product line that you're selling there. Has that been -- is it fair to say that, that's maybe one of the drivers of the Hygiene segment?
William C. Gale: It's still a really small element of the overall revenue growth, I mean on the overall revenue, Andy. It is a -- it did grow nicely in the quarter, met our expectations. But it is relatively small. So it doesn't have that big an impact yet.
Andrew J. Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: Okay, great. And then, just on the guidance. I just want to understand what's really implied here. Is the view for the rest of the year improved because you're feeling better about the second half of your fiscal year? Or is this just passing through outperformance from what's already occurred? I just kind of want to understand how you're looking at it from here. And is it fair to assume that given the reduction in paper prices, the guidance, all else equal, would have been higher if you didn't have this reduction in paper prices?
William C. Gale: We have adjusted the guidance based on both the performance year-to-date, where we have significantly beat expectations. As well as, as we look to the rest of the year, we feel more comparable, as Mike said, of being able to perform even in this lackluster economic environment. And you're right, had it not been for the paper price drop, we would have been able to report or to provide guidance that was even better than this. So we still continue to believe that we're going to be in a very sluggish economy, and we've taken into account this very dramatic drop in paper prices into those numbers. And yet, I think we are signaling a pretty nice improvement this year over the prior year, based on our results to date and our expectations.
Andrew J. Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: Yes. Then just on the buyback, clearly, you had a partial quarter where potentially you could have been buying, you elected not to or perhaps you were blacked out. With the M&A market not being overly conducive today, can you just talk about, was there something going on there that maybe prevented you from going in the market? Or was that really a just decision at this point?
William C. Gale: Well, I think we have to manage our cash flow. We have obviously just received that authorization in late October. As Mike said, we paid our dividend in early December. We paid a lot of interest. And we continue to stay in close touch with the board and look at the market situation, and we will report each quarter what we decide to do on that authorization.
Operator: We'll go next to Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer.
Scott A. Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division: I guess going across all of the segments, but starting with Rental. Bill, I think you made a comment that you're seeing less aggressiveness in pricing. Could you just address that in rental and then talk across the segment?
William C. Gale: Mike said that in his comments, we saw this last quarter where our competitors finally faced the music with the rise in commodity costs that they were seeing, and they became more rational in pricing. And while we had continued to be very disciplined on our pricing, with the competitive environment improving, which continued into this quarter, we saw a little bit of more pricing power. So that pricing has not returned to where it was, but it certainly has become more of a possibility of getting better pricing to what we were seeing a year or so ago. And I would say that's most pronounced in the Rental business, and especially in the Garment business because that was who -- our garment competitors were who were really driving prices down for a while.
J. Michael Hansen: In our Document Management business, as we've seen high paper prices for the last year or so, we've seen some pressure on the service side of the pricing. And while the paper prices came down dramatically towards the end of the quarter, it may take a little bit of time to get those service prices back up. But we certainly have seen aggressive pricing in that business.
Scott A. Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division: On the pricing thing, theme, I'm curious. In looking at the chart of cotton and after that huge spike throughout the past fiscal year, looks like it's been almost fairly flattish in this quarter. It was obviously a big issue for your company last year. Have you made any significant changes? I heard you mention that the performance with regard to that was in line for the quarter, to your expectation. Did you make any big changes? How did you treat pricing? Any change into the makeup of your uniform, synthetic versus cotton?
William C. Gale: There's been really no changes of any insignificance at our uniforms with the mix. I mean we're continuing to work with various fabric suppliers and looking at alternatives, but nothing has really entered the chain yet. Keep in mind that the cotton prices, while they have come down this year, are still above historical levels. And while they are significantly below where they were last fall, all of that cotton that came into the supply chain last fall really didn't get into the garments and the distribution centers until the spring and now are really starting to be injected into the rental programs, both for our competitors as well as ourselves. And as we said, you have those high cotton prices remain with you for a while because of the amortization and the period of time it takes from the cotton at the farm until it gets into the garment. The lower prices, if they are sustained, will certainly help lessen the impact of cotton into the future. But we are kind of stuck with those higher prices, at least through this fiscal year and into part of fiscal '13. And then, as I said, even the prices today are still above historical level. So they don't seem to be coming down as quickly as they did from the fall to the first of the summer.
Steven Gregory: Two more quick ones, I'll ask them both the same time. We just heard some questions about how you're thinking about M&A. You had done some in Document Management in Europe, and Europe does not look too healthy. Just curious, are you still committed there or you maybe going to back up that for a while? And then the second question is, with regard to not being active with share repurchases, and I heard your very valid answer for that, but if you are considering a refinancing, is there any thought to holding a large cash balance in front of that to look attractive to the banks? Just curious how that works.
William C. Gale: The European -- I think I mentioned this in the last couple of quarters. We had pretty much decided to focus on the acquisitions we had made in Europe, and then to determine how well we could grow those businesses, what we could do with improving the profitability. And so, the strategy that we had was that we were really not going to be very aggressive for a period of time in Europe. We're going to work with what we have, and that is what we are doing. We have not lost interest in Europe. We still think it's a very good market for the Document Management business. They have obviously have their economic issues over there. And we are taking appropriate action on those businesses to make sure that they will regain profitability and then we can position ourselves for growth. Regarding your question on maintaining a cash balance, I don't think that would have anything to do with that for what it would look like for purposes of appealing to a bank or to the financing. Most of our financing will be public financings anyway. I think the whole use of cash, whether we use it for share purchases, whether we use it for M&A, whether we do pay off of our debt, is all going to be taken into consideration based on the environment, looking out what happens with our share price, what happens with our business. And we'll continue to assess that month-by-month as the conditions warrant. So I would not make a big deal why we didn't execute anything under that authorization because of the short timeframe we've had since then. But we will continue to monitor that. And given our guidance, we're going to continue to generate a lot of nice cash flow.
Operator: We'll go next to James Samford with Citigroup.
James Samford - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Just a couple really quick ones here. Obviously, you’re at record revenues here. How much more capacity utilization is there available to you? And where are you relative to sort of prior key peaks in terms of utilization of your facilities?
J. Michael Hansen: Well, James, the good news is our guidance gets us higher than our previous high in revenue. But we've used a lot less capacity in getting there. And by that, I mean we've grown our Facility Services business, which includes our Hygiene business, tile and carpet, some chemical business that don't use production capacity in our rental facilities. And so, we still got a fair amount of capacity, generally speaking. Now capacity is a local thing and there may be pockets where we are closer to capacity levels. But generally speaking, we've got a lot of capacity in our infrastructure. And as we continue to grow, especially in non-processed revenue, we should continue to get more leverage.
James Samford - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: And what is the mix at this point of uniform versus nonuniform-related product or revenue?
William C. Gale: Well, it was about 50-50 in our Rental segment, as of our fourth quarter last year.
James Samford - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: And I assume that hasn't changed much in the last couple of quarters then.
William C. Gale: Not appreciably. We'll update that at the end of the year. But not appreciably, James.
James Samford - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: And just a quick -- sorry if I missed it, but did you provide any cash flow expectations for the year?
William C. Gale: No. We don't really provide cash flow expectations.
Operator: We'll go next to Sara Gubins with BofA Merrill Lynch.
Sara Gubins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Are there particular industries where you're seeing either strength or weakness in the Uniform Rental business?
William C. Gale: I'd say FRC, the flame-resistant garments, continue to be one of the stars, and that's primarily in oil, the energy fields, energy processing, chemical processing, et cetera. That continues to be very, very strong. Healthcare is picking up some momentum, as we look at opportunities to provide a rental product in the healthcare industry. And then, we are starting to make some headway in rental programs in the hospitality sector, but those are relatively small at this point.
Sara Gubins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: And then any areas of particular weakness?
William C. Gale: I would not know, I don't think so. We're not seeing that.
Sara Gubins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Could you give us an update on how new sales trended this quarter?
J. Michael Hansen: New sales was generally very good. It improved from our first quarter. So sequentially, we saw a little bit better results. Our productivity still remains very good, and we're very pleased with that.
Sara Gubins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: And then, just last question for conceptual. But how much visibility do you get from your clients if they're thinking about adding new programs?
William C. Gale: Very little, Sara. Our clients don't really tell us what they're going to do. We continue to have our salespeople and our service people trying to penetrate that with additional products and services. But we don't get a lot of visibility from them as to what their plans are.
Operator: We'll go next to Nate Brochmann with William Blair.
Nathan Brochmann - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: I wanted to talk a little bit I mean, we talked a lot about some of the newer services. But clearly, they're seeing a lot more new momentum and I think I applaud you for the efforts that you've put in over the years to build that. Strategically, how do you think about the balance of investment in some of the newer developing services versus some of the traditional ones? And where do you feel you are in terms of scaling those businesses and the opportunity for continued growth?
William C. Gale: As Mike said, let's take the different businesses. In the Rental business, while we'll have to continue to invest in the capacity on the Route side, from the Production side, we don't have the need for a lot of additional investment other than for replacement and improvement-type capital. So we're not anticipating having to build a lot of rental facilities in the near future because of the available capacity in the different mix of the business. But on the Emerging business side, we will continue to invest in the expansion capital for additional trucks, additional facilities as we fill out the footprint across the country. And we’re continue to be very excited about the opportunities there.
Nathan Brochmann - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: And Bill, just along that, could you talk about your customer base in some of those developing services, whether it's really for the moment penetrating current customers or existing customers with other services? Are these completely kind of new customers and in these new categories that then creates a broader opportunity to eventually cross sell?
William C. Gale: Well, it really it’s quite complicated. If you take each business -- for example, all of our uniform rental customers and all of our uniform, our facility services customers are candidates for some of our other products and services. Now a 2- or 3-person auto repair shop is not a good candidate for Document Management, nor are they a good candidate probably for the First Aid and Safety business. But we have a lot of -- let's take a car dealership. A car dealership has the need for uniform rental, facility services, document management, first aid and safety, fire services. So it depends on the size of the customer and the specific business they're in. Now if you go to the emerging businesses, document management has primarily been used in financial institution and healthcare facilities. They are outstanding candidates for a lot of our Facility Services business and our First Aid Safety and Fire Services business. So we look at every customer that we have in each of the different businesses and the sales teams work together to determine are they good candidates for some of the other products and services? And if so, then we begin to work on selling those products and services into that customer.
Nathan Brochmann - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: And then in terms of your current customer base buying more than one service, I would assume that's kind of still on its infancy?
William C. Gale: It's always more than in its infancy, let's put it. But there's a lot of opportunity yet to be had.
Operator: We'll go next to Greg Halter with Great Lakes Review.
Gregory W. Halter - LJR Great Lakes Review: On the M&A side, it looks like there was about $8 million in the quarter. Can you provide any indication on what specific segments those may have occurred in?
William C. Gale: They really were primarily in -- there was some fire -- I'm sorry, there were some Document Management and some Rental Facility Services acquisitions there. Nothing significant.
Gregory W. Halter - LJR Great Lakes Review: And one last one for you, regarding the programmer/nonprogrammer, I guess related to new business. What kind of metrics can you share there?
J. Michael Hansen: Our second quarter, experience was roughly the same as the first quarter, which was an improvement over what we saw during the downturn where we did not see quite as many -- no programmers. But we're back to levels that we've seen prerecession, and feeling very good about that. And it’s led certainly by some of our newer products and services, like the Carhartt program and FRC.
Operator: We'll go next to Joe Box with KeyBanc Capital Markets.
Joe Box - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: Bill, I have a follow-up on your prior point that you'll probably have to make some route-based investments before plant-level investments. Can you just talk about maybe where you're at on the capacity standpoint for trucks and drivers among your different businesses?
William C. Gale: I really can't, Joe. Obviously, I have thousands and thousands of routes out there. I can tell you that generally speaking, when we hit the recession, our management teams did a lot to right-size the routes and do rerouting to keep the capacity relatively full there. So as we see volume coming back, especially as it relates to new customers, we tend to need to add back that capacity by putting a truck back to the service, putting the driver back in the service. Now if the volume comes back from an existing customer, normally that can be handled on the route that, that customer is currently being serviced. So it really depends on the mix that's happening with where the revenue's coming from.
Joe Box - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: That's helpful, thanks. My follow-up question for you is on incremental margins. I guess with comparisons getting much more difficult in 3Q, how should we think about the incremental operating margins over the next few quarters?
William C. Gale: We're still comfortable that we'll continue to be able to expand operating margins. The degree of that expansion depends on where the business comes from. Obviously, increased volume at existing customers is more profitable than new customers in the short term. It also will depend on what happens with the level of cost, and we're making that assumption that generally, there'll be no significant change in our cost structure, like in energy and medical and that sort of thing over the next several quarters. With given that, then we expect there to be margin expansion.
Operator: We'll go next to Thomas Allen with Morgan Stanley.
Thomas Allen - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: I know you don't try to hold yourselves out as economists, but just trying to gauge how optimistic versus cautious your guidance is, taking into account recent current trends. I don't think many of you will believe that 8.6% unemployment will flatline going forward. I know our economists believe GDP is growing above 3% quarter to date and so expect 2% GDP growth going forward. So basically we’re in a very choppy macro environment. Just trying to understand. Is your guidance just factoring in recent, as in like the past few months trends? Or slightly longer-term trends?
William C. Gale: I think it's taking into account kind of what we have seen over the last few quarters. We don't really base our view on what the GDP growth is because that doesn't necessarily drive our growth. But I would say, we continue to look at the future cautiously, but I feel obviously better now than I did a year ago. But it's still a tough environment, and if we could see some real job growth in the economy, you would see some very nice growth with our company's revenues, significantly even more than what we have so far. So we've been able to perform in this economy. And as I said, I don't think we really foresee a changing much over the next several quarters.
Operator: We'll take a follow-up question from Gary Bisbee with Barclays.
Gary E. Bisbee - Barclays Capital, Research Division: One quick one. I wondered if you could give us a sense what the year-to-year hit of the gross margin rentals was from the cotton prices. And if you don't want to give that number, can you just give a sense as to how that should change in the back half of the year? So you'd given us previously, the less than $15 million in dollar terms growth in the cost. Does that get much worse in the next 2 quarters relative to what it just was?
William C. Gale: Gary, I think it's a ratable increase from the first quarter through the fourth quarter. So if you think about that $15 million or so, it is a relatively minor amount in Q1 growing with each quarter. And then, as you may have heard the last couple of calls, we've said it will continue to grow to the tune of an extra $5 million next fiscal year. So it wasn't significant in the first quarter. It's growing a little bit, it will grow a little bit more, but we still expect it to be in the $15 million or lower range.
William C. Gale: For the total year.
J. Michael Hansen: For the year.
Gary E. Bisbee - Barclays Capital, Research Division: So it's a modest headwind to gross margin, sequentially in the back half of the year.
J. Michael Hansen: Yes.
Operator: And we have no further questions from the phone audience. I'll turn the conference back to our speakers for any additional or closing comments.
William C. Gale: The only thing I'd like to say is thank you, all for joining us this evening, and best wishes to you and your families for a very happy holiday.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's conference call. We'd like to thank you all for your participation

Operator: Good day, everyone and welcome to the Cintas Quarterly Earnings Results Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Mr. Bill Gale, Senior Vice President of Finance and Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead, sir.
William C. Gale: Thank you for joining us this evening to report our first quarter results for fiscal 2012. With me is Mike Hansen, Cintas' Vice President and Treasurer. After some commentary on the results, we will be happy to answer questions. We are pleased to report that our first quarter revenue grew 10.1% from last year's first quarter to a record revenue of $1,017,000,000. It was also our second consecutive quarter of double-digit growth. Net income increased by 12% to $68.6 million, and earnings per share were $0.52, a 30% increase over last year. As noted in the release, we are particularly pleased with the expansion of our operating margin compared to last year's first quarter. Despite increases in energy-related costs and garment material costs, our operating margin improved from 10.9% in last year's first quarter to 12.6% this year. We continue to focus on selling profitable business, controlling our costs and improving the efficiency of our operations. These initiatives have allowed us to improve our overall gross margin by 60 basis points over last year's first quarter, more than offsetting the headwinds of higher energy-related costs and commodity costs, and to improve our SG&A by 130 basis points compared to last year's first quarter. Looking forward, we reiterate our guidance for fiscal 2012, which includes revenue in the range of $4 billion to $4.1 billion and earnings per diluted share in the range of $1.97 to $2.05. While we continue to be encouraged by our results, we are cautious about the state of the U.S. economy. We have now seen 4 consecutive months of employment growth under 100,000 per month. We have also seen numerous 2011 and 2012 economic forecasts being revised downward, which have generally resulted in lower employment expectations for those years. While we have not yet seen a significant change in our business due to the state of the economy, we do, however, remain cautious. The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a Safe Harbor from civil litigation for forward-looking statements. This conference call contains forward-looking statements that reflect the company's current views as to future events and financial performance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those we may discuss. I refer you to the discussion on these points contained in our most recent filings with the SEC. Now I would like to turn the call over to Mike Hansen for more details on the first quarter.
J. Michael Hansen: Thanks, Bill, and good evening. As Bill mentioned, total revenue increased 10.1% from the first quarter of last year, with total company organic growth being 7.6%. Total company gross margin for the first quarter was 43.2%, which is up from last year's first quarter gross margin of 42.6% despite a 50-basis-point increase in energy-related costs. Before providing you with details about our first quarter performance, please note that there were 66 workdays in our first quarter, which is the same as last year. As a planning note for the remainder of fiscal 2012, our workdays will be as follows: 65 in the second quarter, 65 in the third quarter and 66 in the fourth quarter. The total workdays in the fiscal 2012 year are 262. We have 4 reportable operating segments: rental uniforms and ancillary products; uniform direct sales; first aid, safety and fire protection services; and document management services. Uniform direct sales, first aid safety and fire protection services and document management services are combined and presented as other services on the face of the income statement. The rental uniforms and ancillary products operating segment consists of the rental and servicing of uniforms, masks, towels and other related items. The segment also includes restroom supplies and other facility products and services. Rental uniforms and ancillary products revenue accounted for 71% of company revenue in the first quarter. Rental revenue was $719.4 million for the quarter, which is up 9.4% compared to last year's first quarter and up 7.3% organically over last year. We continue to be pleased with our increase in uniform wearers and the growth generated by our newer product lines. Our new business and customer adds through the quarter were not quite as robust as in our fourth quarter. We did, however, begin to see some easing of the pricing environment during the quarter as expected, most likely due to the input costs headwinds facing our industry. Our rental segment gross margin was 43.9% for the first quarter, an improvement of 40 basis points over last year's first quarter gross margin of 43.5%. This was despite an increase of 40 basis points in energy-related costs. The first quarter's gross margin was a 30-basis-point improvement over the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 gross margin of 43.6%. Improved capacity utilization from higher volumes more than offset the higher energy-related costs and higher material costs. Obviously, we did not see any impact from hiring at current customers during the quarter that would allow us to take advantage of existing stockroom inventories. Our uniform direct sales operating segment includes the direct sale of uniforms, branded promotional products and other related products to national and regional customers. Uniforms and other related products are also sold to local customers, including products sold to rental customers through our direct sale catalog. Uniform direct sales revenue accounted for 10% of company revenue in the first quarter. First quarter revenue of $101.7 million represents an increase of 3% compared to last year's first quarter. Organic growth was also 3%. The revenue from this segment tends to be a bit choppy based on the timing of new product rollouts, refresh programs and customer openings. Last year's first quarter, uniform direct sales revenue benefited from more of these and was a very strong quarter. Uniform direct sales gross margin was 28.6% for the first quarter, which is down from last year's first quarter gross margin of 30.3% and fourth quarter gross margin of 30.9%. These decreases are primarily due to some cotton impact on garment costs, higher freight costs on shipment from our distribution centers and higher energy-related costs associated with our rental catalog service. Our first aid, safety and fire protection services operating segment includes revenue from the sale and servicing of first aid products, safety products and training and fire protection products. First aid, safety and fire protection revenue accounted for 10% of company revenue in the first quarter. During the quarter, revenues within this operating segment were $103.7 million, an increase of 10.9% versus last year's first quarter. Organic growth was 7.9%. This segment's gross margin was 43.2% in the first quarter compared to 40.9% in last year's first quarter. Energy-related expenses were 30 basis points higher this year compared to last year. More than offsetting the higher energy-related costs was improved capacity utilization from the higher volumes in both our facilities and on our routes. The first quarter's gross margin of 43.2% was also an improvement over the 41.7% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011. Again, higher volumes helped with capacity utilization. Our document management services operating segment includes document destruction, storage and imaging services. Document management accounted for 9% of first quarter total company revenue. Revenue increased 24.7% over last year's first quarter to $92.3 million, with organic growth of 15.9%. Recycled paper prices continued to be at historically high levels and contributed positively to the segment's organic growth. Document management's gross margin for the first quarter was 53.2%, the same as last year's first quarter. However, energy-related costs were 80 basis points higher than last year's first quarter. Offsetting these higher costs were improvements in the efficiency of both facilities and routes, mainly due to higher volumes. The first quarter gross margin of 53.2% was also better than the 51.4% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011. Moving to selling and administrative expenses. First quarter consolidated selling and administrative expenses were 30.5% of revenue, a decrease from 31.8% in last year's first quarter. Selling expenses continued to be lower as a percent of total revenue due to higher revenue levels and greater rep productivity than a year ago. Administrative expenses as a percent of total revenue also decreased due to cost control initiatives and lower medical expenses. The SG&A of 30.5% of revenue was slightly higher than the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 of 30.1%, primarily due to higher bad debt expense in the first quarter. Our effective tax rate was 38.5% for the quarter compared to 30.8% last year. Keep in mind that last year's first quarter rate was positively impacted by the resolution of several tax audits. The effective tax rate can fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter based on tax reserve builds and releases relating to specific discrete items. As noted in our press release, we expect the effective tax rate for the entire 2012 fiscal year to be 37.3%. Turning now to the balance sheet. Our cash and marketable securities were $277 million at August 31. This is down from the $525.3 million at May 31, but $259.5 million of that balance was used to purchase shares of Cintas stock during June and July. Accounts receivable increased by $10 million since May 31, primarily because of the higher revenue levels. DSOs on accounts receivable was 40, down slightly from 42 at May 31, but the same as at August 31 of last year. New goods inventory at August 31 was $280.2 million, up $30.6 million from May 31. This increase is mainly due to continued high demand levels in our Carhartt program, our flame-resistant clothing line, and some build for fall seasonal wear. We expect to see inventory levels decrease during the remainder of fiscal 2012. Accrued liabilities decreased $17.3 million compared to May 31 due to the timing of bond interest payments and the payment of fiscal 2011 profit-sharing accruals. Long-term debt at August 31 was $1.3 billion, of which $226 million was in current liabilities. We have $225 million maturing on June 1 of 2012. Our current expectation is to pay off this maturity with cash. The average rate on the outstanding debt is 5.1%. Total debt as a percentage of total book capitalization was 38%, while net debt, or long-term debt less cash and marketable securities, as a percentage of total capitalization was 32%. Moving on to cash flow. Cash provided by operating activities in the first quarter was $56.6 million, which is up from last year's first quarter amount of $35.3 million. CapEx for the first quarter was $44.4 million. Our CapEx by operating segment was as follows: $28.2 million in rental; $1.1 million in uniform direct sales; $4.8 million in first aid, safety and fire protection; and $10.3 million in document management. We expect CapEx for fiscal 2012 to be in the range of $180 million to $200 million. That concludes our prepared remarks, and we will now take any of your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question today from Andrew Wittmann with Robert W. Baird & Co.
Andrew J. Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: I wanted to dig a little bit, start out with on the document business. Good organic growth there. Could you separate out on a same paper price level what maybe an underlying organic rate was there?
J. Michael Hansen: Excluding the recycled paper, it was 7.7% for the quarter.
Andrew J. Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: Okay. Great. And then just to try to dig in more strategically, can you just talk about what you're seeing in the acquisition market for that business, a little bit in terms of pricing, availability of deals? And your propensity, or maybe philosophically about your desire or non-desire to have storage as part of that offering?
William C. Gale: Andy, the acquisition pipeline has been relatively -- let's say the acquisition activity has been relatively quiet. We still are in active discussions with numerous players. However, at this time during the quarter, there just really weren't a lot of actionable things I think partly due to our price propensity versus their price expectations. But I don't think there's a lot of deals being made anywhere based on what I am seeing. We are continuing to focus on the shredding side. We have done some storage start-ups recently, but we have not really pursued any storage acquisitions in the last several quarters.
Andrew J. Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: Just the, I guess, focus on shredding. Is that just because that's where you've been able to have kind of immediate operating leverage? Is there an aversion generally from using the balance sheet for storage if, say, if you were able to go in with larger scale and maybe get some immediate leverage out of the business, you think that would be a potential use of balance sheet even though, historically, it has not been something that you've done?
William C. Gale: We would certainly look at it. One of the issues you run into often in a storage acquisition is that the seller is selling because he doesn't want to invest in the additional capacity he needs to continue to grow. So one of the first things that happens, typically, is that when you buy a storage operation, you've got to invest a lot of capital right away in order to continue to grow. This tends to drive down the price we're willing to pay for the operation because we want to demand a certain return on our investment. So I think that, that has been part of the issue. The other part of the issue, or the other part of the strategy that Cintas has had, is that we believe there's an awful lot of core competency that we have and route-based businesses that we can apply and have applied to the shredding business. So we look at that as a better return for our shareholders. It's a business that has grown very, very nicely, both in terms of revenue growth as well as margin expansion. And so that's why our focus has continued to be more in the shredding side, because of the returns and the growth potential.
Andrew J. Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: Okay. Great. And I just wanted to dig in one thing on the uniform directs sales, if you will. Mike, I think you mentioned that new product lines have helped kind of the core business results this quarter. Can you help quantify how much of the organic growth was maybe driven by some of the new product lines, whether it's facility services or maybe the deal with Diversey, what have you?
J. Michael Hansen: We don't give that kind of detail, Andy, by product line. But those new businesses are performing well, and we're seeing good growth in those as well as all of our businesses. We're pleased to see growth in all of our business lines within the rental segment.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Sara Gubins with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
David Ridley-Lane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: This is David Ridley-Lane for Sara. Maybe on rental uniform sales, they're nearly back to peak levels. The gross margin for that segment is also nearly back to the 44% level that has historically been, pretty much the high there. Is there a lot of further room for gross margin expansion in that segment as you kind of squeeze the capacity utilization back to your kind of normal levels already?
William C. Gale: David, no, there is certainly room for continued margin expansion for a couple of reasons. One is we still have capacity in our facilities that we can leverage off of. But even more importantly, I would say, is the opportunities that still exist at some point for increased volume at existing customers. Much of our growth over the last several quarters has come from new business as opposed to growth in existing customers. And as we've talked on numerous occasions, when you can get a customer to add an employee, which at this point we haven't really seen yet, that is very profitable business and that would contribute to margin expansion. So hopefully at one -- at some point here in the not-too-distant future we'll begin to see customers increasing the sizes of the workforce. At least what we've seen for the last year has been that they're maintaining their workforces. So the next step would be when confidence comes into the economy, these businesses will start increasing, and we'll see additional profitability from those wearers.
J. Michael Hansen: And David, when it comes to capacity, some of the newer businesses, the chemicals, the hygiene businesses, the tile and carpet, they do not really use capacity at our plants. And so we've been able to grow without using as much capacity as in the past.
David Ridley-Lane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Maybe just on the rental uniforms segment of that, are you back to normal capacity utilization, sort of in the normal range, or are you still below even kind of the normal ranges?
William C. Gale: We're still below where we were back in the fiscal '08, '09, first quarter of '09 periods when we were at these revenue levels in rental before. As Mike said, part of the new businesses that we're in have added to those rental lines and aren't the traditional garment business. So we're still down from where we used to be in the garment side.
David Ridley-Lane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Okay. And then maybe a quick one on the uniform direct gross margin, does the cotton impact there gets worse before it gets better?
William C. Gale: I would say it probably won't get much worse. It will probably start getting a little bit better because the occurrence of the higher cotton prices have been quicker in the direct sale businesses than it does in the rental business. Because in the rental business, of course, we're amortizing that over a longer period of time. So the high cotton prices that we were experiencing in the fall have pretty much entered the product cost. We have a mix in the distribution centers. But they have entered and they come in much quicker on the direct sale business. So I'd say you're probably not going to see it getting worse in direct sales, and we'll start to hopefully offset a little bit of that too with higher pricing going forward.
David Ridley-Lane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Okay. And maybe if I could squeeze one last one in. Do you have quarter-end share count or the current share count?
J. Michael Hansen: The outstanding shares were 129.7 million. And you can see that on our balance sheet.
Operator: And for our next question, we'll go to James Samford with Citi.
James Samford - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Just wanted to touch on at a high level from a macro perspective, what's the state of the union among sort of small business and the feedback that you're getting? It sounds like you're obviously more cautious. Obviously, we are as well. But I just wanted to get anything that you're starting to hear back from your customers relating to hiring plans, things like that.
William C. Gale: Well, I think what we are seeing is that most customers are just trying to maintain their status quo from a labor standpoint. So as Mike mentioned, we did not really see many adds at our existing customers. Fortunately, we didn't see many reductions either. We just -- it was kind of a status quo. So I sense in talking with our sales people and our operating people that companies are just kind of holding with what they've got. And hopefully, we won't see a forced reduction in headcount if the economy goes a lot -- slows down a lot more. So people are just kind of generally holding on to what they have.
James Samford - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: And then with regards to pricing, obviously, so cotton prices coming down, fuel prices coming down. That helps you and your competitors. Have you seen competitor pricing change at all as a result of this? Or have you been able to get some benefit at least from the prior hikes in cotton prices?
William C. Gale: Oh, no. We're -- we got some nice benefit in the quarter, as Mike mentioned. And these cotton prices, the higher cotton prices are going to be with Cintas and our competitors for some time in the rental business because that stuff is really just entering the cost categories as those products get injected into their customers. And then you're kind of stuck with those higher cotton prices for the period of amortization. So I would say that we're -- we've seen a firming up of the pricing environment in most cases, not in all cases, and that is certainly a positive sign as far as we're concerned.
J. Michael Hansen: Jim, Bill mentioned the cotton impact in the uniform direct side. In the rental side, we saw a minor impact this quarter. But we expect that, that will -- that impact will grow as we go throughout the quarters of the year because of, as Bill said, it's entering that amortization stream.
James Samford - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: And I believe you said it was, roughly, $15 million impact in 2012 and $5 million in '13. Is that still valid?
J. Michael Hansen: So we said something less than $15 million in fiscal '12, and we still believe that. And we likely saw less than 1/4 of that. So if you think about that growing impact, we expect to see a little bit more throughout each quarter of the year. And then that $5 million was on top -- the $5 million was an incremental impact in fiscal '13, so roughly a $20 million impact in '13.
Operator: We'll go next to Nate Brochmann with William Blair & Company.
Nathan Brochmann - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: I want to talk a little bit more strategically in terms of how you're thinking about costs within the business in terms of whether you put the pedal down on hiring to take advantage of some opportunities out there or whether you take a more cautious approach. And how do you think about the balance about that right now?
William C. Gale: I would tell you that we are remaining relatively cautious. We're not doing any significant adds to our headcount. We're certainly adding to accommodate the additional growth, especially in our service side. But I would say we're being cautious also.
Nathan Brochmann - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: Okay. Fair enough. And then also, obviously, new business and greater penetration has been a big part of the story here recently to somewhat of the better, more consistent performance and earnings growth that you've been putting up nicely. How do you feel about the pipeline of new business activity? Is there still a lot of eager discussions out there and accounts that continue to close?
J. Michael Hansen: Our salespeople still feel very good about the new business pipeline and selling the value of our different products and services. They're still excited about selling the newer product lines as well. And so they're still feeling good about their ability to produce that rep productivity levels that we've seen.
Nathan Brochmann - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: Sounds great. So while there's a cautious tone in general, we still see some good activity out there.
William C. Gale: Yes, and I think we do because as we talked about the last quarter, so many of our products and services are very appealing to the no programmer market, and that's where we're seeing a pickup in new business. Plus, some of those products and services have led to more competitive wins with some of the traditional uniform rental suppliers. So I think what we're not seeing is just the expansion of existing accounts, which I alluded to earlier, which once that starts, that really just adds another push to our top line growth and obviously improves our margins.
Operator: And we'll go next to Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan.
Andrew C. Steinerman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Could you mention the effect of the lost business? I know you've said pricing up a little bit, add stops flat, new business you commented on. But lost business, I don't think you've said.
William C. Gale: We did not say anything, Andrew, because basically, we saw a reduction in lost business about 3 or 4 quarters ago, and it has gotten back down to more historic levels and really hasn't changed.
Andrew C. Steinerman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Okay. And could you make a comment about merchandise amortization, I expect that's still a higher merchandise amortization at this point, and give us a sense kind of within the guidance how you're thinking about merchandise amortization.
J. Michael Hansen: Well, we're still seeing the amortization give us some upward pressure. Because as we continue to inject new business and new garments for those new accounts, it certainly is making the in-service inventory go up and our amortization go up. And so we continue to expect that to go up as we are continuing to add new business, and that certainly is in our guidance. We do believe that we can continue to offset that with the efficiencies of our plants and our routes though.
Andrew C. Steinerman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Right. But is this a headwind bigger than what you highlighted for energy? Or it's just -- it's smaller than energy's headwind?
J. Michael Hansen: I would say that it's not any larger than what we've seen in the last year.
Operator: For our next question, we'll go to Gary Bisbee with Barclays Capital.
Gary E. Bisbee - Barclays Capital, Research Division: So I'm looking at a chart here that I got from you in your fiscal 2004 that actually broke down at sort of excruciating detail -- I can't remember if I got this in Investor Day or where -- but the end market exposure of your customers. And it dawned on me that I don't think we've gotten a good update since then on that. At the time, like, manufacturing and related and autos and auto mechanics and auto -- I don't know if it was retail or whatever, and related seemed to be the 2 biggest areas, and then it was really pretty diversified beyond that. But has there been any major changes? Are you doing more like in restaurants, food service, hospitality, anything? And I guess this is specifically to the rentals business. Has there been any big change in the last few years?
William C. Gale: I would say, Gary, I don't have it in front of me. I'm not sure how recent data we've had our marketing group do that. But the last time I looked at it, we certainly have had an increase in the sectors you just mentioned, the hospitality sector including hotels, restaurants, that sort of entertainment type things. We've had an increase, slight increase, in the retail sector. We started seeing some increases in the healthcare. As you may probably never even saw that pop up on the last schedule, we've seen a reduction in manufacturing from that period due to the shrinkage of the manufacturing sector in the U.S. But it's still a pretty diverse chart because no one customer still accounts for more than half 1% of our business, and no one sector really is that big a component of our business either.
Gary E. Bisbee - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Okay. That's helpful. I'll ask you what -- I guess it's a fairly obvious question. You put up great growth and big numbers and yet you maintained the guidance, which clearly implies a pretty substantial deceleration. Obviously, the comps get much tougher given how strongly you did in the back half the last fiscal year, and you sounded a cautious tone on the economy. Is there anything else going on there? Would the comps and the economy be what's driving that decision to maintain and not raise the guidance?
William C. Gale: Gary, it's absolutely what you just said. Yes, we've got a little tougher comps, but the bigger thing is we just don't know what the economy is going to deal with us. And we would rather express our caution because, I mean, everything you pick up and read seems to imply that there's not going to be a lot of job growth here in the next -- at least for the next 12 to 18 months. So while we will continue to grow, if we don't get some job growth, it's going to be tough to continue to grow double-digit levels.
Gary E. Bisbee - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Okay. And then just the last one for me. I think in your opening line, Bill, you made a comment that you focus on selling profitable business, controlling costs. And I think you said then continuing to find efficiency opportunities. Can you give an update on what those are today, what you're doing on the efficiency front?
William C. Gale: We're doing quite a few things. We're obviously continuing to look at all our plants and try to do more mechanization to operation, so that we can, basically, I think, improve the throughput of those facilities. So we've invested in some technology there. On our routes, we've -- you probably remember, we did have a route-based computer, well we've done quite a bit on expanding the capabilities of those route-based systems that the drivers are carrying with them. In our B&A functions, we've invested in SAP and continue to invest in SAP, and that's helping reduce the need for additional headcount. I think in all of our businesses have been charged with eliminating non value-added work. And as a result of that, keeping headcount at the appropriate level of service to our customers, but certainly not having excessive headcount around. So it's a combination of process improvement and technology investment.
Operator: For our next question, we'll go to Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel, Nicolaus.
Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: I want to focus a little bit more on the pricing end. Do you have a metric as to how much the firming of pricing and your ability to move that pricing impacted the margin in the quarter on the rentals business?
William C. Gale: Shlomo, we certainly know that internally, but we don't disclose those components publicly.
Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: Is it -- we talked a lot about some of the other areas in terms of offsetting headwinds. Would you say that, that is one of the biggest areas to offset the headwinds from some of the cost items?
William C. Gale: I wouldn't say it's one of the biggest, but it was certainly a contributor. I think the volume was probably a bigger contributor.
Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: And just one other thing. How much -- how long does it take to push that pricing through your base? Does that like go through the year because the contracts take some time to roll through?
William C. Gale: Yes, it does that. But it's also an impact of the new business that we're getting is coming in at a higher price than what we were seeing a year ago.
Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: Okay. And then how should I think about free cash flow for the year? I remember when we were talking about this last quarter, one of the things that we talked about were inventory build around the SAP implementation, which should probably reverse. Do you have kind of a number that you guys are targeting, or at least a range that we should think about?
William C. Gale: Well, we do have that. I'm not sure if I have it right in front of me. We'll have to get back to you with that. I would say it is somewhere probably in the $450 million to $500 million range.
Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: You're talking -- that's cash from operations?
J. Michael Hansen: Yes.
William C. Gale: And then CapEx, Mike said $180 million to $200 million.
Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: Okay. And then in terms of SAP implementation, are things kind of going the way you guys were expecting? Or is there anything -- are you getting more efficiencies out of that? Usually, that's kind of a risky period for a company.
William C. Gale: Well, it's going pretty much as expected. We haven't had any glitches. We've had probably some little lengthier implementation times than we originally expected. Right now, we are in the process of working on a couple of our emerging businesses to roll out the SAP order taking to invoicing cycle, basically, if you will. We had previously focused on the financials and on the global supply chain, which both went very well. And I would say that other than just taking a little bit longer, we haven't really run into any difficulties. But to this point, we haven't really impacted the customer yet. So that's always a more critical point, I think, when you're putting in a system.
Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: And one question just back on pricing. It seems like when cotton pricing came to a head, the industry as a whole is starting to push it through. But there seemed to be less of that when there was fuel type of increases to the overall cost base. Why do you think that is?
William C. Gale: Well, I think part of it is cotton is a bigger impact than fuel. And I think that it stays with you a longer time, whereas fuel was somewhat volatile, go up and down. Whereas the cotton, once it kind of gotten into the supply chain, it takes a while for it to settle back down.
J. Michael Hansen: And it was the first time we've seen cotton move like that in a long time, and it moved drastically.
Operator: And we'll go next to Chris McGinnis with Sidoti & Company.
Christopher McGinnis - Sidoti & Company, LLC: Just one question on the new business that you're seeing. Is it new -- the new business you're seeing, is it more of the uniforms side, or is it more on the ancillary side of the business?
William C. Gale: In both. We're seeing -- we are certainly seeing wearer -- increases in the number of wearers. We're seeing increases in the price of the product that the wearers are having. And we're also seeing nice progress with the ancillary services. So they both have contributed very nicely to the growth in the rental business.
Christopher McGinnis - Sidoti & Company, LLC: And then just one side question, just on SG&A. Obviously, last year, you put a little in, and it really paid off on the top line. Is there, I guess, a moment where you think about increasing the sales force again and investing in that? And what would, I guess, what would set you up to do that, what would trigger you to do that going forward?
William C. Gale: Chris, I think that's going to be driven more by market penetration, especially in the emerging businesses where as we get into different markets, as we continue to establish our footprint, we'll see increases in sales force there. But as far as our rental business, we're in all the markets pretty much anyway right now. And I think we feel like we're appropriately staffed to take advantage of the opportunities that are there.
Operator: And for our next question, we'll go to Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer.
Scott A. Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division: Just going back on the subject of rentals and the fact that things are good now but you're cautious looking forward. Could you give us a feel, kind of going back to Gary's question, of the end markets which you serve? Are there any that are significantly outperforming or underperforming where you're getting an early read on any potential downturn?
William C. Gale: The only thing I've really heard is, of course, healthcare continues to be a very good market, continuing to see growth there. I think the hospitality business has also shown some nice resilience. And with all of our different product offerings, we're continuing to expand the things that we can do for a company in that business. We've seen stabilization in manufacturing, but we're not seeing growth. We've at least seen some stabilization. Mike, have you heard anything else?
J. Michael Hansen: No. I think -- I don't think we've seen any change that would tell us that a new trend is coming.
Scott A. Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division: Okay. That's helpful. And then just on target margin, target operating margin, where do you think that can go? And it sounds like you're not really seeing any of the red flags that have the economy spooked. What are you thinking about sort of target margins here and what you can do? More namely, what are you handling on the expense controls, or are you -- is it putting on the gas pedal or the brakes right now?
William C. Gale: Well, I don't think I can -- I'm prepared to really say what our target margins are because there are so many different factors that go into play. It depends on how much -- how fast our emerging businesses grow, and how much we're going to invest in the sales side to grow those businesses. It depends on the rental business, where does the growth come from. Is it new business? Is it existing customer adds? Is it wearer improvement? All I can tell you is this. We are committed to margin expansion and margin improvement. I think we've done a very nice job over the last couple of years demonstrating our capability to do that. We're still below where we used to be, but the trend is good going there. And we'll continue to focus on improving margins while, at the same time, improving the long-term value of Cintas. So there's just so many different factors that I can't really tell you that this is the target level we're going to get to. All I can say is it will be better than what it is barring a significant downturn in the economy or a significant spike in costs such as energy or other type factors that we are not foreseeing at this time.
Operator: And for a follow-up question, we'll go to Andrew Wittmann with Robert W. Baird & Co.
Andrew J. Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: Maybe I missed this. But Bill, did you -- you mentioned that new customers were up. Did you give a split between no programmers and programmers? I think last quarter, you said you've reached historical levels of kind of like a 60-40 split between no programmers and, I guess, market share gains. Has that changed in the most recent quarter, or is it looking like it's changing further?
J. Michael Hansen: That was -- that did not change significantly from the fourth quarter to the first quarter. It is still in that historical range, nudged up a little bit on the no programmers side, but still pretty close to that historical level.
Andrew J. Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: Got it. Great. And then just on the direct sales side. I think the industry has broadly been seeing some benefits from fire retardant uniforms that were, I guess, mandated from OSHA. Obviously, this business has been pretty good in the last several quarters. Is that one factor that may be running out of steam? Or where do you think the direct sale business is being driven by or could be driven by for the remainder of the year?
J. Michael Hansen: Well, Andrew, that fire retardant garment, the FRC, is really more of a driver in the uniform rental business. We are seeing a good amount of success in the rental space. From a direct sale business, I think it's, again, it's a choppier business, and we still expect to see refreshes and new programs coming up. And we haven't seen a trend that would make us think otherwise for that business.
Operator: And at this time, we have no additional questions in our queue. I'll turn the call back to our speakers for any closing remarks you may have.
William C. Gale: Thank you, all, very much for joining us this evening. I know it had to be a very hectic day for all of you in the investment business. So we'll look forward to speaking with you again during our second quarter announcement, which we expect to take place sometime the week of December 19. Thanks again for joining us.
Operator: And ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude our conference. We appreciate your participation.

===== 2011 Q4  (2011-07-19 17:00:00) =====
Executives: J. Hansen - Vice President and Treasurer William Gale - Chief Financial Officer, Principal Accounting Officer and Senior Vice President
Analysts: Andrew Steinerman - JP Morgan Chase & Co Sara Gubins - BofA Merrill Lynch Dave Brinkman Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc. Justin Hauke - Robert W. Baird & Co.

Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Cintas Quarterly Earnings Results Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Bill Gale, Senior Vice President of Finance and Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead, sir.
William Gale: Thank you for joining us this evening to report our fourth quarter results for fiscal 2011. With me is Mike Hansen, Cintas' Vice President and Treasurer. After some commentary on the results, we will be happy to answer questions.  We are pleased to report that our revenue for the fourth quarter grew 11.3% from last year's fourth quarter to a record revenue of $1,012,000,000. Net income increased by 27.6% to $70.8 million, and the earnings per share were $0.49, a 36% increase over last year. As noted in the release, total year revenue of over $3.8 billion was 7.4% higher than last year, and total earnings per share of $1.68 was 20% higher. Stabilization of revenue at existing customers, excellent new business results and cost control measures, as well as improved productivity within our organization, were all factors in these very good results. We want to express our sincere appreciation to all of our employees, who we call our partners, for their contribution to this successful year. On May 18, we issued $500 million of public debt spread in 2 tranches, $250 million with a 5-year maturity and the other at 10 years. We found the rates to be very attractive, and demand was strong for our bonds. Given the price of our stock and the positive outlook for our company's performance, our Board of Directors authorized management to use these funds to pay off short-term debt and to purchase Cintas stock under parameters established by the board. The $500 million expenditure resulted in total purchases of 15.8 million shares, of which 7.7 million shares were purchased as of May 31, and the remaining 8.1 million shares were purchased between June 1 and July 6. Coupled with the share purchases made earlier in fiscal 2011, Cintas purchased 23.4 million shares since last July. The impact of the share purchases in fiscal 2011 added about $0.05 to our earnings per share from what we would have reported with no share purchases. Our guidance for fiscal 2012 revenue is to be in the range of $4 billion to $4.1 billion and earnings per diluted share to be in the range of $1.97 to $2.05. This guidance incorporates the impact of the recently completed $500 million share buyback program, which equates to about $0.12 a share, when also factoring in the additional interest expense from the debt offering in May. Let me address some assumptions used in developing this guidance. While recent economic news, including the Bureau of Labor announcements for May and June were not as bright as we would like, we expect that the North American economy and employment picture will moderately improve in the next 12 months. We expect that we and the other companies in industries in which we operate could face input cost headwinds in the next 12 months, particularly related to cotton, energy and oil-related products, such as polyester. These rising input costs will add negative pressure to our industry's cost. While this will create some margin pressure for Cintas and our competitors, we expect the margin pressure will also ease the extremely aggressive pricing environment that we have experienced over the last several years. More specifically, for our guidance, we have assumed that energy-related cost would continue at our fourth quarter level of 3.5% of sales. This was the highest level we have seen since our fiscal 2009. As many of you know, the price of cotton significantly increased last fall and has remained at relatively high levels but has declined significantly in recent months. Many factors contribute to the effect that cotton has on Cintas, certainly the price of cotton, but also Cintas' fabric inventory, as well as finished goods inventory levels, sourcing decisions and manufacturing lead times, as well as amortization periods of in-service inventory and the overall uniform industry pricing environment. We have been managing and analyzing each of these areas to minimize the impact on our results. We expect that the fiscal 2012 impact will be less than $15 million on our cost of rentals and other services, and as mentioned, this impact is incorporated into our guidance. Due to the amortizing effect of in-service inventory, the cotton impact could be heavier in our fiscal 2013 by an amount around $5 million. However, as noted, many factors contribute to the cotton impact, and we will continue to monitor and analyze this throughout fiscal 2012. We also believe that the improved environment will lead us to being able to obtain higher prices for our services.

These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those we may discuss. I refer you to the discussion on these points contained in our most recent filings with the SEC.  Now I would like to turn the call over to Mike Hansen for more details on the fourth quarter.
J. Hansen: Thank you, and good evening. As Bill mentioned, total revenue increased 11.3% from the fourth quarter of last year with total company organic growth being 8%. Total company gross margin for the fourth quarter was 42.8%, which is up from last year's fourth quarter gross margin of 42.4%. Before providing you with details about Cintas' fourth quarter performance, please note that there were 66 workdays in our fourth quarter, which is the same as last year. As a planning note for fiscal 2012, our workdays will be as follows: 66 in the first quarter, 65 in the second quarter, 65 in the third quarter and 66 in the fourth quarter, for a total of 262 workdays in fiscal 2012. We have 4 reportable operating segments: Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products, Uniform Direct Sales, First Aid Safety and Fire Protection Services and Document Management Services. Uniform Direct Sales, First Aid Safety and Fire Protection Services and Document Management services are combined and presented as other services on the face of the income statement. The Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products operating segment consists of the rental and servicing of uniforms, mats, towels and other related items. The segment also includes restroom supplies and other facility products and services. Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products revenue accounted for 70% of company revenue in the fourth quarter. Within rental, based on our fourth quarter revenue levels, uniform rental accounted for approximately 51% of the revenue. Dust control, which is mainly entrance mats, accounted for 20%. Hygiene, which is mainly restroom supply and cleaning was 12%. Shop towel revenue was 6%. And linen and other, which is mainly nonperson-specific garments such as aprons and butcher coats was 11%.  Rental revenue was $711.9 million for the quarter, which is up 9.9% compared to last year's fourth quarter. Organic growth was 7.2% over last year, which is an improvement from last quarter's organic growth of 4.3%. Sales rep productivity, particularly as it relates to new accounts, continued to be strong, and our new business sold during the fourth quarter was up over 20% compared to last year's fourth quarter. We are pleased with the increase in uniform wearers and the growth generated by our newer product lines. During the fourth quarter, we noted no significant changes in the pricing environment, although pricing at contract renewal and for large national accounts remained very competitive. As Bill noted though, we expect the current input cost pressures faced by competitors and us to result in some easing of the pricing pressures and in fact, will likely lead us and our competitors to increase prices in the coming fiscal year. Our Rental segment gross margin was 43.6% for the fourth quarter, an improvement of 10 basis points over last year's fourth quarter gross margin of 43.5%. Energy-related costs were 20 basis points higher than last year. Improved capacity utilization from higher volumes more than offset the higher energy-related costs and higher material costs due to the injection of in-service inventory associated with new accounts. While we are pleased with our new account performance and increases in wearers, we have yet to see impactful hiring within existing customers. The add-on wearers associated with hiring at existing customers allows us to take advantage of our stockroom inventories. Our Uniform Direct Sales operating segment includes the direct sale of uniforms, branded promotional products and other related products to national and regional customers. Uniforms and other related products are also sold to local customers, including products sold to rental customers through our direct sale catalog.  Uniform Direct Sales revenue accounted for 11% of company revenue in the fourth quarter. Fourth quarter revenue of $109.1 million represents an increase of 5.7% compared to last year's fourth quarter. Organic growth was also 5.7%.  Uniform Direct Sales gross margin was 30.9% for the fourth quarter, which is relatively consistent with last year's fourth quarter gross margin of 31%, and an improvement from the third quarter gross margin of 29.5%. The improvement from the third quarter is primarily due to better capacity utilization at our distribution centers due to the higher volumes. Our First Aid Safety and Fire Protection Services operating segment includes revenue from the sale and servicing of first aid products, safety products and training and fire protection products. First Aid Safety and Fire Protection revenue accounted for 10% of company revenue in the fourth quarter.  During the quarter, revenues within this operating segment were $99.6 million, an increase of 13.4% versus last year's fourth quarter. Organic growth was 9.7%. We are pleased with the revenue momentum in this business as organic growth for the last 3 quarters has been 8.4%, 9.3% and 9.7%. Sales rep productivity, particularly in the First Aid and Safety side, continued to be strong in our fourth quarter. This segment's gross margin was 41.7% for the fourth quarter, a very solid improvement over last year's fourth quarter gross margin of 39.4%. This improvement was equally strong in both First Aid and Safety and in Fire Protection Services, and was largely due to better capacity utilization due to higher volumes. The improvement also came despite a 40 basis point increase in energy-related cost compared to last year. Our Document Management services operating segment includes document destruction, storage and imaging services. Document Management accounted for 9% of fourth quarter total company revenue. Within Document Management, the European business accounted for 13% of total segment revenues during the fourth quarter. Revenue increased 29.5% over last year's fourth quarter to $91.6 million with organic growth of 16.5%. Recycled paper prices increased throughout the quarter and contributed to the organic growth rate. Excluding recycled paper revenue, organic growth was 11.3% during the fourth quarter. Because the recycled paper prices are so high, pricing for service has been very competitive.  Document Management's gross margin for the fourth quarter was 51.4%, a decrease from last year's 53%. Energy-related costs increased by 60 basis points compared to last year. In addition, our Storage business had several greenfield starts earlier this fiscal year. These startups are running as planned but do have a drag on overall gross margins in the early stages. The fourth quarter gross margin of 51.4% is an improvement over the 49.4% in this year's third quarter. Moving to selling and administrative expenses. The fourth quarter consolidated selling and administrative expenses were 30.1% of revenue, a decrease from 31.5% in last year's fourth quarter. As expected, our selling expenses continue to be lower as a percent of total revenue due to greater rep productivity. Administrative expenses as a percent of total revenue also decreased due to cost control initiatives and lower medical expenses. Our effective tax rate was 39.5% for the quarter compared to 38.2% last year. For the full fiscal 2011 year, our effective tax rate was 37.1%. We expect our effective tax rate for fiscal 2012 to be approximately 37.3%. Turning now to the balance sheet. Our cash and marketable securities were $525.3 million at May 31. As mentioned in the press release, keep in mind that $259.9 million was used in June and July to purchase shares of Cintas stock. Accounts receivable increased by $12.8 million since February 28, primarily because of the higher revenue levels. DSOs on accounts receivable was 42, up from 40 at February 28, but the same as at May 31, 2010. New goods inventory at May 31 was $249.7 million, up $17.4 million from February 28. This increase is mainly due to higher demand levels, particularly in our Carhartt program, our Flame Resistant Clothing line and our womenswear. The SAP system has been performing as expected, but we also took a more cautious approach to our inventory levels during the quarter to ensure that all of our customer needs were met. We expect to see inventory levels decrease in fiscal 2012. Uniforms and other rental items in-service increased by $19.8 million from February 28 to May 31 due to the higher volume levels throughout the fourth quarter. As mentioned earlier, our improved sales productivity, particularly related to new accounts, has driven the higher injection of in-service inventory. Accrued liabilities increased $22 million compared to February 28 due to $12 million of accrued bond interest and $9 million of accrued profit sharing, which build throughout the fiscal year. Long-term debt at May 31 was $1.3 billion. Our average rate on the outstanding debt is 5.1%. Total debt was 2x fiscal '11 EBITDA, and as a percentage of total book capitalization was 36%, while net debt or long-term debt less cash and marketable securities as a percentage of total capitalization was 25%. As discussed, $259.5 million of cash and marketable securities was used to purchase shares of Cintas stock in June and July. If we would have completed the share buybacks by May 31, our debt to capitalization would've been 39%, while the net debt to capitalization would have been 33%.  Moving onto cash flow. Cash provided by operating activities in the fourth quarter was $132.9 million, which is consistent with the $132.4 million from last year's fourth quarter. The growing revenue this year has resulted in increased accounts receivable and inventory levels compared to last year. CapEx for the fourth quarter was $40.3 million. Our CapEx by operating segment was as follows: $25.2 million in Rental, slightly less than $1 million in Uniform Direct Sales, $4.2 million in First Aid Safety and Fire Protection and $10.1 million in Document Management. We expect CapEx for fiscal 2012 to be relatively consistent with fiscal 2011 and in the range of $180 million to $200 million. You may notice that our cash flow statement shows proceeds from issuance of debt of slightly over $1 billion and repayment of debt of $502 million. Keep in mind that accounting guidance requires us to separately show the ins and outs of commercial paper activity. The net of the 2 figures is the $500 million, which represents the financing that we completed in May.  That concludes our prepared remarks, and we will now take any of your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Sara Gubins with Bank of America.
Sara Gubins - BofA Merrill Lynch: You mentioned seeing stabilization at existing clients. Could you talk about what their -- how the discussions with them are going around the next couple of months and into the fall?
William Gale: Well, I'm not sure they're -- Sara, they're really telling us a bunch of what they're plans are. We saw stabilization in our existing customers within the last couple of quarters. And I can just tell you, from reading what you read in the public domain that it seems like most businesses are cautious in adding new employees, and we certainly have seen that with our customers over the last couple of quarters. The good news though, of course, is generally speaking, they're not reducing headcount like they were last year. So we're hoping that perhaps once confidence builds, that we'll begin to see some hiring at existing customers.
Sara Gubins - BofA Merrill Lynch: Okay. And then, I'm hoping to get some more detail within the guidance for next year about how you're thinking about SG&A? How much more room there is for rep productivity?
William Gale: Well, we're certainly anticipating some improved productivity within our sales organization. We had a very good year this year with improved productivity, so we're thinking that trend will continue. Therefore, that will result in a lower SG&A as a percent of revenue, and that's embedded in our guidance.
Sara Gubins - BofA Merrill Lynch: Great. And then last question, could you give us the share count at the end of the year?
William Gale: Yes, it's about 130 million shares just like -- oh no, at the end of the year or as of right now?
Sara Gubins - BofA Merrill Lynch: Actually, as of right now would be even better.
William Gale: Yes, it's about 129.6 million shares.
Operator: Our next question comes from James Samford with Citi.
James Samford - Citigroup Inc: Just, I guess, now that we have the share count for -- potentially for next year, it seems to me that implies almost no margin expansion for the full year. Is that math correct?
J. Hansen: Well, the one thing to keep in mind, James, is that we do have the extra interest from our $500 million in debt. So there is margin expansion if you look at the EBIT levels.
James Samford - Citigroup Inc: Got it. And anticipated interest expense, I guess, is the other question I could ask for that.
William Gale: Well, it's about $20 million pretax.
James Samford - Citigroup Inc: Pretax. Perfect. Have you guys been seeing any additional impact? I know we have another quarter behind us from Japan in terms of other manufacturing?
William Gale: No, we haven't seen any impact from that, not really.
Operator: Our next question comes from Gary Bisbee with Barclays Capital.
Gary Bisbee - Barclays Capital: If I can ask about the first -- of the organic growth, it was particularly strong, I guess, in rentals in terms of the change versus last quarter. Can you help us understand it all, against what looks like a somewhat, I guess, tougher comp? What exactly is going on there? Is it really the new sales activity? And if so, can you give us some examples of, maybe, the types of accounts you're signing up or sort of what's -- how that's going so well?
William Gale: Well, keep in mind, Gary, we've seen improving organic growth all year. Every quarter has been a little bit better. I'd say that what's driving it are 3 factors. First off, as we've seen in the last couple of quarters, existing customers, generally speaking, have been remaining stable, so we haven't had the drag from them reducing headcount. Secondly, we've got the prospects being more willing to take on the new program. Third, I would say that our lost business rates have improved from what we were seeing in late fiscal '09 and '10. And finally, we've been selective in selling business at good prices and making sure that it's good profitable business, and I think that's helped.
J. Hansen: And certainly within that Rental business, our new -- some of our newer product and services are helping too, the Carhartt business, the womenswear garments, the tile and carpet, our chemical business. So we've gotten a broad increase throughout that product line.
Gary Bisbee - Barclays Capital: And maybe I'm being a little cute with the numbers. But in the last few years in the fourth quarter, you've given that mix of business generically within rentals. When I plug those percentages in versus the percentages you gave a year ago, it looks like the Uniform Rental segment really didn't grow. It sort of indicates 1% revenue growth but sort of 14%, 15% for hygiene and dust control actually down a little bit, and then shop towels and linen up significantly, and maybe that's just -- can you give us rounded numbers, does that...
William Gale: That's all it is. We had very nice growth among all our products including the rentals. So I think it's just a rounding issue, Gary.
Gary Bisbee - Barclays Capital: Okay. All right. And then I was curious about the comment that you're confident that pricing will firm. And I think you said will and not has, so is that something you're expecting to help offset some of the commodity cost? How do you have confidence in that?
William Gale: Well, we have confidence in it because I think the impact of these higher costs in commodities, and some of the comments that had been made by some of the competitors in that they're going to have to do something with pricing to offset those cost increases because they're seeing margin deterioration, which we did not see, but they have seen, I think will result in the firming of pricing going forward. So it is an expectation that we're going to see that happening generally across the industry.
Gary Bisbee - Barclays Capital: And then just one last one, if I could. I guess, the revenue growth guidance looks like it's 5% to 7.5% generically for the year. Any willingness to comment on organic, is that mostly organic at this point?.
William Gale: It's almost all organic, Gary. We do not have any anticipated acquisitions in there. We've got a little bit of carryover effect from acquisitions that we made this year, but the bulk of that is organic growth. And we're not real bullish on the economy, we're just cautiously optimistic that we'll see some improvement, but it's not going to be robust. And we've been saying that for the last several quarters, and it's pretty well proved out what our expectations were. But even with a very modestly improving economy, we still expect, we think, nice organic growth.
Operator: Our next question comes from Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan.
Andrew Steinerman - JP Morgan Chase & Co: I want to talk about the share buyback, obviously, it was pretty massive. My question is, what's your proclivity to doing additional share buybacks, meaning authorization? And does the large share buyback indicate anything about activity around acquisitions?
William Gale: The answer to your question, Andrew, is that is going to be certainly a topic of discussion at our board. And I know they will review the success that we had at this program, what we have accomplished this year, which is almost $700 million of buybacks this fiscal year. And I assure -- I'm sure if they are inclined to do so, they may provide us with another authorization and parameters on which to execute that. But that will be decided at the -- I'm sure, at the next couple of board meetings.
Andrew Steinerman - JP Morgan Chase & Co: Right. And, Bill, my other question was, does it speak to anything about acquisitions? What's the company's proclivity towards acquisitions? And obviously the choice of cash has been share buyback.
William Gale: Well, I'd say that the actions give you some indication of what we thought was the best use of our cash and our debt capacity at this time. And that doesn't mean that we are out of the acquisition game, it just means that we felt that this was an opportune time to take advantage of what we thought were good debt markets and an attractive value of our stock. If any acquisitions do come to the table, we will certainly look at them, but they're going to have to meet our hurdle rates, and we're going to have to make sure that they would make sense for our shareholders.
J. Hansen: Andrew, when look we it, we bought the best available company in the last quarter.
Operator: Our next question comes from Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer.
Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc.: Can I just jump back to a response on a prior question. With regard to -- you guys are anticipating gradual improvement in the economy, did you calculate if flat from here, what that would represent with regard to the guidance?
William Gale: It would be the low end of the guidance.
Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc.: Okay. Do you have a margin target that you're targeting, longer-term type of question, at least intermediate term?
William Gale: We're certainly targeting improved margins. Each of our business units and the operations within each units have plans and expectations of what we want them to achieve. And we're not publicly talking about it, but what we have said is that we certainly are moving toward getting back to margins we used to have. And I think we have shown some success in that regard over the last several quarters, and we will hopefully continue that as we go through the next couple of years.
Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc.: One more, if I could. With regard to cotton prices, and thanks for the quantification that you think incrementally, potentially an impact of $15 million. I was a little confused about the $5 million in fiscal '13, is that incremental on top of what you're looking for in '12? And could you just take us a level deeper in how you're thinking about that with regard to the $5 million or $6 million leverage you were thinking about?
J. Hansen: Well, to answer your first question, Scott, the $5 million for fiscal '13 is incremental on top of the less than $15 million in fiscal '12. So because we have that amortization effect, it kind of pushes the full impact of some of the higher prices that we've seen. As it relates to the different factors, we're going to continue to look at all of them. There's a lot that can happen in the next 12 months, particularly as it relates to cotton yields, the demand for cotton. And so we're going to be keeping our eyes on all of those different factors and working to make sure that we minimize the impact going forward.
Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc.: Just curious, I'm going to follow-up there, have you made any major changes with regard to cotton synthetic mix, or anything on your end proactively that's been dramatic?
J. Hansen: We have not at this point. We certainly are always challenging the construction of our garments, but we have not made any significant changes at this point.
Operator: And our next question comes from John Healy with Northcoast Research.
John Healy - Northcoast Research: I wanted to ask about the new sales comment you made, up 20%, again another strong number. I was hoping I can get your thoughts on how much of that you feel is just the market opening up for you guys? And how much of that you think is really a result of activity in some of the initiatives you put forth to kind of stimulate some demand?
William Gale: I'm not sure we can quantify that. I think it's some of both. We've certainly been very successful in the introduction of some of the products that Mike mentioned earlier, the Carhartt products, the women's garments. Some of our standard uniforms are still of a quality better than what our competitors can obtain from their third-party sources, so we think that's helped. I believe some of the additional products that Mike mentioned that are within our Rental division have helped. But there certainly is an improvement in business attitude toward taking on these services. I think we've been able to demonstrate that we're able to provide value that is attractive to many companies as they look to reduce their cost, and they see the value they're getting from what we can do for them. And we've got a very good sales group that has, I think, become more tenured and therefore, have become obviously more productive with the vast array of products that we're offering, as well as the value we're providing. So I think it's all of those factors.
J. Hansen: And when we -- we've talked a little bit about our programmer versus no-programmer numbers. And in the recession, we saw that come down to about a 50-50 level. And we're encouraged that in the last quarter or so, we've seen a movement back towards 60% no programmer to 40% programmer. And I think it speaks to some of the success we've had with our new products and services in really selling the value of those to customers that haven't had a program in the past.
John Healy - Northcoast Research: That's great. I guess, along those same lines too, when you look at kind of the momentum in the business. When you look at it, I guess, maybe over the last 6 to 8 weeks or last 2 months or so, have you noticed any kind of change in tone from the customers though? Has there appeared to be any sort of feedback you're hearing from the sales reps in terms of willingness to spend by the small business customer recently?
William Gale: I don't want to leave that impression. I think, we had a good fourth quarter, it was pretty consistent throughout the quarter. But it really was just building on the momentum we saw earlier in the fiscal year. So we'll see how things go over the next couple of quarters and whether -- we're hopeful that, that trend can continue. And if it is, that certainly would indicate that some of this is caused by better business confidence.
John Healy - Northcoast Research: Got you. And just one last question, and this might have just been me noticing it. But I noticed you guys are marketing the chemicals business a little bit more there. And I was wondering, Bill, if you could shed some light on kind of the scale of that operation today? And is it -- has it been redesigned recently or redeployed or it's just that I'm maybe seeing new ads that I haven't seen before?
William Gale: No, you're right. It has been reinvigorated with a new relationship we now have with Diversey that has given us the ability and the credibility to get into a lot of the markets that Diversey has been successful in the past. And now that we have the service organization, our partnership with them is going to help us in that regard. So we have been increasing our marketing efforts in making it known. And I think that -- you're going to be very pleased with the results that you're going to see in that as we go forward.
John Healy - Northcoast Research: And is that a business that rolled out nationally now or available in most of your large markets?
William Gale: We just completed a rollout nationally within our own sales organization just within the last few weeks. So it's just beginning.
Operator: Our next question will come from Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel, Nicolaus.
Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: I just want to ask a little bit about some of the commentary in the press release about competitors competing on price, while you guys are focusing very much on value. Are you guys at all attempting to push through any pricing increases because of the energy and fuel increases, or how is that working? Are you having those discussions with customers? And are you aware from your discussions with customers if your competitors are having those same discussions?
William Gale: Well, we are certainly reviewing all of our book prices that our sales people use for new business. And we will be certainly making sure that we're covering our cost increases. We are approaching our customers on the renewal dates of the contract, which allows us to increase prices. And we're certainly talking to them about the cost pressures that we have had. And I think what you need to look at is what competitors do show up in their margins versus what shows up in our margins. So I would just advise you to compare among us and you can kind of see who's doing what.
Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. Can you comment a little bit on the floor cleaning business that's kind of nascent is doing, and how's that grown over the quarter?
William Gale: That's the tile and carpet business, and it is growing very well as we continue to roll it across the country. It has a bit of a margin pressure on us, but even with that, you still saw a nice margins in the rental division but it is still relatively small. I mean, it's minuscule in comparison to our Rental business and even into our dust and hygiene business, but we expect it to grow quite nicely throughout the next couple of years. It's just coming from such a low base. It's not really going to impact the overall growth rate for a little while.
Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: And how many markets are you in there now?
William Gale: Shlomo, I don't know. But I would say, it's got to be close to 50 or so.
J. Hansen: Yes, actually, we're in about 90. We're going to be able to service about 90 of the top 100 markets.
Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. And then, last question, in Uniform Direct Sales, we saw as an operating margin that was flat sequentially despite a nice uptick in the sales. Was there a particular infrastructure or sales investment that occurred in that unit in the quarter?
William Gale: No, there wasn't. We had a nice improvement over the third quarter mainly because of the volume. We had a nice fourth quarter last year, and there wasn't a lot of structural change.
Operator: Our next question comes from Nate Brochmann with William Blair & Company.
Dave Brinkman: It's Dave for Nate. I've seen, recently, cotton prices seemed to have fallen off pretty dramatically. Have you guys been following that at all? And if so, any color to add on that as to what you guys think that's causing it to fall off a little bit here recently?
William Gale: Well, we certainly follow it very closely. Our global supply chain group does that. And the things that we read and hear are that the yields from some of the cotton-growing regions, excluding perhaps Texas, which had a big drought but they're very, very good; expectations are high that yields are going to be good. And then secondly, there has been a diminishment of demand throughout the world. There may have been a little bit of hoarding going on back in the fall, but that appears to have dissipated some. And so you're right, the price -- the spot price of cotton has fallen pretty quickly. And we hope that it continues down at those levels. But we're prepared to handle it however it may present itself. Keep in mind, that just because the price drops down for a couple of weeks or a couple months, there's still was a lot of high-priced stock that was put into fabrics and then ultimately into finished goods that's got to work its way through the system.
Dave Brinkman: Right. So this would be more of a 2013 impact, if -- big assumption here, if prices were to stay lower?
William Gale: Well, it would help us as we got into late '12 and '13. And it even starts impacting '14 because of the lead time and the way costs are amortized.
Dave Brinkman: Okay. And then the only one other question I have was in terms of when we look at SG&A, I think in the past, you guys have said it, it takes a sales person anywhere from 6 to 12 months to kind of get on board and get up to speed and become productive. In terms of getting more leverage out of SG&A, what is kind of left in the toolbox there?
William Gale: Well, there's several things left. SG&A is driven by, obviously, improved productivity of our sales force, but also top line growth covers more of the fixed cost. And a lot of the SG&A, especially the G&A is generally fixed cost that will not increase proportionally with increases in revenues, so that will be a plus. We continue to invest in systems and other productivity initiatives within the company, that will be a plus going forward. And it's an area of focus throughout our organization to minimize any increase in our SG&A and yet continue to increase the top line.
Operator: Our next question comes from Greg Halter with Great Lakes Review.
Gregory Halter: On the debt, the 2 pieces there, due in 2016 and '21, were there any swaps used to hedge any of that or convert or anything like that?
William Gale: We did put in place a, I guess, an interest rate block that we put into place in advance. And the cost of that will be amortized as part of the interest expense over the life of the bonds.
Gregory Halter: Okay. You discussed the CapEx, $180 million to $200 million expectations. Just wondered if you had any sort of break out in terms of new facilities for maybe your different segments and so forth?
William Gale: Well, no, we don't break that out, Greg, in detail. We will have new facilities. A lot of the capital expectation is really for growth within existing facilities more than brand-new facilities going forward.
Gregory Halter: Okay. I think this was maybe mentioned earlier on about the acquisitions and so forth. It looked like for the quarter, it was only about $14 million, if my math is correct, and obviously, there's always timing there and willing buyer and willing seller and all that. But just wonder if that was something that you may have not done as much as in the quarter given the buyback and possibly what you're seeing in the market these days?
William Gale: Well, I think, as we said earlier, we thought that we were buying the best thing available by buying ourselves. And so that was the focus that we had in the quarter.
Gregory Halter: Okay. And on the share buyback and the count, I think you mentioned it was just under 130 million shares as of now. And I know that your options between options and restricted stock awards total about $8 million, but most of them are at higher prices, probably $35, $36 and higher, so not many of those will be going into the share count unless the share price continues to do well, which we hope obviously, and I'm sure you do. But I just want to make sure that my take on that is accurate in terms of those exercise prices. And given your guidance, what kind of additional shares you're looking at in terms of going into that diluted share count?
William Gale: Greg, your assumption is correct. Let me ask you to hold off on that until -- we'll be issuing our 10-K, the end of next week. And included in that is a footnote disclosures with all the restricted shares and the option and their prices. But generally speaking, you're absolutely correct. The additional impact is not that significant.
J. Hansen: We will typically plan for, Greg, about 0.5 million shares with just everything that, restricted stock that gets issued and some stock options. But you're right in your assumptions.
Gregory Halter: Okay. And I know for your third quarter, I don't think there was any difference between basic and diluted share count.
William Gale: Correct.
Gregory Halter: Okay. And, Mike, earlier on when you were discussing the Uniform Rental business, and you gave those percentages of 51% in 2012, 6% in '11 for the 5 different areas within Uniform Rental. I believe you mentioned that was of the segment total, not of the company total. And I just wanted to make sure to clarify that.
J. Hansen: Yes, that's correct.
Gregory Halter: Okay. So those percentages would be less as a percentage of the total.
J. Hansen: Yes.
Gregory Halter: So there would not a shift or a big shift as maybe one of the callers may have asked about earlier.
J. Hansen: Correct, yes. So when I mentioned, I believe it was Uniform Rental of 51%, that's 51% of the 70% of the Rental segment.
Gregory Halter: Which works out to about 36% of the total?
J. Hansen: You're right.
Gregory Halter: Okay. And you've discussed the pricing, just wonder if you have any commentary on what percentage-type increase may be contemplated?
J. Hansen: No, we do not -- we're not willing to disclose that right now.
Gregory Halter: All right. I thought I'd give you a chance. Your European business looks like it's about $50 million on an annual basis now, if my math is correct. Just wonder what your goals and aspirations are for that particular area?
William Gale: Well, right now, our focus is to work with what we have. We've got presence in 4 countries over there. We've got very good businesses that we acquired, great management teams. And while we would not, not look at another acquisition, I don't think there would be anything significant at this time. It might be some fill-ins for some services that we may not be providing in one particular area that we'd like to have, to complement what we've got. But right now, I think the main emphasis in fiscal '12 is to improve the margins and to grow those businesses.
Gregory Halter: Okay. And one last one, if I could. I think though, a while back, maybe a year ago, you bought a door business. And I know you get into these businesses just to see how they're going to perform as maybe an incubator. Just wonder if you could provide any thoughts in regard to that particular area?
William Gale: Yes, it was more than just a door business, it's facility services, and it primarily services the retail and commercial industries. That acquisition was made last fall, late fall. It has performed very well. We're continuing to tweak it. And right now, we're very pleased with the results as we incorporate it into our other facilities service offerings.
Operator: Our next question comes from Justin Hauke with Robert W. Baird.
Justin Hauke - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated: Just 2 very quick ones here. First, I guess was just curious, you talked a lot about the buyback, but how are you guys thinking about the dividend here with the authorization being spent? Is there a chance to maybe the dividend is going to become a more meaningful part of your shareholder returns going forward? And also, I noticed that you shifted the timing of when the dividend's normally paid. And just curious if it's going to continue to be end of calendar year dividend?
William Gale: Justin, my expectation is that the timing of the payment of the dividend will continue to occur just like it did last year, where we accelerated the payment from March into December. As far as the amount of the dividend, I think, again, that I have to differ is that will be a decision made by the board. Typically, now under the new time frame, that would be contemplated and made at the October time frame by the board. I would like to also tell you that we've increased the dividend every year since we went public in 1983. And so I'm sure the board will factor the share buyback, the expectations for future results, as well as the results from the previous year when they make the decision on what to declare.
Justin Hauke - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated: Fair enough. And my last question is a little bit of a clarification, but with the numbers you gave, it would seem like your Hygiene business is actually the same size as your Document Management business? Something like $320 million in annual revenue. And just curious if there's any chance that we might start to see that segment broken out separately?
J. Hansen: Justin, one of the issues we have with breaking that business out separately is that much of it is on the same route as either a facilities services mat route, or in some cases, on a uniform route. And so we have some difficulty in coming up with the specific product line results, and so that's the difficulty right now. We will certainly continue to look at it. And if it becomes feasible, we'll think about breaking that out.
Justin Hauke - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated: Sure. Is that correct though, that it's about the same size as the Document Management business?
J. Hansen: It's probably a little bit less than that, than the Document Management business.
Operator: Our next question comes from Gary Bisbee with Barclays Capital.
Gary Bisbee - Barclays Capital: Just one quick follow-up which is, within the Facility Services businesses in general, can you give us a sense of what your margin goals or targets are and what those businesses are doing? I know you'll say this is a bad comparison, but I look at something like ABM, which is in janitorial services and their margin is less than half what yours is. And so how do you think about the profitability of that business?
William Gale: Gary, the profitability of the Facility Services business is comparable to the overall profitability that we report in rental. It really depends a lot on different markets. But I think you can make the assumption that Facility Services business will have margins pretty similar to what we obtain in our Garment business, Garment Rental business.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And we'll go back to Shlomo Rosenbaum.
Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: One more question. I just want to ask about your inventory. I know you guys have been stocking a little bit because of the SAP implementation. I want to know if there are milestones or times in the next year that we should be looking to, which afterwards you guys will feel comfortable if it goes well to bring the inventory levels back down a bit?
William Gale: We have a plan, Shlomo, internally that we hope to start reducing those inventory levels, all else being equal, as we proceed through fiscal '12. So hopefully, we'll be able to demonstrate that we can reduce those inventories back to more appropriate levels in line with our revenues as we proceed throughout '12.
Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: And is there an inventory DSO that you guys feel comfortable with? Or how should I think about that?
William Gale: Well, we certainly have targets, but it's very complicated because we have inventory that ranges from raw fabric to in-process inventory to finished goods in all of our different businesses. And we certainly have individual goals and expectations as a result of that. But for me to just give you a general number, there is so much different stuff in there. It wouldn't be meaningful, and I really would not want to start providing that on an ongoing basis.
Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. So just in terms of the SAP milestones, are there any key milestones going on over the next, over the year that we should be looking towards?
William Gale: As far as the conversion to the global supply chain or SAP in general?
Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Well, I understand that there's -- the SAP implementation, there are different aspects to it, so there are different points in time that you guys are going to be measuring success. And I just wanted to know because I know that those things tend to be complicated and can bring some repercussions throughout the rest of the business.
William Gale: Yes, we are working right now, Shlomo, on implementing SAP at a couple of our different business units. And we will begin converting those later this fall and through the winter on kind of a very measured basis. We'll do some of the operations each month. So as we get later into fiscal '12, we'll be able to report to you on how well we're doing with that, and is it going according to plan. We're still in the final testing and design phase -- or the final testing phase is right now. And hopefully, we'll start some pilot implementations here in the next few months. And then if those are successful, then we'll start rolling out on a more aggressive basis as we complete the year.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And at this time, we have no other questions from the phones.
William Gale: Well, I want to thank everyone for joining us. We're very pleased with these results, and we are very happy with the momentum that our company has achieved here over the last several quarters. We look forward to an even better results as we move into fiscal '12, so we look forward to talking to you again in September, late September when we release our first quarter results.
Operator: And this concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation.

===== 2011 Q3  (2011-03-23 17:00:00) =====

Operator: Good day, everyone and welcome to the Cintas Quarterly Earnings Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Mr. Bill Gale, Senior Vice President of Finance and Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead, sir.
William Gale: Good evening, and thank you for joining us to discuss our third quarter fiscal 2011 results. With me today is Mike Hansen, Cintas' Vice President and Treasurer. After some comments on the quarter's results, we will open the call to questions. For the quarter ending February 28, 2011, total revenue was $938 million, an 8.8% increase from the third quarter of fiscal 2010. Earnings per share were $0.41 versus $0.32 a year ago.  As provided in our press release, we are updating our guidance for the fiscal year ending May 31, 2011. We now expect total revenues to be between $3.75 billion and $3.77 billion, and our total earnings per share to be in the range of $1.60 to $1.63. This guidance takes into consideration our expectation that energy costs will pressure margins in our fourth quarter. We will not be providing guidance for our fiscal year ending May 31, 2012, until we release our fourth quarter 2011 results in mid-July.  We are pleased to see continuing improvement in our revenues among all four of our reportable segments. As mentioned in our release, we ramped up the investment in our sales force in last year's third quarter because we saw signs of stabilization in the U.S. economy. We also expected a slow employment recovery. And we wanted to create revenue momentum by not only increasing our sales force, but also by having the sales force focus on added penetration at existing customers. As we look one year later, we are pleased with the momentum created and with the improvement in our sales productivity. This improved sales productivity, coupled with the stabilization of the economy, have now given Cintas four consecutive quarters of increasing total and organic revenue growth beginning with our fiscal 2010 fourth quarter. While we continue to see a general reluctance on the part of our customers to add employees, on a positive note, they continue to replace employees and large force -- workforce reductions are minimal. The higher revenue levels, along with ongoing cost control efforts at Cintas, have helped drive margin improvement despite the higher energy costs and the fewer workdays in our third quarter than the prior two quarters this fiscal year. These recent energy cost increases, if they continue, will pressure margins going forward. While not significantly affecting this fiscal year, continued elevated cotton costs could impact fiscal year 2012 results. We will discuss this impact further during our discussion of fiscal 2012 guidance in July. Our balance sheet remains strong. Total net debt to capitalization is 25%. In December, we paid our annual dividend of $0.49 per share, the 28th consecutive year in which the dividend was increased dating back to 1983, the year we went public.  The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides the safe harbor from civil litigation for forward-looking statements. This conference call contains forward-looking statements that reflect the company's current views as to future events and financial performance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those we may discuss. I refer you to the discussion on these points contained in our most recent filings with the SEC. I will now turn the call over to Mike Hansen.
Michael Hansen: Thank you, Bill. Before discussing the quarter in more detail, please note that our fiscal 2011 workdays are the same as last year. That means there were 64 in the third quarter and there will be 66 in the fourth quarter. As a planning note for fiscal 2012, our workdays will be as follows: 66 in the first quarter, 65 in the second quarter, 65 in the third quarter and 66 in the fourth quarter. As Bill mentioned, total revenue increased 8.8% from the third quarter of last year with total company organic growth being 5.5%. We have four reportable operating segments: Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products; Uniform Direct Sales; First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection Services; and Document Management Services. Uniform Direct Sales, First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection Services and Document Management Services are combined and presented as other services on the face of the income statement. The Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products operating segment consists of the rental and servicing of uniforms, mats, towels and other related items. This segment also includes restroom supplies and other facility products and services.  Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products revenue accounted for 71% of company revenue in the third quarter. Rental revenue was $665 million for the quarter, which is up 6.8% compared to last year's third quarter. Organic growth was 4.3% over last year, which is an improvement from last quarter's organic growth of 1.9%. As mentioned earlier, our sales productivity continued to improve this quarter, both in new business opportunities and in customer penetration. We have also seen our account retention improve. Our Uniform Direct Sales operating segment includes the direct sale of uniforms, branded promotional products and other related products to national and regional customers. Uniforms and other related products are also sold to local customers, including products sold to rental customers through our direct sale catalog. Uniform Direct Sales revenue accounted for 11% of company revenue in the third quarter. Third quarter revenue of $102.6 million represents an increase of 8.7% compared to last year's third quarter. Organic growth was also 8.7%. Our growth in this segment continued to be broad-based in which we saw rental catalog revenue, national account revenue, and lodging, hospitality and gaming revenue increase nicely. Our First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection Services operating segment includes revenue from the sale and servicing of First Aid products, Safety products and training and Fire Protection products. First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection revenue accounted for 10% of company revenue in the third quarter. During the quarter, revenues within this operating segment were $91.2 million, an increase of 15.1% versus last year's third quarter. Organic growth was 9.3%, up from the second quarter organic growth rate of 8.4%. Sales productivity has continued to improve and customer spending in this space has also picked up. Our Document Management Services operating segment includes document destruction, storage and imaging services. Document Management accounted for 8% of third quarter total company revenue. Revenue increased to 20.3% over last year's third quarter to $79.1 million with organic growth of 7.8%. Recycled paper prices remained at relatively high levels. However, we have now anniversaried the high paper prices. The Document Management growth rate in total now more closely resembles the impact of new customers and higher customer volume levels. Moving on to margins. Total company gross margin for the third quarter was 41.8%, which is in line with last year's third quarter gross margin of 41.7%. Energy-related costs were up 10 basis points compared to last year's third quarter. The gross margin of 41.8% increased slightly compared to the 41.7% gross margin for the second quarter despite having one less workday in the third quarter and despite a 40 basis point increase in energy-related costs compared to the second quarter. Sequentially through this third quarter, our energy-related costs did increase to fairly high levels by the end of the quarter. After being at 3% in our first two quarters this fiscal year, our third quarter energy-related costs as a percent of revenue were 3.4% and reached as high as 3.6% during the quarter. As Bill mentioned, these costs could continue to run at high levels and could negatively impact our fourth quarter earnings. The updated guidance in our press release considered this impact. Rental gross margin of 42.8% was up 10 basis points from last year's third quarter. Material cost has increased due to the injection of new garments during this fiscal year. The injection of new garments has increased due to our higher new business levels including many new Carhartt and Flame Resistant Clothing accounts. This higher material cost is more than offset though by lower production and service costs as a percent of revenue due to improved capacity utilization from the higher volumes. The rental gross margin of 42.8% was also an increase from the 42.6% in our second fiscal quarter. This improvement comes despite one less workday in the third quarter and an increase of 30 basis points in energy-related costs. As just mentioned, material cost increases were more than offset by improved capacity utilization due to higher volumes. Other services gross margin was 39.3% for the quarter as compared to 39.2% in last year's third quarter. First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection gross margin improved significantly due to a better mix of higher-margin revenue and improved capacity utilization. Uniform Direct Sales gross margin was relatively flat compared to last year. And Document Management Services gross margin decreased from 52.7% in last year's third quarter to 49.4% in this year's third quarter. This decrease is mainly due to our U.S.-based storage and imaging business. Our storage business had several greenfield starts this fiscal year. While these startups are operating as planned, they do generate losses in the first year of operation. In addition, our imaging services business, which is primarily a project-based business, began ramping up for several large fourth quarter projects. And finally, energy-related costs in this business segment increased 65 basis points compared to last year. Selling and administrative expenses in the third quarter were 30.2% of revenue, a decrease from 32% in last year's third quarter and also a decrease from 30.8% in this year's second fiscal quarter. As we discussed, our sales force productivity has improved over the course of the past year since we increased our investment in last year's third quarter. In addition, we continue to look for ways of controlling administrative expenses. As a result, our third quarter selling and administrative expenses have only increased 2.7% year-over-year, while our revenue has grown 8.8%. Our effective tax rate was 38.9% for the quarter compared to 32.8% last year. Due to the timing of specific reserve builds and releases, our effective tax rate can fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter. We expect our fiscal 2011 effective tax rate to be approximately 37%.  Our cash and marketable securities were $217 million at February 28, a decrease of $68 million from November 30, 2010. This decrease is mainly due to the $72 million payment of our annual dividend in December. Accounts receivable increased by $14 million since November 30, primarily because of the higher revenue levels. DSOs on accounts receivable remained at 40, the same as at November 30.  New goods inventory at February 28 was $232 million, up $24 million from November 30. We converted our global supply chain to the SAP system in our third quarter, and that conversion has gone as planned. In anticipation of this conversion, we intentionally built up inventory levels prior to the conversion. We expect the added inventory related to this conversion to burn off over the next six months. Uniforms and other rental items in service increased by $9 million from November 30 to February 28 due to the higher volume levels throughout the third quarter. Accrued liabilities decreased $101 million compared to November 30 due to the $72 million accrual of the dividend, which was paid on December 15, and decreased accrued bond interest.  Long-term debt at February 28 was $808 million. Our average rate on the outstanding debt is approximately 6%. Total debt as a percentage of total book capitalization was 25%, while net debt, or long-term debt less cash and marketable securities as a percentage of total capitalization, was 19%. Turning to our cash flow. Cash provided by operating activities was $99 million for the third quarter, a decrease from $135 million in last year's third quarter. Last year's cash flow benefited from lower working capital needs associated with our decreasing volumes. This year, the increasing revenue levels have increased our working capital needs such as increased inventory levels and higher accounts receivable balances. The third quarter cash provided by operating activities of $99 million was an increase over the second quarter's $74 million. CapEx for the third quarter was $54 million. Our CapEx by operating segment was as follows: $33 million in Rental; $1 million in Uniform Direct Sales; $6 million in First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection; and $14 million in Document Management. We expect CapEx for the fiscal year to be in the range of $170 million to $180 million.  We invested $70 million in the third quarter on strategic acquisitions. This includes acquisitions in our Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products operating segment, our Document Management operating segment and our First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection Services operating segment. We will continue to evaluate acquisition candidates as opportunities arise.  That concludes our prepared remarks, and we will now take any of your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And we'll go first to Andrew Wittman with Baird.
Andrew Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated: I just wanted to just get a little clarity on some of the assumptions behind the guidance. Looks like the midpoint's about a 5% -- 5.5-maybe-percent organic growth rate, which would be about consistent with what we saw in the third quarter. Does that seem about right to you?
William Gale: Well, it seems about right. Here's our concern, and I would say we expected some of you to think maybe we were a little conservative on this. But our concern is in the energy cost arena, not only how it impacts our margins but how it might impact our customers. So we are forecasting continued growth on the top line. But given the uncertainty in the energy markets, as well as in the other issues going on around the world, we felt it prudent to be somewhat conservative in our view of the revenue.
Andrew Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated: I see. And just in terms of the margins, thanks for the clarity. It sounds like you are anywhere between 3.4% and 3%, and as high as 3.6%, I guess. Given that, I mean, today, where are we on that spectrum? Are we still kind of 40 basis points over the first two quarters at that 3.4% level? I just want to try to get a handle of what that -- what you're implying on that.
William Gale: We're running at that 3.5% to 3.7% level right now. And if you think about the way that the energy impacts as we did some calculations and basically for every 50 basis points of energy costs, that's about $0.02 a share for us. So we're projecting energy costs will, at best, stay at these elevated levels, but likely could go even higher depending on what happens.
Andrew Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated: Okay, great. And then just in terms of the operating environment, it sounded -- last quarter, it sounds like pretty similar to this quarter in terms of add/stops at existing customers. Is that fair? And is it also fair to assume then that it's still what you call the, I guess, new storefronts, new customers and further penetration in existing customers that's really driving that organic growth?
William Gale: That's primarily correct, a little bit better results in lost business too, Andy. But, yes, basically, we're seeing new business continuing to be pretty good. And fortunately, customers when they lose employees are replacing those employees. So they're just not -- there's not a lot of adds or additions to our customers' headcounts.
Operator: And we'll go next to Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan.
Andrew Steinerman - JP Morgan Chase & Co: Given the commodity changes that are going on here and your end customer must be sensitive to them as well, have you considered a fuel surcharge currently? And would you consider a cotton surcharge to your customers prospectively?
William Gale: Andrew, we don't really have a fuel surcharge per se. We have a service charge. And we have been adjusting that service charge when we can with our customers to try to overcome some of these additional costs. Sometimes, that is not feasible, but we're doing our best to do that.
Andrew Steinerman - JP Morgan Chase & Co: Right. But do you feel like your customers are sensitive to this matter? When you come to them and everyone knows what the price of oil is, and you're starting that discussion now with that talking point. It just seems like, hey, this is kind of a national situation. Do you feel like it's a grind to get it through? Or your customers realize that service charge, it includes higher oil prices and gas prices, should naturally ebb up?
William Gale: Well, Andrew, I would say it all depends on what our customers are able to do with their prices. If they are running into difficulty in raising their prices, they're very reluctant to allow any increase in their own costs. So it really just comes down to what the individual customer is able to do in the markets that they serve.
Andrew Steinerman - JP Morgan Chase & Co: Okay. And the reason why cotton doesn't hit you until later in the calendar year is because you have an inventory?
Michael Hansen: That's a big part of it, Andrew. When the prices of cotton started to escalate, that didn't mean that, that was going to hit us immediately. We still had a cotton fabric inventory that runs through our supply chain and goes through our distribution center before it gets to our operations. And only then do we see some impact of it. And in our Rental business, it starts to amortize at that point. So it is not a significant impact for some period of time.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Gary Bisbee with Barclays Capital.
Gary Bisbee - Barclays Capital: I guess a couple of questions. When you talk about, in the Rentals business, increased penetration of the customers rather than -- and I guess new customer growth rather than employment growth going up, can you give us a couple examples of what increased penetration -- I mean is that literally, I've been doing uniforms and now I'm doing floor mats, or I've been doing uniforms and floor mats, now I'm also cleaning their restrooms. What are some examples of the stuff you're penetrating?
William Gale: Well, those items that you mentioned are certainly examples. In addition to that, we have a full spectrum of hygiene services for restrooms. We have chemical dispensing units. We're doing tile and carpet cleaning. So all of these different facility services businesses that we have gone into, we're able to sell those to many of our existing customers. And as Mike mentioned in his remarks, we began to utilize our professional sales force to assist our service organization in penetrating these customers with these additional products and services. And that has been successful.
Gary Bisbee - Barclays Capital: Have you give -- given that it sounds like this is becoming a much more material business, have you given any thought to splitting it out within your segment results, the facility services?
William Gale: Yes, we are. We are looking at that. It is difficult right now to do that on the cost side because they're housed in the same physical facility as the Uniform Rental business. There would be a lot of allocations that would have to be made and it adds a lot of complexity to our financial system. But it is certainly something that we're going to continue to look at. And when it's feasible to do so, I would say that we will start splitting that stuff out. I just don't know when that will be.
Gary Bisbee - Barclays Capital: Okay, great. On the SG&A, I guess I was surprised it actually dropped by $5 million or so. You mentioned cost savings. Is there anything in particular that's been real helpful there? Or was there also any sort of one-time issues that you had -- you didn't spend on that you might expect to?
William Gale: There were no one-time items. I think a lot of it is the attitude that the company management has taken that we had to control costs. And we began doing that some time ago. We did get slightly lower medical costs, which did help. But offsetting that by a much greater extent were the fact we had all the payroll taxes reset in January. I think it's the higher revenues where we're -- as I told you before, we can leverage these costs once we get the revenue line growing again. And that was demonstrated in this quarter. But it really comes down to just a lot of effort on the part of all the partners at Cintas just watching every dollar they spend.
Michael Hansen: Part of that $5 million decrease you mentioned, Gary, from the second quarter to the third quarter is also just simply due to one less workday. So there's one less payroll day in the quarter.
Gary Bisbee - Barclays Capital: Okay, that makes sense. And then just one last one if I could. I realize you'll laugh. I'm going back what feels like many, many years. But in Q1 of 2006, you actually gave us your energy breakdown. You said natural gas was 31%, electricity was 28%, I think diesel was -- gasoline and diesel were the rest. Can you give us a sense, is that changed a lot? Or is that still a reasonable mix to think about in terms of the different energy components?
William Gale: Much of the increase in energy that we've recently seen is the gas and diesel. And the gas and diesel is about 60% of the total energy costs today.
Gary Bisbee - Barclays Capital: Okay, great. That's helpful. But natural gas, which has actually been falling somewhat recently at least, is still 30% or so, is still a reasonable number for that one?
William Gale: Yes.
Operator: We'll go next to John Healy with Northcoast Research.
John Healy - Northcoast Research: Bill, I had a question on the SG&A line for you. This is one of the first quarters in a while where we've seen revenues really accelerate beyond the SG&A line. And I was hoping to get your thoughts if we've now reached an inflection point with the company where you've increased your headcount on the sales side and you're positioned to grow. And is it safe to assume that, maybe as we head through 2012 and maybe for a bit longer, that we should see revenues accelerate at a decent clip beyond what your growth in SG&A will be for a while? Or are you guys at a point where you feel comfortable seeing that in the business?
William Gale: Well, I would answer that question a cautious yes, John, assuming that there is not any unusual spikes in like medical expenses, unusual legal expenses we might run into or something like that. So those things that we can control, I would say your assumption is correct.
John Healy - Northcoast Research: Okay, great. And then I wanted to ask you on the M&A front, with the business now turning quite nicely and the balance sheet being as solid as it is and the cash flow that you guys are able to produce, I mean, is there any thought of maybe becoming a little bit more aggressive with looking at larger type acquisitions either on the emerging businesses or the Uniform side? Or any thoughts about maybe beginning to use the balance sheet in ways or maybe to drive a little bit more shareholder value in terms of maybe looking at a bigger buyback or looking at a way to deploy capital a bit more aggressively?
William Gale: I'd say the answer to your question is yes to all of those.
John Healy - Northcoast Research: I guess from an acquisition standpoint, I mean, is there a priority right now? Are you looking at things that are more to the core Uniform side? Or would you prefer to look at things that are more on the emerging business unit side right now?
William Gale: One of the priorities, we've talked about this, is certainly to obtain a national footprint in some of the emerging businesses, so that has continued. And as far as the other opportunities, we'll look at them as they present themselves and the value that they would create for the shareholders, the risk that they would involve, what type of returns that they would generate for the company. And I don't think we would necessarily be biased against anything except probably direct sale business, which we don't really see a lot of value in an acquisition for but -- because we like the more service type ongoing businesses. But we are certainly open to looking at different things, and we're doing that.
Operator: We'll go next to Vance Edelson with MS SB.
Vikram Malhorta: This is for Vikram in for Vance with Morgan Stanley. Just wanted to get a little more color. You mentioned sort of going into next year, cotton could be an issue. I'm just sort of wondering, could you sort of break it out between how you'd view it in the Rental business right now? Amortization could hit in next year. And how you'd think of it on the direct sales business?
William Gale: We would prefer at this time to defer any real discussion on cotton until we have greater visibility with what's going to happen in the cotton market and as we put our plans together. So we'll have to defer those questions until July.
Vikram Malhorta: Okay and then in terms of the -- you mentioned that you do have inventory obviously, which is why it's not hit. Could you just give us some sense of how and at what point you are in the process of replenishing?
William Gale: No, we're not going to talk about that right now.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer.
Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc.: Just a quickie follow-up on the cotton question. Presumably, the costs remain elevated, what are some things internally you're considering? I think it was asked, surcharges, but are you considering changing the mix? Any thoughts you can give on that, just in a hypothetical, if it were to remain elevated?
William Gale: Well, Scott, since so many things can happen from now until the end of the next growing season, we would rather defer those discussions until July. And we'll be a little bit more prepared to talk about the impact on next year and some of the things that we plan to do about it.
William Gale: Scott, we may be working on some things that we really don't want to disclose publicly either.
Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc.: Okay, fair enough. Switching over to your sales force, it's been about a year now since you started bulking up. Could you, I guess, speak to productivity, speed of productivity? It sounds like with you're happy with what you're seeing. But just remind us how quickly new staff gets up to the level you'd like to see? What your plans are for increasing or potentially decreasing from here? And if the fact that we've anniversaried is having any impact on the cost line, as I imagine is variable, but just any thoughts there?
William Gale: Well, we're very happy with the productivity. We believe our sales force and our sales management team have done an excellent job of focusing their resources in the right area and we're seeing the results in the top line. We continually evaluate the appropriate size of the sales force, and we will continue to do that as we assess what the market potential is and what opportunities are out there. So right now, I would say it's an ongoing look at things. We're not going to signal to our competitors what we're going to do with our sales force, therefore, we can't really talk about it publicly. But I think we are very pleased with what we're seeing as the results of the actions that were taken about a year ago. Keep in mind, it generally takes a salesperson somewhere between six and 12 months to achieve appropriate productivity. And obviously the more tenured they are, the typically the more productive they are. It does vary by business unit. The Rental Uniform business tends to be the longest cycle, but we do have a ramp up in all of our businesses.
Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc.: Okay, thanks. So then there is benefit now that you're hitting that maturity phase, and that's what we're seeing with regard to the leverage in the business, presumably?
William Gale: That's part of it, right.
Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc.: Okay, thanks. And then just could you speak one final question on the competitive environment pricing particularly in Rental. Any change from what you've seen? My understanding, just to set what I mean is, it sounds like it is still quite competitive out there. But just any indication what you can talk about quarter-over-quarter?
William Gale: Scott, I think we have seen a, I guess, a firming up of the pricing environment a little bit. I think many of our competitors have realized that some of the low prices that they were offering to help keep their plants and routes as full as they could during the downturn are going to come back to haunt them, especially now that it does that we're seeing cost increases in a number of areas. And keep in mind that cotton increases are probably going to hit our competitors much quicker and much more heavily than it necessarily will hit us. Energy costs are probably a little bit more heavier on some of our competitors than us because of the route density. So I think that we are pleased to be able to say that pricing has firmed up a bit from what it was.
Operator: We'll take our next question from James Sanford with Citigroup.
James Sanford - Merrill Lynch: I just wanted to touch on -- I know it's still early days post-Japan. But since you have exposure to manufacturing, I'm wondering if you're starting to hear any feedback from your channel about slowdowns due to supply chain, whether it's temporary shutdowns or anything like that? Are you worried about that having an impact in your business at all?
William Gale: No, we haven't see any of that, James.
James Sanford - Merrill Lynch: Okay. As far as buybacks are concerned, maybe I missed it, but any thoughts on how you're thinking about buybacks going forward? I know you didn't buy any this quarter. Is that sort of something you expect to put back in place next quarter?
William Gale: I really can't say when that will be happening. I can tell you that the board talks about it continuously and looks at the alternatives we have, and will certainly gave us the opportunity to another authorization back at the late October. So we did $200 million just six months ago and we'll continue to assess it.
James Sanford - Merrill Lynch: Great. I guess one final one. I guess most recent acquisition is in the Document Management space. Is that sort of where you're concentrating some of your efforts? Should we think about that as obviously structurally lower-margin business? But as the rest of the business ramps up, should you more than offset some of that structural margin decline?
William Gale: Well, James, that acquisition that was announced was more of a marketing issue. It was a relatively small acquisition. We made acquisitions in all of our businesses with the exception of Uniform Direct Sales this past quarter. The Document Management business is actually very good margin business. It's just that so much of it is in its infancy and the size and the amount of sales cost continues to be invested in it. Mature Document Management operations though generate very good margins comparable to the Rental business.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Christopher McGinnis with Sidoti & Company.
Christopher McGinnis - Sidoti & Company, LLC: Was weather -- was there an impact of weather at all in the quarter?
William Gale: I thought it would have more of an impact than it ended up having. Part of the reason that it didn't impact us as much was the fact that we've converted many of our businesses to 4-day routes. So even when operations were forced to shut down in some of the cities, especially in the northeast, they were able to make up the majority of that volume. So by and large, weather was not a significant factor to us.
Christopher McGinnis - Sidoti & Company, LLC: And then just on the M&A front, has anything changed in the Rental, at least in the rental market environment? I guess maybe the valuations come down at all?
William Gale: No, they really haven't. I'd say the beneficial thing though is that with stabilization in the economy, potential acquisition targets aren't continuing to shrink like they were. So there's a little bit more of certainty if one were to decide to buy one of those companies.
Christopher McGinnis - Sidoti & Company, LLC: And I know you've answered this in the past. And I don't know if this -- I don't think the question's been posed in a few quarters. But of the large operators out there, I think you responded that you felt that you could get an FTC approval. Is that past? Do you feel that you can still do that to acquire a larger -- one of the larger operators on the Rental side?
William Gale: Chris, I'd hate to predict what Washington may decide to do. Until you present the facts, it would be tough for me to speculate.
Christopher McGinnis - Sidoti & Company, LLC: And then just on the growth on the Rental side in the quarter itself, is there a component of taking share from some of the other players in that? Maybe even just a little bit -- I mean that was a little bit stronger than I expected. And was it more just end market demand on the services? Or could you maybe just dig into that a little bit more?
Michael Hansen: Well, I will say that the Rental growth for the quarter was a pretty broad improvement. In other words, we had a garment growth. We had facility services growth throughout our different products and services. But honestly, we don't have the information this quickly to be able to tell what was no program or versus taking share.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We'll go next to Gary Bisbee with Barclays Capital.
Gary Bisbee - Barclays Capital: Yes, just one quick follow-up. Have you set a sort of an IRR hurdle rate for what you're expecting to earn in the Document Management business? I just noticed that the CapEx there has been significant in relation to revenue, and I wonder how you're thinking about benchmarking that investment?
William Gale: Gary, generally, as we've always said, our hurdle rates typically are 15%. Now, there will be certain acquisitions that we might accept a slightly lower hurdle rate in going into in order to do something on a strategic basis. But our review of acquisitions in Document Management are no different than they were in Uniform Rental. But they typically have to have those hurdle rates.
Gary Bisbee - Barclays Capital: And what about internal investment, though, the CapEx being as high as it is, are you confident you'll earn that over time?
William Gale: Oh, yes. We have the same criteria on CapEx, and, yes, that's all baked in to the analysis. Keep in mind much of what you're seeing now is the investment in these businesses to grow them, just like what we did at Cintas in the Uniform Rental business in the 1980s and early '90s.
Gary Bisbee - Barclays Capital: And can you give us a sense within the Document Management, how much of this investment to date has been storage? A year ago, you were telling us you didn't really like the storage business, at least relative to just the shredding business. But I get the sense from a few press releases here and there, that might be changing. Is that fair? Is a lot of that incremental CapEx this year in storage? Or is it buying more trucks to do more?
William Gale: We're still focusing primarily on the shredding side.
Gary Bisbee - Barclays Capital: Okay. All right. So that would be trucks and other facilities, I guess?
William Gale: Yes, as Mike mentioned, we have started up some selective storage operations in different parts of the country that we have -- we believe an opportunity to have a significant return in value. So it's not like we're -- I wouldn't characterize we don't like the storage industry. What we do is we prefer the shredding industry and then selectively look at storage locations.
Operator: And with that, we have no further questions in queue. I'd like to turn it back over to Mr. Gale for any additional or closing comments.
William Gale: Thank you all very much for joining us today. And as we mentioned earlier, we will be announcing our fourth quarter results in July, probably mid-July. So thank you again.
Operator: That does conclude today's call. Thank you for your participation.

===== 2011 Q2  (2010-12-22 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Cintas quarterly earnings results conference call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Bill Gale, Senior Vice President of Finance and Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead, sir.
Bill Gale: Good evening and thank you for joining us. With me today is Mike Hansen, Cintas' Vice President and Treasurer. After some comments on the quarter's results, we will open the call to questions. For the quarter ending November 30, 2010, total revenue was $936.6 million, an increase of almost 6% compared to the second quarter last year. Organic growth was 4.2%. As noted in the release, revenue in all of our business segments grew over last year, with rates even better in Rental, and First Aid, and Safety and Fire than what we saw in the first quarter of this fiscal year. We also saw improved revenue per work day of 3% compared to our first quarter results. Net income was $55.9 million and earnings per diluted share were $0.38. Our tax rate in the second quarter was 38.3% versus 30.8% in our first quarter. The first quarter tax rate reflected the release of certain tax reserves, resulting from the resolution of several tax audits. As we mentioned in our first quarter call, we expected the tax rate to be higher in the second through fourth quarters. While unemployment continues to be stubbornly high, we are encouraged that business confidence has appeared to turn the corner. We have seen the third consecutive quarter of increased wears in our uniform rental business and our direct sale business posted another good growth quarter. Our emerging businesses are First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection and Document Management had good revenue increases also. We continue to reiterate the guidance we've provided at the beginning of the fiscal year and updated at the end of the first quarter for the share buyback. We expect our revenues to be between $3.55 billion and $3.75 billion and our earnings per share to be between $1.55 and $1.63. Our financial condition remains very strong, while we did use approximately $200 million of our U.S. cash to purchase our stock. We still have sufficient borrowing capacity, as well as sufficient cash outside the U.S. to fund our growth initiatives. The board of directors also gave us another $500 million share authorization in late October, to be used as directed by the board if market conditions warrant. None of that authorization has been used as of this time. Cintas paid its annual dividend of $0.49 per share on December 15, approximately three months earlier than our traditional March date. The dividend was increased from the $0.48 paid last year, the 28th consecutive year we have increased our annual dividend since we went public in 1983. The last couple of years have been very difficult for the U.S. economy with the loss of millions of jobs, while it could take some time for employment to return to pre-recession levels. We are encouraged by some of the positive signs that are appearing. Generally speaking, our customers businesses have stabilized their work forces and appear to be on the verge of modestly expanding. We also are very appreciative of the efforts of all of our employees, who we call partners, who made it their mission to take care of our customers and to continue to keep Cintas profitable and cash flow positive during the difficult past few years. We see growth opportunities with all of our business segments. We believe that with the growth as well as the ongoing productivity initiatives underway in the company, we will continue to see margin improvement and positive operating cash flow. The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a Safe Harbor from civil litigation for forward-looking statements. This conference call contains forward-looking statements that reflect the company's current views as to future events and financial performance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those we may discuss. I refer you to the discussion on these points contained in our most recent flings with the SEC. I will now turn the call over to Mike Hansen.
Mike Hansen: Thank you, Bill. Total revenue for the second quarter of fiscal 2011 was $936.6 million, representing a 5.9% increase from the second quarter of last year. Total company internal growth was 4.2%, an increase from the 2.8% internal growth in our first quarter. Each operating segment's revenue grew compared to last year, both in total and organically. Before discussing the quarter in more detail, please note that our fiscal 2011 work days are the same as last year. That means there were 65 days in the second quarter and there will be 64 in Q3, and 66 in Q4. We have four reportable operating segments, Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products, Uniform Direct Sales, First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection Services and Document Management Services. Uniform Direct Sales and First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection Services and Document Management Services are combined and presented as Other Services on the face of the income statement. The Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products operating segment consists of the rental and serving of uniforms, mats, towels and other related items. The segment also includes restroom supplies and other facility products and services. Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products revenue accounted for 70% of company revenue in the second quarter. Rental revenue was $657.8 million for the quarter, which is up 2.2% compared to last year's second quarter. Internal growth was 1.9% over last year, which is an improvement from last quarter's internal growth of the 0.1%. Our revenue momentum of the last few quarters continued in our second quarter. The modest U.S. private sector job growth in the second quarter positively impacted our business. In addition, the productivity of our sales force continued to improve. This improvement was due to the impact of new products and services like Carhartt and our tile and carpet service, and was due to improved rep tenure. As you may recall, we increased our investment in sales about a year ago and have seen steady productivity improvements since then as new reps become more efficient. In addition to the productivity improvements, our account retention improved compared to last year and compared to this year's first quarter. The stabilization of the economy has certainly helped, but we have also been very focused at providing outstanding customer service. Our Uniform Direct Sales operating segment includes the direct sale of uniforms, branded promotional products and other related products to national and regional customers. Uniforms and other related products are also sold to local customers, including products sold to rental customers through our direct sale catalog. Uniform Direct Sales revenue accounted for 12% of company revenue in the second quarter. Second quarter revenue of $180.8 million represents an increase of 9.4% compared to last year's second quarter. Internal growth was also 9.4%. Our Uniform Direct Sales business has shown a nice rebound over the past three quarters. As in the first quarter, this rebound continued to be broad improvement in which we saw large national account customers, as well as lodging, hospitality and gaming customers increase spending. Our First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection Services operating segment includes revenue from the sale and servicing of first aid products, safety products, and training, and fire protection products. First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection revenue accounted for 10% of company revenue in the second quarter. During the quarter, revenues within this operating segment were $93.3 million, an increase of 14.4% versus last year's second quarter. Internal growth was 8.4%, a strong improvement over the first quarter internal growth rate of 2.2%. Both First Aid and Safety and Fire Protection Services internal growth improved relative to the first quarter, and the Fire Protection Services internal growth was in double digits. Fire benefited from an improving economic environment, growth in our national accounts business and greater sales team productivity. Our Document Management Services operating segment includes document destruction, storage and imaging services. Document Management accounted for 8% of second quarter total company revenue. Revenue increased 27.9% over last year's second quarter to $76.6 million, with internal growth of 14.7%. While this is still very positive internal growth, it is a decrease from the first quarter internal growth of 23.2%. Much of this decrease in growth rate relates to recycled paper revenues. The price of recycled paper increased significantly during last year's second quarter, and has remained at historically elevated levels since that time. As a result, we have started to anniversary that large increase, thereby reducing our recycled paper revenue growth rate. If the recycled paper prices continue at current levels into our third quarter, we will see some further slowing of the growth rate. Moving on to margins, total company gross margin for the second quarter was 41.7%, which is in line with last year's second quarter gross margin of 41.8%. Energy-related costs were up 15 basis points, and as was the case in our first quarter, our maintenance expenses were up 25 basis points. The gross margin of 41.7% decreased, compared to the 42.6% gross margin for the first quarter. This decrease is largely due to having one less work day in the second quarter compared to the first. An example of the work day impact is that our in-service inventory material cost is based on a monthly amortization schedule. So we essentially have the same expenses as in the first quarter, but one less revenue-generating day. We experienced a similar decrease, in that case 110 basis points from last year's first quarter to the second quarter. Rental gross margin of 42.6% was down 90 basis points from last year's second quarter. Higher energy and maintenance expenses accounted for 50 of the 90 basis points. The remaining decrease is due to higher material cost. As our wearers have increased over the past three quarters and new business results accelerate, we have injected more garments into our in-service inventory. The rental gross margin of 42.6% was also a decrease from the 43.5% in our first fiscal quarter. As already discussed, this decrease is largely driven by one less work day in our second quarter. Other Services gross margin was 39.6% for the quarter as compared to 37.3% in last year's second quarter. All three of the operating segments within Other Services improved, with Fire Protection Services improving the most due to the elimination of installation work. All businesses also benefited from higher volumes this year. Relative to the first quarter, the Other Services gross margin of 39.6% was a decrease of 80 basis points. This is primarily due to the Document Management Services gross margin, which decreased by 180 basis points from the first quarter for a few different reasons. Our European Document Management business, which now accounts for roughly 14% of our total Document Management business, had a decrease in its gross margin due to various initial expenses associated with our recent acquisitions. Our Storage business had several Greenfield starts this fiscal year. And lastly, our Imaging Services business is primarily a project-based business, which makes the margins more volatile from quarter-to-quarter. Selling and administrative expenses in the second quarter were 30.8% of revenue. This is a 100 basis point decrease from the 31.8% of revenue in the first quarter. A number of different areas contributed to this decrease, including G&A labor and medical expenses. Selling expenses as a percent of revenue were similar to the first quarter. The selling and administrative expense of 30.8% of revenue was an increase from the 29.3% for the second quarter last year. Selling expenses were 60 basis points higher than last year's second quarter. As we have discussed on the last few calls, we had a planned increase in our sales force during mid fiscal 2010 as a result of the stabilization that we saw in the economy. In addition to the increase in selling expense, Professional Service expenses increased 30 basis points due to our Enterprise Live system conversion, and bad debt expense was 20 basis points higher than last year due to a slight deterioration in our aging compared to last year. Please keep in mind that last year's second quarter included a legal settlement amounting to $4.1 million pre-tax net of insurance proceeds. Our effective tax rate was 38.3% for the quarter compared to 39.3% last year. Due to the timing of specific reserve bills and releases under FIN 48, our effective tax rate can fluctuate from quarter to quarter. We expect our fiscal 2011 effective tax rate to be approximately 37.3%. Our cash and marketable securities were $285 million at November 30, a decrease of $85 million from August 31, 2010. As we discussed last quarter, we used $72 million in September for the execution of our share buyback program. Accounts receivable increased by $18 million since August 31, primarily because of the higher revenue levels. DSOs on accounts receivable remained at 40, the same as at August 31. New goods inventory at November 30 was $208 million, up $24 million from August 31. We will be converting our global supply chain to the SAP system in our third quarter as part of our company conversion to the Enterprise Live resource system. In anticipation of this and as a precaution, we have intentionally built up inventory levels prior to the conversion. We have also built up our Carhartt and our flame-resistant clothing inventory levels. Uniforms and other rental items in service increased by $17 million from August 31 to November 30 due to the higher volume levels throughout the second quarter. Accrued liabilities increased $101 million compared to August 31 due to the $72 million accrual of the dividend which was paid on December 15, and increased bondage risk and accrued profit sharing. Long term debt at November 30 remained at $787 million. Any early retirement of this debt would require pre-payment penalty, and it is not currently attractive. Our average rate on the outstanding debt is approximately 6%. Total debt as a percentage of total book capitalization was 25%, while net debt or long term debt less cash and marketable securities as a percentage of total capitalization was 17%. Turning to our cash flow, cash provided by operating activities was $74 million for the second quarter, a decrease from $149 million in last year's second quarter. Last year's cash flow benefited from lower working capital needs associated with our decreasing volumes and the accrual of the legal settlements. This year, the increasing revenue levels have increased our working capital needs such as increased inventory levels and higher accounts receivable balances. The second quarter cash provided by operating activities of $74 million dollars was an increase over the first quarter's $35 million. CapEx for the second quarter was $40 million. Our CapEx by operating segment was as follows; $27 million in rental, $1 million in uniform direct sales, $5 million in first aid, safety and fire protection and $7 million in document management. We invested $41 million in the second quarter on strategic acquisitions. This includes a number of small acquisitions in our document management business and our first aid, safety and fire protection services business. We will continue to evaluate acquisition candidates as opportunities arise. That concludes our prepared remarks and we will now take any of your questions.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) And we will take our first question from John Healy with Northcoast Research.
John Healy: Question for you about cost and input cost in your business. I have been reading a lot about rising cotton prices and I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about those and maybe how much they are as a percentage of sales and what you are seeing there, and as well as your thoughts on energy prices going forward. There is a lot of speculation there. Oil is going to have a big run up in 2011, and I wanted to get your thoughts on how you feel about the likelihood that you will be able to pass any sort of energy cost increases that we see next year through your business without that really crimping back the margins.
Bill Gale: Sure, as far as cotton prices go, they are less than 5% of our rental business. And the reason is because many of our garments are 65/35 Poly Cotton Blend. And then when you include the direct labor cost component, the overhead cost component, freight, to get in, the cotton content is not a significant piece of the garment's total cost. When you then think about that cost of the garment being amortized over 18 months, it almost acts like a natural hedge such that cotton costs need to be elevated for quite a long period of time before it has a significant impact on us. So we don't expect that big of an impact on us this fiscal year, but certainly we're keeping our eyes on it. And we are working with our vendors to minimize the impact to us. As it relates to passing those costs on, we feel pretty good about the ability to do so to our customers. There is a lot of talk about this increasing cost, and I think it's a reasonable thing to do to pass that on at some point. In the energy area, certainly, especially with gasoline, John, it's something that we are having to keep our eyes on. We believe that if the gasoline prices continue to increase, we will have the ability to pass along those increases through our price increases. Tends to be a bit of a lag, but we'll be able to recoup that as we go forward, we expect at this time.
John Healy: And then was hoping if could talk a little bit qualitatively about the environment that you're seeing out there on the new sale side, and what you are thinking more of on the rental business. Are you seeing any signs of life that the small business customer that you focus on is showing any better vital signs? Are you starting to see more free activity? I know the rental business continues to firm up a little bit. And we are just trying to get a better understanding of where the firming is taking place.
Bill Gale: We are seeing a much more, I guess, accepting attitude on the part of businesses to look at potential expansion of their own businesses. I don't want to characterize it as extremely bullish, but certainly, we have turned the corner on this given that it's our third consecutive quarter of increased wearers. Our sales people are getting a lot of presentations, a lot of interest on the part of prospects, both at our current programmers as well as no programmers. So yes, it is a better environment than we have seen for the last few years. And we're cautiously optimistic that as we get into '11 we're going to see a reasonable growth rate in our wearers and continued expansion of all of our business lines.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Gary Bisbee with Barclays.
Gary Bisbee: I guess a couple of questions. Let me follow up that one on Rentals. I've seen a couple of press releases out there targeting what looks more like some of the facility services type stuff. There was one last week I think that had sounded to me like it had a health care angle to it, maybe was infection control or something, and I have seen a couple of others. How much is this whole facility services area contributing to the rentals growth? Should we think of that as one of the things that's driving the growth rebound, or I should say re-acceleration there?
Mike Hansen: Gary, it's contributing to it, but I don't want to leave the impression that the garment revenue wasn't growing also, because it is. If you look at our total rental business today, it's about 50/50, facility services versus garments. And so, I would tell you that we're seeing growth in both areas.
Gary Bisbee: Okay, that's good to hear. I guess two questions on the Document Management business. You mentioned a couple of new storage facilities. I know a year or so ago you were sort of treading cautiously, maybe the right way to say, with that business. It seems to me that there is a fairly weak return on invested capital and it takes significant upfront capital investment to scale I guess given what seems like a pretty competitive business. How are you thinking about the decision to scale the storage piece? And how are you trying to position yourself competitively to be successful in that business?
Bill Gale: We are continuing to be very cautious in the storage business. We have not, in the U.S. made any acquisitions of existing storage operations, but rather we have selectively picked out cities where we will have a base amount of business from a national customer and established a shredding business that we will then start up an operation on storage. While there are some short term losses associated with these Greenfields, its nothing like the significant investment that needs to be made and then a lengthy return on the investment that might happen from being very acquisitive with storage companies. So it is selective, it's very strategic and it's pretty much driven by customer relationships that we already have.
Gary Bisbee: And I guess a follow-up question on that business. I think you mentioned, growth could slow a bit more if recycled paper prices continue to stabilize where they seem to have been recently. But I guess we lapped a big year-over-year increase. How should we think about the margins as we look over the next few quarters? You mentioned a couple of investments that have brought margins down a bit. Is that reasonable to expect you'll continue to make that level of investments and the margins could drift a little lower, or should we think of scale helping the margins in the document business overall?
Bill Gale: You know, it's difficult to project when an acquisition might make itself available. But I would tell you that we believe that you should see margin expansion in those businesses. We are not going to pass up on a great acquisition opportunity if it becomes available. But I think that at this point, my expectation is that the new acquisitions that we made and specifically the European ones are going to continue to show improved margins going forward. And certainly our U.S. operations have done very well and we'll continue to do so. So I think you'll see improvement there.
Gary Bisbee: And then just one last one on the SG&A. Can you give us any sense how you're thinking about that trending. Nice to see it down a bit this quarter as a percent of revenue, but now that we're starting to lap that sales hiring, should we expect that you might begin to get some leverage on that if we continue to see this modest sales reacceleration, or are you still investing heavily there?
Bill Gale: Mike and I both talked about the fact that we expected leveraging of our SG&A line as we went through the year. So I think it is clear that what we said is starting to happen and you could see it in the second quarter. And as long as that revenue continues at the growth rates that we have seen and even accelerate some, I think you'll continue to see even more leverage in that line.
Mike Hansen: Something to keep in mind, our third quarter has 64 work days, so one less than the second quarter and to some payroll taxes reset, so the sequential movement of SG&A will likely reflect some impact of that. However, as Bill said, we do expect some leveraging going forward.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer.
Scott Schneeberger: I'm curious in the press release and your discussion, you guys mentioned that customer penetration, could you speak a little bit about what you're seeing there and perhaps just ability to cross sell as well?
Mike Hansen: Well what we're seeing is, it kind of goes back to the comments we've made on businesses now realizing that the economy is generally beginning to improve. There is some more visibility with regard to what's going to happen. Now that the tax changes have been resolved, I think that our existing customers are more confident on their ability to grow their businesses. And as such they are more willing to talk about other products and services that we may have to offer, as well as expanding their own work forces. It's a modest type of growth, but it's certainly a much more positive development than what we saw 12 months ago.
Bill Gale: As we increase that investment in sales, we did focus some of sales team on improving penetration. So that's been part of the momentum that we've seen in the last year.
Scott Schneeberger: And along these lines mention of retention improved, could you speak a little bit to as well as new business. Could you speak to the competitive environments specifically the pricing, primarily in rental but also across other businesses?
Bill Gale: Pricing continues to be aggressive and I think that what we have seen for the last several quarters has continued. And our competitors and all of our business lines are looking to grow their own businesses. And as such they have been aggressively going after our customers as well as customers who are looking for the service from a number of different providers. So the competitive environment has not really changed. In terms of aggressive pricing, I would say it has not gotten any more aggressive. But certainly there's not a lot of ability to get increased prices on new business at this time any different than what we've seen over the last several quarters.
Scott Schneeberger: And then finally, I think you mentioned $41 million in M&A, primarily in document management and some for safety and fire. Could you give a little more color on geographically where these were and were they predominantly document management? And then just kind of a prioritization of use of cash from here, a bit of buybacks recently, a sizable authorization, but just kind of the (inaudible) there?
Mike Hansen: We did make an acquisition in document management in the U.K., the acquisition we made last summer, the rest of the acquisitions in document management, first aid and safety, and some in-facility services were located here in the United States and they were all pretty much small acquisitions. Some were tuck-in, some opened up into some new markets with some of their products, but nothing was very big during the quarter. As far as use of cash, I think the attitude is that we will continue to use our cash to grow our businesses. We are going to look for good acquisitions and have the appropriate internal rates of return that we require. But the Board did issue another authorization on the share buyback. And depending upon what the availability is of acquisition opportunities as well as the market conditions of our stock, they'll direct us in how they want us to execute under that buyback, if at all.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Ashwin Shirvaikar with Citi.
Ashwin Shirvaikar: My first question is with regards to the topline growth. Congratulations, by the way, a very good rebound there in the internal revenue growth. Is it possible to parse out, maybe size, the various components, how much is coming from new clients versus same-store sales versus pricing? You mentioned pricing stability a bit here. But is it still negative on a year-over-year basis?
Bill Gale: Ashwin, we used to break that out many, many years ago, and that was when the business was much simpler and we had a better ability to make sure that the information we were being provided from our operations was consistent. At this time, I am not comfortable in breaking out the details of the growth in specifics. I would tell you that most of the growth though has come from new store fronts, that is new customers or new products at existing customers. We have not really seen a significant amount of growth like wearers within a customer. There has been some of that, but not a significant amount. What we have seen is no further deterioration. Right now, it's mostly new store fronts that we're seeing the growth from. Pricing, we are not getting a lot of growth from pricing at all. The CPI is basically flat. So on our existing contracts at this point, it has been relatively minimal about price increases. So it's pretty much at the new store fronts.
Ashwin Shirvaikar: When you think of target margin by segment, and the reason I ask this is obviously the business has changed a bit as you've gone through this downturn with regards to your own cost structure as well as a little bit in the competitive environment, how do you think of target margin by segment? Is it possible in the core rental business to get back to the levels that you used to have? What should we think about for the paper destruction business?
Bill Gale: Let me answer the paper destruction business. Assuming stability in the recycled paper price, the margins in the paper destruction and shredding business should certainly be at levels that we see in kind of traditional rental type margins. The rental margins themselves, I would be little too optimistic to say we could get back to pre-2005, 2004 levels, because it is difficult to assume that all of the cost increases that we now have incurred is the result of much higher medical cost, higher energy cost, expensing of stock options, Sarbanes-Oxley. I am not sure we can ever overcome all of those expenses. But however, I will say that we are optimistic that we will see improved margins from what you're seeing today in the rental business as well as the other businesses and borrowing again a spectacular increase in some component of costs like energy or medical expenses or something along those lines.
Ashwin Shirvaikar: With regards to the buyback that is announced in October, I was a little bit surprised to not see any of it used in the remainder of the quarter. Is there not a time limit to use it within two years, three years? Is that how you're thinking of it or is it purely use it only if the stocks below a certain price or something like that?
Bill Gale: Well, I think it certainly is driven to a degree by the stock price, but it's also driven by the other cash needs in the company. We are always looking out into the future of what we are going to do and what we are going to need for our cash. As I mentioned, we did pay the dividend here just last week. So we knew we had $70 million-some that we needed to do for that. We had some acquisition activity. We have this working capital build-up. So we balance all of that out and we also look at what's coming down the road here in terms of growth initiatives, capital requirements, potential acquisition opportunities, et cetera. We've got borrowing capacity. If the market condition and our stock warranted it, we would certainly look at the opportunity to execute under that buyback. But it's a very complicated evaluation of what we expect to happen and what we see happening with our valuation. And the Board helps us figure out what they think we should do for the benefit of our shareholders.
Ashwin Shirvaikar: What are your free cash flow expectations for this year?
Bill Gale: Ashwin, we really don't give that out as guidance at this point, because it becomes of a little bit more specific in terms of evaluating the working capital needs and the capital. So we publicly have decided not to disclose that. We'll let you guys figure that out based on your expectations. We give the sales and the EPS and capital spending, and that's about it.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Vance Edelson with Morgan Stanley.
Vance Edelson: First, just a follow-up on an earlier one on the level of competition. Is it strictly in the form of pricing aggression or is anyone out there trying anything new or exciting in terms of service, quality or anything else, or is it more like all they can think of is price?
Bill Gale: I wouldn't characterize our competition is just being on price. We have some very good competitors in all of our businesses, and I think they are always attempting to do things to help distinguish themselves in front of our prospects and customers. I think we are at the forefront in many of our businesses and the things that we do, as evidenced by our ability to provide the Carhartt uniforms and some of the other comfort uniforms that we have that many of our competitors don't have. Some of the services that we have in the imaging and shredding side I think distinguish us from some of the competitors. And certainly in first aid and safety, and fire services, we have really provided lot of new things and a lot of interesting approaches to providing those services. But our competitors are aggressive. They look for their niches also, and we respect them very much. So they're keeping us on our toes.
Vance Edelson: I want to make sure I heard you correctly. The bad debt was higher due to a change in methodology. Can you share with us what the change was?
Mike Hansen: No, we did not change our methodology. We had a slight deterioration in our aging compared to last year, but no change in the methodology.
Vance Edelson: Just on the geographic expansion initiatives within the U.S., is that ongoing, is there anything new to share there in terms of efforts to expand greenfield or otherwise within the U.S.?
Bill Gale: The primary expansion greenfield-wise that we've had was in document storage. And our document management shredding business and fire service business continue to expand in different markets throughout the U.S., because we still don't have the same coverage that we have in our rental business. So we are finding opportunities to expand into cities where we might have a rental operation, but we don't have fire service or document management at this time. And that's where that expansion takes place.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan.
Andrew Steinerman: Could you give us a sense of what rental gross for the second half of the year is implied within the revenue guidance? We just did 1.9%. In the first quarter we did basically zero. And so I'm asking in the second half of this fiscal year, what would be the organic rental growth implied in the overall revenue number that's guided for.
Bill Gale: The revenue guidance we gave you is still relatively broad. So for us to break that out is a little difficult, because I still got a pretty broad revenue guidance there. Let me just say it from my expectation is that assuming things continue as we've seen so far and the trend that I would expect organic growth in all of our businesses to improve from what you saw in this last quarter. I can't really give you any more details on that at this time.
Andrew Steinerman: When you're looking for organic revenue growth acceleration in uniforms, do you think it would be the same drivers that drove the second quarter? I think you called it new store fronts being the biggest driver.
Bill Gale: Yes.
Andrew Steinerman: When you're saying new store fronts, do you mean new business? I didn't quite catch what store front meant.
Bill Gale: Well, what I mean by that, Andrew, is basically a new customer renting uniforms as opposed to an existing customer increasing their workforce.
Operator: We'll go next to Greg Halter with Great Lakes Review.
Greg Halter: Looking at your cash and securities, how much of that is held in the U.S. and how much is outside?
Mike Hansen: Roughly about $160 million is outside and the remainder is in the U.S.
Greg Halter: And capital spending, I think you've had been talking levels around $150 million for the year. Is that still in line?
Bill Gale: Yes, we're going to be certainly at that high end of the range that we talked about.
Greg Halter: How much of that is for the SAP installation?
Bill Gale: It is likely going to be somewhere in the neighborhood of $10 million per quarter.
Greg Halter: And talking about SAP, any issue so far that you've run across that would cause any problems in deliveries and billings and so forth?
Bill Gale: No, not at this point. We have not run into any problems. We have fairly extensive testing and re-testing underway. So we don't expect there to be any problem when we convert over the supply chain early next year.
Greg Halter: I missed the figure you provided on SG&A due to selling expenses in terms of the increase year-over-year.
Mike Hansen: It was 60 basis points.
Greg Halter: I don't believe you specifically addressed the add/stop metric. I think you have directionally, but I presume that figure was a positive.
Bill Gale: Likely positive, yes, similar to what we saw in the first quarter.
Operator: We will take our next question from Justin Hawk with Robert W. Baird.
Justin Hawk: First of all on the productivity upgrade that you guys have initiated, beyond the SAP upgrade, can you just remind us what all is included in that and I guess what hasn't been rolled out thus far and what run rate you have to continue to improve things on that side?
Bill Gale: We've got a long way to go, Justin, in terms of what we are going to do with SAP. All we have really tackled up to this point from a conversion is our financial system. So we have now all of our financial systems and financial reporting under SAP. We are very closely nearing the conversion of our global supply chain. And then you will begin to see some of our business units converted over, if everything continues to go well, over the course of the next couple of years.
Justin Hawk: So when you were talking about the productivity upgrades, you were talking about the SAP upgrades specifically.
Bill Gale: I'm having difficulty recalling the context of productivity. So I am not sure.
Justin Hawk: There were other initiatives that you guys did that are driving some of the SG&A improvement?
Bill Gale: There is a lot of other things that are going on in terms of leveraging our staffing. It's not just all driven by SAP by any means. There are a number of different areas that go back to this whole concept of value-added work and making sure that what we're doing makes sense and we're doing it efficiently. And it's certainly beyond just SAP.
Mike Hansen: When we were talking about productivity improvements, it may have been in reference to our sales rep productivity. So as those sales reps have been around the longer, as they get tenured, they become better sales reps and their productivity levels improve. That may have been also what you heard.
Justin Hawk: On the acquisitions again, just curious if you could give us a sense on kind of what pricing looks like for deals that you're doing, especially since document management business seems that it's been pretty successful for you. And I would imagine there are other players out there looking at some of the same companies. Just a sense of what pricing looks like right now.
Bill Gale: Well, we don't disclose specific pricing in terms of multiples on our acquisitions. We tend to keep that confidential. What I would tell you though is that we have seen no real increase or decrease in the multiples that we have been paying for businesses over the past 18 months or so.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Chris McGinnis with Sidoti & Company.
Chris McGinnis: I think the gross margin increased on the rental side. I guess just because of the pricing has been so aggressive over the last almost two years, how much of the growth rate do you need for that to start move in your favor. Is there another dynamic that I'm missing in terms of that improving from hereon now?
Mike Hansen: If the pricing remains at the levels that it's at, we're going to see some margin improvement because of the higher revenue levels that we're able to spread all the fixed costs over and the improved amount of volume that we have on existing routes and that sort of thing. So price increases will only add to the speed of the margin expansion. But at this point, I still believe that margin expansion will happen even without prices.
Bill Gale: And really current customer hiring will be the best driver of gross margin improvement. So if we can see our customers and generally the job employment levels improve, that's going to be very positive.
Chris McGinnis: Just in term of the new customers coming in, how many are new to wearer programs themselves?
Bill Gale: We only look at that on an annual basis, Chris. So we don't really have that data on a quarter-by-quarter basis.
Chris McGinnis: Just the acquisition market for the industrial laundry segment, any lowering of valuations, any expectations you're looking for?
Bill Gale: Really haven't seen any change. Most our acquisition activity has taken place in the emerging businesses area, document management and fire service.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Gary Bisbee with Barclays.
Gary Bisbee: Given one less work day this next quarter, it would seem reasonable that the rental gross margin will probably creep down a little bit more. Is that the right way to think about it or is there anything we should think about?
Bill Gale: You are absolutely right that there is a way to think about it and then an improvement in the fourth quarter.
Mike Hansen: From last year's second quarter to third quarter, we had a drop of about 80 basis points and same number of work days.
Operator: And at this time, there are no other questions in queue.
Bill Gale: Well, thank you all very much for joining us this evening. On behalf of all of the Cintas family, we want to wish you and your families very happy holidays and a prosperous 2011.
Operator: That concludes today's conference call. We appreciate your participation.

===== 2011 Q1  (2010-09-22 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Cintas quarterly earnings results conference call. As a reminder, today’s call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Bill Gale, Senior Vice President of Finance and Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead, sir.
Bill Gale: Good evening and thank you for joining Mike Hansen and myself for our first quarter of fiscal 2011 earnings conference call. Cintas reported today growth in revenues and net income for the first quarter. We saw revenue growth in each of our operating segments. Overall revenue growth was 3.6% compared to last year. Revenues were also approximately 1.7% higher than the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010, a quarter with the same number of work days as this quarter. Earnings per share were $0.40 this year compared to last year’s $0.35 per share. Last year’s first quarter earnings did include an $0.08 charge for a legal statement on wage and hour litigation. During the quarter and continuing into September, the Company purchased 7.6 million shares of its stock. Most of these purchases were made under a 10b5 filing that went into effect when the Company entered quiet period in mid-August. The Company made these purchases from cash and did not incur any debt. At August 31st, 2010, Cintas has $369 million in cash and marketable securities. Of this amount approximately $167 million is outside the U.S., resulting from cash flow from non-U.S. operating units, leaving about $202 million of U.S. cash and marketable securities and no short term debt. In September, $72 million of the August 31st, 2010, cash was used for share purchases. This completes the authorization for share purchases by the board. The board will determine at its future meetings whether any additional authorizations will be given. As noted in our release, the share purchases had no impact on earnings per share in the first quarter, but will increase earnings per share by about $0.05 over the rest of the year. As a result, while revenue guidance for the year remains unchanged from that provided in July, our earnings per share guidance is increased by $0.05 per share on both the lower and upper end of the range given in July. We are encouraged with the recent modest growth and we believe that the North American economy will continue to improve at a relatively slow pace. As a result, Cintas will continue to focus on taking care of its customers by providing valued products and services. In addition, we will continue to enhance our existing customer relations by providing additional products and services as well as seeking out new customers in all of our business lines. Finally, we will focus on cost control and investment in acquisitions, our capital investment that meet the appropriate return criteria. As a reminder, the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a Safe Harbor from civil litigations for forward-looking statements. This conference call contains forward-looking statements that reflect the Company’s current views as to future events and financial performances. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those we may discuss. I refer you to the discussion on these points contained in our most recent flings with the SEC as well as in the press release issued today announcing our first quarter 2011 results. I will now turn the call over to Mike Hansen who will discuss this quarter’s results in more detail. We will then be happy to answer your questions.
Mike Hansen: Thank you, Bill. Total revenue for the first quarter of fiscal 2011 was $924 million, representing a 3.6% increase from the first quarter of last year. Total company internal growth was 2.8%. As Bill mentioned, each operating segment’s revenue grew compared to last year, both in total and organically. Before discussing the quarter in more detail, please note that our fiscal 2011 work days are the same as last year. That means there are 66 work days in the first quarter, 65 in the second quarter, 64 in Q3, and 66 in Q4. We have four reportable operating segments Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products, Uniform Direct Sales, First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection Services, and Document Management Services. Uniform Direct Sales, First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection Services, and Document Management Services are combined and presented as Other Services on the face of the income statement. The Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products operating segment consists of the rental servicing of uniforms, mats, towels, and other related items. This segment also includes restroom supplies and other facility products and services. Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products revenue accounted for 71% of Company revenue in the first quarter. Rental revenue was $657.6 million for the quarter, which is relatively flat compared to last year’s first quarter, but up 1.5% compared to – ended May 31st. Internal growth was 0.1% over last year, which is also an improvement from last quarter’s internal growth of negative 1.1%. The steady revenue improvement that we saw in the fourth quarter continued through our first quarter. The modest U.S. private sectors job growth continued in the first quarter. In addition, the focus of our sales of adding new customers and penetrating existing customer accounts positively impacted our first quarter rental revenue. Our wearers increased for the second straight quarter and our new business and net add/tops over the fourth quarter levels. Our Uniform Direct Sales operating segment includes the direct sale of uniforms, branded promotional products and other related products to national and regional customers. Uniforms and other related products are also sold to local customers, including products sold to rental customers through our direct sale catalog. Uniform Direct Sales revenue accounted for 11% of Company revenue in the first quarter. First quarter revenue of $98.8 million represents an increase of 10.6%, compared to last year’s first quarter. Internal growth was also 10.6%. We are encouraged that our Uniform Direct Sales customers have shown a willingness to spend uniform dollars on new hires and new programs. Our revenue growth over last year for our global accounts and strategic markets division was a broad improvement in which we saw large national accounts as well as lodging, hospitality and gaming customer increase spending. Our First Aid, Safety, and Fire Protection Services operating segment includes revenue from the sale and servicing of first aid products, safety products and training, and fire protection products. First Aid, Safety, and Fire Protection revenue accounted for 10% of Company revenue in the first quarter. During the quarter, revenues within this operating segment increased 3.9% versus last year’s first quarter. Internal growth was 2.2%. First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection revenue increased sequentially over the fourth quarter by 6.4%. This sequential improvement came in both first aid and safety and in fire protection. Our Document Management Services operating segment includes document destruction, storage and imaging services. Document management accounted for 8% of first quarter total Company revenue. Revenue increased 30.7% over last year’s first quarter with internal growth of 23.2%. Recycled paper prices remained at historically elevated levels during the quarter. Internal growth for Document Management Services excluding the recycled paper revenue was 10.6%. Moving on to margins, total Company gross margin for the first quarter was 42.6%, a decrease compared to last year’s gross margin of 42.9%. This decrease is due to a 10 basis points increase in energy related costs and a 35 basis point increase in maintenance costs. As our volumes declined during the past two years, we reduced maintenance on certain equipments and trucks not needed for the declining capacity requirements. Consequently, as volume now increases, we have some higher maintenance requirements. We expect this increased level may continue into the second quarter as well. The gross margin of 42.6% did represent a slight increase over e 42.4% gross margin for the quarter ended May 31st. First quarter energy related costs were down 15 basis points from the fourth quarter level. Rental gross margins of 43.5% were down 110 basis points from last year’s first quarter and the same as that of the quarter ended May 31st. Regarding comparison to last year, energy related costs were 15 basis points higher this year and as just discussed our maintenance cost increased 40 basis points. Other services gross margin was 40.4% for the quarter as compared to 38.2% in last year’s first quarter, and 39.8% for the quarter ended May 31st. Compared to last year, the Other Services gross margin improvement was due to an improved document management gross margin, resulting primarily from the high paper prices and an improved First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection gross margin resulting from better sales mix in both first aid and safety and in fire protection. Selling and administrative expenses were 31.8% of revenue, an increase from 29.7% for the first quarter last year. Selling expenses were up 110 basis points higher than last year’s first quarter. As we’ve discussed on the last few calls, we had a planned increase in our sales force during mid-fiscal 2010 as a result of the stabilization that we saw in the economy. Going forward, we expect our selling expenses to stabilize and start to come down as a percent of sales as revenue levels continue to increase. In addition to the increase in selling, professional service expenses increased 20 basis points compared to last year due to our enterprise wide system conversion. And bad debt expense increased by 40 basis points due to a slight deterioration in our aging. Please keep in mind that our bad debt expense and allowance for doubtful accounts are based on a consistent application of our established accounts receivable policy, which includes specific reserve percentages for each aging category. Sequentially, SG&A increased from the quarter ended May 31st, due to an 80 basis points increase in bad debt expense. Please keep in mind that last year’s first quarter included a legal settlement amounting to $19.5 million pretax net of insurance proceeds. Our effective tax rate was 30.8% for the quarter compared to 38.1% last year. This rate was impacted by the closure of various tax audits in the quarter. Due to the timing of specific reserves builds and releases under FIN 48, our effective tax rate can fluctuate from quarter to quarter. We still expect our fiscal 2011 tax rate to be approximately 37.3%. As Bill mentioned in his opening comments, we completed our authorized share buyback program by purchasing 7.6 million shares of our common stock at a cost of $202 million. And we did not incur any added debt as a result of these purchases. Since the purchases began at the latter part of the first quarter, these share buybacks did not impact our first quarter diluted earnings per share. As a result of completing our authorized share buyback program, we have now acquired 27.9 million shares since May of 2005 for a total cost of $1 billion. Primarily as a result of the completion of the share buyback program, our cash and marketable securities decreased $197 million to $369 million at August 31st. We also increased our capital expenditures and acquisitions during the quarter. The steadily improving economic conditions provided some incentive to begin returning to historical levels. Accounts receivable increased by $18 million since May 31st, primarily because of the higher revenue levels. DSOs on accounts receivable were 40, a slight decrease from last quarter’s 42. However, we did have a slight deterioration in our aging since May 31st, which caused the higher bad debt expense mentioned earlier. Our August 31st aging though is consistent with the aging of a year ago. New goods inventory at August 31st was $184 million, up $15 million from May 31st, mainly due to planning for the increased volume levels and the fall season. This balance is relatively consistent with the total at the end of last year’s first quarter. Uniforms and other rental items in service increased by $15 million from May 31st to August 31st due to the higher volume levels throughout the first quarter. Accrued liabilities decreased $24 million compared to May 31st due to the payment of our annual profit-sharing contribution and other benefit related accruals and scheduled bond interest payments. Long term debt at August 31st was $787 million. Any early retirement of this debt would require a pre-payment penalty and is not currently attractive. Our average rate on the outstanding debt is approximately 6%. Total debt as a percentage of total book capitalization was 24% while net debt or long term debt less cash and marketable securities as a percentage of total capitalization was 14%. Turning to our cash flow, cash provided by operating activities was $35 million, a decrease from $145 million in last year’s first quarter. Last year’s cash flow benefitted from lower working capital needs associated with our decrease in volumes and the accrual of the legal statement. This year the increase in revenue levels have increased our working capital needs such as increased inventory levels and higher accounts receivable balances. CapEx for the first quarter was $48 million including $15 million for our SAP conversion. Our CapEx by operating segment was as follows $23 million in Rental, $2 Million in Uniform Direct Sales, $8 million in First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection, and $15 million in Document Management. The CapEx associated with the SAP conversion was largely in Document Management and First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection operating segments. We invested $48 million in the first quarter on strategic acquisitions. This includes the Document Management business in the U.K., which we announced in July and also several other smaller acquisitions in our Facility Services business, our Document Management business and our First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection Services business. We will continue to evaluate acquisition candidates as opportunities arise. That concludes our prepared remarks and we will now take any of your questions.
Operator: (Operator instructions) Our first question comes from Vance Edelson from Morgan Stanley.
Stephen Gregory: Hello?
Bill Gale: Hi, Vance.
Stephen Gregory: Hi, this is Stephen Gregory actually from Mandalay Research. A couple of questions, Bill. Congratulations on a good quarter. In 2011, you are talking about earning – ecommerce is going to be the number one driver of the businesses and articles in The Wall Street Journal about two months ago on how companies are going to look to ecommerce to transform their businesses. Can you provide some color on the call today as what you think or believe your ecommerce vision will look like over the next couple of years and how you plan to get Cintas 2011 [ph]?
Bill Gale: Well, ecommerce for Cintas is primarily driven by some of our large national customers who have requested that they do ordering, inventory checking and other various reporting through an ecommerce platform and our IT, our information technology group works closely with our global accounts division to help these national customers do that. It is not going to be an appreciable part of our business though given the fact that most of our customers are small businesses or small operations of big businesses.
Operator: And we will go next to Gary Bisbee with Barclays Capital. Mr. Bisbee, please check your mute button. And as there is no response, we will move on. We will go next to Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan.
Andrew Steinerman: Hi, Bill and Mike.
Bill Gale: Hi, Andrew.
Andrew Steinerman: I would like to talk about – hi, I would like to talk about pricing. I know there is sort of two pieces to pricing, what I will call kind of the ordinary annual pricing that will happen in the middle of a contract and I actually think during your fiscal first quarter that we just completed there might be kind of an aggregation of some of that typically in this season. And then of course there is prices that come into play when contracts are renewed. That’s usually the more competitive side the equation. If you could talk about kind of both sides of pricing, what I will call kind of the annual pricing versus the competitive contract renewal or new business, and when you put those tow together is net pricing still positive.
Mike Hansen: Andrew, the pricing that goes into effect is during the terms of a contract is primarily in our rental business and that has been driven – that is driven by the CPI, which has been basically flat to slightly positive. So we’ve had – we’ve got – we’ve had very little pricing improvement over the last year or so in our rental business due to the fact that there is basically no inflation. With regard to renewals, we are finding that to be the most competitive situation that we are running into. Our customers, when they are at the end of their contract terms are vigorously approached by our competitors and it has resulted in a more competitive environment than we have seen. We have been talking about that for some time, and that has continued into and through this first quarter. I talked to our sales people with regard to new business, and while we have more competitive situations than we’ve had in the past, we haven’t seen the degree of pricing pressure on brand new business that we see in renewals of our existing customers. So, overall, to answer your question, we had very little impact in our revenue during the quarter from increased pricing. I would say that basically pricing for our services in the rental business is probably flat compared to where it was over the last 12 months.
Andrew Steinerman: And that’s flat all in considering both sides of placing, right?
Mike Hansen: It is – now, I will have to say to you it is very difficult to be given the number of products and the number of customers we have to be absolutely definitive on that, but as we look as trends, if we take out selected major products, that statement is true.
Andrew Steinerman: Okay, very fast. Thank you.
Operator: And we’ll go next to Justin Hott [ph] with Robert W. Baird.
Justin Hott: Good evening, guys. Thanks for taking my call.
Bill Gale: Yes, Justin.
Justin Hott: So, just wanted to get a little more clarification on the guidance. I guess is it fair to assume that this quarter was kind of to your expectation and your guidance from here is still assuming employment remains weak and margins either hold flat to increase slightly?
Bill Gale: Yes, that is a very true statement. We were pretty much in line with expectations and as a result of that, we did not see any reason for us to increase our guidance for the year at this time. We still expect a very, very modest recovery over the rest of our fiscal year and into next.
Justin Hott: Okay. And then just one more clarification on the pricing question. So were you saying in aggregate your pricing is flat, so including any benefit any benefit that you are getting from annual price escalators and then offset by any decrease in new business or were you saying that both of those in aggregate are flat?
Bill Gale: Basically, I am saying that in total that we are flat in the aggregate.
Justin Hott: Total pricing is flat?
Bill Gale: Yes.
Justin Hott: Okay. And then just the last question. One thing we’ve been monitoring is cotton prices have been elevated for a while and I am just wondering if there is any impact to your margins at this point from – as you are starting to source some new garments as the volumes are picking back up and if you’ve seen any pressure there, if you are able to pass that on to your customers?
Bill Gale: We have not seen any pressure from our suppliers that I am aware of. Therefore, we’ve had nothing to pass on to our customers. So the impact of higher cotton prices really has not impacted the cost of our garments that we are buying throughout the world.
Justin Hott: Great, great. Thank you very much. Very helpful.
Operator: And we’ll go next to Chris McGinnis with Sidoti & Company.
Chris McGinnis: Hi, thanks for taking the call. Can you talk may be a little bit about the acquisition environment you know I guess for all segments? And then may be talk a little bit about the Document Management and how that’s progressing for you?
Bill Gale: The acquisitions, as Mike indicated have picked up. You know, we told everyone on prior calls that we continue to be active looking for acquisitions, but we were very disciplined, we wanted to make sure we didn’t overpay in a declining economic environment, and it’s very difficult to predict exactly when things will develop, but we saw a nice quarter of closures and as a result of that we are very happy with these acquisitions. None of them really are large in and of themselves. The biggest one of course was the one we talked about in July and that’s still modest in size: the one that’s in the United Kingdom, the document storage business. So, right now, I would say that the acquisition pipeline is very active. We are continuing to pursue a number of targets, none of which though at this point are any significant size, but I would certainly expect there to be more acquisitions made throughout the rest of this year. Regarding the Document Management Business, continues to be a very good business for us. We are working diligently on expanding our footprint across North America and into northern Europe. We are continuing to make all acquisitions in markets that we are not in as well as acquisitions in markets that we are in where we can tuck them in. And it continues to be a very good business. The environment is such that the – paper prices remain high. Therefore, a lot of little competitors are being very price aggressive with their customers because they are after the paper so they can get the recycled price, which was set relatively good level. So – but it’s a great business, continues to be small relative to our other businesses, but we have a lot of very positive feelings towards this business going forward in how it will continue to grow.
Chris McGinnis: And I don’t know if you can break this down anymore since we do it in the Qs, can you just give a breakdown of what segments the acquisitions were for?
Bill Gale: Not at this time. We are – I am not prepared to give out that information.
Chris McGinnis: All right. Thank you very much.
Operator: And we’ll go next to Ashwin Shirvaikar with Citi.
Ashwin Shirvaikar: Hi, Bill, Hi, Mike.
Mike Hansen: Hi, Ashwin.
Ashwin Shirvaikar: So, just to start, I wanted to ask if you can provide a little more clarity on the sales environment where you have – where do you have success, is it primarily selling new clients or is it cross-selling new services to existing clients, where is the success coming in.
Mike Hansen: We’ve had – we’ve really seen the new business and the sales to existing customers improve this quarter over the last quarter and the last few quarters. And so we’ve – as the jobs increase, we get some benefit there as our sales force continues to focus on penetrating existing customers with additional products and services we were getting benefits. And we are seeing some pick-up in new business. So, we’ve seen some improvement in both areas.
Ashwin Shirvaikar: Okay. And with regards to the sort of your macro environment assumptions, I know you said they didn’t change, but could you sort of remind us with regards to what your assumptions are on employment trends, I know from manufacturing you had – except for the last month, you had some pretty good manufacturing employment data and that obviously helps you guys. So, at what point do you kind of call it a tipping point where you get more positive than you are?
Bill Gale: Well, Ashwin, it’s – I am not an economist, and I read everything that I can and trying to gauge what is happening, but our expectations are that we do not see a significant pickup in private sector growth, which is what is important to us. We do anticipate there will be some modest growth. And there we would expect as we go through the year the comparables become easier because we don’t have the significant drop-off that we’ve had – saw a significant drop-off last fiscal year and the year before. Then we’ll begin to see more of an impact of this revenue growth. So, I would say that as you look at our organic growth this quarter, our expectations here internally and our plan range from basically remaining at those levels going forward to slightly increasing them and that’s what drives you to the top end of the range. May be we get up to a revenue per day that’s modestly higher than it is now as we go through each quarter for the rest of the year.
Ashwin Shirvaikar: That’s very useful. So, if I take that and take your comments on pricing and look at the gross margin trend, I should probably expect gross margins to be flattish, may be a modest uptick. We could then still be 100-150 basis points lower than a year before and two years ago. Is that sort of a new normal for gross margins?
Bill Gale: No. No, I don’t think it’s the new normal, but I think your assumption is correct in that it is – there will be slight improvement. We will get back to those levels of where we were several years ago when we get back up to those revenue levels assuming that there isn’t a significant spike in energy cost or a significant deterioration in the pricing environment. But it’s not going to happen this year. And I am not even sure it will happen next fiscal year unless the economy really booms and we see a lot more top line growth, which I really don’t expect at this point.
Ashwin Shirvaikar: Okay. And my last question on the cash flow and CapEx front, CapEx for the quarter seem a little bit higher as – when it relates to sort of the trend line. You might have mentioned this, but is missed it. What was the CapEx for and are you kind of implying an upper end of the range CapEx currently and then correspondingly cash flow was much weaker than we anticipated? Was that primarily CapEx and bad debt type of situation or was there something else going on?
Mike Hansen: Well, let’s start with CapEx. Yes, we – back in July we gave you a range of $125 million to $150 million for the year and we do expect that we’ll be at the high end of that range. We did have $15 million of SAP in the quarter, and that project is moving somewhat quicker than anticipated earlier and so we may have a little bit more spending on that front than we thought back in July. From a cash flow perspective, as we – as our revenue has grown throughout the quarter, we’ve seen our accounts receivable come up, we’ve seen our working capital needs come up and that’s had some drag on our cash from operating activities. But nothing that we think is unusual.
Bill Gale: Nothing that’s going to change our strategies going forward. We will certainly continue to watch it and manage it. And as I stated in my remarks, we are being very cautious and only approving capital that makes sense or acquisitions that make sense. But certainly in the more positive environment, we want to continue to invest in the business and we will continue to do so.
Ashwin Shirvaikar: Okay. Thank you. Very useful. Thank you.
Operator: And we’ll go next to Bhupender Bohra with Oppenheimer.
Bhupender Bohra: Hi, this is Bhupender sitting in for Scott Schneeberger from Oppenheimer. My first question, can you give some color on competitive environment of your shredding business and especially related to pricing and volume?
Bill Gale: The shredding business is a business that is – there are a lot of players in it. There are three relatively good sized players, Cintas, Iron Mountain, and Recall, and ShredX, those four big players. And I would say that all four of the big players continue to aggressive go after national business. I think Cintas is a little bit more aggressive going after local business as we continue to develop our footprint around the country. Our biggest competitive situation right now though rests primarily with the smaller players in all the market that we are at. And as I mentioned, they are being very aggressive on their pricing because they are after the paper itself to sell it to the recycler. So, while we certainly are going to continue to pursue business growth, we want to cautious that we don’t destroy the market by driving prices too far down. So, we think some of this is short term competitive situation on the part of some of the smaller players. But even with that you could see our margins were still very good. We’re still continuing to grow that business and we still have a long way to go to really fill out our footprint and grow the relatively small size businesses we have throughout the United States into much bigger entities within each of those markets.
Bhupender Bohra: Okay. Okay, and the next one – I have one more actually on your U.K. storage acquisition. Just wanted to know like as you mentioned in your previous call like you plan to launch some products and services, if you can just give some color on that like in future on that – ?
Bill Gale: Well, we’ve only had it for three months and so far everything is great. We have a terrific management team over there. We are still working on developing our strategies on how we want to launch additional products and services. We haven’t done anything at this point. But it’s – like I said it’s only been a few months. So, so far we are very excited with the potential that exists over there.
Bhupender Bohra: Okay, and if I can have the last one, if you can give some color on new product development, anything planned for fiscal ’11?
Bill Gale: Well, I think the – everything probably saw the announcement on our tile and carpet cleaning business, which is starting out very well. It’s very small right now. We are in about 50 markets, usually with just one or two trucks within those markets, but we are finding great reception on the part of many large institutions that have been looking for a provider that can take care of their carpets and tiles and refurbish them to the point where they don’t have to replace them as quickly as they need, primarily in the hospitality and in schools, colleges, convention centers, that sort of thing. So that’s – that is one big area that we are in and then I’d say the other one in our rental business, because we are not – we certainly don’t give up on the uniform rental business is we have now a relationship with a provider of garments called Carhartt, which is a very loyal customer base that is primarily serving outdoors type activities. We now have developed a rental garment that we are having some great success in penetrating new customers with – and as well as existing customers at higher prices and we think that this is – that will be a significant advantage going forward. We are chemical dispensing, which is doing very well. So, I would say all of our businesses are looking for opportunities, but those three that I mentioned seem to be – have quite a bit of momentum right now.
Bhupender Bohra: Okay. Thanks a lot, guys.
Operator: And we’ll go next to Gary Bisbee with Barclays Capital.
Gary Bisbee: Hi, guys, can you hear me this time?
Bill Gale: Yes, Gary.
Gary Bisbee: Yes, okay, alright. Yes, following up on that one, what – can you just give us just a sense of the scope of offerings and size of the Facility Services business right now? I have just noticed in the last couple of press releases and even one or two spots on your website that’s getting more play than it used to. So is it basically just what we’ve thought about historically is the hygiene business or is there a lot more going on right now?
Bill Gale: There is a lot more going on. It represents about half of the rental segment. So, it’s become quite large. I think the approach that we’ve taken now is instead of a bunch of individual products, we are coming up with solutions for our customers, floor care, restroom care, that sort of thing that I think it’s more of a package solution more responsive to what the customer needs as opposed to just renting them an entrance mat or renting them an air freshener. So, we’ve broadened it out to be more service oriented. Over the last few years, Mike Thompson who used to fill in on these call is now working with our COO Phillip Holloman on really trying to determine what’s the best strategic direction for that business and how to continue to grow it and add products and services and come up with solutions that are geared toward a customer and taking care of many different things as opposed to just one or two items.
Gary Bisbee: So, when you say half of the rentals business, that would include mats and mops and some of these other – ?
Bill Gale: Yes, when I used Facility Services, that includes all those.
Gary Bisbee: Okay. I guess the second question, can you just give us a sense of remind us of how the profitability compares on new business in the first year versus growth from existing and I know – and not adding an employee, which we know – customer adding an employee, which we know is really high margin, but like selling an additional service to a new customer, are those both profitability weighed down a lot by the sales commission initially or should we think of that as still being fairly profitable?
Bill Gale: It depends on the business. You know you are – if it’s a uniform program, there tends to be lower profitability in the first year because you are injecting all those new garments, you got all the sales cost, the fitting cost, et cetera. And so it takes a while for that account to become profitable. But on some of the other products and services, when you go in let’s say to a customer and we are going to add tile and carpet cleaning, that’s pretty profitable stuff from day one. So it really varies depending on what the product is, what are the services and how much material cost is associated with it, what type of selling commissions are we paying, are there any setup type costs, et cetera.
Gary Bisbee: And so I guess the new business sales how they are each trending would correspond pretty closely to the organic growth that you’ve talked about it. Is there anything that could really energize the rentals business in the near term other than a much brighter economic picture and I guess what I am really getting at here is how much revenue growth do you think you need in rentals for the margins to really start filling some of this gap down over the last year?
Bill Gale: I think we are – I think not much higher growth than what we saw this quarter if we – as we go through the rest of the year and into next fiscal year as we continue to see an uptick in each quarter, I think you are going to see some margin improvement because we have a lot capacity that can be used.
Gary Bisbee: And then I guess just the last question from me. I thought the buyback was – certainly was a good move and it was somewhat surprising given commentary over the last couple of quarters. Did anything really change because it – I have a sense from you that you’d much more likely want to follow revenue growth strategy. Was this just an acknowledgement that there aren’t enough big targets willing to sell or was there something else that drove that decision to do that now? Thanks.
Bill Gale: I think there were a number of factors that came into play. The large cash balances, the lack of executable, big deals at this point, the fact that many of our shareholders had been communicating with us on some of their thoughts. The price of the stock, the fact that we couldn’t earn – hardly anything on the cash that was sitting on the balance sheet, and I’d say our confidence in the future.
Gary Bisbee: Okay. Thanks for all the color.
Operator: We’ll go next to Vance Edelson with Morgan Stanley.
Vance Edelson: Hi, can you hear me this time?
Bill Gale: Yes. Somebody popped in on you last time.
Vance Edelson: Yes, that was odd.
Bill Gale: Very odd.
Vance Edelson: Yes. So, the first question, just your thoughts on geographic expansion of the Greenfield variety for the core uniform rental business within the U.S., are there under penetrated regions, is this something we could see more of, could this be a potential growth driver going forward beyond acquisitions, beyond cross-selling opportunities?
Bill Gale: Vance, it certainly can be because there are markets that we are not – that we don’t have a large market share in very populated parts of the country, the northeast, California, name it, the southeast. So, I think there are great opportunities there. You take Chicago, we’ve got five or six uniform rental facilities within the Chicago area. There is no reason that we wouldn’t see similar or even greater numbers of opportunities in places like Southern California or the New York area or the Washington, New York, Boston corridor type situation. So, yes, there are still continued expansions. Just because we are in one city today doesn’t mean that we can't add two or three more facilities within that same geographic area. So, we will continue to look for that. You know I think we evaluate whether it makes sense just to – branch and plant spoke scheme or to look for a nice tuck-in acquisition like we did when we bought Van Dyne Crotty here a few years ago. So, there are a number of ways to do it. As employment has finally stabilized and now is beginning to show some life and some growth and we think that you’ll begin to start seeing some of those expansions in areas as we go forward. There really aren’t a whole lot of cities in North America today though that we are not in. I think it will be primarily expanding within cities, regional areas where we are already present.
Vance Edelson: Okay. That makes sense. And I may have missed it earlier. I was off the call for a minute, and I know you did address pricing, but you did you address the discipline or lack thereof on the part of your larger competitors. Have there been any changes on that front as the economy has improved some?
Mike Hansen: We hadn’t really seen a whole lot of change from the larger competitors from that standpoint, no.
Vance Edelson: Okay. And just one more, if I may, regarding the share buyback, a long as you are going to do it or you have done it historically and there could be another one going forward, I am just curious, why purchase under the 10b5? A lot of companies indicate they are going to buyback opportunistically, in other words, they want to move in when the share price is low. Does the plan prevent you at all from having that kind of flexibility?
Bill Gale: No, we decided and the board advised us that they were comfortable with us establishing a 10b5 under certain parameters so that we could buy in the first quarter during the quiet period if the proper conditions warranted, which they did. So, that’s why we implemented it, otherwise we felt that we legally could not be buying our stock during the quiet period and we wanted to take care – take advantage of the opportunity if it presented itself.
Vance Edelson: Okay, that makes sense. Thanks for the color.
Operator: (Operator instructions) And we’ll go next to Greg Halter with Great Lakes Review.
Greg Halter: Yes, good afternoon, guys.
Bill Gale: Hi, Greg.
Mike Hansen: Hi, Greg.
Greg Halter: I don’t know if you can provide any additional color between or behind the add/stops, but if you can I would appreciate it.
Mike Hansen: Well, as we mentioned, the add/stops did improve in the quarter and I would say that a lot of that improvement came in the uniform rental business, so we have seen our wearers pick up in the last couple of quarters, and we’ve also had some good performance on adding wearers at existing customers.
Greg Halter: Okay. And I know you talked about energy cost and so forth, but I am not sure that you related that to your total revenue and what that increase or decrease may have been relative to a basis point change.
Bill Gale: It was about a – well compared to last year, let’s get the number, hold on just a second. Mike did talk about it. It was 3% for the quarter and that was for the rental business – there was a 10 basis point increase in energy cost – there was a 10 basis point decrease in energy cost in the first quarter compared to last year’s first quarter, is that right, Mike.
Mike Hansen: Yes, so it was about 3% of total revenue.
Greg Halter: Okay. That sounds good. Thank you very much.
Operator: And we have no further questions at this time.
Bill Gale: Well, thank you, everyone, for joining us this evening. We are glad to have reported some positive results. We will – plan to release our second quarter earnings sometime in mid-to-late December. Appreciate it very much.
Operator: And this concludes today’s conference. Thank you for your participation.

===== 2010 Q4  (2010-07-20 17:00:00) =====
Executives: Bill Gale – SVP and CFO Mike Hansen – VP and Treasurer
Analysts: John Healy – Northcoast Research Gary Bisbee – Barclays Capital Scott Schneeberger – Oppenheimer Phil Stiller – Citigroup Vance Edelson – Morgan Stanley Chris McGinnis – Sidoti & Company Vishnu Lekraj – Morningstar
Operator: Good day. And welcome to the Cintas quarterly earnings results conference call. Today’s call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Bill Gale, Senior Vice President of Finance and Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead, sir.
Bill Gale: Good evening and thank you for joining us to discuss the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010. With me this evening is Cintas’ Vice President and Treasurer, Mike Hansen. Mike Hansen was recently promoted to this position from Corporate Controller to replace Mike Thompson, who has assumed a role in a rental organization as Senior Vice President, Facility Services. We are pleased to report that revenues increased 3.5% from last year’s fourth quarter. Internal growth, adjusting for acquisitions and the one additional workday in this year’s fourth quarter, compared to last year was also positive at 1.9%. After the very difficult economic conditions experienced since the beginning of the recession, this marks our first positive growth period in revenue since our quarter ending August 31, 2008. Our fourth quarter revenue of $909 million was above our previously released guidance of $870 to $890 million. Earnings per share for the quarter were $0.36, compared to last year’s $0.03 per share. Prior year numbers included restructuring and impairment charges of approximately $49 million before tax or $0.35 per share. Current year earnings per share were positively impacted by approximately $0.01 due to the reversal of certain restructuring charges. As we have reported in the last couple of quarters, we continue to see signs of stability with the employment levels of our customers. While customers continue to be hesitant to add employees, we no longer see the significant reductions that occurred during the past couple of years. The result is that our new business is beginning to offset the impact of lost business or stops at existing customers. The pricing environment continues to be very competitive both with the new business, as well as, renewal of existing contracts. We continue to be very pleased with the overall financial condition. During fiscal 2010, we paid our annual dividend amounting to $74 million and still increased our cash and marketable securities by over $300 million. As of May 31, 2010, we had no commercial paper outstanding and have cash and marketable securities of over $560 million. During the recession, we continued to generate substantial cash flow and are able to keep our debt capacity available for opportunities that will arise for additional acquisitions or more rapid expansion throughout the world. Now that we have more confidence in our view of the future economic environment, we are resuming providing guidance. Our expectations are for revenues for the fiscal year ending May 31, 2011 to be between $3.55 and $3.75 billion, and earnings per share to be between $1.50 and $1.58. This guidance assumes a slowly improving economy with a relatively modest increase in employment levels and no significant increases in costs such as energy or medical benefits. We also expect our growth in both sales and profits to improve, as the year progresses on a workday adjusted basis. We are pleased to report our continued expansion outside of North America. Earlier this month, we acquired Squirrel Storage in the United Kingdom that has 10 record storage centers, serving six markets in England, Scotland and Wales. This acquisition, which has over 10 million pounds in annual revenue, now gives Cintas the opportunity to provide Document Management Services to customers in Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, as well as, the U.K. We are excited to have a Cintas presence in the United Kingdom. We are encouraged with the stabilization of the economy. Through the very hard work of our employees, coupled with our strong customer relationships, we have weathered the most serious economic downturn since the 1930s. With our breadth of business services and strong financial position, we believe that we are prepared to benefit from the improved economic conditions that we expect to prevail in the next several years. The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a Safe Harbor from civil litigation for forward-looking statements. This conference call contains forward-looking statements that reflect the company’s current views as to future events and financial performance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those we may discuss. I refer you to the discussion on these points contained in our most recent filings with the SEC. Mike Hansen will now provide more detail on our results and after his comments we will open the call to questions.
Mike Hansen: Thank you, Bill. Total revenue for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 of $909 million represented a 3.5% increase from the fourth quarter of last year. This year’s fourth quarter had 66 workdays, one more than last year’s fourth quarter and two more than this year’s third quarter. On an adjusted workday basis, total revenue grew 1.9%, compared to last year’s fourth quarter. Total company internal growth was also 1.9%, an improvement over a third quarter internal growth of negative 3.6%. As compared to this year’s third quarter, revenue increased 2% on an adjusted workday basis. Before discussing the quarter in more detail, please note that our fiscal 2011 workdays will actually be the same as fiscal 2010. That means there will be 66 workdays in Q1, 65 in Q2, 64 in Q3 and 66 in Q4. We have four reportable operating segments. Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products, Uniform Direct Sales, First Aid, Safety, and Fire Protection Services, and Document Management Services. Uniform Direct Sales, First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection Services, and Document Management Services are combined and presented as other services on the face of the income statement. The Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products operating segment consists of the rental and servicing of uniforms, mats, towels and other related items. The segment also includes restroom supplies and other facility products and services. Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products revenue accounted for 71% of company revenue in the fourth quarter, within rental, based on fourth quarter revenue levels, uniform rental accounts for approximately 52% of revenue, dust control, which is mainly entrance mats, accounts for 22%, hygiene, which is mainly restroom supply and cleaning is 11%, shop towel revenue is 6% and linen and other, which is mainly non-person specific garments, such as aprons and butcher coats, is 9%. Rental revenue was $647.7 million for the quarter, down 1.5% compared to last year’s fourth quarter on an adjusted workday basis, but up 1% compared to last quarter on an equivalent workday basis. Internal growth was negative 1.1%, an improvement from the third quarter internal growth of negative 5.9%. Our rental revenue benefited from the modest U.S. private sector job growth during our fourth quarter, as well as, our efforts to maintain and further penetrate our existing customer base. Our uniform wearers increased during the quarter, as we had improvements in our new and lost business metrics and our add/stop metric. Pricing continues to be aggressive for both customer retention and new business. We are protecting our market share by maintaining high levels of customer satisfaction and by fighting our competition in the marketplace. Our Uniform Direct Sales operating segment includes the direct sale of uniforms, branded promotional products and other related products to national and regional customers. Uniforms and other related products are also sold to local customers, including products sold to rental customers through our direct sale catalog. Uniform Direct Sales revenue accounted for 11% of company revenue in the fourth quarter. Fourth quarter revenue of $103.2 million represents an increase of 10%, compared to last year’s fourth quarter and represents internal growth of 8.3%. Additionally, this revenue level represents an increase of approximately 6% over last quarter on an adjusted workday basis. Within this segment, our global accounts and strategic markets division has a significant amount of business within the lodging, hospitality and gaming industries. These industries gained jobs in our fourth quarter and we began to see some willingness on our customer’s part to resume spending. We also experienced improved levels of spending at the local level through our direct sale catalog. However, the fourth quarter segment revenue is still well below pre-recession levels. Our First Aid, Safety, and Fire Protection Services operating segment, includes revenue from the sale and servicing of first aid products, safety products and training, and fire protection products. First Aid, Safety, and Fire Protection revenue accounted for 10% of company revenue in the fourth quarter. During the quarter, revenues within this operating segment increased 5.8% versus last year’s fourth quarter. Internal growth was 2.8%, which is an improvement over last year’s – over last quarter’s internal growth of negative 6.1%. Both the first aid and safety revenue and the fire protection services revenue showed improved levels and growth rates in the fourth quarter, compared to last quarter. First aid and safety revenue increased by 3.4%, compared to last year, while fire protection services increased by 9.5%, compared to last year. As with Uniform Direct Sales revenue, the revenue in this segment is still well below pre-recession levels. Our Document Management Services operating segment includes document destruction, storage and imaging services. Document management accounted for 8% of fourth quarter total company revenue. Revenue increased 30% over last year’s fourth quarter with internal growth of 25%. Recycled paper prices remained at historically elevated levels during the fourth quarter and this was a significant contributor to the relatively high internal growth rate of 25%. Internal growth excluding the recycled paper revenue for document destruction service and purge business was 10.5%. Turning to margins, we continue to actively manage our cost structure to ensure it is appropriate, given our revenue levels. Total company gross margin for the fourth quarter was 42.4%, an increase over last year’s gross margin of 38.1%. Keep in mind that last year’s fourth quarter gross margin included a loss on inventory valuation of $27.5 million due to excess inventory levels caused by the significant deterioration in the U.S. and Canadian economies. Excluding this charge, the adjusted gross margin in last year’s fourth quarter was 41.2%, compared to this year’s fourth quarter of 42.4%. This 120-basis point improvement in gross margin was in spite of a 50-basis point increase in energy-related costs. Fourth quarter total company gross margin improved by 70 basis points from the third quarter, energy-related costs accounted for a 10% basis point improvement. Higher volumes were also a contributor to this improvement. Rental gross margin of 43.5% was down 10 basis points from last year’s fourth quarter, adjusted for last year’s loss on inventory evaluation. However, energy-related costs increased by 50 basis points from last year’s fourth quarter to this year’s fourth quarter. Aside from the effective energy, our improvement was due in part to better capacity utilization in fiscal 2010, driven by the impact of our restructuring activities, which were completed throughout this year. Rental gross margin improved 80 basis points compared to the third quarter. Energy costs decreased 10 basis points in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter. The remaining improvement is mainly due to higher overall rental volume. Other services gross margin was 39.8% for the quarter, as compared to 34.5% in last year’s fourth quarter adjusted for last year’s loss on inventory valuation and 39.2% last quarter. Improvements over both last year’s fourth quarter and this year’s third quarter are generally due to better fixed cost absorption due to improved volumes. Selling and administrative expenses were 31.5% of revenue, an increase from 28.9% for the fourth quarter last year. Selling expenses were 120 basis points higher than last year’s fourth quarter. As we discussed on last quarter's call, we have continued to use our sales force to penetrate our existing customers with new and different products or services. Sales commissions paid on these non-traditional ads where the sales force was involved have resulted in increased commissions compared to last year. We also continued our planned increase in sales force head count. Future increases in our sales force will depend on the direction of the economic environment. In addition to the increase in selling expense, medical expenses increased 50 basis points compared to last year, due to higher utilization of the medical plans and profit sharing expense increased by 40 basis points due to the higher net income levels in this year's fourth quarter compared to last year. Sequentially, SG&A decreased from our third quarter, mainly due to a combination of the lower payroll taxes and lower bad debt expense due to improved collections of past due accounts. We were positively impacted by a $2.9 million change in estimate to the restructuring reserve during the fourth quarter. This change in estimate represents the difference between severance and other exit costs estimated during last year's fourth quarter and the costs actually paid during fiscal 2010. Our effective tax rate was 38.2% for the quarter, which reflects the timing of specific reserve, bills and releases under FIN 48. For the full fiscal 2010 year, our effective tax rate was 37.3%. We expect our effective tax rate for fiscal 2011 to again be approximately 37.3%. Our balance sheet and cash flow continue to be strong. Our cash and marketable securities increased $14 million from February 28, despite paying our annual dividend of $74 million. Since May 31, 2009, our cash and marketable securities increased $316 million. DSOs on accounts receivable were 42, a slight increase from last quarter, but consistent with last year's fourth quarter. Although we had a slight increase in DSOs from last quarter, our aging improved substantially due to a focus on past due accounts. New goods and inventory levels at May 31 were relatively consistent with the levels at the end of the past two quarters. We believe the current balance is appropriate based on our current revenue level and mix. Accrued liabilities decreased $58 million compared to February 28, due to the $74 million payment of the annual dividend, which was paid on March 10. The dividend of 0.48 marks the 27th straight year in which we increased the dividend. The decrease in accrued liabilities due to the dividend was offset by a $12 million increase in accrued bond interest. Long-term debt at May 31 remained at $786 million as all outstanding debt is now at fixed rate. Any early retirement of this debt would require a prepayment penalty and is not currently attractive. Our average rate on the outstanding debt is approximately 6%. Total debt as a percentage of total book capitalization was 24% while net debt or long-term debt less cash and marketable securities as a percentage of total capitalization improved to 8%. As mentioned earlier, our cash flow remain – continues to be strong. Our cash flow provided by operations in fiscal 2010 was $562 million, an increase of 7% over fiscal 2009. And our free cash flow was $450 million for fiscal 2010, an increase of 24%. CapEx for the year was $111 million, including $32 million in the fourth quarter. Our CapEx by operating segment was as follows. $68 million in rental, $7 million in Uniform Direct Sales, $8 million in First Aid, Safety And Fire Protection and $28 million in Document Management. We expect our CapEx to modestly increase in fiscal 2011 to be between $125 million to $150 million. We invest $50 million in fiscal 2010 on strategic acquisitions, primarily in our Document Management Services operating segment. We continued to evaluate acquisition candidates and we have sufficient cash and access to capital for when opportunities arise. As Bill mentioned in his opening comments, we expect fiscal 2011 revenue to be between $3.55 billion and $3.75 billion and earnings per diluted share to be between $1.50 and $1.58. While we expect a return to growth of sales on profits in fiscal 2011, the U.S. economic environment still appears mixed and we expect job growth to continue to be sluggish. Any downturns in the U.S. economic climate and further job losses in fiscal 2011 will have an adverse effect on our results. Additionally, the low end of our earnings per diluted share considers slight deterioration in medical and energy-related expenses and recycled paper prices. Thank you and we will now take any of your questions.
Operator: Thank you (Operator instructions) Our first question is John Healy with Northcoast Research.
John Healy – Northcoast Research: Good evening, guys.
Mike Hansen: Hello, John.
Bill Gale: Hello, John.
John Healy – Northcoast Research: Well, hello. Wondering if you could you talk about the operating environment right now? It’s great to hear that it appears the revenue trends are stabilizing, the business conditions are stabilizing. Could you talk about how you are thinking about revenue growth in 2011, maybe talk about what areas you feel the most bullish on, whether it’s firming in the pricing environment or the new sales or just increased ancillary sales? Maybe talk about where you're thinking it, you're going to see the most improvement in those metrics?
Bill Gale: Well, John, I think what we are expecting and what our plan calls for is that we are going to continue to see good organic growth in our Document Management business, so that, that will continue to do well. We expect the businesses that are really impacted by employment levels, such as Uniform Rental, Uniform Direct Sales and even First Aid and Safety, to basically show some very modest growth as we go through the year. Reason being, that we are seeing customers at least starting the process of adding some employees in some sectors and therefore needing some uniforms. We're seeing, you know, additional hands in the first aid cabinets. We're seeing some of the hospitality customers, as Mike mentioned. We're looking now to refresh their programs and buy some uniforms but until we see a dramatic increase in employment, I don’t think we’re going to see a dramatic increase in those particular line – in those particular segments. So while we continue to sell new business, the fact that the customers are not reducing head count is going to help us show positive growth albeit at relatively modest rates.
John Healy – Northcoast Research: That's helpful. And I was hoping we could talk about the cash flow of the business. Pretty amazing that cash flow you generated in 2010. Can you give us some thoughts about utilizing cash flow? I mean, it appears that you're at an inflection point here where the business is stable and looking up and yet you've done some few things with the balance sheet. Maybe how you're thinking about using cash, whether it's for acquisitions or if there's any thoughts about returning cash to shareholders and increasing the dividend or maybe getting aggressive at buying back stock?
Bill Gale: Well, as we've talked about over the last couple of quarters, John, now that we see the economic environment become more predictable, I think we anticipate being more aggressive on looking for good acquisitions in all of our business segments. And I think that would be the first use of cash. But as we said in the last couple of quarters, especially the last quarter, if we can't find a good acquisition that can give the return that we feel as justifiable, I'm sure the board will continue to look at what is the best thing to do for our shareholders, be that resume our share buyback program or more aggressively increase the dividend and that is a constant discussion item that will take place at the board level. Right now, though, you know, we are hopeful that we can find some very good acquisitions that we can deploy this cash with.
John Healy – Northcoast Research: Okay. And just last question, I might have missed it, did you guys give a free cash flow guidance number for 2011 or maybe mention what working capital should be?
Bill Gale: No, we did not. I think Mike mentioned the CapEx but we don't – we did not predict what was going to happen with working capital. I will tell you that we did bring down our inventory levels quite a bit during the year. And as Mike said in his comments, we now think they are pretty much at the levels that they should be. So we're not going to get that benefit in fiscal ‘11 of another drawdown in inventories.
John Healy – Northcoast Research: Okay. Thanks.
Operator: We'll go next to Gary Bisbee with Barclays Capital.
Gary Bisbee – Barclays Capital: Hi, guys. Good afternoon.
Bill Gale: Hi, Gary.
Mike Hansen: Hi, Gary.
Gary Bisbee – Barclays Capital: Any updated thoughts on sort of strategy for storage versus shredding? I know you've been real excited about shredding and taking somewhat more cautious approach on storage. I think in part just due to the fact that it seems to be a much more capital intensive business but it sounds like this acquisition oversees there is more storage and maybe you’re doing more of that there. Any just thoughts on how you're looking at that? Is that a point you want to do in the U.S. as well?
Bill Gale: Yes. Well, the acquisition in the U.K. is strictly storage. And we really like that company. It's great management team, gives us a nice presence throughout the United Kingdom and it's a very good business. So we found what we think is a gem and that has been our approach any time we look at storage. If we can find a good acquisition that isn’t ready to all of a sudden require millions of dollars of capital expenditures to expand their capacity, you know, we will entertain that. In the U.K., let me just say that – now, this will give us a platform on which to maybe perhaps launch other products and services as we go forward. In the U.S. and in Canada, we continue to look at potential storage acquisitions, but we also are saying to ourselves that, you know, the opportunities in shredding appear to be more actionable and viable for us right now. So while storage acquisitions might come along, we tend to find most storage, most companies that are selling their storage business really are maxed out in the facilities they have. And so it makes the return on capital not so attractive because we have to inject so much money right upfront to expand their facility. We have looked at starting up some storage operations in a couple of different cities and we've been successful in doing that when you can get a good base customer. So those are some of the – you know, we continue to look for the right things to do, but I would say most of our acquisitions in the U.S. will be more on the shredding side.
Gary Bisbee – Barclays Capital: Given how strong cash flow has been in the balance sheet under levered growth to your history, you know, I remember at one point you told us you had, if I remember correctly, 90 different potential businesses you were tossing around as long-term ideas. Is there, is there room for another leg here? I still struggle with the fact that it seems to me other than uniforms, may not be sort of scale acquisition candidates or at least not many of them that really could make a change in your mix. Is there anything else out there that you think you could do in a fashion that would impact the business in the next couple of years?
Mike Hansen: Gary, yes there are. I would differ a little bit with you. I think there are some good acquisitions of scale in the other businesses, especially in Document Management and in the fire business. So I'm not sure that, you know, that we couldn't get quite a bit of volume, you know, relatively quickly by making a good acquisition there. We have – we continue to test a couple of different things. We also see a opportunity to expand quite a bit in the facility services business that I think will prove out to be a real nice growth vehicle for us. So, you know, the additional leg of the stool that may be less likely in the next year or two, but you could see quite a bit of an expansion or a broadening of some of the services in some of the businesses, especially facilities services.
Gary Bisbee – Barclays Capital: And then just one last one for me, when I look to the margins this quarter, how much of that improvement sequentially was just the extra workday? I think I remember a quarter ago you saying you didn't think that would be such a big deal. So was that a big part of this improvement or is it much more, just other things going on?
Mike Hansen: There's a lot of other things going on there. You know, there's a little bit of that but it wasn't significant.
Gary Bisbee – Barclays Capital: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer
Scott Schneeberger – Oppenheimer: Thanks. Good afternoon, guys.
Mike Hansen: Hi, Scott.
Bill Gale: Good afternoon.
Scott Schneeberger – Oppenheimer: I guess, following up on Gary's question, you mentioned that our CapEx is going to be higher this year versus last. You are willing to – is actually starting some storage operations, which may involve a bit of capital. Is that the incremental spending or might it be for SAP, just update you there and other thoughts on why the increase?
Mike Hansen: The increase will be both in the Document Management business. Because that is a growing business, we will, we will be of course buying trucks and other plant-based equipment as we continue to move some of that business off site into our facilities, shredding our facilities. We'll see some capital expenditures in that Document Management space and we'll also, as it relates to SAP, we are going to be embarking on transition of a couple of our operating systems onto the SAP platform and we do expect that that will increase over the fiscal '10 SAP spend as well.
Scott Schneeberger – Oppenheimer: Thanks. That's helpful. Could you also address in the core rental business, verticals – among your top three verticals, what are they and trends? Can you discern on the vertical level, the differentiations? Thanks.
Mike Hansen: Are you talking in terms of the kind of customer, industry we're serving?
Scott Schneeberger – Oppenheimer: Exactly. Yes.
Bill Gale: Well, the largest segment, if you lump it all together in NAICS codes, is what we call automotive and automotive related and that encompasses anything from big three auto plans, dealerships, auto repair, oil change, tire change, et cetera. And we've seen pretty stable numbers there. We have not – we don't have a lot of growth there, but we have seen pretty good stability because even though people aren't buying a lot of cars or repairing a lot of the cars they have. So that business has done okay. The second largest segment is what we lump together as hospitality. Some of that is – it’s uniform rental but a lot of it is facility services type products. That services restaurants and hotels and other type of hospitality-type events. So that one has suffered a little bit in the recession, but as Mike indicated, we're seeing it in our direct sale business a pickup in volume there, as actually the employment is starting to pick up in those categories. So after that, manufacturing is kind of a hotchpotch of things, because it encompasses everything from pharmaceutical to food processing, every machinery, et cetera. And while we have seen a slowdown on the outward transfer of jobs outside of the United States, there's really no growth we're seeing in the manufacturing sector right now. It's just finally stabilizing somewhat.
Scott Schneeberger – Oppenheimer: Thanks. That's very helpful. And just in direct sales, Gale, fiscal '11, optimistic in that area? If you could single that out, thanks.
Bill Gale: Well, I'm cautiously optimistic. I don't foresee a lot of new casinos and new hotels being opened, but I do foresee a slight uptick in employment levels, which will require uniforms. And the fact that so many of these institutions have really stopped buying things over the last couple years, they have got to start spending money to refurbish some of their programs. So, we, we feel like there will be an increase in sales in that category, but we're still probably a ways from returning to the heyday of that particular segment.
Scott Schneeberger – Oppenheimer: Thanks very much.
Operator: Our next question comes from Ashwin Shirvaikar with Citigroup.
Phil Stiller – Citigroup: Hi, this is Phil Stiller on for Ashwin. Thanks for taking my questions. I just had a question on the rental business. Can you talk about the amount of revenue growth, return to net units? How you guys think about incremental profitability of each dollar that you get?
Bill Gale: Well, it depends where it comes from. If it comes from an existing customer and we already have the truck stopping there, it is very profitable business. We often also are able to use garments that are in our stockroom. So the amortization of those garments continue, whether they are in service or not until they are fully amortized. If it is from new business, new customers, in the short run, you don't get a lot of profit from that, but as that customer evolves and after the selling costs have been absorbed and the injection of the new garments, those customers become more profitable as we go forward. Right now, I would say our thoughts are that there's going to be, not a lot of growth within existing customers, but there will be some new customers, either that we're going to get from competitors or that we're going to convince that should entertain the uniform rental program. So there will be a little bit of margin pressure from the new customers, but in the long run, they are certainly with five-year contracts, very attractive business.
Phil Stiller – Citigroup: Does your guidance assume margin contraction in the rental unit for this year?
Bill Gale: No. No, it assumes, as Mike said, varies from either very modest increases in some of the costs like medical benefits and energy to essentially kind of flat and with higher revenue growth, a little bit more leverage so that's kind of the range that we gave you at the upper end is, okay, the top line's going to grow a little stronger and, again, as I said, the mix, even in that assumption is that most of it is going to come from new business as opposed to increases in existing customers.
Phil Stiller – Citigroup: Okay. And then just lastly on the, across the balance sheet, I know you guys just want to keep some potential M&A. But is there a certain number that you guys want to keep on the sidelines for that? And how much do you need to operate the business on a daily basis?
Bill Gale: Well, I mean, we would have no problem operating the business with no cash in the balance sheet, because we have such good access to commercial paper that we can fund our operating needs quite well. We would be easily – easily able to absorb a billion dollar-plus acquisition if the right opportunity came along. With our $500 million plus cash hoard, as well as our line of credit with commercial paper of about $600 million, we could easily go out and sell more debt on the markets. So I don't think there would be any concern on that at all. We're just waiting now to see if the right opportunity comes along and if not, we'll figure out other ways to get that cash deployed for our shareholders.
Phil Stiller – Citigroup: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: We'll go next to Vance Edelson with Morgan Stanley.
Vance Edelson – Morgan Stanley: Hi. Thanks for taking the questions. Regarding the selling environment, you pointed out for a couple quarters now how it's taking some increased sales effort to penetrate existing customers and so forth. Can you say that the environment has gotten at all eased here during the fourth quarter? And I guess a related question, is there anything you could tell us about demand trends during the quarter, the monthly progression?
Bill Gale: Well, the – I will say the job growth in the private sector and in the businesses to which uniform rental plays a big part certainly helped. We are still certainly not seeing a lot of jobs coming back. And so the environment is still pretty difficult. We expect that throughout fiscal '11, the job growth is going to continue to be pretty sluggish. And so we don't necessarily think that the environment is going to get much easier, but we do think that as we saw in the fourth quarter, we think it's going to be some very slow, sluggish growth and hopefully no contraction of jobs.
Vance Edelson – Morgan Stanley: Okay. That's helpful. And another M&A question – regarding the candidate that you are tracking? Which direction would say domestic valuations are currently having, is there any sense that attractive pricing that exists now might not last, making this possibly the time to make some more moves?
Mike Hansen: I don't see any pressure real upward on prices and valuations. In fact, if anything, I think some sellers may consider some of the tax consequences, awaiting much longer to sell their business, that they are not going to get. The government's going to get a little bit more piece of any gain that they have. So I would hope that we might see some opportunities present themselves soon.
Vance Edelson – Morgan Stanley: Okay. Got it. And just one more question. As you look for new customers to spur growth, are there any existing customers that because of their reduced needs, during the sluggish economy are just not as profitable and really not worth servicing anymore? Is it that you would be better off shedding them? Is there any shrinkage of your customer base as a result?
Mike Hansen: Vance, I would say that generally speaking, unless a customer just gets down to only maybe one or two people in uniform, they still remain profitable. It's only when they get down to such a low level that, we have in our contracts a minimum stop charge. And it sometimes becomes just not viable for the customer to continue to obtain the service. Even the small customer, though, with our pretty extensive route structure, it's still profitable to service them. So I don't think we really have that situation that you're envisioning.
Vance Edelson – Morgan Stanley: Okay. Got it. And then maybe just one more. I might have missed it with, but with direct sales showing better growth and actually quite strong growth the past year, is this what you would expect to see at this point in the recovery? Is it a conscious decision on your part to emphasize that, or is the marketplace at all changing?
Mike Hansen: I think the market is reacting again because the hospitality sector, which is primarily what our direct sale business serves, has shown some light recently. And I think that's what you're seeing.
Vance Edelson – Morgan Stanley: Got it.
Mike Hansen: It's been so long since so many of those customers have refreshed their program, as Bill said that some spending is bound to come sooner or later. And keep in mind, in that segment, we're still well below where we were couple years ago. So it's – We've still got a long way to go to see the spending return in that segment.
Vance Edelson – Morgan Stanley: Right. It makes sense. All right. Thanks, guys.
Operator: Our next question comes from Chris McGinnis with Sidoti & Company.
Chris McGinnis – Sidoti & Company: Good afternoon. My question's been answered. Thank you very much.
Operator: (Operator instructions) We'll go next to Vishnu Lekraj with Morningstar.
Vishnu Lekraj – Morningstar: How's it going, guys?
Bill Gale: Hello, Vishnu, well.
Vishnu Lekraj – Morningstar: I want to dig down little deeper into the pressing environment. I know you've been saying that things are improving a little bit. But are you still seeing pricing concessions in terms of current customers and perhaps the concessions for maybe customers you're going after?
Bill Gale: We're seeing – First off, I don't think Mike or I really said the pricing improvement is improving. We're staying saying it's still pretty competitive and we see it both in terms of new customers, no programmers are getting into the service because they are working with multiple providers. And we're also seeing it on any renewal of existing contracts, either with our customers or with our competitors' customers. So to get – Cintas, along with the other uniform rental providers and facility services providers are still trying to keep the routes relatively full and their plants operating nearer to capacity than not, so you're continuing to see aggressive pricing.
Vishnu Lekraj – Morningstar: Right. Okay. When you talk about slow growth or sluggish growth over here for fiscal 2011, is that assuming that employment trends as they currently are, are going to be pulled forward, or do you expect a gradual improvement in these trends? How should we view this in terms of employment affecting your business going forward?
Bill Gale: Our guidance. The guidance that we gave you, basically if you take the upper end of the guidance, what we're saying is we would see modest improvement in employment. If you take the lower end of the guidance, we're saying you're going to see no improvement in employment, it’s just basically speaking.
Vishnu Lekraj – Morningstar: Makes sense. One more question here in Document Management, when we try to think about the growth within this segment, is that going to mainly come more from overseas, your operations overseas or are you going to do basically the balance of domestic overseas? How is that going to mix flow?
Bill Gale: The significant amount of business that we do in that segment is still in the U.S. and that will continue to grow very nicely. The overseas volume is still relatively small, but we see good growth opportunities and we see some nice acquisition opportunities in that business. So I think what, what you're going to see is the predominance of the growth will come domestically, but the foreign stuff certainly is going to be additive to it.
Vishnu Lekraj – Morningstar: Great. All right. Thank you.
Operator: We have no further questions in queue at this time. (Operator instructions) We have no further questions in queue, sir.
Bill Gale: All right. Well, we appreciate everyone joining us today. And we'll look forward to talking to you in the latter part of September, when we discuss our first quarter fiscal 2011 results.
Operator: This concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation.

===== 2010 Q3  (2010-03-18 17:00:00) =====
Executives: Bill Gale – SVP and CFO Mike Thompson – VP and Treasurer Mike Hansen – Corporate Controller
Analysts: Ashwin Shirvaikar – Citi Justin Haki [ph] – Robert W. Baird John Healy – Northcoast Research Nate Brochman – William Blair Scott Schneeberger – Oppenheimer Gary Bisbee – Barclays Capital Greg Halter – Great Lakes Review Andrew Steinerman – JP Morgan
Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Cintas quarterly earnings results conference call. Today’s call is being recorded. At this time, I’d like to turn the call over to Mr. Bill Gale, Senior Vice President of Finance and Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead, sir.
Bill Gale: Good day and thank you for joining us for our discussion of our third quarter fiscal 2010 results. For the quarter ending February 28, 2010, total revenue was $862 million, a 3.7% decrease from the third quarter revenue of fiscal 2009 when adjusting for the one less work day in this year’s third quarter versus last year. Earnings per share were $0.32 versus $0.47 a year ago. This is $0.01 higher than the upper end of our previously issued guidance. We are pleased to see the stabilization in the economy and the significant reduction in job losses. In fact, our total revenues have been relatively comparable over the last four quarters when adjusting for work day differentials. We find this development encouraging, but at the same time, we expect job recovery to be sluggish. We have updated our internal estimates with our third quarter actual results and continue to believe that our previously released fourth quarter guidance is appropriate. Therefore we are reiterating our guidance for the fourth quarter of revenue between $870 million to $890 million and earnings per diluted share of $0.30 to $0.34. Our businesses have been greatly impacted by the large number of job losses and facility closures that have occurred since early in calendar 2008. During this time, we continue to focus on taking care of our customers, but working also to reduce our cost structure and conserve cash. The price environment remains extremely competitive. Despite the most significant recession since the 1930s, we are pleased to report that our financial condition has strengthened, leaving us with over $550 million in cash and marketable securities and with no short-term debt. Our ratio of net debt to capitalization improved to 9%, down from over 21% a year ago. Reflecting the strong cash flow and confidence in our business, last week we paid an annual dividend of $0.48 per share, continuing our practice of raising the dividend every year since going public in 1983. We continue to be very disciplined in making acquisitions, but continue to search for great opportunities at good values. During this quarter, in addition to some small US-based document management and fire service acquisitions, Cintas expanded its presence in the Document Management business in Europe by purchasing a company in Belgium. Combined with our prior European acquisitions in the Netherlands and Germany, we continue to see great opportunities with this business in Northern Europe. We wish to express again our sincere appreciation to all of our employees who we call partners. They are to be complimented for their unwavering focus on taking care of the customer and making Cintas the strong company it is and will continue to be. With me today is Mike Thompson, Cintas’s Vice President and Treasurer, and Mike Hansen, Cintas’s Corporate Controller. After some comments from Mike Thompson and Mike Hansen, we will open the call to questions. The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a Safe Harbor from civil litigation for forward-looking statements. This conference call contains forward-looking statements that reflect the company's current views as to future events and financial performance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those we may discuss. I refer you to the discussion on these points contained in our most recent filings with the SEC.
Mike Thompson: Thanks, Bill. I will talk about our income statement. Our third quarter had 64 workdays, one less than last year’s third quarter as well as this year’s second quarter, both of which had 65 workdays. Total revenue for the third quarter of fiscal ’10 was $862 million and represented a 3.7% decrease from the third quarter of last year on an adjusted workday basis. As compared to this year’s second quarter, revenue declined 1% on an adjusted workday basis. While US job losses and revenue pressures continue, new business sold to prospects and to existing customers has generally offset these losses, allowing total revenue to be stable over the last four quarters on an adjusted workday basis. Total company internal growth was negative 3.6%, an improvement from second quarter internal growth of negative 10%. As a reminder, there are 66 workdays in this year’s fourth quarter. Note that in fiscal 2011, workdays will actually be the same as fiscal 2010. That means there will be 66 workdays in Q1, 65 in Q2, 64 in Q3, and 66 in Q4. We have four reportable operating segments; Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products, Uniform Direct Sales; First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection services; and Document Management services. Uniform Direct Sales; First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection services; and Document Management services are combined and presented as other services on the face of the income statement. The Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products operating segment consists of the rental and servicing of uniforms, mats, towels, and other related items. The segment also includes restroom supplies and other facility products and services. Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products revenue accounted for 72% of company revenue in the third quarter. Rental revenue was $622.5 million for the quarter, a 6.3% decrease as compared to last year’s third quarter on an adjusted workday basis and down 1.8% as compared to last quarter on an equivalent workday basis. The sequential decrease of 1.8% is largely due to the impact of holiday closures and weather related issues. Internal growth was negative 6%, an improvement from second quarter internal growth of negative 9.5%. While still declining, US job losses have moderated. This moderation of job losses as well as of our efforts to maintain our existing customer base as a result of an improvement on a loss business metric and the stops within our ad stop metric as compared to both last year’s third quarter and this year’s second quarter. However, achieving new business and traditional customer adds continues to be difficult in an economy where jobs have not yet been added. Competitive pricing in the marketplace for both customer retention and new business continues to be aggressive. However, as long as it makes economic sense, we will continue to vigorously fight our competition in the marketplace. We are protecting our market share, and our customer satisfaction level remains high. Our Uniform Direct Sales operating segment includes the direct sale of uniforms, branded promotional products, and other related products to national and regional customers. Uniforms and other related products are also sold to local customers, including products sold to rental customers through our direct sale catalog. Uniform Direct Sales revenue accounted for 11% of company revenue in the third quarter. Revenue levels in this segment continue to be soft, as customers are maintaining uniform programs, but few are upgrading or refreshing them. Last year’s third quarter marked the most dramatic sequential revenue decline in this business during the current downturn. We are now 12 months out from that decline. Internal growth was negative 1% in the current third quarter. While growth has not returned, we have seen stabilization in this business. The third quarter internal growth rate of negative 1% marks a sizable improvement from the 17% decline last quarter. Looking forward, we continue to believe further economic stabilization needs to occur before customer spending under these more discretionary types of programs returns to more traditional levels. Our First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection services operating segment includes revenue from the sale and servicing of first aid products, safety products and training, and fire protection products. First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection revenue accounted for 9% of company revenue in the third quarter. During the quarter, revenues within our First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection services operating segment decreased 8% versus last year’s third quarter. Internal growth was negative 6%, an improvement from negative 17% last quarter. As with Uniform Direct Sales, last year’s third quarter marked the most dramatic sequential decline in First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection revenue throughout this economic downturn. Going forward, we expect to see better year-over-year revenue comparisons. The first aid and safety revenue in this segment decreased 5% from last year’s third quarter and was down slightly compared to the second quarter, excluding the normal holiday impact. Fire protection services revenue was down 12% from the third quarter of last year. However, fire services revenue increased 7% over the second quarter as we continued to focus on test, inspection and repair service. Our Document Management services operating segment includes document destruction, storage, and imaging services. Document Management increased 8% of third quarter total company revenue, up from 7% in the second quarter. Revenue increased 29% over the third quarter of fiscal 2009 and 10% over the second quarter of this year. Internal growth was 27%. Recycled paper prices strengthened significantly during the third quarter and accounted for the significant lift in the internal growth rate from 9% in the second quarter to 27% in the third quarter. When excluding the impact of recycled paper revenue, internal growth for document destruction service and purge business was a robust 15%. We continue to expand our geographic presence. And as Bill mentioned earlier, we have expanded into Belgium. While small relative to the company in total, our European businesses are performing to expectations. We continue to look for additional document management acquisition opportunities, both domestically and abroad. Turning to margins, we continue to actively manage our cost structure in order to maximize results during this challenging environment. Total company gross margin for the third quarter was 41.7% a 30 basis point improvement from the third quarter of last year. This improvement came in spite of a 20 basis point increase in energy cost from last year’s third quarter. Third quarter total company gross margin decreased 10 basis points from the second quarter. However, total energy cost increased 40 basis points from the second quarter to the third quarter. Rental gross margin of 42.7% was down 110 basis points from last year’s third quarter. Lower revenue levels and one fewer workday this year compared to last year’s third quarter pressured rental gross margins. In addition, energy costs increased by 20 basis points. However, as compared to last year’s third quarter, expenses were reduced by $23 million on a dollar basis. Rental gross margin declined 80 basis points compared to the second quarter. Energy cost increased 50 basis points in the third quarter compared to second quarter. The one fewer workday in the third quarter also contributed to the lower margin. Other services gross margin was 39.2% for the quarter as compared to 34.7% in last year’s third quarter and 37.3% last quarter. All operating segments within other services had gross margin improvements compared to last year’s third quarter and compared to the second quarter. Uniform Direct Sales gross margin improved significantly from last year due to our cost savings initiatives of the past year and the right-sizing of the organization. Gross margin improved slightly from last quarter. However, gross margins continue to be stressed relative to historical levels due to lower fixed cost absorption from lower revenue levels and fewer new program redesigns and rollouts. Third quarter First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection margins improved primarily due to the elimination of the lower margin fire installation business over the past year. Document Management gross margin improved primarily as a result of recycled paper prices. Gross margins also benefited [ph] from revenue gains, allowing local operations to cover larger portion of their fixed costs. Selling and administrative expenses were 32% of revenue, an increase from 28.3% for the third quarter last year. In addition to the impact of lower revenues and one less workday, selling expenses increased by 120 basis points compared to last year’s third quarter. Sales commissions paid on ads where the sales force was involved have increased. Traditionally, as it occurred, when our existing customers hire additional workers and/or add additional services for growth reasons. Unfortunately, this is still not the case today. Rather, the primary adds, which we are achieving by selling new and different products and services to our existing customers and in many cases using our sales force to obtain this further customer penetration. We also continued our planned increase in sales force headcount. As the economy stabilizes, we have positioned ourselves to take advantage of opportunities, as they begin to arise. In addition, medical expenses increased 80 basis points compared to last year due to higher employee utilization of the medical plans. Sequentially SG&A increased from the second quarter mainly due to a combination of the reset of payroll taxes on January 1st, the increased planned investment in selling, and an increase in medical costs. Our effective tax rate was 32.8% for the quarter, which reflects the timing of specific reserve builds and releases under FIN 48. Since the adoption of FIN 48, our effective tax rate has decreased during the third quarter due to the timing of reserve requirements, but then returned to higher levels for the remainder of the year. We expect this to be the case again this year and anticipate that our effective tax rate for fiscal 2010 will be approximately 37.3%. And now Mike Hansen will discuss our balance sheet and cash flow.
Mike Hansen: Thanks, Mike. Our balance sheet continues to get stronger, primarily due to robust cash flow. Our cash and marketable securities increased almost $72 million from November 30th. Over the last 12 months, we have increased our cash and marketable securities on hand by over $390 million and paid an annual dividend of $74 million. DSOs on accounts receivable were 39, an improvement from November’s DSOs of 41. We continue to aggressively manage our accounts receivable in order to lessen any impact from current economic conditions. New goods inventory levels at February 28th were consistent with the levels at the end of the last quarter. We believe current levels are appropriate based on our current revenue level and mix. Net property, plant and equipment balances increased slightly from November 30th to $895 million. CapEx through the first nine months of this year was $79 million, including $31 million in the third quarter. This is about 60% of the amount we spent through nine months of last year when CapEx was $133 million. Accrued liabilities increased as of February 28 due to the $74 million accrual of the annual dividend, which was paid on March 10. The dividend of $0.48 continued the company’s track record of increasing the annual dividend every year since going public in 1983. Long-term debt at February 28 remained at $786 million, as all outstanding debt is now fixed rate. Any early retirement of this debt will require a prepayment penalty and is not currently attractive. Our average rate on the outstanding debt is approximately 6%. Total debt as a percentage of total book capitalization remained at 24%, while net debt or long-term debt less cash and marketable securities as a percentage of total capitalization improved to 9%. As mentioned earlier, our cash flow continues to be strong. Through nine months we have generated over $275 million in cash and cash equivalents. Acquisition activity has picked up to some degree, as we spent $35 million during the quarter with acquisitions primarily in document management and fire, repair and inspection services. Our combined cash flow, current cash balances, and access to additional capital had provided us the ability to weather the economic difficulties of the last 18 months and are allowing us to now begin to act on acquisition opportunities that become available at attractive valuations. Thank you. And we will now take any of your questions.
Operator: Thank you. (Operator instructions) And we’ll take our first question from Ashwin Shirvaikar with Citi.
Ashwin Shirvaikar – Citi: Thanks. Hi, Bill, Mike and Mike.
Bill Gale: Hi.
Mike Thompson: Hi, Ashwin.
Ashwin Shirvaikar – Citi: My first question is, is it possible for you guys to talk a little bit more quantitatively about the things such as pricing and ad stops [ph] in ballpark? I know you don’t give exact numbers, but in ballpark.
Bill Gale: Well, generally speaking, I would tell you that ads have improved over the last couple of quarters to basically equate to the stops. So we are very close to having a neutral impact on that for several weeks over the last couple quarters. So that’s a positive sign. Now, keep in mind, some of those ads -- or a lot of those ads are not necessarily new wares, but rather our additional products and services at existing customers. As far as pricing is concerned, I think as we mentioned in our comments, it continues to be very, very competitive. And we are finding it probably one of the most aggressive price environments that we have seen for quite some time. Meaning that many of our competitors are in our customers at the end of a contract and offering very low prices. We are finding some difficulty in obtaining price increases during the contracts themselves. And as we get new business, we are often meeting very competitive environment and having to basically get business with lower prices than what we would have seen several years ago. We think a lot of this is due to the desire on the part of our competitors to keep volume in their facilities and cover their fixed costs. So we expect this to continue for some time, but hopefully we will resume to more traditional pricing in the not too distant future.
Ashwin Shirvaikar – Citi: And on the pricing, is that fairly widespread across small and large competitors or is it more of a smaller -- more the larger national competitors?
Bill Gale: Well, I would tell you, some of the larger national players are really the ones who are most aggressive. But in order to keep business, we are finding local and regional players are having to meet much of this price competition also.
Ashwin Shirvaikar – Citi: Okay. And then one question on Document Management. Can you maybe break out -- as you grow the storage piece, break out the destruction versus storage?
Bill Gale: Ashwin, we will intend to break that into further segments as they get larger. At this time, we’re just going to report on the Document Management business in total since it’s just about 8% of our revenue. But given its growth and its growth potential, I would say that at some point in the future we will be giving more detail there.
Ashwin Shirvaikar – Citi: So what I was leading with that was what kind of incremental CapEx investment do you need on the storage side?
Bill Gale: Well, we are really not very aggressive on the storage side. Our growth is primarily coming from shredding side. So our capital spending is mostly with trucks and with plant-based shredding and bailing systems.
Mike Thompson: The revenue is still predominantly from the destruction side of the business.
Ashwin Shirvaikar – Citi: Right, right. And last question, any update on (inaudible)?
Mike Thompson: On Suda [ph], certainly it’s across the board we’ve seen increases, but it varies widely. So we’ve certainly seen an increase not only with the reset of payroll taxes, but certainly some of the preliminary hits we’ve seen coming through on the state have been significantly higher. We don’t have a good quantification efficacy. We are still seeing the impact of those. From the healthcare side, certainly we don’t know what’s going to happen with the healthcare legislation coming up this weekend. But we’ve certainly seen some increased usage in this quarter by our employees again. It tends to ebb and flows. There is no real reason other than we have a medical plan our employees are using it.
Bill Gale: And keep in mind, most of the costs that we are seeing in the third quarter tends to be late in calendar ’09. And as you get near the end of a calendar year, employees often will use more medical expenses than they otherwise like. But I will remind you that our medical expenses in the first quarter were about 4.4% of our revenue, dropped in the second, but then kind of came back up to this level of 4% here in the third quarter. So it is something that we are continuing to monitor, and we had some plan changes go into effect January 1 that we believe will help us control costs as we move through 2010, but they really haven’t get yet.
Ashwin Shirvaikar – Citi: Okay. Thank you, guys. Very useful.
Operator: And we’ll take our next question from Justin Haki [ph] with Robert W. Baird.
Justin Haki -- Robert W. Baird: Good evening, guys.
Mike Thompson: Hi, Justin.
Bill Gale: Hello.
Justin Haki – Robert W. Baird: Hi. My question really is on the rental operating margin. I mean, it fell 400 basis points sequentially. I know a lot of that was on the SG&A side just from the added headcount that you have. But I was hoping that you could give a little more color on what your expectations are kind of for 4Q and really for the first half of ’11. I mean, do we -- is it wrong for us to assume that things get better from here or do they kind of hover at this level?
Bill Gale: Well, I think a lot of it depends on what happens with the top line. If we continue to see stabilization in the business, I think you will see improvement in those margins, assuming that there is no big energy spike -- energy cost spike. So our expectations are that we will begin to see some leverage on those margins as we go forward. And we are hopeful that that will take place.
Mike Thompson: Additionally, you also have the third quarter is a little different because of the workdays. So again, depending on what happens with the economy going forward, we would hope to get some benefit Offsetting that, obviously we will have some selling costs because we are keeping the sales force if you’re looking at operating versus gross margins pretty active.
Justin Haki – Robert W. Baird: I guess, I mean, just to push on a little bit more though. I mean, with your commentary that pricing is so aggressive and you are having to kind of take a haircut on some of your new business that you’re bringing in, I mean, even if we do see some employment growth, I mean, are we talking about maybe margins improve 100 basis points over the next couple quarters or is that too aggressive?
Bill Gale: We are not prepared to quantify the amount at this time.
Justin Haki – Robert W. Baird: Okay. And then another question, just on RFID, I know you guys have talked about that in the past, any update on just your thinking on that? Is that an investment you still consider pursuing?
Bill Gale: Yes, we are still very interested, and we are continuing to evaluate various chips and various processes within our R&D group. I can tell you that right now we do not have a viable economic solution, but we still think the potential exists and we are continuing to invest in looking for that.
Justin Haki – Robert W. Baird: Great. Thank you very much.
Operator: We will take our next question from John Healy with Northcoast Research.
John Healy – Northcoast Research: Hi, good evening, guys.
Bill Gale: Hi, John.
John Healy – Northcoast Research: I wanted to talk a little bit about the balance sheet and the cash flow. You guys continue to generate a lot of cash and make the balance sheet even more pristine than it has been in the past. I wanted to talk a little bit about what you feel like your access to credit is right now in terms of the cost and the flexibility to take a commercial paper and maybe what your (inaudible) of debt, what do you think the credit markets would -- what that would cost you, and kind of how you feel about taking leverage of this company in the future and maybe kind of your thoughts on capital allocation kind of going forward from here?
Mike Thompson: Sure. I’ll start and then Bill will also jump in if he can. Certainly we believe our access to capital has never been better. The market has stabilized. We have $600 million CP line out there being untapped really because there is no reason to tap and put on the balance sheet. We continue to look at acquisition opportunities, but certainly we have plenty of cash in our balance sheet to use. Historically, we’ve gone as high as a 35% to 40% debt-to-capital, and we’re comfortable with that. Right now, our net debt-to-capital is less than 10. So it gives us a lot of space to move. And looking at the current markets, we are certainly in constant communication with our banking group, and we believe we could easily float quite a bit of debt, easily $500 million to -- even up to $1 billion that would do the CP line, not that we hate it today, but you’re talking rates in the 5.5 to 6.0 range depending on the term. Our name in the market has been very good. Whenever we floated CP, it’s never been an issue to put it out to the marketplace and get favorable rates. It’s just funding the opportunity for the need for that cash, and we believe there will be an opportunity in the future.
Bill Gale: As far as capital allocation, our current thought continues to be to invest for growth in the company, both for internal growth as well as for acquisitions. You notice that we did ramp up the acquisitions a bit in the third quarter, as opportunities presented themselves that had been not really there earlier in the 2009. And we expect that to continue. So if we cannot make good acquisitions and utilize this cash that would be in the best long-term interest of our shareholders, then the Board is committed to look at other ways to get return back to our shareholders. That means by our stock, increasing the dividend, whatever it will take to make sure that we generate an adequate return for the shareholders. But right now, we believe that acquisitions will become more and more available at reasonable prices in the not too distant future, and we hope to take advantage of that.
John Healy – Northcoast Research: It’s very helpful. And then I want to ask you guys a little bit about the gross margin potential for kind of the current uniform business. I was wondering if you could kind of put some thoughts around when we should begin to kind of see some more (inaudible) we are going to see some improvement on the rental gross margins. And I thought being at some point in time, when you begin to anniversary some of the larger losses of customers in your business and some of those (inaudible) that have been in merchandising service become fully amortized that maybe aren’t being put in place right now. You should have some gross margin recovery, even if revenues remain pretty -- revenue growth remains pretty muted. Are we thinking about that right, and maybe your thought process on when that should begin to be seen in the results?
Mike Thompson: You are saying about that right. Remember, we’ve had to adjust our cost structure dramatically over the last 18 months and done a decent job of doing that given the revenue declines. Certainly, when you rotate that fixed cost we have in place, we remain such that when the revenues grow or stabilize, we will see some other benefits of what we’ve been doing internally. Right now, job losses continue; revenues are still declining to some degree although lessened as far as existing business. So there is still that churn effect going on within Cintas of profitable business of 15 men uniform going to 13 men, while I’m adding in new services, so I’ve got a kind of a double hit and I’m losing profitable business and adding in the first share of an agreement where it’s pretty expensive. As you move forward depending on how much new business you sell with that material cost impact is in the sale cost. You should see gross margins improve especially because of selling below the gross margin line. So we expected to improve again depending on what goes on the marketplace. We need the job loss to be stable at zero versus continuing to drag down. Let’s see if we are getting closer to that. But every time we think the next month is going to be the zero month; it’s still a little bit down. So hopefully we will get there.
Bill Gale: We’ve got excess capacity in our plants and in our routes and obviously within our stock rooms, meaning that we have a lot of garments that are continuing to be amortized that could -- that aren’t generating any revenue. So if -- as Mike just said, if we just get stabilization with an existing customer, you are going to see an improvement in gross margins just from that because we will not have to keep shuffling around trying to advantage the capacity as much as we are having to do. So I think that’s the first sign of really an improvement. And then as we can obtain other new customers and begin to make those customers profitable by growing with them, start seeing some churn in the work force, which generate additional revenues for us, people leave jobs and go to other jobs, I think that you will see an improvement going forward.
Mike Thompson: And the other piece behind that obviously is with that capacity that we have begun utilizing a little better. There is -- we don’t believe there needs to be a significant increase in CapEx or cash flows to just continue to be very positive.
John Healy – Northcoast Research: When I think about kind of free cash flow maybe going out maybe a year -- or maybe a year or two, is it realistic to think that the capacity that’s still in the business that CapEx should remain at lower levels and maybe historic levels for the intermediate timeframe?
Bill Gale: It should as long as couple things. Again, we have a very localized service model. So if one market or geographic area would spike, there could be some additional capital required or we were to expand with quicker document management or something or we need to access or obviously not free cash flow, but from acquisitions you could use some cash. But I’d agree to your statement.
John Healy – Northcoast Research: Okay. Thank you, guys.
Bill Gale: Thank you.
Operator: And we’ll take our next question from Nate Brochman with William Blair.
Nate Brochman – William Blair: Good evening, gentlemen. Nice quarter.
Bill Gale: Thank you, Nate.
Nate Brochman – William Blair: Hey, why don’t you expand a little bit more on some of the additional services that you are able to sell into your existing customer base? Obviously, that’s probably a nice trend in terms of over the last couple of years building out some of those service categories. And I was just wondering why it seems like right now in terms of that’s gaining a little bit of added traction.
Bill Gale: Well, I think it’s gaining traction. A couple perspectives. One is our traditional focus on our part to do it. As Mike mentioned in the commentary, we are now utilizing our professional sales force in addition to our service group to sell into existing customers. So I think that’s helping. I think the second thing is that there is a broader offering of products and services than we’ve ever had in the past. So we have more appeal to customers of doing other things for them. And I think the third thing is that I believe there is a better feeling of what the future holds on the part of our customers and what things look like a year ago or so. So people are beginning to gain some confidence. They are still being conservative, but they are willing to take on some additional offerings now, but maybe a year ago they absolutely were not.
Nate Brochman – William Blair: Okay. That’s very helpful. And then kind of a follow-on question to that would be, if indeed the customers are starting to feel a little bit better, are you starting to get that sense from maybe some of the non-programmers out there in terms of warming up to investing again back in the uniform program, at least in terms of like the sales cycle there?
Bill Gale: Nate, in hearing from our sales force, we are hearing there is a lot of interest, and more interest now than there was a year ago or even six months ago. I haven’t really seen it in the numbers yet. But at least as far as interest in verbals, there seems to be some momentum moving forward.
Mike Thompson: Attitudes seem to be much better. I wouldn’t say they are extremely positive, but they are not negative anymore. So they are certainly moving in that direction.
Nate Brochman – William Blair: That’s great. Well, it sounds like everything is moving in the right direction, and nice job.
Mike Thompson: Thank you.
Operator: We will take our next question from Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer.
Scott Schneeberger – Oppenheimer: Thanks. Good afternoon.
Bill Gale: Hi, Scott.
Scott Schneeberger – Oppenheimer: Could you guys address what type of weather impact you incurred in the quarter and how you think that may impact the fourth quarter?
Bill Gale: We actually were pleasantly surprised that the weather had a relatively minor impact on our businesses, especially in the Northeast during the quarter. If you recall, when we put out the guidance in mid-February, we’ve put in an additional caveat that we were concerned what was happening with the weather and how that could impact our businesses. But I have to give it to our operating people and our drivers, they did a phenomenal job of servicing customers. And the impact was less than was thought it could have been when we kept cheering about the horrible snowstorms and closures throughout the Northeast.
Scott Schneeberger – Oppenheimer: Thanks, that’s helpful. And then obviously reiterating fourth quarter guidance, but any feel for the high enrolling of the range on the health [ph] of those comments?
Bill Gale: Not at this point. I think we have to continue to keep the relatively broad amount of guidance that we gave you the range, because some many things going to happen in the next 10 to 12 weeks. So I would say that the only comfort area we are in right now is the guidance we just provided.
Mike Thompson: We keep getting mixed signals on our KPIs, and we would like to see some trend developing. We just haven’t seen the trend change enough to change -- either tighten that range or change the range. So we feel appropriate to deploy [ph] where it is at this time.
Scott Schneeberger – Oppenheimer: Okay, thanks. And then I noticed you guys did do the acquisition in the quarter, and I think the most you spent in two years in a quarter. A, how is the pipeline? B, is this predominantly going to be in the document category and maybe a little in fire service that actually surprise me a bit? Or is there a strong work rate now at uniform rental? And I think you’ve been talking about how you’re waiting for valuations to come down in that category of supply. Four questions in there, but if you could (inaudible). Thanks
Bill Gale: The pipeline is certainly fuller than it was last quarter, which was fuller than it was six months ago. So there is a lot of discussions beginning to take place. We are seeing the predominant amount of activity -- or let’s say, activity that where action can be taken on in the document management and in the fire service business. But when I say fire service, I do not include installation. We are looking at strictly the service business itself of the inspection of fire distinguishers, emergency exit lights, et cetera -- kitchen fire suppression system. So that’s where we are focusing on, and there is a lot of acquisition candidates out there albeit most of them are relatively small, but we are targeting them and document management to expand our footprint throughout the US, and then we are now beginning to look at tuck-ins in existing operations. The uniform rental business is still very attractive to us. As we’ve mentioned in several of these calls recently, there was a big disconnect between the sellers and the buyers as to what the business was really doing and what the future held in the short-term, what kind of volume we are buying and how much of it was going to be there six months later or a year later. If stabilization does continue, then I think that the attractiveness of uniform rental will start to increase because we know we will have a better idea of what we are getting. So we are still interested in it. There is tremendous synergies we can get from them. There are some very nice acquisition opportunities, both big and small in the industry. And we will certainly pursue them if they make sense.
Scott Schneeberger – Oppenheimer: Thanks. And just one more quick follow-up on that. More of a bias internationally or domestically, and how much of the cash is held on to the border? Thanks.
Bill Gale: The predominant amount of interest is domestic. International is still relatively small. We have a small team also looking at it. But you’re going to see the majority of the acquisitions I think in the domestic side. As far as what’s held north of the border, it’s a little over $100 million. I think it’s about $140 million.
Scott Schneeberger – Oppenheimer: Okay. Thanks, guys.
Operator: And we’ll take our next question from Gary Bisbee with Barclays Capital.
Gary Bisbee – Barclays Capital: Hey, guys, good afternoon.
Mike Thompson: Hi, Gary.
Gary Bisbee – Barclays Capital: Can you give us a sense -- you said you are remaining very disciplined on acquisitions. What do you mean by that? Is there a certain hurdle rate? How do you guys define discipline?
Bill Gale: Hurdle rates and expectations, when we put together the economics of an acquisition, what our expectations are for growth versus perhaps what others may think, so we take I would say a conservative view of what we believe that business will bring to us, and then obviously that drives the IRR. So that’s where I think the discipline comes in.
Mike Thompson: Also making sure in a more difficult environment that we look at earn-outs or hold-backs to help us, because again while things are getting less cloudy, they are still cloudy. So we will make sure that we are not the one putting on all the risk on the acquisition many times.
Gary Bisbee – Barclays Capital: Would -- does valuation relative to where your stock is trading play any part or is it all building in IRR? I guess what I’m getting at is if you use cash, which is obviously low cost -- and it’s pretty low cost debt, would you consider paying much higher EBITDA multiple than you trade at if that would get you an attractive growing business, say, in document or one of the areas that -- one of the non-uniform areas?
Mike Thompson: That’s strong. Maybe it depends on the circumstance. But certainly if we felt the long-term it was really going to drive future growth and opportunity, we may do that, but for the most part, we understand there is a buy ourselves or buy other potential there. So we’re always looking at both. But again, you can’t look at in a vacuum on a straight financial decision. You’ve got to look out and look at what it’s going to do versus the competition, access to markets that we’re not in today, and also locking up markets that we are in today.
Gary Bisbee – Barclays Capital: I guess the reason I ask -- I’m not trying to harp on this, I’m just trying to understand the thought process. You’ve done a terrific job generating cash. The balance sheet is better than it looked in an awfully long time by many valuation metrics. Over the past year, your stock has been cheap. And yet you haven’t brought back any stock in seven quarters, and the acquisitions while maybe picking up a little bit, there are really small mom-and-pop deals that don’t seem like -- unless you did an awful lot of them, they would have a real significant impact. But I guess I’m trying to understand maybe what you are waiting for or if there is some reason you haven’t been a little more aggressive given the strong shape of your cash flow and balance sheet.
Bill Gale: Yes. I think that the -- let's don’t have a short memory here. It wasn’t more than 12 months ago I think many people felt we were dropping into a depression, and there was tremendous concern about the viability of the financial industry in the whole US economy, the world economy for that matter. So, to say that we may be missed an opportunity to buy our stock, I think we were looking at making sure the company could continue to survive and withstand anything that it met. And so it’s really just been very recently that things are starting to look a little bit better, and we are not out of the woods yet. And acquisitions, you don’t just decide day one you are going to start buying companies up and then you will start seeing them happening within a couple months. It takes a while to do the coding and to do the analysis and et cetera. So I think you need to be a little patient and just recognize that we are not going to just rush into something (inaudible) we have confidence in the future and then we know what we are getting makes a lot of sense. And I think hopefully you will begin to see some of that happen, but as I said earlier, to me, if it doesn’t then we will have to deploy the cash somehow than either through buying our stock back or doing some other way of returning -- getting better returns for our shareholders.
Gary Bisbee – Barclays Capital: Okay. I didn’t mean to insinuate that you had missed an opportunity. I’m just trying to probe sort of how you think about it going forward. I guess just one more question on that -- on that line of thinking, and I’m certainly not asking for mains or anything, but do you see, as you look at the landscape of the business that you are in, any potential targets out there that could have more than just a token impact in the short-term on the mix of your businesses? In other words, are there some mid-sized assets out there that could be attractive in document or fire? Or is it much more likely to be, as you’ve historically more often than not, in a bunch of small mom-and-pop?
Bill Gale: Gary, we have a list. I mean, we have a very extensive list of knowing our competitors in all of the businesses we are in. And we have interest in companies, both large and small in all of our businesses. I would tell you in the fire service business, there really isn’t another big competitor outside of Cintas and Tyco. And I don’t think Tyco is going to be interested in selling their division, and it’s much larger than ours is anyway. But in document management, there are several good sized companies that would be attractive. There are a lot of good regional players that would be attractive. And in uniform rental, I don’t need to tell you that there are some very good sized players. There are some great regional players, and there are still a lot of local players. We know all of -- who they are, and we will certainly pursue those that look like that they could be doable at the right price.
Gary Bisbee – Barclays Capital: Okay. And then just one last one, can you give us a sense what type of offerings customers are adding on? You said you’re getting ads, but a lot of it is from the ability to up-sell the more stuff. You got --
Bill Gale: It covers the gamut of our different service groups and what they can offer. For example, in the uniform, I’d say, the rental business, we’ve expanded our facility services line now to include a lot of hygiene services, a lot of floor care, chemical dispensing, the restroom cleaning services. Those have provided our customers with a lot of different opportunities to outsource some of the services that they need to have done at a price cheaper than what they can indeed do it themselves. So that’s one example. In the first aid and safety and fire service, we are doing a lot of training. Our safety supply sales are growing very nicely. Our -- the external defibrillators continue to do very well. Document Management, we have expanded into doing some imaging work for some of our larger customers. And we do have storage capability in certain markets. So each business has something that can broaden the offerings to the customers that they have or appeal to customers that we have in some of the other businesses.
Gary Bisbee – Barclays Capital: Great. Thanks a lot.
Operator: We’ll take our next question from Greg Halter with Great Lakes Review.
Greg Halter – Great Lakes Review: Yes, good afternoon.
Mike Thompson: Yes, Greg.
Greg Halter – Great Lakes Review: Just wondering if you could provide a status of the SAP initiative and what your costs so far have been on that in this fiscal year.
Bill Gale: We are fully converted in the financial system under SAP, and it’s gone reasonable well. As far as where we stand, we are looking -- we are working right now on converting our supply chain. And that is still in process, and hopefully we will be converting that sometime this fall. We are looking at other -- some of our business units and how they can be integrated into SAP. And so there is some, what they call, blueprinting going on with a couple of those businesses right now. As far as the costs are concerned, I’m not prepared to tell you exactly what we’ve spent right now. But the bulk of the spending was done last fiscal year. However, we continue to spend at a lower rate this fiscal year and going into the -- I would say probably at 40% to 50% of what we spent in the last year. And this will be a multi-year effort because we have -- each of the businesses will be looked at, and if make sense, will be converted into SAP also.
Greg Halter – Great Lakes Review: Okay. And relative to capital spending, what is your budget for 2010 -- fiscal ’10?
Bill Gale: We are looking at a $100 million to $120 million of CapEx for fiscal 2010. So I think we’ve spent, what, $78 million year-to-date. So somewhere between $30 million to $40 million in the fourth quarter is probably what’s going to happen.
Greg Halter – Great Lakes Review: And would you expect that to ramp up in fiscal ’11?
Bill Gale: Somewhat, not substantially. But it could have some marginal increase, given the improvement in the economy.
Greg Halter – Great Lakes Review: Okay. And one final one for you. Relative to the first aid segment, the income before tax there has been down year-over-year for quite a while. I think you are at $2 million now on a pretax basis. And it seems like it’s been on a steady decline. And just wondering what the management team is doing relative to stemming that -- reversing it?
Mike Thompson: There are two things in there. First, the fire installation business was certainly a drag for a couple of years and we’ve exited that business as of last quarter. And certainly the change in the external economic conditions that honestly hit first aid harder than we expected because of the tie in the headcount. So with that drop in revenue that happened very quickly was the other piece over the last 15 months or so has impacted us. So we expect going forward, again depending on what happens in the external economy, but being out of the installation business will certainly help. And then with that, a stabilization in the revenue -- the top line revenue we expected to turn. And certainly we are cognizant of it. We are watching our cost structure there. We believe they are both very good businesses to be in. And again, getting out of the installation business as of last quarter will certainly make the future comparables better.
Greg Halter – Great Lakes Review: Okay, thank you.
Operator: (Operator instructions) And we’ll go next to Andrew Steinerman, JP Morgan.
Andrew Steinerman – JP Morgan: Hi there. Mike, could you talk about what level of rental gross margins of uniforms and items (inaudible) fourth quarter guidance and maybe kind of what headwinds and tailwinds might go in that number relative to the third quarter just reported for rental gross margins?
Bill Gale: We don’t provide details on the guidance for the fourth quarter other than we certainly have indicated we believe everything to continue to be sluggish from the top line, which certainly keeps the bottom line relatively stable other than what happens with energy. Typically when we look forward to energy, we forecast based on where it is at the current time of that guideline announcement. So we have energy factored in at this point at current levels. As far as what happened in the quarter, certainly, as we indicated, the workday adjustment and also this being our third quarter, the holiday always impacts that -- the gross margin in that business And I think certainly, as we discussed with others on the call, we expect it to improve going forward albeit we need the economy to stabilize. So we’re not continuing to chase the route structure et cetera, as jobs lessen, and you continue to lose that very profitable business. And that continues to be, to some degree, existing today. Now it’s not as bad as it was six to nine months ago, but it continues to occur. So if it’s still bad, it’s still worse than last quarter on a go-forward basis when you lose those jobs. We need that to stop and be zero so that we can start generating it on the upside. Certainly, energy did impact us this quarter. So it’s about 20 basis points sequentially. We expect hopefully that will be flattish in the fourth quarter, but that sounds out of our control. I don’t know if that answer it completely your question, but --
Andrew Steinerman – JP Morgan: Right. And are there other headwinds or tailwinds when thinking about rental gross margins fourth quarter versus third quarter? You just said the energy will be flattish --
Mike Thompson: Fuel cost --
Andrew Steinerman – JP Morgan: Are there any other headwinds or tailwinds to think about in the fourth quarter for rental gross margin?
Mike Thompson: It’s really just volume driven. I think material costs should be okay unless there is a big input [ph] new business, which we’d love to have, by the way. But the material costs should be okay. The service costs should be in line for the most part. Energy cost, I don’t know where it would -- where it’s going to go. So we feel pretty good. Production costs have been pretty consistent.
Bill Gale: It’s strictly a top line impact, I would say, in the short-term, Andrew.
Andrew Steinerman – JP Morgan: Okay. So help me with one more point here. Rental gross margins usually go up the most sequentially in a typical fourth quarter, sequentially for Cintas. Is that, in the past, premature volume driven, but it’s also usually a volume seasonal --?
Mike Thompson: It is typically almost strictly volume driven. We do a little push, because at the end of the year typically in some cases, but it’s typically volume driven because of these extra workdays traditionally.
Bill Gale: And you’ve been building up to that point throughout the year. So you incur -- you set up your organization at an operation. You start incurring the cost earlier in the year and then the volume builds in the rental business as you go. So that’s always been part of the reason why the fourth quarter has always been some of the strongest. The difficulty for us is just like last year, this year it’s a little bit different world out there and they traditionally have a slightly growing economy or positive and we are still losing jobs. So you need to then count a little bit when you look going forward. That’s why we’ve been a little cautious in those statements.
Andrew Steinerman – JP Morgan: Okay. And the medical cost is an SG&A item in that gross margin.
Mike Thompson: That is correct.
Bill Gale: Just to remind everyone, I know you know this, Andrew, but all medical cost for every employee in the G&A line, it’s not located in the production or service area, but rather it’s recorded in G&A.
Andrew Steinerman – JP Morgan: Okay. Thanks for all the questions.
Bill Gale: Thank you.
Operator: And that does conclude our question-and-answer session. At this time, I’d like to turn the call back to you, Mr. Gale, for any additional or closing remarks.
Bill Gale: Well, first off, I want to thank all of you for joining us this evening. And I would also like to announce that Mike Thompson has been asked by our Chief Executive Officer Scott Farmer and our President Phillip Holloman to work in a special operational assignment. During this assignment, which is underway, Mike Hansen will be assisting me with our Investor Relations activity. So while Mike Thompson will be helping us with this quarter’s follow-up, please direct all future requests to either myself or my assistant, Judy Girty. Either Mike Hansen or I will then get back to you as quickly as possible. Thanks again for participating, and we will be announcing our fourth quarter earnings in mid-July.
Operator: That does conclude today’s conference. Thank you for your participation.

Operator: Good day everyone and welcome to the Cintas quarterly earnings results conference call. At this time I’d like to turn the call over to Mr. William Gale, Senior Vice President of Finance and Chief Financial Officer. 
William Gale : Good evening and thank you for joining us. With me today is Michael Thompson, Cintas’ Vice President and Treasurer. After some comments we will be opening the call to questions.  For the quarter ending November 30, 2009 total revenue was $884.5 million, a slight increase over the first quarter of this when adjusted for this quarter’s one fewer work day. While job losses appear to be moderating, the industries in which the majority of our customers operate in, continued to lose jobs. So there still is a negative drag on our revenue.  While we are hopeful that a recovery may be near, we are still uncertain as to when that will occur. We continue to see revenues being below the comparable period in the prior year for the next several quarters.  As a result our key focus will be to continue to take care of our customers, ensuring they value our service offerings. We also recognize the need to continue to right size our organization structure to adapt to the new revenue environment.  We have substantially reduced costs in all areas of the company as Michael will explain shortly. Net income was $57.2 million, down from last year’s $71.8 million, but higher than our first quarter income of $54 million. Please note both our first and second quarters of this fiscal year contained legal settlements that are reported separately on the income statement.  These settlements were made in order to avoid the potential cost and distraction that these cases would have had on the organization for the next few years. During the quarter the company continued to aggressively manage capital spending and acquisitions. We currently have almost $0.50 billion of cash and marketable securities and no commercial paper outstanding.  We are well positioned to aggressively pursue acquisitions when the right opportunities present themselves. We are continuing with our practice adopted last year at this time of providing no guidance. We caution everyone that in our view the recovery in the job market will be slow in coming and will take some time to return to what we saw in the late 90’s or even in the middle of this decade.  We will continue to focus on providing our customers with exceptional service and manage our cost structure efficiently. Because of our view of the sluggish recovery we believe the current analyst estimates are overly optimistic for the remainder of this fiscal year and into 2011. The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a Safe Harbor from civil litigation for forward-looking statements. This conference call contains forward-looking statements that reflect the company's current views as to future events and financial performance.  These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ materially from those we may discuss. I refer you to the discussion on these points contained in our most recent filings with the SEC. I would like to turn the call over to Michael Thompson who will give you more color on the quarter. 
Michael Thompson : Thank you William and good evening everyone. Total revenues for the second quarter of fiscal 2010 were $884.5 million, a 10% decrease from the second quarter of last year. The decrease was mainly due to the significant job loss experienced during this economic downturn. When compared to the first quarter of this fiscal year, revenue decreased 1%.  This year’s second quarter had 65 work days, the same as the second quarter fiscal 2009, but one less work day than the 66 in the first quarter of this fiscal year. When adjusted for the one less work day revenue for the second quarter increased by 1% over the first quarter.  Company internal growth was negative 10%, an improvement from first quarter internal growth of negative 12.5%. Work days for the remainder of this fiscal year are 64 for the third quarter and 66 for the fourth quarter. Our third quarter is traditionally our most challenging quarter due to the lower work days and customer holiday closures.  We anticipate customer holiday closures will be longer and more widespread this year than they have been in better economic climates. Any revenue and earnings estimates for the remainder of this fiscal year should take these factors into account.  We have four reportable operating segments; rental uniforms and ancillary products, uniform direct sales, first aid safety and fire protection services, and document management services. As a reminder on the face of the income statement, uniform direct sales, first aid, safety and fire protection services and document management services are combined and presented as other services. The rental uniforms and ancillary products operating segment consists of the rental and servicing of uniforms, mats, towels, and other related items. The segment also includes restroom supplies and other facility products and services. Rental uniforms and ancillary products revenue accounted for 73% of company revenue in the second quarter.  Rental revenues were $643.6 million for the quarter, a 9.5% decrease in revenues as compared to the second quarter of last year but flat as compared to the first quarter on an equivalent work day basis. While the US economy continued to shed jobs especially within our customers’ industries, we were able to somewhat offset that revenue impact over the last six months and rental revenue has been flat the last three quarters on an adjusted work day basis.  Our lost business metric while slightly higher than the first quarter of this year has improved from fiscal 2009 levels. Our add/stop metric which includes both uniform wearers and facility service products was a positive add metric for the second consecutive quarter. And our second quarter adds were stronger than the first quarter.  The improvement was due to a combination of the moderation in job loss and our continued focus on further penetration into our existing customer base. While these adds have helped maintain our top line revenue, they’ve also increased our selling costs. Offsetting these positives were reduced new business and a difficult pricing environment. New business was down from the first quarter as new customer prospects appear to be hesitant at adding new services in this time of economic uncertainty.  In addition competitive pricing in the marketplace has become more aggressive. Pricing for both customer retention and new business has been challenging. However as long as it makes economic sense we will continue to aggressively fight our competition in the marketplace. We continue to protect our market share and our customer satisfaction level remains high.  Our focus remains on taking care of our customers, enhancing our opportunities for future rental growth. Our uniform direct sales operating segment includes the direct sale of uniforms, branded promotion products, and other related products to national and regional customers. Uniforms and other related products are also sold to local customers including products sold to rental customers through our direct sale catalogue. Uniform direct sale revenue accounted for 11% of total company revenue in the second quarter, up slightly from 10% in the first quarter. While uniform direct sale revenue increased 11% from the first quarter revenue levels continue to be soft. Internal growth was negative 17% in the second quarter a moderation from the negative 25% in the first quarter.  A large amount of this segment’s business is with the lodging, hospitality, and gaming industries. While these industries appear to be stabilizing headcount generally remains low as compared to historical levels. In addition location expansion and existing location refresh programs and/or rebranding initiatives have been isolated.  While customers have begun to plan for future expansion and improvements we expect further economic stabilization needs to occur before these discretionary types of spending return to more traditional levels.  Our first aid, safety and fire protection services operating segment includes revenue from the sale and servicing of first aid products, safety products and training, and fire protection products. First aid, safety and fire protection accounted for 9% of the company’s second quarter revenue as compared to 10% for the first quarter.  During the quarter revenues within our first aid, safety and fire protection services operating segment decreased 19% versus last year’s second quarter and were down 8% on an adjusted work day basis from the first quarter. Internal growth was negative 17% a slight improvement from negative 18% last quarter. While the first aid, and safety revenue in this segment decreased 11% from last year’s second quarter revenue has stabilized and was relatively flat as compared to the first quarter. First aid services and training revenue were positive, as compared to the first quarter while the sale of safety items including AEDs suffered as these items are a more discretionary cost for customers. Fire protection services revenue continued to suffer with revenue down almost 30% from the second quarter of last year and approximately 20% from the first quarter. The majority of this decline is due to the continued pressure on fire installation business. We have exiting the fire installation portion of this business over the last year and that process is now effectively complete.  We continue to focus on the test, inspection, and repair service within fire protection. Test, inspection, and repair revenue was also down but not as dramatically as the installation business. In addition to our focus on exiting the installation business, business closures, competitive pricing pressure, customer price concession requests and seasonal fluctuation all had an effect on this business during the quarter.  Similar to first aid, safety product sales, fire equipment upgrades and enhancements have been lagging as customers delay these purchases and request price concessions. Our document management services operating segment includes document destruction, storage, and imaging services.  Document management represented 7% of second quarter company revenue up from 6% in the first quarter. Revenue increased 13% over the second quarter of fiscal 2009 and 6% over the first quarter. Internal growth was 9%. When excluding the impact of recycled paper revenue and the related impact of recycled paper prices, internal growth for document destruction service and purge business was 15%.  Our document destruction services as well as our storage and imaging services continued to provide solid growth. Recycling revenue was down 12% from the second quarter of last year due to lower paper prices. However beginning in the month of November we have anniversaried the impact from recycled paper prices so moving forward full division revenue comparisons will be more meaningful provided recycled paper prices remain stable.  Turning to margins, we continue to actively manage our cost structure in order to maximize results during this difficult environment. Total company gross margin for the second quarter was 41.8% a 30 basis point decrease from the second quarter of last year. However to combat the decline in revenue cost of goods was reduced by $56 million as compared to last year’s second quarter on a dollar basis.  Total company energy costs improved 60 basis points versus last year. Second quarter total company gross margin decreased 110 basis points from the first quarter while energy costs were flat. Rental gross margin of 43.5% was down 10 basis points from last year’s second quarter. As with the company in total energy costs improved as compared to last year.  The improvement in energy was offset by margin pressure due to reduce revenue levels. However as compared to last year’s second quarter expenses decreased by $38 million on a dollar basis. When adjusted for work days and seasonality rental margins were comparable to the first quarter and as with the company in total energy costs were flat.  As we mentioned last quarter pricing has become more aggressive in the marketplace. While we are maintaining our customer base at historical retention levels, the reduced pricing levels have impacted our margins. Other services gross margin was 37.3% for the quarter as compared to 38.4% in last year’s second quarter and 38.2% last quarter.  The lower margin was due to lower fire revenue within the first aid, safety and fire segment. Within that segment first aid and safety margins were maintained as were margins for fire test and inspection business. However margins continued to be pressured in the fire installation business. As I mentioned earlier we have now essentially exited the installation business and expect fire margins to begin to recover. Uniform direct sales margins were also lower due to reduced revenue levels from last year and a change in sales mix. Generally customers are purchasing base level and general stock garments but have been delaying purchases of more specialized higher end garments.  Document management gross margin was below the second quarter of last year due to lower recycled paper prices. However margins were up as compared to the first quarter due to a combination of higher revenue and improved recycling paper prices as compared to the first quarter. We have achieved a solid national footprint for destruction services and depending on recycled paper prices we expect margins to continue to strengthen as local operations reach scale. We continue to actively pursue document management acquisition opportunities both domestically and abroad. Selling and administrative expenses were 29.3% of revenue an increase from 28.9% for the second quarter last year but an improvement from 29.7% last quarter. We reduced our SG&A spend by over $25 million from the second quarter of last year but the reduction in revenue over that timeframe caused SG&A to increase by 40 basis points.  G&A labor and labor related costs as a percent of sale improved from last year’s second quarter while the relatively fixed types of expenses such as insurance costs, professional fees and property taxes increased on a percent of sale basis. The 40 basis point improvement from the first quarter was due to an improvement in medical costs.  As mentioned in our first quarter earnings call medical costs spiked during our first quarter. While still high medical costs did moderate accounting for 3.7% of revenue. G&A labor also improved as a percent of sale from the first quarter. Partially offsetting these improvements was an increase in selling and bad debt expense. The increase in selling related to commissions paid on add where the sales force was involved.  We have also increased the headcount of our sales force during the quarter. These new sales professionals are currently in training and it typically takes approximately one year for a new sales professional to achieve solid new business sales results. While bad debt increased from the first quarter it remains at a manageable level.  Our effective tax rate was 39.3% for the quarter which reflects the timing of specific reserve builds and releases under FIN 48. Since the adoption of FIN 48 our effective tax rate has increased during the second quarter due to the timing of reserve requirements. But then returned to lower levels for the remainder of the year.  We expect this to be the case again this year and anticipate that our effective tax rate for fiscal 2010 will be approximately 37.5%. Despite the difficult economic environment our balance sheet continues to get stronger primarily due to robust cash flow. Our cash and marketable securities increased $122 million from August 31. Over the last 12 months, we have increased our cash and marketable securities on hand by over $350 million, reduced our outstanding debt by over $80 million and paid an annual dividend of over $70 million. So during the most difficult period in our company’s history, we increased free cash flow, improving combined cash and debt levels by over $430 million and increasing our annual dividend to shareholders.  DSOs on accounts receivable were 41, a slight improvement from August. We continue to actively manage our accounts receivable in order to lessen any impact from current economic conditions. As mentioned earlier bad debt expense increased in the first quarter but it remains at a manageable level.  New goods inventory levels continue to fall as actively manage inventory requirements given reduced demand especially in our uniform direct sale business. Inventory decreased by $19 million from August 31. Net property, plant and equipment balances continue to decline as we have significantly reduced our capital expenditures due to lower revenue levels.  CapEx for the first six months of this year were $48 million including $23 million in the second quarter. This is 50% of the amount we spent through six months of last year when CapEx was $96 million. Our capital expenditures are near maintenance CapEx levels and were consistent by segment with spending in the first quarter. We continue to inject growth capital where appropriate which is mainly in our document management business.  Included in our capital expenditures are costs related to our SAP financial system implementation. Year to date SAP related capital expenditures totaled $10 million including $4 million during the second quarter. Accrued liabilities increased as of November 30 due to increases on retirement and profit sharing, interest on debt, and legal settlement accruals.  long-term debt at November 30 remained at $786 million as all outstanding debt is now fixed rate. Our average rate on the outstanding debt is approximately 6%. Total debt as a percentage of total book capitalization improved to 24% while net debt or long-term debt less cash and marketable securities as a percentage of total capitalization decreased to 11%. We continue to evaluate acquisition opportunities and have sufficient cash and access to capital were opportunities to become available at attractive valuations. Our strong cash flow and robust balance sheet continue to provide us the financial stability to withstand the current economic conditions while enabling us to be poised for future expansion when market conditions improve.  Thank you and we will now take any of your questions. 
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of John Healy – Northcoast Research 
John Healy – Northcoast Research :  Quick question on the margins, as you look at the margins for the business as we go through the remainder of this year and go into 2011 could you talk a little bit about how we should see those margins move in terms of how we should begin to see those heal up and improve from here. I’m trying to understand at what point do you begin to anniversary large losses of employees within your customer base and how we should think about just the margin improvement solely from that fact as we move forward.
William Gale : First off to answer the question on when do we anniversary the large losses, that’s going to take a little longer because we were still losing uniform wearers in our customers up through and including this quarter. Now obviously the rate of loss has declined somewhat but essentially we still saw an awful lot of job losses in the first half of calendar 2009. As for margins what we need is a, further stabilization of revenue and a stabilization in the pricing environment. We saw very aggressive pricing taking place. I think it began in our first quarter but it really seemed to accelerate in the second. We are looking at all of our customers very closely before we grant a price decrease if necessary or looking at new business aggressively to determine whether or not its profitable and has some potential down the road.  But we’re going to have to meet some of those pricing pressures in order to maintain the volume. So I really am uncertain as to when we’re going to see some margin improvement because I don’t know when I’m really start to see some increase in the revenue line and that’s what really we’re going to need to drive this thing forward. 
John Healy – Northcoast Research : And could you talk a little bit about just the environment as a whole, maybe where that pricing pressure is coming from, is it competitors just trying to hold on and stay in business, is it some of your better capitalized players that are maybe pursuing different business strategy. I was also hoping to get a little bit of color on your commentary in the release that talked about plant closures or facility closures, maybe what you’re seeing there, how severe that is and kind of the timing of that. 
William Gale : I think what you have to do, let’s first off make sure that everyone understands that if you just pay attention to the macro changes in the reported jobs that is not going to really tell you what the impact is on our industry. So you’ve got to cut through the reported numbers and look at it by industry and if you look at just the month of November what the government reported where there was only a net decrease of 11,000 jobs, the problem was is that the job losses were still relatively high in our traditional industries that we service.  They were offset by increases in healthcare and education services which really don’t help our revenue lines too much at all. So I think first off one needs to really judge that. But to get back to the first part of your question, there is absolutely a desire on the part of our competitors both big and small to hold onto their business and to continue to replace business that they’ve lost through client closures or through reductions in work forces and so I think they’re trying to offset some of their fixed costs and just continue to have some revenue and some cash flow to withstand this very sluggish recovery that we’re in, I don’t think that’s going to abate in the near-term and I think that we’re going to have to continue to aggressively pursue and hold onto our customers and pursue new customers and that is going to continue to be the margin closures. As for actually facility closures, they are continuing. Customers are continuing to assess whether they want to keep their operations open or keep as many plants open and while its not nearly as bad as it was 12 months ago, or nine months ago it is still an indication that this economy is still in a very precarious state. 
Michael Thompson : And to be clear also in the release we talk about holiday closures, what we’re talking about there is the third quarter typically starting about this time, businesses will close down for the Christmas and New Year’s break and during more difficult times we’ve seen customers take longer breaks and also your concern about will they open back up in this economic environment. So that’s what we talked about in the release. 
John Healy – Northcoast Research : The cash flow you generated was pretty amazing for the first six months of the year and the balance sheet is very solid, you made some comments about being interested in being more active on the acquisition side could you talk a little bit about how big of an acquisition you could make in terms of what level of comfort you would be in terms of taking that on the balance sheet and maybe just remind us what your available commercial paper borrowings could be and other access to liquidity that you would have. 
William Gale : We certainly have commercial paper available to us right now that would enable us to quickly pick up $500 to $600 million in a relatively quick time period. We could also sell some longer-term bonds. We’ve talked to some of our advisors and there would be a very good appetite to increase that. As for the size of acquisition it could be relatively large because I think we have a lot of capacity given the cash flow strength of our businesses, we could easily buy a company very large and put quite a bit of debt on the balance sheet and because of what might happen, or what would continue to happen with cash flow from our existing businesses as well as the acquired businesses we could pay down that debt relatively quickly.  I would just point out what we did in 2002 when we bought Omni Services, we added a lot of debt to the balance sheet but our debt to cap ratio quickly came down because we generated an awful lot of cash from that particular acquisition as well as our existing operations. So we would be very comfortable in a relatively good sized acquisition. 
John Healy – Northcoast Research : Since you brought up the Omni deal if you look at the big players that are still in the space in the uniform side of things, from an industry consolidation standpoint could you see Cintas as an acquirer of still at a large property on there from a DOJ standpoint, would that be something that you think could still happen in this industry. 
William Gale : I think it could but I don’t know what the current attitude on the part of the FTC and this administration would be but we would certainly expect to be able to make a very large acquisition and get it approved. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer 
Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer : As you mentioned in the press release and then again in the prepared remarks some discussion of adding on products and services to customers and also an addition to the sales force in the quarter, could you just speak to (a) on the first subject what were the cross sells that you were doing and two the strategy behind the additional sale folks and what you’re looking at going forward. 
William Gale : We’ve always been interested in trying to become a larger provider of services to our customers so as we have expanded our offerings within our different businesses as well as expanding the number of different businesses we offer, we’ve been very much interested in trying to get our customers where it made sense to take additional services from Cintas. In this period of economic difficulty we’ve turned our existing sales force in our service group to work with our customers to try to find areas where we could provide additional value to them by offering some other services, be it facility services, first aid and safety, document management if it made sense, etc. So that, we’ve really kind of ratcheted that up over the last six months or so. As for increasing the size of our sales force, we also I guess are showing a little bit more confidence now in that what everybody was seeing 12 months ago, you were staring into the potential of a depression, I think we all feel that that’s not going to happen.  And we have seen stabilization that Scot Farmer mentioned in our release of for the last three quarters as far as revenues so we think its time to start training sales people to be prepared to take advantage of the opportunities as the economy really starts picking up. 
Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer : How is utilization running at your facilities and what steps are you taking in good locations and bad.
William Gale : As you may remember back in May we shut down some facilities to improve the utilization of what we had. We haven’t shut anything further down since that time or anything that we had already planned to do. And we’re seeing basically utilization somewhere probably in the mid to upper 70’s from a capacity standpoint. So we’ve got adequate capacity available to grow back into, as the business conditions improve.  And I would think that we should be in a position where we’re going to be able to get by with very little capital expenditure in our rental business because we’ve got that capacity available. We basically have right sized the organization but have kept available to us the ability to add a lot of volume in our plants without having to build new facilities.  Now as Michael mentioned we certainly have to increase capacity in our growth industry which has been document management, that has continued to grow during this entire period and so we are spending money there and getting new trucks available, new facilities opened up so that we can service more markets and I think that we should be sitting pretty well from a capital spending standpoint for the near-term because of the available capacity we have. 
Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer : Could you speak, you mentioned healthcare and education may see a pick up in employment but that doesn’t necessarily translate to your business, could you take us a level or two more granular on where you’re seeing the real pressure among verticals that you serve and are there any bright points. 
William Gale : I don’t really have the details on that to be able to share that with you. I’d just say generally speaking manufacturing continues to be very difficult and while manufacturing isn’t that large a segment of ours it does provide an awful lot of support for a lot of distribution and other service businesses which are customers of ours. So we’re not seeing growth there because the manufacturing base isn’t really growing. Retail continues to be very sluggish and retail has been a target of ours over the last few years. 
Michael Thompson :  I would say the most stable really has been automotive after market, the service stations, dealerships seem to stabilize since all of the turmoil from nine months ago, so in looking at that data that seems to be doing better from our customers standpoint. But again the manufacturing and service industries continue to be hurt. 
Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer : You certainly are projecting that you want to be positioned for acquisitions once you deem the time is right and it doesn’t sound like we’re there just yet, but is there consideration on use of cash beyond the stock pile because you do have access to capital in other ways, is there consideration for share repurchase, any other use of cash that’s being considered or is much more just a very primary focus on the acquisitions.
William Gale : I think that’s a board level decision that the Board continues to evaluate. I would just point you to what our behavior has been over the last 18 months to tell you what the appetite really is right now for the Board with regard to the use of cash. And given that its building up on the balance sheet I would say that barring a significant reduction in the price of our stock where it might be deemed to be a time to perhaps reenter the market I think what we are looking for is the opportunities that we think will come for some very nice acquisitions. 
Michael Thompson : And we think the pipeline right now as it has been for the last six months is pretty good on acquisitions. Its just valuations haven’t come back in line where we think its appropriate yet. So we continue to be actively discussing various acquisitions in the pipeline but they just haven’t come to fruition. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup 
Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup : I wanted to take a step back and ask you about what are your underlying economic assumptions when you say that street estimates are too high because on the one hand you did mention that revenue seems to have stabilized so if you assume stable revenues for the next couple of quarters is that fair in your mind and then on the cost front, you’ve taken an awful costs, are you at a level of operating cost that you feel is optimal for the circumstances, can you talk about that a little bit.  
Michael Thompson : On the first certainly you have to look at where we are year to date and if you look at a stabilized revenue environment and stabilized economy as we indicated in the release we’re not looking at future expansion at this point in time. So combining that outlook with the work day and the holiday closures that we talked about in third quarter I think gives you a feel of where we believe it will be which is a more stable environment than we’ve seen over the last excluding the current month, going back to the previous year and being consistent from there.  We just think the job recovery which does typically lag economic recovery is going to be slow and its not going to be a snap back that we’re going to see jobs being added at a tremendous rate. So that’s our issue from that end. As far as our cost structure we feel we’re in a pretty good spot right now from a cost structure that we have right sized the organization. We do not feel that we need to add a lot of costs back in.  Certainly we have looked at the sales force and seen some opportunities but it takes awhile to train reps and get them up and ready so we’ve taken some steps there. I wouldn’t say they’ve been dramatic but we’ve started to take steps there as we’re being a little cautious in that area as well. 
William Gale : One of the things that I think you need to consider is that often when you’re seeing the adds coming back at your existing customer base that becomes more profitable business. And you get some more leverage there going forward with the results. But as we have seen over the last couple of quarters we’ve seen revenue stabilization but the fact is its not coming really through adds per say as much as its coming through some new business and new offerings within existing customers.  So that’s a little bit more expensive business and that’s why you’ve seen a little bit of the margin pressure, our selling expense for example as Michael indicated was up 50 basis points. So I’m afraid what’s happening is is that one there is an expectation on the part of many analysts that there is going to be a more robust job recovery which is going to add more profitable business to us in the near-term that I don’t think we necessarily hold the same view.  And then the second thing is I don’t think that there is a true understanding that while revenues may be relatively stable the problem is is that the cost of that revenue is a little bit more expensive than just adding customers or adding wearers to existing customers. So that’s the disconnect I think that happens. Also don’t underestimate the fact that this third quarter tends to be, our third quarter tends to be more difficult because of the holiday closures, the fewer number of work days, weather issues, that sort of thing so I think that some of that has got to be factored in also. 
Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup : One of the points you mentioned a couple of times, the costs associated with new revenues, is that anything other than normal commissions and amortization. 
William Gale : Its pretty much commissions, amortization of the new garments or the product, you also will have some additional costs relatively minor with just sizing and that sort of thing that would enter into it. 
Michael Thompson : And as I mentioned in my comments, with a focus on trying to add additional services within our existing customer base we have shifted some of our focus on our sales force into selling, into certain items within our existing accounts. So those adds are paying commissions to sales reps versus strictly a straight growth add on from a customer that adds an employee. 
Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup : And you talked about pricing and medical costs on the call, did you quantify pricing and also what’s the outlook going forward on medical costs. 
William Gale : We did not talk about the pricing because that’s a very difficult thing to quantify. It just varies across the board with different, new business versus what were selling new business for, and what we’re having to do with existing customers. So I really don’t have that data to give you I can just tell you that it has certainly been more competitive.  As for medical costs, I have no way to predict what the future will be on medical costs. We were encouraged that we did see a drop from what we had experienced in that first quarter which was just higher than we’d ever seen. Our hope is that we will continue to manage that as best we can. We want to be able to provide our employees with a good medical plan that will cover them and its really what happens with the whole cost of medical from the medical providers.  This new healthcare legislation whatever it may turn out to be we don’t know what impact that’s going to have on companies such as our who are self insured for medical. And so it really is its uncertain going out into the future. We’re committed to continue to provide a good package to our employees and we recognize that we have to manage the costs accordingly. But its very difficult to predict what will take place. 
Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup : Eventually when you return to growth, let’s call it late next year and into 2011 maybe, will that return to growth result in maybe at least a temporary negative impact on cash flow as you, because of CapEx going up and working capital rising. 
William Gale : It will certainly impact yes working capital, we’ll definitely absorb some cash. Injection of new garments you’ll have to have that take place but as I mentioned earlier from the uniform rental perspective we don’t see a need for a lot of new rental plants so I don’t think we’re going to have the same degree of spending on plants and facilities as maybe we saw in the 90’s when we had very robust growth.  Some of our other businesses the most capital intensive the other businesses is document management from the cost of the trucks and I don’t think that’s going to cause much more capital spending than what you have seen over the last few quarters because that has continued to grow. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Steinerman - JPMorgan
Andrew Steinerman - JPMorgan: You talked about three quarters now of a rental business being stable and you also gave your economic comments but it seems to me that perhaps the most recent quarter that the business was a little less stable, I think I heard you correctly that lost business was a little higher sequentially in this quarter versus sequentially the last quarter. And I think you made a similar comment about new business and so is there some additional headwinds happening right now or am I not asking the question correctly. 
Michael Thompson : You’re asking the question correctly, we don’t see it that way. As we mentioned on last quarter’s call we weren’t as optimistic as the numbers tend to be and the downturn that we’ve seen this quarter we think is a little bit of timing and just effort. Sometimes you get fluctuations that are a little more positive or negative but overall when you look at the final output, revenues on a same work day basis were stable and you’re going to see a little bit back and forth.  We didn’t see lost business decrease dramatically from Q1 but it was down a little bit. We didn’t see adds spike tremendously over Q1 but they did improve. So I wouldn’t look at it too much that there was a dramatic change, certainly new business has been a little more difficult but it was difficult in the first quarter as customers, as new prospects are a just a little bit hesitant to put in new programs.  We’re still selling new business but its not at the same levels. 
William Gale : I would be very careful, I think Michael’s right, its kind of like minor changes in these parameters and I think sometimes people try to read too much into it. We are actually encouraged that from a rental standpoint on a comparable work day basis it was relatively flat. And I think that that’s an encouraging sign and hopefully we’ll continue to see that and then start seeing things get better as we move throughout 2010. But I think it will be very slow. 
Andrew Steinerman - JPMorgan: So maybe let me take a shot and ask you a little bit more about the February quarter and obviously you’ve given a lot of qualitative comments and we have one less business day and the factory shutdowns, seem tough, when I look at a typical February quarter historically this is your worse quarter, its down about 1%, this is rental revenues when you look at the kind of last decade. And we’re also losing a point and a half because of one less day, so my question is if we were going to quantify how much the February quarter will be down from the November quarter will it be down a lot more than normal or is it we lose the day which is one and a half percent down on rev and then we talk normal seasonality you’ll lose another point or so, but then when we try to say stepping back that’s still stable. 
William Gale : You’re looking at the revenue line correctly. I would say that there tends to be in addition to what you just said a little less success on selling new business because you have the month of December and then you get into, by the time you come out of the holidays before companies really start willing to start thinking about adding new services that factors into it.  So I think that’s another issue. We’ve seen in the last year for sure, you come out of the holidays companies shut down for longer periods of time, not sure what’s going to happen here this time. I think a lot of it depends on the confidence level. And then we have some cost pressures that we experienced in our third quarter that we don’t have in the other quarters. All the payroll taxes are reset so we’ve got all that expense for all the employees in the company.  So you always see a little pick up in our SG&A spending as a result of that. Its just a number of those different things that give us reason to ask you guys to be very cautious in how you look at the third quarter. 
Michael Thompson : I would agree with William, and if you look at it as you indicated, you’re correct on revenue its just we’re a little more cautious than a typical quarter and remember also when you get those shorter work day months, when you get to the margin side you have things such as material costs that’s calculated on a monthly basis or depreciation where you’re taking a full quarter hit despite one or two less work days in a quarter. So it does have an impact on the margins more extensively than just the top line. 
Andrew Steinerman - JPMorgan: But are you comfortable saying that sequentially in this February quarter that revenues won’t be impacted as much as they were in February of 2009.
William Gale : No, I can’t say that. I can’t say that’s true, I can’t say its false. I don’t really know.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Vance Edelson - Morgan Stanley 
Vance Edelson - Morgan Stanley : So one more question on your point that analyst estimates are too high, is that specifically referring to the quarterly estimates that you see out there going forward or are you thinking of that partially in terms of the 2010 fiscal year and if that’s the case how much of the rejiggering that’s needed is simply because second quarter results already feel shy.
William Gale : I think I see it in all, the answer to all your questions for the next several quarters as well as I mentioned in my opening comments even into 2011. And its not just because we missed supposedly the estimates for this quarter. I think there was just too much optimism in those numbers. 
Vance Edelson - Morgan Stanley : And then you mentioned that you’re adding new customers which is helping to offset other revenue declines, and yet your competitors are cutting prices and it sounds like they’re doing what’s necessary to hold onto their customers as best as possible, so could you elaborate on the competitive dynamics that are allowing you to add customers when you do add them. Is it essentially a matter of taking market share from smaller less well capitalized players and is that becoming easier. 
William Gale : Yes it is becoming easier so we are taking market share not only from them but also from some of the bigger competitors. But certainly the little guys are having more difficulty. And I think we’re also finding that there are still companies that are willing to take on the service so its not like our whole source of no programmers has totally dried up. That’s not the case. We are still selling to no programmer business, its just not nearly what it used to be. 
Vance Edelson - Morgan Stanley : When you think about the pricing pressures across your business where are they most pronounced among the various business lines. 
William Gale : The uniform rental and facility services rental have been probably the most impacted. We saw in the second quarter our fire service business, there was a fairly dramatic competitive increase in competitive pressure there also. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Vishnu Lekraj - Morningstar
Vishnu Lekraj - Morningstar: Looking at what you’ve been saying or listening to what you’ve been saying in terms of what you expect over the next half year to 12 months and the recovery in manufacturing and goods producing industries, how that’s going to impact your revenues going forward are you looking to explore moving outside or building more service type customers into your customer base to motivate growth going forward.  
William Gale : Yes, absolutely. We are looking at our strategic direction to identify those industries that will provide greater opportunities for growth over the next five to 10 years. And we are going to see what we can do to develop products or service offerings that appeal to that type of customer. 
Vishnu Lekraj - Morningstar: Specifically though with the uniform rental are you looking to move into more hospitality, move into healthcare which seems to be resilient in terms of jobs. 
William Gale : Absolutely, we have mentioned that before that that has been one of our strategies is to identify how we can convince those types of companies that have traditionally always bought uniforms or had their employees buy their own uniforms as is the case with healthcare, what the value of perhaps a rental program could be and we’ve got some experiments going that are showing some promise. And we are hopeful that that will provide a new avenue for growth down the road. 
Michael Thompson : We have been doing that as well [inaudible] healthcare but over the last five or six years of manufacturing jobs have left the US for abroad, we’re able to go to that environment mainly because we took our uniform programs and developed them for other industries so we’re certainly doing that and continue those efforts. 
Vishnu Lekraj - Morningstar: Should we expect then maybe some higher costs associated with the selling of those newer garments to newer customers.  
William Gale : Not necessarily, I think its more of a having the right type of products and convincing those type of customers the value of what a program like that can bring to them. 
Michael Thompson : Its certainly a longer sales process in the beginning when you first enter a new industry or have a new product offering for an industry to educate those first few customers and them taking that product but as far as the actual cost itself it would be about the same from a sales cost perspective. 
Vishnu Lekraj - Morningstar: I want to drill down a little bit on your uniform direct sales have you heard anything from your customers in terms of they expect to start spending here in the next over 2010 or is there’s just no communication between yourself or they haven’t said anything to you. 
Michael Thompson : We’ve had a lot of discussion with customers and from what we have seen in the uniform direct sale market is a lot more discussion on their part of future plans. The difficulty we have is that until they actually pull the trigger, its hard to say when that’s going to be because they are more discretionary in nature and they can always push those programs back six or nine months.  But I would say the activity is certainly picked up. There is certainly a lot more discussion about new redesigned programs, not so much as openings although there has been some talk of that, but redesign of brands, upgrading of, freshening up of programs so to speak but again we’re cautious there because we want to make sure that until they see their revenues beginning to increase its going to be difficult for them to make that spend but we are encouraged somewhat at least they’re having those discussions now. 
Vishnu Lekraj - Morningstar: So just to clarify that we probably could expect a little bit slower growth within that service line than we’ve seen in the past due to the nature of what’s going on with those type of customers, correct.
William Gale : I think at this point that’s probably a fair assumption because I think many of those types of industries are sitting on the sidelines talking about a lot of things but not doing it much yet. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Andrea Wirth - Robert W. Baird 
Andrea Wirth - Robert W. Baird : I wanted to first dig a little bit more into pricing, I just want to make sure I’m thinking about this the right way, is it fair to say that most of the pricing pressure is coming in on the renewals so maybe its call it 20% of your rental business right now is seeing some of the pricing pressure or is that not necessarily the right way to think about it. 
William Gale : I think you’ve got to look at it, its not just on the renewals its on the new business, its on the, even within a contract being able to convince a customer to accept a price increase is more difficult so it really runs across the whole board of business. 
Andrea Wirth - Robert W. Baird: And at this point should we consider the pricing levels now to be the permanent levels going forward or is there actually the opportunity for pricing to go back up from here. 
William Gale : It could go back up but I think it could also go down. 
Michael Thompson : Certainly people are being more aggressive today be it competition to maintain and generate some cash flow to cover their fixed costs. Certainly customers today are being much more cost conscientious than they have been in a growth economy. We would hope that the pricing would rebound, will it come back to levels before, that’s difficult to say but once growth returns typically what does occur is at least from a customer standpoint they’re not looking strictly at cost at least not as hard as they are today.
Andrea Wirth - Robert W. Baird : And just in terms of the actual contract terms are you seeing any changes there, customers looking for shorter terms, anything going on in that front. 
William Gale : We occasionally get requests on that but we are holding pretty firm on that. That’s not in the best interest of the industry to allow that to happen because the investment that one makes in all the uniforms so while there might be some inquiries, I don’t see much of that happening in reality. 
Andrea Wirth - Robert W. Baird : And in terms of your sales force and then adding to the headcount there, is the headcount actually up year over year now for your sales force.
William Gale : Yes.
Andrea Wirth - Robert W. Baird : And so then in terms of just the increased costs, we should probably assume that there’s a little bit of a headwind for call it the next 12 months or so.
William Gale : At least that yes, because we also as we continue to see opportunities down the road it takes awhile to get people trained and in place and we’ve got to invest in that future. So yes, there is going to be some headwinds for a little while until we start really seeing some nice growth coming from not only new business but also existing customers. 
Andrea Wirth - Robert W. Baird : And just looking at the energy costs going forward into next quarter is it probably fair to say that those are a little bit higher just given what we’ve seen on the natural gas front and a little bit higher on diesel and gasoline. 
William Gale : You tell me what’s going to happen with diesel gasoline and natural gas for the next three months and I’ll tell you whether that has an effect on our quarter. It is what it is so we’ve done a lot to try to become efficient but we can’t predict what’s going to happen with energy prices. We were happy to see they were stable from the first quarter to the second quarter. And they are going to fluctuate up and down but hopefully we’re going to stay within a reasonable range. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Gary Bisbee - Barclays Capital 
Gary Bisbee - Barclays Capital : First of all Happy Holidays, first one can you clarify for me the commentary you’ve made the last two quarters on the add/stops, are you talking that its up sequentially a bit in each of the last two or is it up year over year and is the right way with revenue being flattish ex the work day changes, is the right way to think about it that sales or new business activity is down in equal amounts to offset the improvement in add/stops. 
Michael Thompson :  Its kind of a mixed bag but it is sequentially that we’re talking about although because these were two straight add quarters, they are up year over year as well. But we are talking sequentially. Also when you talk about directionally what’s occurring you are right that the adds are making up more of the growth so to speak to offset the job loss. Lost business has been pretty consistent, its better than last year sequentially it was down a little bit. New business I would say that the adds are making up more of the lower new business as well as the price increase pressures that we talked about. So price increases have taken a hit and new business as well if you go sequentially and those adds are offsetting that. 
William Gale : Keep in mind I just want to make sure everyone understands when we talk about adds we’re not just talking about additional uniform wearers, we categorize an add as adding an entrance mat to an existing customer, adding some hygiene services so adds to us include everything from new uniform wearers to new entrance mats, new hygiene services, etc. 
Gary Bisbee - Barclays Capital : And so that would explain why there could be incremental costs associated with it. 
Michael Thompson : Right, especially when you take those sales reps and they go in and sell them new service but its to an existing customer. In a normal situation you may have a uniform wearing customer, they hire three people, there’s a little bit of commission there for the driver but not like it would be to send the sales rep in selling a new service.
Gary Bisbee - Barclays Capital : Let me just ask you a big picture question then, you’ve clearly proven in the past that uniform acquisitions can be nicely accretive over time but in the last couple of years you’ve been much more focused on documented first aid, safety, fire acquisitions. When you think about this great balance sheet that you’ve got right now, how do you weigh the benefits of continued diversification to the business overall versus opportunities to gain market share within the core uniform business. My take is I think investors would be more pleased to see more diversification but given that there can be good accretion from uniforms, how do you think about that and can you give us any guidance on what we might expect. 
William Gale : That’s a good question and we really study that continuously and we look at all these different alternatives and I think one of the interesting things that people maybe don’t necessarily realize is that when you look at an acquisition you also take into consideration what you perceive the future environment to be. And while acquisitions in uniform rental may have looked attractive in just general terms two years ago as we began to see the weakness in the business starting to come about we didn’t want to buy a company like the uniform rental business and then find out that a year later we only had 80% of what we thought we were buying.  So you’ve got to be very careful there and I think on the part of the sellers they didn’t have that expectation and wouldn’t factor that into their expected price that they were going to see a downturn in their revenues. So I think you’ve got to look at an acquisition in light of what you expect it to perform for you over the near-term as well as down the road and what synergies you can get and we are not against buying any additional uniform rental companies.  In fact we would be interested in doing it at the right value in light of the current, at least our expectation of what the economic environment is going to be. So I think that we feel that we have the ability and the financial wherewithal to probably do both, to pick up some nice uniform rental companies to also expand offering, look for additional acquisitions in fire and first aid and document management. And even start thinking about, okay what is the next document management service that we want to have and should we start thinking about buying a player in that and then doing a rollup like we’ve done with some of the other businesses. I think we’re big enough, we’re strong enough to be able to do all of those things and we’ve got people working on each one of those within the company. 
Gary Bisbee - Barclays Capital : Help us think about currency impact going forward, can you remind me what percent of your revenue is from Canada these days. 
Michael Thompson : Its under 10%, we don’t give an exact percentage but its under 10% and in this quarter the Canadian dollar really didn’t move much, there was a very minor impact so again—
William Gale : Our European business is relatively, is still very small. 
Gary Bisbee - Barclays Capital : Obviously you’re spending on like increasing the inventory at uniforms has been down as the uniform business has slowed, should we have any expectation that we’re going to see amortization from big programs you may have started 18 months ago fall off and is that likely to be a benefit any time in the near-term or is that already—
Michael Thompson : You wouldn’t see a significant change quarter to quarter just because no one customer is a huge customer and but certainly unless growth picks up higher, you’re going to see either stable or down number there because the amortization will continue to roll and your injections on existing customers isn’t as great as new business injections.  So you’ll see some stabilization but it won’t drop quite as quickly because the revenues are stabilizing but again you won’t see any one time dramatic change because we don’t have any one customer that large. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Nate Brochman - William Blair 
Nate Brochman - William Blair: Happy Holidays gentlemen, just wanted to kind of ask you a wrap up question if I could and that is combination of everyone else’s questions but what I get the sense is we’re entering the seasonally slow period, we’re being a little bit cautious, we’re adding back a little bit to the cost line, but yet overall you still feel pretty good about the overall trends, maybe not as rapid as people would have hoped in terms of imbedded in estimates but yet we’re still past the negative inflection point, moving positively and the overall thing that I take away is that you are adding the sales forces again which means that one, you can use your stronger balance sheet to become more aggressive relative to your competition not just on pricing but in terms of the sales effort, but two it really does signal that better times are ahead and we can keep the positive trajectory of trends rather than worrying about kind of going negative again, is that kind of the general way to think about all the comments.  
William Gale : I would absolutely agree with what you said. I think the only thing I would caution is again I don’t want to beat a dead horse here, but I just don’t think you’re going to see this rapid addition of, into the work force in this country and therefore all of the adds that we’re going to get as a result of our customers adding on business. I think its going to be relatively slow but on the other hand it is not the doom and gloom that many people were predicting nine months or 12 months ago. And I absolutely agree with that, that we have turned the corner. Our management here, we’re still very bullish on our business. We have demonstrated that this is great cash flow business and we’re very pleased to do what we do and we think that being the strongest company in all the businesses that we’re in that we are in the best position to really take advantage of what’s going to happen as the US economy and let’s say the North American economy continues to improve.  So I would completely agree with what you said. 
Nate Brochman - William Blair: And while at the end of the day the breaking profile of economic recovery is certainly open to debate in any conversation with any customer or any company, any client right now, the fact though that you are adding more aggressively, you have a lot of different bullets in terms of whether its acquisitions or new service offerings, and the fact that you do have a fair amount of leverage in your model, again while the pace of earnings growth might not be as optimistic as we might have thought going into this call, it feels that the future is still pretty bright with all those things especially on a comparative basis. 
William Gale : Yes, you are right on that, absolutely. 
Operator: There are no additional questions at this time; I would like to turn it back over to management for any additional or closing comments. 
William Gale : Thank you all very much for joining us this evening. We really appreciate your continued interest in our company. And we would like to wish all of you and all your family a very joyous holiday and a prosperous 2010.

===== 2010 Q1  (2009-09-23 17:00:00) =====
Executives: William C. Gale - Chief Financial Officer Michael L. Thompson - Vice President and Treasurer
Analysts: Vishnu Lekraj - Morningstar Nathan Brochmann - William Blair & Company Andrew Steinerman - J.P. Morgan Vance Edelson - Morgan Stanley Gary Bisbee - Barclays Capital Analyst for Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Andrea Wirth - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.
Operator: Good day, everyone and welcome to the Cintas quarterly earnings results conference call. As a reminder, today’s call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Bill Gale, Senior Vice President of Finance and Chief Financial Officer. 
William C. Gale: Good evening and thank you for joining us as we discuss the first quarter of fiscal 2010. Joining me this evening is Mike Thompson, Cintas' Vice President and Treasurer. The company today reported revenues and net income in line with its plan for the year. Due to the severe economic downturn that began about one year ago, we believe comparisons to last year's first quarter are not as meaningful as they would be in a more normalized environment, therefore in addition to providing comparative data to the same quarter last year, we also have shown comparative information in the release to our fourth quarter of last fiscal year. We believe this provides investors a better understanding of the trends in our various business units. While revenue declined 11% from the first quarter last year, it increased 1.5% from the fourth quarter. This year's first quarter had one more workday than both the first and fourth quarters of last year. Adjusting for the workday difference, this year's first quarter revenues were flat with the fourth quarter. Earnings per share were $0.35 this year, but when you exclude the previously announced legal settlement on wage and hour litigation, earnings per dilute share were $0.43. This compares to the $0.51 in last year's first quarter and $0.38 for the fourth quarter, excluding the various special charges. The fourth quarter charges amounted to approximately $0.35 per share. While job losses have moderated recently, they still remain negative. In the past 12 months the U.S. economy has shed approximately 6.0 million jobs, including about 1.0 million jobs during our first quarter. These job losses have impacted our customers' business activity significantly. We believe that visibility remains unclear as job losses in the U.S. economy are expected to continue. As a result, we are unable to provide any meaningful guidance at this time. Until employment stabilizes, which government officials and most economists currently believe may not happen until mid- to late-calendar 2010, our revenues, adjusted for workday differences are expected to be comparable to the previous sequential quarter. We suggest that analysts be cautious with their estimates for the foreseeable future. We continue to proceed cautiously with discretionary spending and we are aggressively managing our cost structure. As a result, despite the top line pressures, our margins remain strong and our cash flow has been excellent. Our balance sheet has continued to strengthen, with a debt to capitalization ratio of less than 20% and we currently have over $350.0 million in cash and marketable securities and no short-term debt. Despite the most serious economic downturn since the 1930s, our businesses remain profitable and strong cash flow generators. We expect a resumption of revenue growth in all of our businesses once the economy stops shrinking. Acquisition opportunities remain plentiful and we believe activity could increase as valuations become more reasonable. Opportunities also exist to further expand our presence outside of North America. We appreciate all of the outstanding efforts our employees have made in taking care of our customers and controlling costs. The commitments made by our employees have helped Cintas weather this economic downturn better than most companies. Such actions have resulted in positioning Cintas for enhancing the long-term value for our shareholders.

This conference call contains forward-looking statements that reflect the company's current views as to future events and financial performance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ materially from those we may discuss. I refer you to the discussion on these points contained in our most recent filings with the SEC, as well as in the press release issued today announcing Cintas' first quarter fiscal 2010 results. I will now turn the call over to Mike Thompson, who will discuss this quarter's results in more detail. We will then be happy to answer your questions.
Michael L. Thompson: Total revenues for the first quarter of fiscal 2010 were $891.0 million, 11% decrease from the first quarter of last year. This decrease was mainly due to the significant job loss and difficult economic environment over the last 12 months. However, when comparing to the fourth quarter of last year, as Bill mentioned, revenue increased 1.5%. There was an additional workday in the first quarter of this fiscal year. When adjusting for the additional workday, revenue for the first quarter was flat as compared to the fourth quarter. Also, while total company internal growth was negative 13%, it was the same rate as the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009. Market conditions remain difficult but we have seen some moderation in job loss and stabilization with our customers.  This quarter had 66 workdays. As a reminder, work days by quarter for the rest of this fiscal year, are 65 in the second quarter, 64 in Q3, and 66 in Q4. Each quarter in fiscal 2009 had 65 workdays.  The Canadian exchange rate increased slightly from May 31 to August 31. The negative impact on this quarter's revenue was minor. We classify our businesses into four reportable operating segments: Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products; Uniform Direct Sales; First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection Services; and Document Management Services. Uniform Direct Sales, First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection Services, and Document Management Services are combined and presented as Other Services on the face of the income statement. The Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products operating segment consists of the rental and servicing of uniforms and other garments, mats, mops, shop towels, and other related items. Our restroom and hygiene products and services are also included within this segment. Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products revenue accounted for 74% of total company revenue in the first quarter, consistent with the fourth quarter of last year. Rental revenues were $655.6 million for the quarter, a 9% decrease in revenue as compared to the first quarter of last year, but a 1.3% increase over the fourth quarter last year. On a workday adjusted basis, rental revenue was flat as compared to last year's fourth quarter. Rental internal growth for the quarter was a negative 10.5%, a slight decrease from negative 9% for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009.  Job loss in the U.S. continues to be heavy. For the 12 months ended August 31, 2009, the U.S. economy lost approximately 6.0 million jobs with the majority of these jobs lost in traditional uniform-wearing industries. In addition, unemployment continues to increase and was 9.7% at the end of August. This job loss had, and will continue to have, an impact on our results, especially on a year-over-year basis. Despite the continued job losses, our first quarter rental revenue on an adjusted workday basis, was consistent with the fourth quarter of last year. Improvement in all four of our key revenue performance metrics provided an offset to the additional job loss. As compared to the fourth quarter we sold more new business, lost less existing business, had positive price increases, and had positive net adds.  This is significant as our add/stop ratio was not positive for any quarter last fiscal year and was our most difficult metric. Through increased identification of opportunities within our existing customers, we were able to turn the add/stop ratio positive despite 1.0 million additional U.S. jobs being lost during the first quarter. While the 1.0 million jobs lost is a significant amount, the rate of job loss in the U.S. has moderated over the last few months. For the last seven months of fiscal 2009, the U.S. lost an average of approximately 600,000 jobs per month. During our first quarter, the rate of job loss was half of that, with approximately 300,000 jobs lost per month. Job loss for August was 216,000. It appears that the market may be stabilizing. Past job losses will certainly continue to impact our results but if the current moderating trend continues, then the degree of impact would lessen as we move through the rest of this fiscal year. Our data continues to indicate that we are protecting our market share. Customer satisfaction levels remain very high and our customer retention levels are good. These factors provide us confidence that if the market continues to solidify, our results will continue to improve. Our Other Services revenue category on the income statement is comprised of the Uniform Direct Sales, the First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection Service, and the Document Management operating segments.  The Uniform Direct Sales operating segment includes the direct sale of uniforms, branded promotional products, and other related products to national and retail customers through our Global Accounts and Strategic Markets Division. This segment also includes the direct sale of uniforms and related products to local customers who typically also rent products from us. This includes items sold through our direct sale catalogue. Uniform Direct Sales revenue accounted for 10% of total company revenue in the first quarter, down from 12% in the first quarter of last year, and 11% in the fourth quarter. Within this segment our Global Accounts Division has a significant amount of business with the lodging, hospitality and gaming industries. These industries continue to suffer and continue to cut costs and reduce headcount. While our Uniform Direct Sales business is directly impacted by headcount, it is also impacted by customer discretionary spending as well. Very few new property openings or refresh programs are occurring. Refresh programs are sales which occur when customers change or refresh their uniform design at a property or throughout their organization. During economic downturns these discretionary types of spending tend to slow or even stop. The current economic downturn is the most significant we've experienced since entering this business in the 1990s. This segment's sales continues to suffer with first quarter revenue down 24% from a year ago and down 5% from the fourth quarter. Internal growth was negative 25% as compared to negative 33% last quarter. In our First Aid, Safety, and Fire Protection Services business, we sell and deliver first aid products, safety products, and automatic defibulators to our customers. We also provide safety training to their employees. Within fire protection, we install, inspect, repair, and recharge portable fire extinguishers and sprinkler systems. We also provide and service emergency lighting systems and kitchen fire suppression systems.  The First Aid, Safety, and Fire Protection segment accounted for 10% of the company's first quarter revenue as compared to 11% for the first quarter of last year, but up from 9% last quarter. During the quarter revenues within our First Aid, Safety, and Fire Protection Services operating segment decreased 17%, but increase 8% as compared to the fourth quarter of last year. Internal growth was negative 18% as compared to negative 22% last quarter. The First Aid and Safety revenue in this segment is reliant on customer employee headcount. As customer employment levels decrease, there are less people requiring first aid products, such as bandages and tablets and less safety products such as hard hats and eye protection. This situation is compounded given little business expansion or new construction, which normally helps drive safety sales. On a positive side, as our customers reduce their headcount, they rely on us more to provide their first aid training and we continue to develop into their third-party first aid and safety consultant and provider. As compared to the fourth quarter, revenue increased mainly due to new business with national accounts, increased sales of safety products, and increased AED sales. A portion of the increased sales relates to sales of various safety products, such as respirators and hand sanitizers designed to protect against illness, including the H1N1 virus. There is also a little seasonality in the safety portion of the business as certain customers tend to purchase more safety equipment and supplies during the summer months. Within our Fire Protection segment we continue to exit the fire installation business, other than in a few markets where we have a sufficient presence and installation infrastructure. Our focus in fire protection services has been and continues to be on the test, inspection, and repair of portable fire extinguishers, exit lighting, and fire suppression systems. Our test, inspection, and repair revenue, which is not as reliant on headcount or new construction, improved during the quarter. Our Document Management Services operating segment is comprised mainly of document shredding services, although we do have storage and imaging capabilities. Document management comprised 6% of fourth quarter total company revenue and increased from 5% last year, but the same as the fourth quarter of last year. As with many commodities, recycled paper prices rose dramatically during fiscal 2008 providing additional revenue for our shredding business. Prices reached their peak in April of 2008. Since that time, paper prices have fallen back to more historic levels and prices have been fairly stable over the last six months. Excluding this impact, our document shredding service and parts business provided internal growth of 13% versus 17% last quarter. There is some seasonality that provides some fourth quarter lift as certain customers require an annual purge after their December 31 year ends. Total Document Management internal growth, including the impact of recycled paper, was negative 2% versus negative 4% in the fourth quarter of 2009. Total growth, including acquisitions, was a positive 3% for the quarter, up from 1% last quarter. While still small on a relative basis, our European Document Management Operations continue to meet expectations. We continue to actively look for additional expansion opportunities in this business, both domestically and abroad. Before I discuss margins, please note that during our fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, we had a restructuring, impairment, and inventory charge. Please refer to our 10-K for more discussion of this charge. As I discuss margins, all comparisons of margins and earnings to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 will be comparisons to adjusted results, that is results which exclude the effects of this charge.  Total company gross margin for the first quarter was 42.9%, an improvement of 50 basis points over the gross margin in last year's first quarter of 42.4%. This improvement was due to lower energy costs, partially offset by margin pressure from decreased revenue levels.  Energy cost improvement from last year was due to decreases in the pricing of natural gas and delivery gas for our fleets as well as efficiencies gained from rerouting and other energy conservation measures. In total, energy costs for the first quarter were 2.9% of total company revenue, or approximately 150 basis points lower than the first quarter of last year. Total company gross margin for the first quarter was 42.9%, a 170 basis points improvement over the fourth quarter adjusted gross margin. On a dollar basis, the company's gross margin increased over $20.0 million. The improvement was primarily due to aggressive cost management and a continued right sizing of the organization and all of our businesses. Note that energy costs for the first quarter were 20 basis points higher than the fourth quarter of last year due to higher energy prices. Rental margin was 44.6% for the quarter while Other Services margin was 38.2%. The rental gross margin of 44.6% for the first quarter was 90 basis points higher than the 43.5% in the first quarter last year and 100 basis points higher than the 43.6% in the fourth quarter of last year. The improvement from last year's first quarter was due to improved energy costs, which decreased 170 basis points. This improvement was offset by margin pressure from a lower revenue stream. Rental energy costs increased 20 basis points from the fourth quarter. Despite this increase, rental gross margin improved 100 basis points over the fourth quarter adjusted gross margin. Improvements in material cost provided much of the improvement. When garments, mats, and other rental items are placed into service, they begin amortizing over their useful life, generally 18 months for garments, and 36 months for entrance mats. This amortization period is not adjusted or halted.  During a period of decreasing revenue, material cost as a percent of revenue will typically increase due to inventory injections that occurred in prior months when the business being supported was at a greater level. As sales stabilize cost of goods improves as inventory injections and amortization come back in line. Material costs for the quarter improved 90 basis points over the fourth quarter. Other improvements included improved delivery labor, production maintenance, production depreciation, and hanger expense, as we continue to drive costs out of the organization and consolidate operations. The measures we've taken are having a positive effect on margins. Other Services gross margin was 38.2% for the quarter as compared to 39.5% in last year's first quarter, but improved significantly from last year's adjusted gross margin of 34.5% in the fourth quarter. The decrease compared to the prior year is due to the decrease in Uniform Direct Sale and First Aid, Safety, and Fire Protection revenue and the reduction in recycled paper prices in Document Management. While these segments' margins have not returned to levels from a year ago, the relative stabilization of revenue and the effect of our cost control measures have allowed margins to rebound quickly. The significant improvement over the fourth quarter adjusted gross margin was primarily due to a combination of the impact of these cost control measures, increased revenue in First Aid, Safety, and Fire, and the stabilization of recycled paper prices. Selling and administrative expenses were 29.7% of revenue, an increase from 28.7% for the first quarter of last year and 28.9% for the fourth quarter of last year. The increase over both quarters is primarily due to a spike in medical costs. During the first quarter medical costs were 4.4% of revenues as compared to 3.7% in last year's first quarter and 3.4% in last year's fourth quarter. Medical costs over the last few years have been in the range of 3% to 3.5% of revenue. This quarter's medical costs were the highest percent of sale we've ever experienced. There was no significant change in high-dollar claims or increasing costs related to older claims, rather it was due to a significant increase in plain usage by participants in the quarter. Despite the medical cost increase, SG&A spending decreased $23.0 million as compared to the first quarter of last year, including a reduction in selling and G&A labor and employee-related costs, which include payroll taxes and workers compensation and retirement costs. SG&A increased by $11.0 million from the fourth quarter, due primarily to the spike in medical costs. Net interest cost this quarter of $11.7 million was down slightly compared to $12.0 million in last year's first quarter and consistent with the $11.7 million last quarter. The reduction from the first quarter of last year was due to our paying off of all of our outstanding commercial paper.  Our effective tax rate was 38.1% for the quarter, which reflects the timing of specific reserve bills and releases under FIN 48. We expect our full year effective tax rate to be comparable to last year's 37.4% effective rate.  Excluding the settlement charge, operating income was 13.3%, 40 basis points below last year's first quarter, despite the reduction in revenue, and was 100 basis points higher than the adjusted operating profit from the fourth quarter. Our balance sheet is strong and continues to improve, despite the difficult economic environment. Cash and marketable securities of $358.0 million increased $108.0 million from May 31, 2009, and are $43.0 million greater than total current liabilities. The company's current ratio improved to 4.25:1. In addition to the strength demonstrated by our balance sheet, the company owns the majority of its rental operating plants and delivery fleet. Of the total cash and marketable securities of $358.0 million, $130.0 million of marketable securities are held in Canada. These funds are generated from Canadian operations and are held in short-term conservative government investments. We are currently holding these for future investment opportunities outside the United States. DSOs on accounts receivable were 42 days, the same as last quarter. We are actively managing our accounts receivable in order to lessen any impact from current economic conditions. New business inventory levels decreased $17.0 million from May 31 as we continue to aggressively challenge and manage inventory requirements in conjunction with lower volumes. As a reminder, assets held for sale of $16.0 million represents the value of real estate and equipment for consolidated operations under the restructuring plan.  Accrued liabilities decreased approximately $6.0 million from May 31, reflecting the payment of the company's 2009 profit sharing contribution and the timing of accrued bond interest, offset by an accrual for the legal settlement. Long-term debt at August 31, 2009, was $786.0 million. All of the outstanding debt at May 31 was fixed rate debt and had an average interest rate of approximately 6%. Total debt as a percentage of total book capitalization decreased to 24.5%, while net debt, or long-term debt less cash and marketable securities, as a percentage of total capitalization, decreased to 15%. Our cash flow remains strong, with cash provided by operations of $145.0 million and free cash flow of $120.0 million, an $86.0 million increase over the $34.0 million of free cash flow in the first quarter of last year. Capital expenditures were $25.0 million for the quarter, a 54% reduction as compared to the first quarter of last year. Included in the $25.0 million of capex was approximately $6.0 million spent in conjunction with our SAP/ERP financial system implementation. The capital spent on SAP is allocated among our operating segments. The $25.0 million in total capital expenditures was invested in our operating segments as follows:  $16.0 million in the rental division. These expenditures were primarily for ongoing maintenance capex. In last year's first quarter we spent $38.0 million in rental division capex, so this represents a $22.0 million, or 58% reduction in spending. We continue to have enough capacity to adequately service our customers and for future anticipated growth; $2.5 million in capex was spent in uniform direct sale, as compared to $6.0 million in last year's first quarter; $1.5 million was spent in First Aid, Safety, and Fire, as compared to $3.0 million in last year's first quarter; and $5.0 million was spent in Document Management as compared to $7.0 million in last year's first quarter. We continue to invest capital in this double-digit growth business, mainly in the form of mobile shredding trucks and industrial shredding equipment.  We did not make many acquisitions in the quarter, but continue to evaluate acquisition candidates. We have sufficient cash and have access to capital were an acquisition opportunity to present itself at the right valuation. Our strong cash flow and balance sheet continue to provide us the financial stability to withstand the current economic conditions, while enabling us to be poised for future expansion when market conditions improve. Thank you and we will now take any of your questions.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Vishnu Lekraj – Morningstar.
Vishnu Lekraj - Morningstar: Looking here at your margins, they seemed to have improved over the quarter, and over the past half year. Looking at your uniform rental division, how are you going to approach that currently? Do you plan on keeping consolidating stops or do you plan on keeping them as they are so when the economy turns around you will be in a position to increase stops?
William C. Gale: We will intend to keep our routes operating very efficiently but we have a lot of flexibility. So in a particular location, if we get a major new customer, we can very quickly adjust our route structure to handle any increased new business. So at this point in time, I would say that due to the way that we have basically structured our current route system, the fact that we have so many routes in every particular geographic area, we are able to fairly quickly respond to changes in business environment and keep the routes fairly efficient.
Vishnu Lekraj - Morningstar: One more question related to your customer base. Given the deep struggles of certain industries during this recession and the reduction in employment levels for these industries, how has the mix in your customer base changed, if at all, in the last year or so?
Michael L. Thompson: It has certainly become less concentrate manufacturing, but again, you haven't seen a significant change in the percentages, just because the timing's been too quick and relative job losses has impacted all of our customers to some degree. Certainly more of the industrial, heavy-soil-type customers have been hurt a little more, although in certain areas like energy and utilities they've still done okay. So, it's kind of a mixed bag but certainly manufacturing is a lower percentage than it was.
Vishnu Lekraj - Morningstar: So if you expect manufacturing to come back a little slower than the rest of the industries, how do you plan on growing your revenue in pace with GDP, I guess, with an increase over the next couple of years.
William C. Gale: Well, we're going to do it two ways. First off, we are very aggressive on trying to take additional market share from our competition and we believe that our dedication during this downturn to continuing to take care of our customers will benefit us as we go forward and allowing us to take some of that market share. But the other thing we're doing, and we have been doing this for the last couple of years, is developing products that are desired by the sectors of the economy that will probably resume growth in the not-too-distant future, primarily in the service businesses. And so we believe that product development will be appealing to those wearers and in addition to that, we've mentioned this a couple of times, we have been aggressively producing garments that are like and more suitable for women and we have been very successful in converting many non-uniform women wearers to the new products that we have. So I think all those things together will enable us to probably be the highest grower in the uniform business in the long term going forward.
Vishnu Lekraj - Morningstar: How about flat wear? Do you plan on maybe moving more into that area at all?
William C. Gale: I'm sorry, into what?
Vishnu Lekraj - Morningstar: Bed sheets and napkins and things of that nature.
William C. Gale: No. No, we do not intend to move into what we call the linen business, that we really aren't interested in. We do some linen—we classify some of our products as linen but it's primarily aprons and towels and that sort of thing that are used in the restaurant industry. But as far as like tablecloths and sheets and stuff, we have no interest in that right now.
Operator: Your next question comes from Nathan Brochmann - William Blair & Company.
Nathan Brochmann - William Blair & Company: I was wondering if you could expand a little more on some of the trends, intra-quarter. Certainly you seem to be bucking the trend a little bit and you're starting to see some stabilization. Your numbers align with some of the macro trends, but what are you doing in terms of some of those 4 points—if you could provide any specifics—that's helping you produce some pretty solid numbers in the rental business. In terms of new customers, adds, and pricing.
William C. Gale: I think it goes back to a couple of the things I was talking about just previously to Vishnu. I think that we have been very focused with all of our service providers to ensure that they take care of their customers, even though they may have fewer wearers than they did a year ago. And one of the things that we didn't want to do was have, in a spirit of trying to reduce costs, to the point where we hurt our customers by not replacing uniforms when they were needed, by not being consistent on delivering the right product at the right time. So I think that has helped us. I think it also, given our broad spectrum of products and services, we've been able to identify other cost-saving measures for our customers by providing them items from maybe our facilities services business that would be cheaper than them doing it themselves or perhaps another provider that they may be using. So I think those actions have enabled us to basically retain business to the extent we could, in a very difficult environment, and even in some cases increase the amount of business we had with certain customers. I won't downplay the fact that I think a lot of the products that we're offering, as I said earlier, to employees in the service business into female workers, have also helped us to continue to penetrate our customers' business and have helped the top line.
Nathan Brochmann - William Blair & Company: And how about pricing? I mean, it seems pretty unique in terms of starting to get a little pricing back, in terms of one of the four things you mentioned. Could you talk a little bit about that?
William C. Gale: Pricing is still a difficult environment but I think that we have selectively found opportunities to convince customers when prices need to go up and we've been able to do that. But there is no question that we still are in a very competitive situation and will most likely continue to be that way for the foreseeable future. But I think if you treat your customers right, you can demonstrate, when you need a price increase that you can get it.
Nathan Brochmann - William Blair & Company: And maybe turning to the margin side a little bit, obviously you have been very aggressive in terms of kind of right-sizing your business for the current environment. Do you feel that that's pretty much over and we're right size for the current trends and kind of, as you alluded to, not providing specific guidance but in your initial remarks saying that assuming that the environment were to continue to stabilize, that we should see similar sequential results, a.k.a kind of the margins being maintained as where they are in the first quarter?
William C. Gale: As we have said before, if we could just get stabilization—we felt that stabilization in the workforce in the is country and in Canada—that we would begin to be able to achieve more consistency in our margins and obviously better results. And I feel that as long as that continues to happen, if the trends that we saw in the latter part of our first quarter continue to get just a little bit better, so that we're at a point where we're not losing jobs, yes, we believe we have right-sized the organization for that.  Now, we're going to still always work on ways to improve our efficiency and we still have the opportunity in front of us that when employment starts growing again and as a customer adds one employee to their work site—instead of delivering seven sets of uniforms, we're not delivering eight sets of uniforms—that additional uniform wearer is going to be very profitable for us because there's really not a lot of added cost. So our expectation certainly is going to be tempered by what happens in the overall economy, but I feel much better today than I did, say, six to nine months ago.
Operator: Your next question comes from Andrew Steinerman - J.P. Morgan.
Andrew Steinerman - J.P. Morgan: I need some clarification on thinking about the four components of internal growth, year-over-year versus sequentially. Internal growth year-over-year in the fourth quarter for rental was 9% and year-over-year in the first quarter I heard you say 10.5%, so the year-over-year internal growth got worse year-over-year as you compare sequentially. But you said that pretty much all four metrics got better. Could you pull that all together for me?
Michael L. Thompson: Just remember that when you talk about current metrics, those metrics affect you from this quarter forward, and really what your revenues are doing are going back four quarters. So, when you play that through the cycle, we certainly had an improvement in this quarter but that doesn't completely play through your financial statements because you still have a lot of weekly volume going back a year, so to speak. Those metrics are covering weekly increases.
Andrew Steinerman - J.P. Morgan: Right. But when you said the four metrics improved sequentially, did you mean the fourth quarter versus the third quarter or did you mean year-over-year there was improvement.
Michael L. Thompson: First quarter versus the fourth quarter.
Andrew Steinerman - J.P. Morgan: Right. And usually when we talk about those metrics we usually talk year-over-year, right?
Michael L. Thompson: No, we talk sequentially typically for those measures.
Andrew Steinerman - J.P. Morgan: On shredding, or document management business overall, I think you gave internal growth with paper. Could you give us the trend if you looked at the service business by itself there?
Michael L. Thompson: The service business internal growth was 13%. That excluded the paper, versus 17% last quarter.
Operator: Your next question comes from Vance Edelson - Morgan Stanley.
Vance Edelson - Morgan Stanley: You mentioned plentiful acquisition opportunities and possible international expansion. I'm just wondering what some of your parameters would be when you start looking over what might come along and what makes international an attractive avenue for growth, versus plowing money back into the U.S. And then a follow-up on that would be how much of your balance sheet are you willing to use for acquisitions, what do you consider a comfortable level of cash? I take it you would use the Canadian cash first, so the amount you have there, is that a good guideline for the amount that you might ultimately use for acquisitions?
William C. Gale: You have a lot of questions in there and some of the things are so specific I couldn't give you an answer. Let me talk in some general terms. You know, our strategy has been, in the U.S. and in Canada, to always look for acquisition opportunities to help fill out our geographic presence in all our businesses. We are still doing that, filling out that geographic presence in our fire and in our document management business, and we'll continue to do so. We will evaluate opportunities as they present themselves to make sure that they meet our criteria for our various hurdle rates, etc. Now, we have also been, over the years, aggressive in determining whether there were some strategic acquisitions in our businesses that helped in markets that we're at. A good example of that was Van Dyne Crotty we did a few years ago, where we bought a very good company that had business in most of the markets where we were and it really enhance the profitability of those markets by picking up a lot of new business. And we will continue to look for those. Up until this point and time, over the last couple of years though, there hasn't been, I don't think, a reasonable expectation on the part of the sellers with regard to the value they were wanting to receive and therefore we haven't really made any acquisitions in that area. Now, with regard to overseas, you know, our focus has been to proceed cautiously. We bought our first document management company in Europe a couple of years ago. We followed it up with another acquisition in Germany this past winter. We are very happy and pleased with the results of those acquisitions and we are looking overseas to continue to expand that presence in that business, as well as look at opportunities for some of our other businesses. Surely the Canadian cash is going to be a big part of the capital that we use to acquire those businesses, but we're not limited by that. Because we also believe that with some of our borrowing capability and our commercial paper market that we can access, etc., that we can make a bigger acquisition if the right opportunity presented itself and we would do that. As far as our comfort level, we have always claimed, and we have demonstrated, that given the cash nature of our businesses, it's very easy for us to leverage up the balance sheet to go up to 35% to 40% on a debt to cap basis, because we can quickly pay that down through our businesses. So I would say if the right opportunity came along, we would have no qualms in borrowing the amount of capital necessary to make the right acquisition, you know, in any of our businesses, either here in North America or in some of the selected businesses outside of North America.
Vance Edelson - Morgan Stanley: Additionally, sort of a twist on a question already asked, regarding any additional cost cutting. Granted, you are always looking for improved efficiencies, but in terms of right-sizing for the current conditions, it sounds like based on the flexibility of the routes and so forth, you can continue to cut costs as needed and we're not going to get a point where you say, okay, we can't cut any more, or we don't want to cut any more, because the rebound is eventually coming. Does that sound fair?
Michael L. Thompson: Yes, that's very fair. We can certainly right-size our organization in either direction. The nice thing is we've been at these various levels not too long ago because we have been a growing company in the past and expect to be again in the future. So we certainly are looking at our cost structure very carefully. We want to be able to exploit any opportunities that come available.  Certainly, they've been fewer and far between over the last 12 months, but hopefully with the situation going from bad to not-as-bad, and with jobs hopefully it's going to turn to flat, and then positive, we certainly do not want to get behind and not have the ability to grow, and we believe we have sufficient capacity to do that in our operating plants and we can manage our route structure appropriately.
Vance Edelson - Morgan Stanley: On the medical costs, you mentioned a significant increase in plan usage. Is there anything that would explain that or is that just likely an aberration?
William C. Gale: We're continuing to analyze it. I would tell you that our first quarter medical costs tend to be some of our highest quarter anyway, but the other phenomena that may be happening here is that due to the reduction in our workforce, we're finding that many of the employees who have left Cintas are continuing to remain on our medical plan, and we're self-insured.  And under some of the new government inducements for people to remain on COBRA, where the government is providing some of the sustenance for that, we think that there may be an increased usage of the medical benefits on the part of former employees who are still within our plan. So we are going to keep analyzing that. I'm not sure if that's the total reason, but from a dollar perspective, that seems to be a logical explanation based on what we're able to tell right now.
Operator: Your next question comes from Gary Bisbee - Barclays Capital.
Gary Bisbee - Barclays Capital: The gross margin is up nicely, sequentially. Is part of that due to the extra work day or is that just more revenue and it flows through the same margin?
Michael L. Thompson: A light bump for the extra work day but it's mainly from the cost-saving initiatives and the solidifying of the revenue.
Gary Bisbee - Barclays Capital: And so now that you're sort of a full quarter past the big cost moves, should we expect any further incremental improvement or unless things get worse and you decide to keep cutting, is this sort of a good baseline level to thing about?
Michael L. Thompson: No, we think our margins will get back to more historical levels if revenue stays stable. And also, a big component of that is job loss. Because when you lose existing customers or individuals at existing customers, it's pretty expensive. So until that becomes flattish, it's very difficult to improve margins. But, it was easier over the last three months than it was the previous six to that, because there was some stabilization. That certainly helps in that regard. Do we think there is certainly more to go? Yes, we think margins can improve from here, if revenue remains at these levels or goes up. But again, you've got to look at the mix. If there's a significant amount of job loss in there and a significant amount of new business, well then that's more difficult because you're losing a very profitable business and injecting expensive business. So it comes down to mix a little bit, but certainly this quarter was an improvement.
Gary Bisbee - Barclays Capital: So if I think about the impact in November and then again in February, when I believe you have one less work day, sequentially, each quarter, can we maintain this type of margins based on the cost cutting you've done, or are they likely to fall because unless your organic growth changes dramatically, revenue likely drifts lower with the one less work day.
William C. Gale: The point that you need to factor in is really the reduction in the revenue because of the less work day. So the impact on the margin percent isn't going to be all that significant, all else being equal, given what Mike said. Now, that's a very important factor, what Mike said. But I think the thing that we would caution you, those of you who put out estimates, is to be sure that you factor in the impact that that lack of revenue has in a 64-day work day quarter versus a 66-work day quarter. Because that basically falls almost all the way through to the bottom line. So just be very careful as you put your estimates together. I wouldn't worry so much about the percentage of the margins themselves. That's not going to be all that significant.
Gary Bisbee - Barclays Capital: So is 42.9% consolidated gross margin a reasonable number, if nothing else changes dramatically, to think about over the rest of fiscal 2010?
William C. Gale: Well, let's be realistic. Obviously it is an approximate number but things are going to change, because things do change. We have hanger price fluctuations, we have energy, we have utilization of various facilities. But generally speaking, it may improve, depending on what the mix of the business is. But it's probably a good basis on which to start.
Gary Bisbee - Barclays Capital: I just wanted to probe the comments around the components of organic growth, but the one comment I think that Mike made was you've done a better job of identifying opportunities within customers. Can you give us some sense, are you trying to figure out which customers businesses are growing and focus on them, or is it much more hammering home, trying to get cross-sell? What's driving that improvement?
William C. Gale: All of that. Basically, you go into a customer and you look for are there people working in jobs that should be wearing uniforms that maybe for one reason or another are not wearing uniforms. And just working on getting those people into the uniform. You look for the entrance mats, the hygiene services, bringing in potentially some first aid or fire business is always an opportunity. I think we are trying to help our service providers become sales people and look for the opportunities to enhance the business that they have with their customers by looking at the full spectrum of products and services that we as a company are not offering. And I think that as they are interested in taking care of their customers and making sure that their paychecks stay at levels that will sustain the life style that they want, that they're adopting that and they're realizing that customers will take on some additional products and services because it will benefit the customer as well as the service provider and Cintas as a company.
Michael L. Thompson: A lot of that is certainly focus. When you are growing substantially your route professional is trying to take on a lot of new customers, balance out what he's doing. Well, in today's environment that taking care of the customer certainly means go in and make sure that we're doing everything we should be for them. And by rerouting and making sure people understand their customers and really have that focus of where is the rest of the business, that is a very important point.  Versus in a heavy expansion mode you want to be able to do both but the reality is sometimes in these situations it gives you the ability to go in and focus on your customer, prove to them that you can continue to support them sufficiently, thanks to our balance sheet and cash flow, etc., but then also while you're there, identify those opportunities that sometimes you pass up in the past.
Gary Bisbee - Barclays Capital: The comment on positive add/stop sequentially, obviously not year-over-year.
Michael L. Thompson: It's year-over-year, too, because all of last year it was a stop ratio versus an add ratio.
Gary Bisbee - Barclays Capital: And so how are you doing that in light of continued job losses for the economy?
Michael L. Thompson: It's what we just talked about.
William C. Gale: It's focus. And you make sure that you have the right product offerings.
Michael L. Thompson: There are still job losses going on. The difference was that we've been more successful at finding other adds within our existing customer base to offset those losses that are certainly still coming through the economy.
William C. Gale: And with that said, though, we are going to be very careful here. We don't want to predict that that's going to continue for the rest of the year. We hope it does, but it's just a very difficult—and continues to be a very difficult environment out there. And I think that we have to proceed very cautiously as we go forward, just to make sure that what we are sensing maybe as the beginning of a recovery, we hope that really will be sustainable going forward. So we just want everyone to realize that while we are somewhat encouraged by what we've seen in our first quarter, we're certainly not back to the growth that we saw a few years ago. And we just hope that maybe this trend will continue to expand across the country and go forward for the rest of our fiscal year and beyond.
Gary Bisbee - Barclays Capital: I didn't hear what the Other Service, in aggregate, organic revenue growth was.
Michael L. Thompson: Because I didn't give it. Other Services, internal growth, for the quarter was negative 18%.
Operator: Your next question comes from Analyst for Ashwin Shirvaikar – Citigroup.
Analyst for Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup: I wanted to drill down on some of the ancillary segment. Saw some nice sequential improvement in margins in direct sales and in first aid. Do you think margins in those segments can improve sequentially without any notable revenue increase?
William C. Gale: I wouldn't say without a notable revenue increase. I mean, there could be some slight improvement. But I think the opportunity we have is we are continuing to see the service and purge revenue in document management improve and increase. That is continuing to grow. And we've always said that as we fill out the size of these operations from around the country to have a bigger mass, they'll be able to absorb more of the fixed costs and thus improve the margins. So that will certainly help. Regarding the direct sale business, that's a tough business right now. It's still very much focused on the lodging and gaming institutions. I'm not sure yet whether or not we can see a lot of opportunity there without revenue growth, but when revenue growth comes back that will certainly help offset some of those fixed and semi-fixed costs. First aid and fire, we will continue to see improved margins on the first aid side. And the fire, as we expand around the country to develop the national footprint, you're going to have growth in some of the operations that are maturing, but some of the new operations are going to be a bit of a drag. So that one is going to be a little bit more neutral, probably, in the foreseeable future until we get the national footprint developed.
Analyst for Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup: On capex, do you have any projection for your capex?
William C. Gale: We're not really providing any guidance at this point on capex either, although I would tell you that what you saw in the first quarter is probably the rate that we're going to spend throughout the rest of the year.
Operator: Your next question comes from Andrea Wirth - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.
Andrea Wirth - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Wondering if you could just talk a little about the guidance suspension and when we should expect you to reinstate that. Obviously things do look like they're getting a little bit better. I understand your caution, but Bill, you did say once the economy starts growing again, or stops shrinking, you should actually see some growth, and by all accounts the economy is expected to start growing next quarter. So again, I understand the caution, but what do you really need to see to get that confidence to reinstate the guidance?
William C. Gale: First off, I'll take a little issue with you. I hope you're right on the next quarter that we'll see growth, but we'll see. I don't know. It's a big item of discussion here. Right now there is just obviously is a lack of visibility. I guess we will certainly give it consideration when we are more confident in our ability to predict the future. We got away, several years ago, from this quarterly guidance. We went to an annual guidance. We don't believe we'll ever resume quarterly guidance because we think that's there's just too much difficult in doing that and probably too much attention paid to it. So I would tell you that once we have a comfort level within the entire company, we will give it consideration to resume guidance. I can't guarantee when that will be but we will continue to look at it.
Andrea Wirth - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: And looking at your overall headcount, I believe last quarter you mentioned it was down 12%. Is that still roughly where it's at?
William C. Gale: Yes, it is.
Andrea Wirth - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: And specifically your sales force headcount, is your sales force headcount up, down? How do we think about where your sales force is and have you started adding to that yet at this point?
William C. Gale: We're adding in selective situations.
Andrea Wirth - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: You had mentioned that one of our expectations to try to grow the businesses, you try to aggressively try to take market share. Can you address a little more specifically how you intend to do that? I know you did mention that you're trying to add specifically within existing customers but how do you really aggressively go after market share, aside from pricing? And do we need to worry that pricing is something that is going to weigh on margins going forward?
William C. Gale: We don't to become an aggressive price gouger, to go out and try to do it that way. We look at it as opportunities when contracts come up for renewal, we make sure that we know when that is happening, that we are able to present our case to the prospect, demonstrate why Cintas' products and services are better than what their incumbent was. We meet price competition if it makes economic sense for us to do so.  And I think we find that a lot of times that once the prospect understands our service system and the types of products we can get and our reputation, we win many more of those than we lose. So I think we'll just continue to do that.
Michael L. Thompson: In addition to that, service is very important and certain competitors falter with service levels due to the economic times and having issues of upgrading garments, etc. We certainly are looking at the ability of taking over those customers, when it makes sense and those customers look for a change. So certainly service and reputation is very significant in this market.
Andrea Wirth - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: On the direct sale business, just looking at the operating income, it was up about $6.0 million sequential, but revenue was actually down. Just wondering, want to understand specifically what happened there, and is it now the kind of sustainable level of operating income, in the direct sale business, assuming that revenues are able to kind of be sustained at this level?
Michael L. Thompson: It's difficult to say for that business because it is so choppy and you do need some level of revenue on a monthly basis to cover those fixed costs that Bill talked about earlier.  Certainly we did a lot of right-sizing within that organization and certainly are looking at inventory levels very closely to ensure we don't get ahead of ourselves with products on the shelves that then become obsolete due to downturns in revenue levels. And that certainly had some impact as we aggressively manage those inventory levels. So it's difficult to answer that question completely because that business is choppy. But certainly we have kind of gotten through the difficult couple of quarters with that. We hope that if the revenues remain at this level that our margins can stay where they are or go up a little bit.
Andrea Wirth - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: So you would probably say sequentially that the majority of the increase is probably due to the cost cutting initiatives? Is that fair to say?
Michael L. Thompson: Yes. For the most part, yes.
Operator: That does conclude our Question & Answer session.
William C. Gale: Thank you all very much for joining us today. We appreciate your interest. We're glad that we were able to report some better results than we had been the last couple of quarters. We expect to release our second quarter earnings sometime after December 15 and we look forward to talking to you then.
Operator: This concludes today’s conference call.

Operator:  Good day, everyone and welcome to the Cintas quarterly earnings results conference call. Today’s call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Bill Gale, Senior Vice President of Finance and Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead, sir. 
William C. Gale: Good evening and thank you for joining us tonight. The current recession continues to impact our customers in a significant way. As a result of the ongoing job losses, which have exceeded $5.5 million in the last 12 months, our revenues are showing a decline for the first time in 40 years. According to the U.S. Department of Labor, this job loss is 40% greater than losses experienced in 1982 and 2001 combined.  Today we announced fourth quarter revenue of $879 million, a 13% decrease from last year’s fourth quarter. As we announced in late May, fourth quarter results include a restructuring, impairment, and inventory valuation charge amounting to $54 million after tax.  Excluding this charge, earnings per diluted share were $0.38 in the fourth quarter, or $0.01 higher than the upper end of the range we provided in the May 29th announcement.  The economic conditions being faced by our customers continued to impact our revenue as customers reduce headcount. While we are adjusting our cost structure to meet these lower revenue levels, the severity and speed of the job reductions make it difficult to consolidate routes and plant capacity fast enough to offset the revenue declines.  However, we will continue to remain profitable and generate solid cash flow. Also, when employment begins to increase again, the marginal profitability of the additional uniform wearer or first aid user will be significant.  We are very pleased with our overall financial condition. During the fourth quarter, we generated over $185 million in cash from operating activities. During fiscal 2009, we paid off $165 million of commercial paper, paid our annual dividend amounting to $72 million, and yet increased our cash and marketable securities by $60 million. As of May 31, 2009, we had no commercial paper outstanding and have cash and marketable securities of approximately $250 million.  During this economic slow-down, we continue to generate substantial cash flow and are able to keep our debt capacity available for opportunities that will arise for additional acquisitions or more rapid expansion throughout the world.  Due to the lack of visibility with the employment levels expected over the next 12 months, we are unable to provide any meaningful guidance and thus have chosen not to do so. We suggest that those of you making an estimate of our performance focus on the results experienced by Cintas in our fourth quarter and temper future results with your expectations of ongoing employment levels.  The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides the Safe Harbor from civil litigation for forward-looking statements. This conference call contains forward-looking statements that reflect the company’s current views as to future events and financial performance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those we may discuss.  I refer you to the discussion on these points contained in our most recent filings with the SEC.  Joining me today is Mike Thompson, Cintas' Vice President and Treasurer. Mike will now provide more details on our results and after his comments, we will open the call to questions. Mike. 
Michael L. Thompson: Thank you, Bill and good evening. As Bill mentioned, total revenues were $879 million for the quarter, a 13% decrease from $1.01 billion reported for the fourth quarter of last year. Internal growth was also a negative 13%.  As Bill mentioned, all of our businesses are being impacted by the significant ongoing job losses and a difficult economic environment. Revenue was also negatively impacted by 1% due to a weaker Canadian dollar.  Before I discuss the quarter in more detail, as a planning note for fiscal 2010, the number of work days by quarter for next year are 66 works days in the first quarter, 65 in Q2, 64 in Q3, and 66 in Q4. As a reminder, each quarter in fiscal year 2009 had 65 work days.  We classify our businesses into four reportable operating segments -- rental uniforms and ancillary products, uniform direct sales, first aid safety and fire protection services, and document management services.  Uniform direct sales, first aid safety and fire protection services and document management services are combined and presented as other services on the face of the income statement.  The rental uniforms and ancillary products operating segment consists of the rental and servicing of uniforms and other garments, mats, mops, shop towels, and other related items. Our restroom and hygiene products and services are also included within this segment.    Rental uniforms and ancillary products revenue accounted for 74% of total company revenue in the fourth quarter. Within rental, based on fourth quarter revenue levels, uniform rental accounts were approximately 53% of the revenue. Dust control, which is mainly entrance mats, accounts for 22%. Hygiene, which is mainly restroom supply and cleaning, is 11%. Shop towels, 5%. And linen and other is 9%.  As a reminder, linen is mainly non-person specific garments such as aprons and butcher kits. We do not service many tablecloths, napkins, or bed sheets.  Rental revenues were $647.5 million for the quarter, a 9% decrease in revenues as compared to the fourth quarter of last year. Rental internal growth for the quarter was also a negative 9%.  This reduction is a direct reflection of the overall economic environment and also includes a negative 1% impact from a weaker Canadian dollar.  All four of our key revenue metrics continued to deteriorate in the fourth quarter, with a negative ad stop ratio having the most impact. This is not surprising, given the significant number of job losses that have occurred over the last 12 months. As compared to the third quarter, rental revenue decreased 4%.  Unemployment has almost doubled since the beginning of fiscal 2009 and was 9.5% at the end of June. The impact is even more dramatic with approximately two-thirds of the job losses occurring in traditional uniform wearing industries. These losses impact all of our metrics.  While we are doing a good job of retaining our customers, our ad stop ratio suffers due to lower headcount at our customers. Lost business increases as companies go out of business and/or do not pay their bills.  We continue to sell new business but average new customer size has decreased and new business is harder to obtain as prospects are resistant to new programs in this environment. Additionally, price increases become harder to obtain as customers control their spending.  While we are bearing the impact of our share of these job losses, our data indicates that our market share is not deteriorating. Consistent with that, our customer satisfaction levels remain very high and our customer retention levels are good. These factors provide us confidence that as the market solidifies, our results will improve.  Our other services revenue category on the income statement is comprised of uniform direct sales, first aid safety and fire protection, and document management operating segments.  The uniform direct sales operating segment includes the direct sale of uniforms, branded promotional products, and other related products to national and regional customers through our global accounts and strategic markets division. This segment also includes the direct sale of uniforms and related products to local customers who typically also rent products from us. This includes items sold through our direct sale catalog.  Uniform direct sale revenue accounted for 11% of total company revenue in the fourth quarter, down from 14% in fiscal 2008. Within this segment, our global accounts division has a significant amount of business with the lodging, hospitality, and gaming industries. These industries continue to suffer and are cutting costs and reducing headcount.  While our uniform direct sale business is directly impacted by headcount, it is also impacted by discretionary spending. Given current conditions, very few new property openings or refresh programs are occurring. Refresh programs are sales which occur when customers change or refresh their uniform design at a property or throughout their organization. During economic downturns, these discretionary types of spending tend to slow or even stop.  The current economic downturn is the most significant we’ve experienced since entering this business in the 1990s. This segment’s sales for the fourth quarter were down 33% from a year ago and internal growth was also a negative 33%.  In our first aid safety and fire protection services business, we sell and deliver first aid products, safety products, and automatic defibrillators to our customers. We also provide safety training to their employees.  Within fire protection, we install, inspect, repair, and recharge portable fire extinguishers and sprinkler systems. We also provide and service emergency lighting systems and kitchen fire suppression systems.  First aid safety and fire protection accounted for 9% of total company fourth quarter revenue. During the quarter, revenues within our first aid safety and fire protection services operating segment decreased 21% and internal growth was negative 22% in the fourth quarter.  The first aid and safety revenue in this segment is reliant on customer employee headcount. As customer employment levels decrease, there are less people requiring first aid products such as bandages and tablets and less safety products such as hard hats and eye protection. This situation is compounded, given little business expansion or new construction, which normally helps further drive safety sales.  On a positive note, our on-site training program revenue was positive for the year, as our customers reduce their headcount, they rely on us more to provide their first aid training. We continue to develop into the third-party first aid and safety consultant and provider.  Fire protection revenue continues to decline, primarily in installation revenue, due to the lack of commercial construction and expansion. Customer facility closures and consolidations are also impacting fire protection revenue.  We continue to exit the installation business, other than a few markets where we have a sufficient presence in installation infrastructure. Our focus on fire protection services has been and continues to be on the test, inspection, and repair of portable fire extinguishers, exit lighting, and fire suppression systems.  Revenue for this portion of fire protection services was significantly less impacted by the economy than the installation portion of the business. Our document management services operating segment is comprised mainly of document shredding services, although we do have storage and imaging capabilities. Document management represents 6% of fourth quarter total company revenue.  As with many commodities, recycle paper prices rose dramatically during fiscal 2008, providing additional revenue for our shredding business. Prices reached their peak in April of 2008. Since that time, paper prices have fallen back to more historical levels and prices have been fairly stable over the last six months. Excluding this impact, our document shredding service and purge business provided internal growth of 17%. Including recycled paper, internal growth was a negative 4%.  Total growth of document management, including acquisitions, was a positive 1% for the quarter.  During fiscal 2008, we expanded our document management business to Europe through an acquisition in The Netherlands, and in fiscal 2009, we further expanded into Germany through another acquisition. Both operations continue to meet expectations and we continue to look for additional expansion opportunities in this business, both domestically and abroad.  Fourth quarter total company gross margin was 38.1%. However, this margin included the inventory valuation portion of the restructure, impairment, and inventory valuation charge. As indicated in the release, the total after tax charge was $54 million. On a pretax basis, the charge was $86.6 million. This is broken down as follows -- $48.9 million is the loss on impairment of long-lived assets and appears on the face of the financial statements. The majority of this charge relates to the write-down of real estate and equipment in conjunction with plant consolidations under the restructure plan; $10.2 million is for restructuring charges, including lease termination, severance, and other direct costs related to the rental plant consolidations. This amount also appears on the face of the income statement; $27.5 million is for the inventory valuation charge. This charge established an appropriate reserve on inventory based on current customer demand. The inventory valuation charge is included as a charge to cost of goods sold; $8.4 million of the charge is included in cost of rental uniforms and ancillary products and $19.1 million is included in cost of other services. The $19.1 million charge included in cost of other services is the sum of a $16.1 million charge in uniform direct sale and $3 million charge in first aid safety and fire protection services. Excluding the inventory valuation charge, total company gross margin increases from 38.1% to 41.2%. This is 170 basis points lower than the total company 2008 fourth quarter margin of 42.9%. The decrease is due to the impact of lower revenue, partially offset by energy cost improvement.  Despite a $30 million decrease in total revenue from the third quarter, the 41.2% adjusted total company margin is in line with the 41.4% margin earned in the third quarter.  Rental margin excluding the inventory valuation charge was 43.6%, while other services adjusted margin was 34.5%.  Energy costs for the company were 2.7% for the quarter, as compared to 4% in last year’s fourth quarter, due to lower delivery fuel and natural gas expense. Energy costs for the third quarter were 3.1%. This 40 basis point improvement was mainly through lower natural gas expense.  While energy pricing plays a large part of the improvement year over year and quarter to quarter, we are also gaining efficiencies through more efficient routing structures and other energy conservation measures.  Rental gross margin was 42.3% of revenue for the quarter, but 43.6% when excluding the inventory valuation charge. The 43.6% adjusted gross margin is a 30 basis point decrease from the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 and a 20 basis point decrease as compared to last quarter. The decrease was due to the effect of lower revenues on material costs.  When garments, mats, and other rental items are placed into service, they begin amortizing over their useful life, generally 18 months for garments and 36 months for entrance mats. This amortization period is not adjusted or halted. This means that during a period of decreasing revenue, material cost as a percent to revenue will typically increase due to inventory injections that occurred in prior months when the business being supported was at a greater level.  Material cost in dollars was consistent as compared to last year’s fourth quarter and to last quarter but on a percent of sales basis, it increased 180 basis points from the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 and 100 basis points in the third quarter, primarily due to these lower revenue levels.  As mentioned earlier, energy costs were lower in the fourth quarter, which offset most of this increase in material costs.  In addition, while plant and delivery labor as a percent of sales were flat, the company did reduce those labor costs by $12 million compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 and $7 million as compared to the third quarter, as we continue to bring our cost structure in line with current revenue levels.  Excluding the restructured charge, other services gross margin was 34.5% for the quarter, as compared to 40.5% in last year’s fourth quarter, but in line with the 34.7% in the third quarter.  The decrease compared to the prior year is due to the decrease in uniform direct sale and first aid safety and fire protection revenue and to a lesser extent, the reduction in recycled paper prices being received in document management.  As compared to the third quarter, when excluding the restructured charge, uniform direct sale and document management margins improved 100 basis points each but the improvement was offset by deterioration in the fire protection services within first aid safety and fire.  Selling and administrative expenses were 28.9% of revenue. We have reduced SG&A expense by $25 million as compared to last year’s fourth quarter, including a $6 million reduction in G&A labor and a $10 million reduction in total employee related costs, such as payroll taxes, workers compensation, and medical costs.  However, the sudden and rapid decrease in revenue caused a 120 basis point increase in SG&A on a percent of sales basis. We continue to aggressively manage our cost structure to bring these costs in line with current revenue levels.  Likewise, SG&A costs decreased $3.4 million as compared to the third quarter but increased 60 basis points on a percent of sales basis.  Within SG&A, our bad debt increased approximately $6 million over the fourth quarter of last year, primarily due to increased reserve requirements for fire installation customers. Certain customers in this line have increased financial difficulties and some are facing or have entered bankruptcy proceedings. This is another reason we continue to exit much of this business.  We also increased our bad debt reserve for specific rental customers due to bankruptcies, including balances related to certain automotive industry related customers. Despite these increases, our bad debt was 0.5% of revenue and consistent with bad debt expense for each of the last three quarters.  Net interest costs this quarter of $11.7 million was down slightly as compared to $12.1 million in last year’s fourth quarter and $11.9 million last quarter. The reduction was due to lower outstanding commercial paper.  Our effective tax rate was 58.8% for the quarter, which reflects the effect of the restructure. The full year effective tax rate was 37.4%, which is in line with previous estimates.  Our balance sheet continues to be strong. Our current ratio was over 4-to-1 at May 31st, and our equity has improved to a record $2.4 billion. Cash and marketable securities increased $58 million over May 31, 2008, and by $98 million since February 28, 2009 due to strong cash flow.  The $120 million of marketable securities at May 31, 2009 are all held in Canada. These funds, which are generated from operations there, are held in short-term conservative government investments and are currently being held for investment opportunities outside the United States.  DSOs on accounts receivable were 42 days. We continue to actively manage our accounts receivable in order to lessen any impact from current economic conditions.  New goods inventory levels decreased $36 million from May 31, 2008 and $50 million from February 28, 2009. $27.5 million of the increase is the inventory valuation charge taken in the fourth quarter. The additional $8.5 million reduction from last year-end and $22.5 million reduction since the end of the third quarter is through aggressive inventory management in conjunction with lower sales volume.  Uniforms and other items in service decreased $35 million as compared to last May and $17 million as compared to February. The negative ad stop ratio allows us to pull a greater percentage of used garments from our rental operation stock rooms and in conjunction with lower new business, reduces the need for additional new garment injections.  Assets held for sale of $16 million on the balance sheet represents the value of real estate and equipment for consolidated operations under the restructure. Also as noted in the supplementary information included with the earnings release, no impairment charge was required or recorded for good will or other intangibles.  Long-term debt at May 31, 2009 was $787 million. All of the outstanding debt at May 31st was fixed rate debt and it had an average interest rate of approximately 6%. Total debt as a percentage of total book capitalization was 25%. Net debt, or long-term debt less cash and marketable securities as a percent of total capitalization was 18%.  The company’s current assets exceed company total liabilities by over $200 million. This does not include the current real estate and equipment value, which on an historical cost basis net of depreciation was $915 million.  Our cash flow remains strong, with cash provided by operations totaling $524 million and free cash flow of $363 million, which is an increase of $11 million. Capital expenditures were $160 million for the year. This included approximately $43 million that was spent in conjunction with certain IT infrastructure capital projects, including implementation costs of an SAP, ERP financial system. Of the $43 million, $3 million was spent in the fourth quarter.  Excluding capital for these projects, the $117 million in capital expenditures was invested as follows: $87 million was invested in the rental division. These expenditures were primarily for ongoing maintenance CapEx but also included completion of a couple of rental plans which were under construction earlier in the year. Last year we spent $140 million in rental division CapEx, so this represents a $53 million reduction this year; $2 million was spent in uniform direct sale, as compared to $7 million last year; $6 million in first aid safety and fire as compared to $12 million last year; and $22 million in document management as compared to $31 million last year.  While the rate of growth has slowed in the document management business, the service revenue continues to grow at a double-digit rate. We continue to invest growth capital mainly in the form of mobile shredding trucks and industrial shredding equipment.  In fiscal 2009, we spent $31 million on strategic acquisitions, mainly of document management businesses. We continue to evaluate acquisition candidates but valuations need to continue to come in line with today’s market realities. We have sufficient cash and access to capital were an acquisition opportunity to present itself at the right valuation.  Despite a difficult economy, which caused lower revenues and earnings, our strong cash flow, combined with lower capital expenditures and fewer acquisitions, allowed us to fully pay off our commercial paper balance as of May 31, 2009. Our $600 million commercial paper program remains in effect through February of 2011.  In addition to paying off over $155 million in debt during the year, we also increased our annual dividend payment to shareholders, paying $72 million during the fourth quarter. This increased dividend demonstrates our confidence in cash generation despite a difficult economy.  Our cash flow and balance sheet are providing us the financial stability to address current economic concerns while enabling us to be poised for future expansion when market conditions improved.  Thank you and I will now turn the call back over to Bill. 
William C. Gale: At this point, we’ll be happy to answer any questions that you have, so Jessica, if you want to explain how to do that, we will start. 
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Ashwin Shirvaikar.
Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup: My first question is actually about the sustainability of the lower cost structure as revenues eventually come back. So to what extent would you expect costs to go back up with revenues in an eventual recovery? If you could take us through the math or the thought process and maybe some examples of what kind of cost you are taking out?
William C. Gale: Okay. Well, I guess let’s assume that there’s no significant change in cost components like energy but assuming that, what you will see initially is as we add -- as our customers add back employees, we will begin to see the marginal profitability of that additional revenue to improve margins going forward.  Now once you -- your top line growth that’s caused by new business continues to go up, you are going to start injecting more garments but we believe that the margins for the business segments will actually improve in an improving economic environment. 
Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup: Would you expect the profitability of the rental segment to get back down to the 16%, or possibly higher level in the next couple of years?
William C. Gale: We would -- assuming again the basis that I said on energy costs, as an example, we absolutely believe we can get our margins back to more historical levels. 
Michael L. Thompson: A side note on that as well, Ashwin, is that with the restructure project, we were very careful that we were not taking all our capacity out of markets. We want to ensure that we have the ability to grow when the market does turn around. 
Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup: Okay, and a couple of housekeeping questions -- one is, could you provide the split for the inventory adjustment charge between all the various segments?
William C. Gale:  Mike can give you that again. 
Michael L. Thompson: The piece -- it was $27.5 million was the total inventory valuation charge. Of that, $8.4 million was in the cost of rentals and 19.1 is cost of other services. Of the 19.1 in cost of other services, 16.1 is in uniform direct sale and $3 million is first aid safety and fire. 
Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup: And with regard to document management, the impact of paper prices obviously is there. You’ve said in the past that you had a contract that went through the end of the fiscal year for paper price sales, for paper sales. What’s the status of the renegotiation? What kind of pricing are you getting as you go forward?
Michael L. Thompson: We actually indicated it goes out through part of this fiscal year, so we are currently in those negotiations but that contract still remains in place at this point in time. 
Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup: So the old contract stays for now?
Michael L. Thompson: Yes. 
Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup: Okay. Thank you. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Vance Edelson from Morgan Stanley.
Vance Edelson - Morgan Stanley : Thanks a lot. In terms of moving out of the fire installation business, you know, even though the bad debt is still pretty low on a percentage basis, at least company-wide, if in the coming years building activity were to pick up again, is that something you could easily get back into, or would you even want to?
William C. Gale: At this point in time, I would say that we would only remain in that business in those markets where we have a -- where we are going to continue to have a significant presence. I doubt if we would decide to expand in any aggressive way in the installation business, even if economic conditions improved. 
Vance Edelson - Morgan Stanley : Okay, and regarding expansion around the world, do you see attractive M&A opportunities right now? In other words, have valuations come down such that now is the time, or close to being the time, or would you rather wait until global growth prospects are stronger?
William C. Gale: Vance, I’d say right now, other than in a very few selected situations, the majority of valuations have not come down to the appropriate levels to justify an acquisition. 
Vance Edelson - Morgan Stanley : Okay, and turning back to the domestic side, are there any areas for investment going forward that you think are likely to turn sooner, a bit more early cycle when you look at your different verticals, or the different business lines in the area that you are thinking over the next 12 months you might actually be investing in?
William C. Gale: Well, I think it all depends on where do the jobs stop declining and where do they start coming back, and we are poised to take advantage based on some of our businesses that we are in where those job -- that job growth may be. For example, if it’s in healthcare, you know, we have direct sale programs in our document management business and even some of our first aid and safety businesses lend themselves very well to the healthcare market, so we are ready to take advantage of that.  In the hospitality and gaming businesses, we’re certainly the largest company in uniform supplier in those businesses and we’ll certainly be the one to take advantage of any growth in that potential.  You know, I think in the uniform rental side, you know, our strategy has been to broaden our customer base over the last several years to take advantage of where the economy is going, so I think that we will be in a position to take advantage of any improvement that does happen, regardless of which business it’s in. I just at this time can’t predict where that’s going to be or how quickly that’s going to happen. 
Vance Edelson - Morgan Stanley : Okay, appreciate the color. Thanks. 
Operator: We’ll now go to John Healy from North Coast Research. 
John Healy - North Coast Research: Good evening. A strategy question for you, Bill -- after the last economic downturn, you guys took the opportunity to move from I guess the uniform professional into the service professional. With the balance sheet as strong as it is today and the cash flow that you guys are generating, is there any appetite to begin to kind of I guess further that move into the service professional world, or are you at a level where you guys feel like you are going to remain conservative with the investments? I mean, is there an appetite I guess to begin to try to roll out more services or pilot more services and kind of use this opportunity to try to test things out?
William C. Gale: Well John, despite the economic downturn, our company continues to evaluate other services that we feel have some potential and that we could have a competitive advantage. So those activities are continuing, and I would say that we will continue to look for opportunities to become more of a service professional as long as it meets the criteria that we’ve talked about over the years of being relatively fast-growth businesses, high margin businesses, things that we could get into, you know, and develop a presence and move the needle -- businesses that may be used by a lot of our other customers. So that criteria continues.  We will always be a relatively conservative company in that we are not going to jump into something in a major way until we have proven it to ourselves that it makes sense, but let me tell you that there are several things going on, some of which are very promising right now that we think could enable us to just expand our offerings as the economy begins to improve. 
John Healy - North Coast Research: That’s encouraging. And then you made the comment, Bill, that the average customer that you guys service continues to become smaller. I guess going forward, I have to imagine that the days of servicing -- finding new sales in terms of the 500 employee manufacturing facility, there’s probably not a lot of those opportunities but a lot of opportunities going forward, I imagine, on smaller businesses. Do you see that as a benefit to margins, selling to smaller customers rather than to bigger customers over the long run? Or is that something that is not necessarily a benefit to operating margins I guess going forward?
William C. Gale: Well, you know, keep in mind, all of our customers have always been relatively small customers. The average stop typically has always run between eight and 12 employees. Yeah, we have large manufacturing or large distribution type operations but our bread and butter has always been the smaller -- basically the smaller company or smaller stops of bigger companies. So that strategy doesn’t change.  I think the opportunity we have because of our broad offering of products and services is probably going to be more appealing to the smaller business, so I think that we will become a more valued provider in a number of different things to the small business owner as they look for ways to cut their cost and look for ways to make sure that things are done properly, that they are maintaining a safe environment, maintaining the proper image for their employees.  So the growth that we hope will begin to take place here soon in the economy will be driven by small business and that really has always been our sweet spot, so I think we are probably in even a better position now than we were 10, 15 years ago. 
Michael L. Thompson: And with that, I think we’ve been battling the manufacturing job loss in the United States for years now and I think Bill’s comments were more that because of the job loss, we’re not losing that many more customers. It’s mainly that the customers we have are smaller because they are all losing positions. We expect those to grow back but I agree with your point, John, that there aren’t as many large factories out there that are going to sprout back up in the near future. 
John Healy - North Coast Research: Got it. And then just last question, was there any sort of identifiable trend during the quarter in terms of the declines in revenue? You know, was it steady throughout the quarter -- you know, did it kind of accelerate either at the front-end or the back-end of things?
William C. Gale: Well, you know, you have changes week to week, John, but as we look at trend, I’ll tell you, it was relatively steady, it was probably a little heavier in the early part of the quarter and then it might have seemed to get a little bit better. But it’s still an ugly situation out there with regard to job losses, so it continued pretty much through the quarter.
John Healy - North Coast Research: Okay, great. Thank you so much. 
Operator: We’ll now go to Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer. 
Analyst for Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer: Good afternoon. This is [Alice] for Scott. I guess first of all, can you guys help clarify how much dollar savings that you are having fiscal year ’10 from all the cost reductions from the employment reduction and the closure of locations?
William C. Gale: We are estimating that the impact on fiscal year ’10 from the actions that we took right at the end of our fiscal year ’09 are going to add about $0.03 to $0.04 a share for the year. Now, part of the issue that we have is, as Mike talked about this inventory valuation charge, it’s very difficult to predict when that impact would happen, so what we are talking about when we say $0.03 to $0.04, that’s primarily as a result of this reduction in valuation of some of these fixed assets and the severance costs associated with the termination of certain employees, but that’s the number you are looking for. It’s about $0.03 to $0.04. 
Analyst for Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer: Okay, thanks for the color. And in terms of capital spending, could you provide some colors for the guidance for the next year and what will be your primary areas of investment for fiscal ’10? 
William C. Gale: At this point, we are not going to give specific guidance with regard to capital spending but we will tell you that it will be less than what was spent this year because the majority of the information technology spending on the new ERP system that Mike talked about is pretty well behind us for right now.  But the level of capital spending will vary depending on how quickly the economy recovers, so if the economy recovers quicker, then we would tend to spend a little bit more money buying trucks or expanding, buying equipment. But if the economy continues to be relatively sluggish, then that capital spending, we’ll adjust it to be lower. But I would say for planning purposes, you certainly can assume that it will be less in fiscal ’10 then it was in ’09. 
Michael L. Thompson: And we will continue, just like we did this year, to infuse capital into document management, as long as it continues to grow double-digit, as it did this year.
William C. Gale: We always have maintenance capital. We have to replace trucks, we have to replace some equipment here and there and as Mike said expand, you know, document management should continue to grow and expand. But beyond that, as far as new plants, we don’t anticipate a lot of new plants being built and there’s not going to be a lot of new trucks needed other than to replace those that wear out. 
Analyst for Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer: All right. Thank you, guys.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) We’ll now go to Gary Bisbee from Barclays Capital. 
Matt Gulati - Barclays Capital: This is Matt Gulati on behalf of Gary Bisbee. Just a quick question -- I was wondering if you could provide some commentary on kind of the U.S. reorganization of the automotive industry and what kind of impact that has on both the uniform business, as well as some of the ancillary offerings?
William C. Gale: Well, the biggest impact that we are going to probably feel is going to -- has to do with what happens with the dealership networks. You know, Chrysler has announced a significant reduction in the number of their dealerships, as has General Motors. A lot of the General Motors dealerships haven’t yet been publicly announced, so it’s hard for us to say what that would be.  But offsetting that is going to be determined by what these owners of these dealerships do. Many of them have indicated that they may remain in business as a repair shop, which actually will be to our benefit, because that’s primarily what we are servicing. You know, we have had some impact of some of the plant shut-downs by the big three and some of the supporting industries to those big three. That stuff may not come back, so that may be a permanent loss.  But the vantage that Cintas has always had is that we have a very diverse customer base. We have over 800,000 customers that we are providing different services to. No one customer amounts to any significant amount of our revenue -- in fact, no one customer amounts to more than one-half of 1% of our revenue. So even with the significant reduction in employment in that industry, you know, it’s not going to have a detrimental impact on the company. We are going to be able to continue to service a lot of the industry that fixes cars, the after market, that’s going to continue. And it’s -- as far as the exposure we had to new auto construction is relatively insignificant. 
Michael L. Thompson: And as well, you talked about dealerships, it’s interesting too in that we’ve already been impacted to some degree in that many of the sales professionals have changed to where rented uniforms, and obviously those professionals, the job ranks have been squeezed quite a bit over the last few months. And then you start talking about the back of the house with the mechanics, that work will still need to get done in some fashion.  So while there will certainly be an impact, it’s difficult to quantify, just because that work that they are doing in the back of the house, so to speak, from the mechanic side, will end up somewhere. 
Matt Gulati - Barclays Capital: Great, thanks for that. And then if I could ask a follow-up -- could you quantify or provide an approximate amount, I guess, the level of paper pricing? And also what type of impact that paper pricing has on the document management? I guess what percent of overall document management is made up from the sale of paper?
William C. Gale: We haven’t disclosed that level of detail at this point. Now, Mike did talk about the impact it had on the overall growth rate. I believe the number was -- you know, without the impact of the paper price reduction, the growth of the document management business was 17%; with the paper prices, it was a negative 1%. But we -- you know, for competitive reasons, we don’t want to disclose publicly what our price is and we are concerned that people could back into what our contract is and that’s all very proprietary and we have to keep that quiet. 
Matt Gulati - Barclays Capital: Okay, fair enough. Thanks for your time. Appreciate it. 
Operator: We’ll now go to Vishnu Lekraj from Morningstar.
Vishnu Lekraj - Morningstar: I want to talk a little bit more big picture here, looking out maybe two, three years -- your core competency has been uniform rental, obviously but looking at your newer lines of business, the historical [model] here over the last year-and-a-half, given the recession, how do you guys view this and how should we be thinking about the profitability and the return of these businesses over the next couple of years and if they are going to ramp up to a level where you’ve had in regards to the rental uniform business?
Michael L. Thompson: I think first in response to that, I’m not sure that the other businesses have suffered dramatically, other than uniform direct sale. Certainly first aid has been impacted by less traffic and the installation business, the construction industry has hurt us there and we are exiting that business.  The document management has continued to grow very well and our service side of the fire business is, while it was down a little bit during the year, it was not down dramatically. So I think our emerging business has continued to do pretty well, but certainly just like uniform rental, the economy has impacted them.  As jobs come back, we expect them to come back in that business as well as in uniform rental and we continue to put all of our efforts into maintaining those customers so that we can gain that market share when they do come back.
William C. Gale: I’d say we actually feel very confident that as the economy improves, businesses and our customers are going to continue to look for ways to get things done in their operations without having to add people, without having to worry about it themselves, and we are going to be the company that’s going to be poised to do a lot of that and do it professionally, handle a lot of -- you know, the small details, not just uniforms but facility services, first aid and safety, fire services, document shredding services, and the other things that we are still working on, and we believe that that will enable us to resume very good growth rates into the future. 
Vishnu Lekraj - Morningstar: So on a profitability level, on the return level in terms of investment, would these newer businesses get on par with what you guys have done with rental uniforms?
William C. Gale: Oh, yes. We’ve always stated that other than the direct sale of uniforms, all of these other businesses when they get to the appropriate scale in a market, have profitability levels equal to or greater than our uniform rental business. 
Michael L. Thompson: That’s a very important point that it’s a local operation that needs to get the size. I think many times, people look at the division and say oh, it’s getting big but you’ve got to look at the individual location size from our perspective and it has to get up to critical mass. And we can tell you that when those locations do, in first aid, fire, and document management, the profitability is there. 
Vishnu Lekraj - Morningstar: Okay. One more quick question for you -- I think this has been touched on previously but given that employment here is expected to be at depressed levels, or levels below pre-recession levels for the next couple of years, how do you guys plan on maintaining the profitability within your route distribution network, in terms of -- 
William C. Gale: Well first off, I don’t know if it will remain at these levels or not, so we are going to be prepared to react to whatever situation that comes our way and the way we are going to do that is the way we started to do that over the last nine months, is that we will do route consolidations, we will do plant consolidations, if necessary. We look for other opportunities to reduce overhead in our operations and in our corporate office, so our -- we’ve already started this process and we can -- we’ve got a very flexible organization that enables us to adjust for these type of things and it just takes us a while to get there.  So as Mike said, you know, material costs, the uniforms, once you inject them into a new customer and then if that customer reduces headcount, we bring those garments back into our stock room and if we don’t have another place to use them, then we continue to bear the cost of that in our cost structure because part of it is the way we, you know, through our conservative accounting that we deal with this.  So I think that over time, we can adjust our cost structure to the revenue levels that we will be dealing with because the company wasn’t -- it wasn’t too long ago we wrapped these type of revenue levels.  So we know what to do, we just have to be careful you don’t overreact because you want to be able to take advantage of the improvement in the economy whenever that takes place, which we believe certainly is going to take place -- we just don’t know when. 
Michael L. Thompson: Certainly what would help is if the job loss just doesn’t continue to deteriorate. If we would get to an unemployment level that’s stable, then we believe we can start recovering from that and then beyond that, when you get to growth, a good example for uniforms, for example, is on a typical customer, if you he had 11 wearers six months ago and we’re down to nine today, you’re dropping about 18%. Well, if we go back to just one additional wearer in the next six months, you get 12% growth out of that 11% growth. And the marginal profitability of that growth is significant because you were already stopping the truck, in many times you have the garments already in your stock room, you are already paying the driver, the production is pretty easy to pick up on, so the profitability can really pick up quite quickly. 
Vishnu Lekraj - Morningstar: Great. Thanks, appreciate it. 
Operator: And we’ll now go to Greg Halter with Great Lakes Review. 
Greg Halter - Great Lakes Review: Good afternoon and thanks for taking the questions. I wonder if you could comment on overall pricing for the -- especially on the rental side, and then on the cost side, the hangars and medical costs, which have at least during fiscal ’09 appeared to be an issue at certain points in the quarter, of the year. 
William C. Gale: Well pricing has certainly become a much more difficult situation with regard to getting price increases through because obviously with CPI down, there has been -- you know, and due to a lot of customers having their own issues, we’ve had to basically work with our customers to keep price increases in line.  New business pricing remains very competitive. It always has. There have been certain markets where it’s become even more competitive but we continue to evaluate the business based on the future profitability of that business to the company and the growth of that customer, and we will react accordingly but we are not going to just continue to chase prices down if a competitor decides that they want to try to do that in a particular market.  With regard to some of the cost issues, I would say that the hanger prices have now returned back to more normal levels, after the run-up that we saw about a year ago. They are back down to more normalized levels and the -- what was the other one that you asked, Greg?
Greg Halter - Great Lakes Review: Medical. 
William C. Gale: Medical costs were relatively flat on a percent of sales basis, while medical costs continued to increase, some of the programs that we have put in effect are having an impact. Of course, we have lower headcount, which that is helping us. And you know, it’s something that we are concerned about in the future. We continue to try to make sure that we balance providing our employee partners with the proper level of medical benefits while at the same time making sure that we are not, you know, spending too much money on it from a company and a shareholder perspective. So it’s -- but I would say it’s been staying in line on a percent of sales basis over the last 12 months. 
Greg Halter - Great Lakes Review: Okay, and I wondered if you could provide some commentary on the SAP installation, if you’ve turned on any of the different features of that yet and how you would judge it going so far?
William C. Gale: Well, we have not turned on any features yet. Our plan is that during this fiscal year, certain parts of it are going to be turned on. So far we are happy with the project and what we are seeing and we are still in line with our cost estimates of what it was going to take to put this first couple of phases in.  So again, we haven’t converted anything but we will be converting something this fiscal year. 
Greg Halter - Great Lakes Review: Okay, and I know you are not giving the commentary on the CapEx but relative to depreciation and amortization, I think it was $200 million in fiscal ’09, would you expect that level to be higher or lower, especially with some of the IT CapEx that has a -- probably a quicker depreciation rate than other things?
Michael L. Thompson: I don’t think it would move materially because of the restructure pieces coming down. We don’t have an exact number for you at this point but we don’t expect a significant movement. 
Greg Halter - Great Lakes Review: Okay, and I know it’s a board decision but any commentary you could provide on the company’s dividend policy, if you would like to keep that moving upward, as has been history for I think 30-plus years?
William C. Gale: Well you know, I can’t say, Greg, for sure. I know the board, it does look at that very closely. It’s an annual decision. As you know, we only pay it on an annual basis but the board felt very confident this past spring to raise the dividend and I would think that they will take into consideration current year results, as well as the expectations going forward and it would be nice to hold on to that continued increase but I can’t guarantee anything at this point in this environment, so we’ll just have to see how things go. 
Greg Halter - Great Lakes Review: Okay, and one last one for you -- it may be too early in the year, but can you remind us what the breakdown is by industry, especially on the rental side?
William C. Gale: You mean as far as what our percentage is in the various industries?
Greg Halter - Great Lakes Review: Correct. 
William C. Gale: We really don’t have anything more than what we’ve provided before. That’s something that is not necessarily done at any one point in time. It’s looked at periodically so I really can’t give you any update to that right now. 
Greg Halter - Great Lakes Review: Okay. Thank you. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Justin [Hautt] from Robert W. Baird. 
Justin Hautt - Robert W. Baird: Actually, all of my questions have been answered except for one quick housekeeping one -- back to the scrap paper prices, I know you guys mentioned in the past you had some price floors on those contracts and I guess I was just wondering with the sequential up-tick we’ve seen on the prices, are we still below those floors or are we kind of moved past that?
Michael L. Thompson: We are still slightly below. 
Justin Hautt - Robert W. Baird: Okay. Thank you very much. 
Operator: And we’ll now go to Andrew Steinerman from J.P. Morgan. 
William Lee - J.P. Morgan: This is William Lee for Andrew Steinerman -- just one quick clarification; in terms of the internal growth for document management, including paper prices, was that a negative 1% or negative 4%?
Michael L. Thompson: With paper prices, the internal growth was negative 4%, the total growth of the division, including acquisitions, was positive 1%. 
William Lee - J.P. Morgan: Okay, great. Thanks. 
Operator: And there are no further questions. I would like to turn the conference back over to you, Mr. Gale, for any additional or closing remarks. 
William C. Gale: Well, thank you, everyone for joining us this evening. We are -- we appreciate your continued support. We will be planning on releasing our first quarter earnings some time in the mid to latter part of September. Good night. 
Operator: This concludes today’s presentation. Thank you for your participation.

===== 2009 Q3  (2009-03-18 17:00:00) =====
:
Executives:  William C. Gale – Chief Financial Officer, Senior Vice President Michael L. Thompson – Vice President, Treasurer 
Analysts: Andrea Wirth – Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. Ashwin Shirvaikar – Citigroup Scott Schneeberger – Oppenheimer & Co. Andre Steinerman – JP Morgan Securities Gary Bisbee – Barclays Capital Gregory Halter – Great Lakes Review  Good day and welcome everyone to the Cintas quarterly earnings results conference. Today’s call is being recorded. At this time for opening remarks and introduction I would like to turn the program over to Mr. Bill Gale, Senior Vice President of Finance and Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead sir.
William Gale: Good evening and welcome to the Cintas’ third quarter fiscal 2009 conference call. Thank you for joining us. For the quarter ending February 28, 2009, total revenue was $909 million, a 7% decrease from the third quarter revenue of fiscal 2008. Earnings per share were $0.47 versus $0.53 a year ago. The U.S. economy is experiencing a significant and widespread recession. Since the recession officially began in December of 2007, the U.S. economy has lost 4.4 million jobs. Over the last six months alone, we have seen a historical level of job losses with 3.7 million jobs lost, and 2.6 million of these jobs were lost in just the last four months. A significant number of U.S. companies are reducing headcount and closing facilities with approximately 800,000 business customers many of these companies are our customers. Our business is directly impacted by this large number of job losses and facility closures. From an employment standpoint, fewer jobs means fewer uniforms both rented and purchased, less usage of first aid and restroom supplies, and less opportunity for ancillary catalog sales such as shoes and jackets. Facility closures impact our volume of entrance mats, shop towels and linens, restroom cleaning and other facility needs such as fire protection services and even document destruction. Clearly, this is a difficult economic environment. We are aggressively managing our cost structure to maintain our improved margins. We are pleased that despite such a dramatic drop-off in revenue, we remain profitable, generate strong cash flow and maintain a very conservative balance sheet. During the quarter, the company reduced outstanding debt by approximately $85 million reducing its outstanding commercial paper balance to zero at quarter end. Our ratio of debt to capitalization improved to 25% down from over 30% a year ago. We continue to focus on generating cash by managing our cost structure, minimizing capital spending, and working capital needs and being very selective in making acquisitions. Because of our strong cash flow and confidence in our business, last week we paid an annual dividend of $0.47 per share continuing our practice of raising the dividend every year since going public in 1983. While we continue to be very disciplined in making acquisitions as evidenced by the fact that we have spent approximately $29 million in acquisitions versus a $102 million through the third quarter of fiscal 2008, we will make acquisitions that we believe bring long-term value to our company. In that regard, I'm excited to report that at the end of the third quarter Cintas expanded its presence in the document management business in Europe by purchasing Aktenmühle. Headquartered in Munich, Germany, Aktenmühle provides document shredding service to most of the major cities in Germany. We are pleased to bring the Aktenmühle management and employees to the Cintas family. Combined with our prior European acquisition in the summer of 2007, we now have the ability to offer Document Management Services outside of North America in both The Netherlands and Germany. While this economic downturn is negatively impacting our customers and thus our company, we believe that it is critical to continue to provide value-added services to our customers. All of our employees who we call partners are to be complemented further on wavering focus and taking care of the customer and making Cintas the strong company it is and we'll continue to be. We thank them for their outstanding efforts. All of us at Cintas will continue to adhere to our principle objective of exceeding our customer expectations to maximize the long-term value of Cintas for our shareholders and working partners. With me today is Mike Thompson, Cintas' Vice President and Treasurer. After some comments from Mike, we will open the call to questions.

Michael Thompson:  Thank you, Bill. Total revenues were $909 million for our third quarter, a 7% increase from the $976 million reported for the third quarter of fiscal 2008. Our year-to-date revenue declined 1% as compared to the first nine months of last year. As mentioned in our earning release and by Bill, the current economic environment continues to impact our revenue. This year's third quarter had the same number of workdays as the third quarter of last year. However, this year's first quarter had one less workday than the first quarter of fiscal 2008. Therefore, our nine-month year-to-date results reflect one less workday than the same nine-month reporting period last fiscal year. On a planning note, the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 will have the same number of workdays as last year’s fourth quarter. Accordingly, fiscal 2009 will have 260 total workdays, one less than the 261 workdays last fiscal year. The number of workdays does have an impact on both revenue and income. Total company internal growth was -7.4% for the quarter. Year-to-date internal growth was -1.4%. In addition to the current economic environment, revenue was negatively impacted by 1% due to a weaker Canadian dollar. Let’s discuss our revenue trends in more detail. First as a reminder, we classify our businesses into four reportable operating segments. Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products, Uniform Direct Sales, First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection Services and Document Management Services. Uniform Direct Sales, First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection Services and Document Management Services are combined and presented as other services on the face of the income statement. Detail for these operating segments is provided in the supplemental data included with the release. The Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products operating segment consists of the rental and servicing of the uniforms and other garments, mats, mops, shop towels and other related items. Restroom and hygiene products and other related services are included within the segment. Our significant geographic coverage gives us the ability to reach approximately 95% of the workforce in the United States and Canada from our existing infrastructure. Rental revenues were $675 million for the quarter compared to $704 million in the third quarter of last year, a 4% decrease. Internal growth for the segment was also -4%. The difficult business conditions significantly impacted our rental results. The U.S. seasonally adjusted unemployment rate increased from 4.8% a year ago to 8.1% at the end of February 2009. These job losses have a direct impact on our rental business. You may recall that from 2000 through last fiscal year, the U.S. economy lost approximately 4 million manufacturing jobs mainly due to offshore and consolidation. This job reduction and the economic ripple effect of these job losses also impacted our rental growth rates. However because of this job loss occurred more gradually overtime, we were able to react and growth through the significant reduction. Proactively addressing and marketing to the growing service economy and expanding our line of services. This has not been the case in the current recession. The swift reduction in jobs with 2.6 million jobs lost in the last four months alone has been too fast and widespread to offset on a short-term basis. We have four significant metrics that we track internally as key revenue indicators. New business, lost business, add over stops and price increases. Our add stop ratio continues to be the most difficult metric in this environment. For the third quarter, approximately two-thirds of our rental negative internal growth rate is attributable to the decrease experienced in our add stop ratio. Given the significant job loss it is not surprising that this ratio is running negative. The breakdown within the add stop ratio is a little surprising and that the stops are running about where they have historically. The issue is that the adds are down significantly, in effect turnover to our customers is remaining at historical levels. But once turnover occurs either through involuntary terminations or voluntary, the customer is not replacing these positions. Not only we affected by this net reduction in headcount, but our rental revenue is also impacted by the reduced amount of churn at customers, lowering revenue from loss replacement, makeup and other charges. As we mentioned last quarter, our new business results are also being pressured. Approximately one-third of our rental negative internal growth is due to a decrease in new business dollars. While the environment is difficult, we do continue to sell new business. In fact, our percentage of new business growth while below historical levels remains in double-digits and our close rate are the number of new accounts we are selling is being maintained. However, the average size of the new accounts has declined reflecting reduced customer headcount as well as new customers being cautious on the extent of these new programs. Our lost business ratio has increased over last year, but that decrease has largely been offset by price increases. In addition, the weakening of the Canadian dollar impacted rental revenues by approximately 1%. While our growth metrics continue to suffer we are encouraged by our customer retention results. Customers are reducing staff and locations, but overall they continue to retain our services understanding and appreciating the value of the products and services provided to them. Our customer satisfaction index, which tracks current customer satisfaction levels, continues to be very high. Our strong customer retention, which is driven by customer satisfaction, provides us a solid business foundation for when economic conditions improve. Our other services revenue which includes Uniform Direct Sales, First Aid Safety and Fire Protection and Document Management declined 14% for the quarter. Internal growth was -16%. This reduction is better understood by addressing each segment within other services separately. Our Uniform Direct Sales operating segment includes the direct sale of uniforms, branded promotional products and other related products to national and regional customers through our global accounts and strategic markets division and the direct sale of uniforms related products to local customers who typically also rent products from us including the items sold through our direct sale catalog. Within this segment, our global accounts and strategic markets division has a significant amount of business with the lodging, hospitality and gaming industries. As with most recessions, these industries have been hit especially hard during this downturn. While our Uniform Direct Sale business is directly impacted by headcount, it is also impacted by more discretionary spending. Revenues generated from new property openings or expansions as well as refresh programs, which occur when customers change the uniform design in the property or throughout the organization. During economic downturns, these more discretionary types of spending tend to slow or even stop. The impact of the downturn especially over the last six months has caused our Uniform Direct Sales segment revenues to decline significantly. Uniform Direct Sales growth both in total and internal was -23% for the quarter. As with customers of our rental division, we are doing a good job with customer retention but customer purchasing levels have declined significantly. Within First Aid Safety and Fire Protection Services, we sell and deliver First Aid products, Safety products and automatic defibrillators to our customers and provide safety training to their employees. We install, inspect, repair and recharge portable fire extinguishers and sprinkler systems. We also provide service to emergency lighting systems and kitchen fire suppression systems. Revenue within the First Aid Safety and Fire Protection Services operating segment was also significantly impacted by the economic environment, with total growth of -12% and internal growth of -14%. The First Aid portion of this business is relined on customer employment levels as much of the revenues based on product usage within the first aid cabinets. Training revenue has also been impacted as customers have less employees requiring training and in some cases are reducing or delaying training programs. Fire service internal growth continues to be negative primarily due to continued difficulty in the fire installation business reflecting continued weakness in commercial construction and expansion.  While we continue to reduce our installation business it continues to impact our fire protection services results. Customer facility closures in consolidation also impact our fire protection services. Our Document Management Services operating segment is comprised mainly of document shredding services. We also have storage and imaging capabilities.  Service revenues within this operating segment increased 3% for the quarter. Internal growth was -3.5%. Both growth rates were impacted by significant reduction and recycle paper prices. As we look many commodities, paper prices rose dramatically last fiscal year, reaching a high mark level in March of 2008. Since that time, prices have come down significantly approximately 50% returning to more historical levels. Excluding the impact of paper prices, our shredding operations third quarter internal growth was a positive 15%. While we've in some customers postponing and/or reducing purge frequency and volume for economic reasons. Our overall demand remains healthy and customer retention has been maintained.  Third quarter total company gross margin was 41.4%, a 70 basis point decline from the third quarter of fiscal 2008, and a 70 basis point decline from this year’s second quarter. I would discuss margin by segment, but a couple of total company margins comments first. Energy pricing came down late in our second quarter and remained at these levels through our third quarter providing us a benefit.  Energy cost for the quarter were 3.1% of total revenues. A 60 basis point improvement from the third quarter of last year and approximately 40 basis points better that this year's second quarter. The weaker Canadian dollar reduced total operating margins by approximately $1.5 million. We are actively managing our cost structure and eliminating all non-evaluated work. During our second quarter call, we mentioned through these efforts we had reduced our total company workforce by over 5%. Now through the end of February we've reduced our workforce by total of over 9%. We've suspended hiring throughout the organization significantly raising a prevalent analysis levels for any new or replacement higher that is required. We have also instituted a wage fees for all salary employees throughout the company. Our rental gross margins were 43.8% of revenue for the third quarter, a 40 basis point improvement over last years third quarter and a 20 basis point improvement over this year’s second quarter. We reduced our rental operating cost by $38 million as compared to our second quarter. Rental margins benefitted from an 80 basis point improvement in energy cost as compared to the third quarter of last year, and a 50 basis point improvement versus this years second quarter. The energy improvement was offset by similar amounts in both quarters, by increased material cost and depreciation.  Both material cost and depreciation are more fixed in nature in the short-term and reflects the impact of lower revenue. While higher costs were higher than last year due to the new U.S. imposed tariff discussed on our last call. We do get some release as compared to the second quarter. Other rental margin improvement is compared to both last year’s third quarter and this year’s second quarter, came through active cost management in various categories including supplies expense and temporary labor. The weaker Canadian dollar impacted rental-operating margins by over $1 million versus last year’s third quarter and approximately $1.5 million as compared to the second quarter.  We continue to challenging consolidate our local route structures, which historically we’ll maintain for an expanding economy. We also continue to analyze better production process as an equipment, which we believe we'll have a positive impact on our operational cost structure in the future.  Other services gross margin was 34.7% as compared to 38.9% last year, and 38.4% last quarter. Our margins continue to benefit from an improving sales mix with a greater percentage of revenue coming from the higher margin First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection Service and Document Management operating segments. However, the revenue shortfall in First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection the significant decline in uniform direct sale revenue and the dramatic drop in recycle paper prices always heavy on margins. In addition to our operating cost structure we are aggressively challenging our SG&A spend, we've reduced SG&A cost from $285 million during our second quarter down to $257 million in our third quarter, a reduction of $28 million. Due to lower revenue selling and administrative expenses were 28.3% of revenue as compared to 28% for last year’s third quarter and 28.9% in this year’s second quarter. Payroll taxes reset during our third quarter each year, when compared to the second quarter this seasonal payroll tax increase was offset in the quarter by reductions in SG&A labor. Medical cost which were higher our last quarter two quarters did come back inline with historical levels. Medical costs were 30 basis points higher than last years third quarter but flat on the dollar basis. These cost decrease 50 basis points from our second quarter again back to more historical levels. Net interest costs this quarter was $12 million the same as net interest for our second quarter of last year. Our effective tax rate was 33.2% for the quarter as compared to 35% for the third quarter of last year reflecting reserve releases. Under FIN48 the effective tax rate fluctuates with reserve requirements on a quarterly basis, impacting quarterly net income and earnings per share results. Our year-to-date effective rate is 36.8%. However, we continue to expect our effective tax rate for fiscal 2009 to be approximately 37.1%. For the quarter, net income was $71.8 million and earnings per diluted share were $0.47 per share.  When adjusted for the severance cost and earnings impact of the weaker Canadian dollar, diluted earnings per share would have been $0.02 higher or $0.49 per diluted share. Our balance sheet continues to be strong with the current ratio of 3.2:1 and over $150 million in cash and marketable securities, the most of which are invested in highly rated short-term Canadian government securities.  We continue to target our Canadian funds to be used for future international expansion as we did and we acquired the German Document Management Company. Our DSO on receivables stood at 41, at February 28 down from 46 at the end of the second quarter. The second quarter ended on the day after thanksgiving, which created some timing issues on collection efforts. The 41 DSO is a slight increase as compared to the 40 DSO at February 2008, although viewed positively in light of market conditions. Accounts receivable in total was lower than last February, due to reduced revenue levels. Our inventory levels increased $11 million of February 2008 due to the opening of our new facility services distribution center earlier this fiscal year. This distribution center was opened in order to take better advantage of our purchasing power for facility service products and to provide a better inventory management solution for us local operations. Uniforms and other end service inventory decreased $13 million versus last February, due to lower new business sales and reduction rental revenue. The reduction and acquisition activity has allowed the balance of both service contracts and other assets to amortize low as compared to last February.  Other assets consists mainly of non-competition agreements obtain through acquisitions. Accounts payable increased approximately $11 million as compared to last February as we extended many of our vendor payment terms. Our current year income taxes payable is $20 million lower than last year’s third quarter due to new federal requirements to finding quarterly estimated tax payments are computed and remitted which went into effect this fiscal year. Long-term debt at February 28, 2009 was $787 million a reduction of approximately $85 million since November 30. Total debt as a percentage of total book capitalization improved from 27.2% at November 30 down to 25.3% at February 28. As of the end of February, we have paid-off all of our outstanding commercial paper. We've reduced our total debt level by over $155 million since the beginning of this fiscal year. We continue to focus on cash generation and preservation. Our net cash provided by operations decreased by approximately the same amount as a decrease in net income. To offset this reduction we have aggressively challenged all capital expenditures and remained very selective on acquistion opportunities ensuring that valuations are appropriate. We have spent a combined $162 million on capital expenditures and acquisitions to the first nine months of this fiscal year as compared to $247 million to the third quarter of last year.  While a significant reduction this does not tell the full story, as we have spend approximately $40 million this fiscal year on certain IT infrastructure capital projects including the implementation of SAP ERP financial system. Without these expenditures our year-to-date CapEx and acquisitions spending would have been approximately $125 million or 50% of the amounts spend through February of last fiscal year. We continue to invest capital and growing our document management business purchasing vehicles and expanding infrastructure as required. Because of these items, we continue to expect capital expenditures for the year to be between $150 million and $170 million for total fiscal 2009. We continue to evaluate acquisition opportunities and our pipeline remains active, mainly with smaller businesses and our emerging business units. While interested in using our capital to make strategic acquisitions, and expand our market opportunities we will only do so at appropriate evaluations.  Finally, we've recently paid our annual dividend to shareholders. The dividend was increased to $0.47 per share this year continuing our tradition of increasing our dividend every year since going public in 1983. Our annual dividend provides shareholder value and demonstrates our confidence in the future success and cash flow of the company. In closing under these serious economic conditions, our top priority continues to be to take care of our customers. We will continue to actively and aggressively manage our cost structure, maintain a strong balance sheet and protect our cash flow. When conditions improve we'll be prepared to take advantage of the opportunities they lay ahead.  We appreciate your time and thank you for being on this call. So, I'd now be happy to answer any questions you may have.
Operator: Thank you. The question-and-answer session will be conducted electronically. (Operator Instructions). And we'll take our first question this afternoon from Andrea Wirth with Robert W. Baird.
Andrea Wirth – Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Good afternoon.
William Gale: Hi, Andrea.
Andrea Wirth – Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: One of you could first start by addressing the margins, the EBIT margins within the Rental division. I think your margins are up about a 130 basis points year-over-year something about 80 basis points of that was due to lower fuel costs. So you are still up above 50 basis points year-over-year despite the volumes being down 4%. Just wondered if you could put this in terms of your cost cutting because I’m wondering you feel at this point you maybe cutting a little bit too deeply. Just given that the fact that the margins are still up despite lower volumes or do you feel like you’ve actually cut in anticipation of what we are expecting to be even worse volumes next quarter and therefore maybe your headcount reductions are fairly well taken care of at this point?
William Gale: You are talking about our rental margins?
Andrea Wirth – Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Yeah, rental margins.
William Gale: I would say that we do not and I'll think whether we’ve cut too much. Some of the benefits certainly was energy as I mentioned. We are aggressively looking at our cost structure. We’ve certainly reduced headcount. We’ve looked at more controllable costs such as supplies and thinks of that nature. But given depreciation levels and given material cost that typically amortize over 18 months, you can’t adjust completely, I think the biggest component was we saw some benefit from the energy costs.
Andrea Wirth – Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: And then I guess just trying to understand a little bit more though even despite the energy, your margins are still up with volumes down 4%. I’m just trying to understand the disconnect between the two?
William Gale: Andrea, we are doing a lot of things. I guess your question is are we doing too much and your concern is are we going to hurt the company going forward. We don’t think so. We’re looking at efficiencies on consolidating some of the administrative functions. We’ve come up with some ways of doing that. I think heavy business needs to look at every activity that is performed to see and determined if it’s value-added. We are consolidating routes as volume declines we will consolidate customers and have fewer routes, but that doesn’t mean that we won’t be able to add those routes back when business improves. So, we feel what we are doing is prudent. I would not be concerned that we are cutting too deep and that we’re going to hurt ourselves and what we are probably doing is becoming a much more streamlined efficient company and as business conditions improve whenever they do we feel like we will be in great shape.
Michael Thompson: Also in our business is where growth is pretty expensive and when the growth pulls back a little bit, you don’t have the selling cost, you don’t have which is not in that line, but certainly the new material cost flows through that line. Certainly you are maintaining those routes as Bill indicated where you have some excess capacity that in the growing market you use up pretty quickly and we pull back on that route structure, given the realities of today. But we certainly built, we are nimble enough to the turn it the other way and we would love to be able to do if the market returns.
Andrea Wirth – Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.:  Fair enough. And then just as looking at your actual savings as far as it sounds like you said I think you said $15 million this quarter. What was the additional 4% in headcount reduction since last quarter? And given where fuel costs are today, what’s your expectation for savings in 4Q?
William Gale:  Well Andrea, we really don’t know. We are going to watch our revenue line or as everybody noticed we didn’t provide any guidance because we still feel the economic outlook is pretty uncertain. So what we are doing is just managing things on a week-to-week basis and watching our revenue, watching our new business, watching our existing stop ads ratios. And we hope that we will continue to see improvement in margins as we go forward, but it all depends on what happens with that top line and how quickly things happened with the top line?
Andrea Wirth – Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Sure, okay. And then when you go to look at the Document Management segment margins just a little bit further about 7.7%. Would you expect that to generally be the floor at this point just given were scrap paper prices are currently assuming that there is really no change in general, which you are seeing on the revenue growth side. Would you think that’s the floor or is there still some potential that margin comes down just given where scrap paper prices are?
Michael Thompson: I think that the paper price did not move much during quarter. We don’t seen any of that going further now paper prices could move again, but we had a full quarter at the lower level.
William Gale: The other thing it could impact that on the negative side, Andrea would be of energy costs despite the gain a lot. So, the 7.7% is relatively low but we did have a little energy help there. So all of certain out gasoline where they should backup in this weak environment to $5 a gallon again then that could pressure those margins, but absent energy and I would say an absent is significant decline in the top line, I think we are looking at pretty low historically low margins for the infrastructure that we have in place today.
Andrea Wirth – Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Thank you, that’s very helpful.
Operator: And our next question will come from Ashwin Shirvaikar with Citi.
Ashwin Shirvaikar – Citigroup: Hi, Bill. Hi, Mike.
William Gale: Hi Ashwin.
Michael Thompson: Hi.
Ashwin Shirvaikar – Citigroup: My question is if we continue losing say 6, 700,000 jobs in the economy per month for the next three, four months. Can you keep in lowering your cost structure to maintain margins and what are some of the incremental things you can do. You already shutdown a couple of operating plants. You’ve taken out jobs in tool processes. So is there a level at which you kind of have to just say this is too much?
William Gale: Well first let me just clarify Ashwin. The plants we closed down were manufacturing plants where we produce carbon. So we have not shutdown any of our uniform rental facilities to-date. If job losses continue at a very rapid pace, we will be looking at potentially consolidating some of our operating locations, taking some branches that we had setup and maybe converting them to a depot-type situation where we eliminate the administrative functions in the stock room and bring that back to a mother plant. We could also look at where we have multiple plans in the city and temporarily idling one of those to get some efficiency. We also will continue to look at route consolidation we really haven’t been, it takes a long time to consolidate our uniform rental routes because you got to re-tape every garment, and you got to re-route all of the customers and so there is a lot of effort there but that’s ongoing and we are going to get some benefits going forward on that. There are more things that we can do. We are going to make sure though that what we do doesn’t do anything to jeopardize the services we are providing to our customers and doesn’t do anything that gives us a short-term gain at a long-term expense. So I think our management team feels confident that borrowing again, I’ll go back to same thing I used with Andrea, a significant jobs and some sort of costs like energy, these margins are attainable even in the declining revenue environment, which may or may not happen. I just I can’t predict it.
Ashwin Shirvaikar – Citigroup: Okay fair enough. And as you look at the first aid safety fire protection, look at the decline in the reserved debt, Mike that you provided some details with segment, but can you breakout how much is say on the first aid side versus the others because first aid was doing fine. You had some issues in the fire protection and so on. So I kind of want to separate out if you will just look out from what used to be a problem before as well?
Michael Thompson: Well I can tell you that the revenue drop in both of those, it is only one segment and that’s the only way we are going to report it is we are going to report it together. But I can tell you that the revenue drop was slightly more significant in the fire side quarter-over-quarter than it was in the first aid side. Now part of that is this installation business, which we are basically not going to focus on as much as we thought we would before, but the first aid business certainly has had the impact of the lower employment levels and again that will continue to be negatively impacted if employment levels continue to decline. But from a profitability perspective, I think again the fire business had a slightly more dramatic impact on the segment than the first aid and safety business.
Ashwin Shirvaikar – Citigroup: Okay, and my last question is with regards to Employee Free Choice Act. If it passes, what’s the likely financial impact on Cintas. We might checks seem to indicate that you guys pay a fair rate, so on those grounds you probably shouldn’t be much of an impact? Is it more you are opposed to it more from a philosophical standpoint or is it the cost?
William Gale:  Our position has always been that we believe that with our employees right to the side whether or not they wanted to be represented by union or not through the secret-ballot election. And if this Employee Free Choice Act passes as it has been introduced into both houses of Congress, the concern we've is that it takes the right away from our employees to both in a secret-ballot election and could enable coercion on the part of Union Bosses to employees to basically create this union environment. And then additionally the other concern we've would be that if that were to happen and the employee and the company and the unions could not negotiate a contract that a federal mediator could come in and impose, what they proceed to be the appropriate work rules, benefit levels and wages for our company and our employees without any knowledge of our industry or competition et cetera. So the way the act is currently proposed is very concerning to us because of those issues.
Ashwin Shirvaikar – Citigroup: Got it. Okay, thank you.
Operator:  We will take our next question from Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer.
Scott Schneeberger – Oppenheimer & Co.: Thanks good afternoon. Could you guys speak a bit to the pricing environment out there and just what you are seeing on the competitive front?
Michael Thompson: Yes Scott, this is Mike. I think it's relatively speaking it’s still the same. It has always been very aggressive in the marketplace as we mentioned in the past. Certainly here anecdotal stories in the marketplaces of people becoming more aggressive in different spots, but it's difficult to see that on a full basis. I think certainly as we continue through this, again this downward trend and economic triggers is really been over the last four or five months, six months or really telling off and I think as companies are hurt by that and become potentially more desperate especially smaller players that’s don’t have a capital lose standard. You could see some of that just to get funds flowing through. We haven’t seen a lot yes certainly because pricing has always been pretty aggressive in our marketplace, but we're certainly watching for it.
Scott Schneeberger – Oppenheimer & Co.: Sure, and two things. Did I hear you mention anything about pricing increases anywhere and also you did say that retentions have been fairly strong correct?
Michael Thompson: Retentions have been good and actually our customer satisfaction surveys that we put out indicate that our customer satisfaction is as high as it has been ever been. So that’s doing very well. Our retention levels are good really across all businesses. From a price increase standpoint, we're still getting price increases. It’s always a little easier sometimes when fuels increases, but when fuel cost increase we like it better this way that hurts us more when those things increase. So we still get on, but is it more difficult environment? Probably a little bit but we haven’t seen a material move there.
Scott Schneeberger – Oppenheimer & Co.: Thanks, you said last quarter, you're looking for about negative one from Forex in both three 3Q and 4Q. Still the same outlook based on what you've seen the dart aiming in that move?
Michael Thompson: We didn't indicate that last quarter.
William Gale: We had that impact this quarter 1% but I don't think we predicted what the exchange rates were going to be.
Scott Schneeberger – Oppenheimer & Co.: Yeah. You said I'm reading from the transcript, we expect our revenue growth rates in the third and fourth quarters to be negatively impacted by approximately 1%?
William Gale: No it would continue at that level.
Michael Thompson: We’ll see what happens.
William Gale: There is no movement really in the third quarter.
Scott Schneeberger – Oppenheimer & Co.: Okay, I'm clear. Now as you mentioned Mike there obviously, some of your competitors are seeing some weakness, the German acquisition obviously, but domestically how closer are we getting the consolidation? Are you seeing attractive multiples the way I read the press release? It seems like you are warming up there and obviously the balance sheets in pretty good shape given the state of the world?
Michael Thompson: Two things I would say the German acquisition was not a case where the company was in trouble at all that one was in and works for a while and we were very happy to get them. It’s a very good acquisition opportunity for us, the right valuation for us but it was good acquisition. So I don’t think they were impaired at all. The acquisition pipeline here is good. We haven't seen a significant outpouring of that adds to this point but again it has been fairly short in duration. We typically do see some uptick as you get further into it. But again as I mentioned earlier this has been a pretty quick turn in the employment levels. So, we are going to keep a close watch on it and will stay close and we will keep an active department that will reduce all of that space and contact where we can with opportunities, so we will see what happens.
Scott Schneeberger – Oppenheimer & Co.: Thanks and share repurchase stocks or we have just other uses of cash coming up prioritization?
William Gale: I think as we stated in last quarter, right now our objective is to continue to generate cash, keep the balance sheet very strong, position ourselves for whatever the economy deals us and then be ready to really take advantage of opportunities that will present themselves.
Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co.: Okay, thanks.
Operator: And we take our next question from Andre Steinerman with JP. Morgan Securities.
Andre Steinerman – JP Morgan Securities: Energy prices stay where they are today. How much would the fourth quarter benefit in terms of margin basis point sequentially in the year?
William Gale: The last year’s fourth quarter Andrew our energy cost as a percent of sales were 4%. This current quarter they were 3% roughly. So, basically there is a 100 basis points difference there.
Andre Steinerman – JP Morgan Securities: Right. So as you gave the quarter, how about like last conference call you gave us the month of November. Has energy cost changed much through the quarter like what was February as a month to give in I will guess the number to last time.
Michael Thompson: It has been pretty steady through the quarter.
William Gale: There has been a little fluctuation but not significant. It has been fairly constant.
Michael Thompson: Last quarter, we had the phenomena, where it kind of happened in mid term, so we want to let people that larger amount was coming in the next quarter. At this point if things stayed the same, it will be probably pretty consistent with Q4.
Andre Steinerman – JP Morgan Securities: Okay and then also when thinking about route consolidation and I know you say it takes time. Could you just give us a little more color like beneath the surface about whether route consolidation happens? Is that challenging? Or is in for some customers they are changing, their driver who they have gotten used to?
William Gale: There are several factors that certainly is one. Changing who the customer deals with you want to be very careful with that. The logistics of re-taping all of those garments. Remember we have 11 sets of uniforms for every employee at our customer’s location and if you change the route and the route there, you got to change the label, the barcode on there. So that takes some time to go through. We've done these before. We've always had some re-routing in our company primarily used to be because we were growing so much. No now, it’s a little bit different and that we are trying to just make sure that our routes remain efficient and have enough volume on them to continue good margins. So this is not a new phenomenon for us to do it. It’s just something that is the reasons why we're doing it or different than what they used to be.
Andre Steinerman – JP Morgan Securities: Okay. And is the route consolidation also happening in the other service lines, shredding and fire and first aid?
William Gale: Well absolutely. Every route-based business is looking at opportunities to maintain a certain level of revenue per route and in the declining environment as this is the case with everything other than shredding, we are certainly doing that. But even in shredding, we are looking at ways to make those routes more efficient, and if it means re-routing that’s a pretty easy thing to do and we're doing it.
Andre Steinerman – JP Morgan Securities: Right, any thoughts on making more hybrid routes, I know you like to keep separate trucks for separate business?
William Gale: That will be very difficult to do that. We certainly do in the rental division with entrance mats and mops this is a nature on some uniform.
Andre Steinerman – JP Morgan Securities: Right.
William Gale: But the goal across business lines we do onsite trading. We can trade documents and have uniforms whether you can't put first aid supplies, which has more inventory on the truck. So it’s really you really cant do that.
Andre Steinerman – JP Morgan Securities: Okay perfect. Thank you so much.
William Gale:  Welcome.
Michael Thompson:  Thanks.
Operator:  Gary Bisbee with Barclays Capital, your line is open.
Gary Bisbee – Barclays Capital:  Hey guys good afternoon.
William Gale: Hi Gary.
Gary Bisbee – Barclays Capital: I guess, let me ask a little bit about uniform sales business. Any sense how much further the sales could fall and I guess what I am wondering is there sort of an underlying part of this business within that is, that you feel pretty confident repeat business that isn’t getting postponed or is a lot more of that potentially at risk if things remains challenging over the next six months?
William Gale:  Well Gary, it really comes down to you look at the different segments of that business serves and what happens with those customers. So let’s break down a little bit. The Las Vegas gambling industry is not going to go away. They are going to, if they continue to have the problems they have an attracting people to come out to Las Vegas, they are going to continue to downsize their organizations. Now the people that are left will still have to replace uniforms because those large companies are very protective of their image and Caesar’s Palace or the Bellagio are not going to led their employees run around in uniforms that don’t look good. So there will be that underlying repurchase of uniforms for the employees that remain onsite. The problem is that many of those big properties though are going to postpone or delay any renewal, any big renewed, renewal of their uniform programs. So, we are not going to get that. Hotels, same thing, as their number of guests decline, they are going to reduce their headcount, but they will continue to replace uniforms because they don’t want their employees again to destroy the image of the hotel. We are not seeing a whole lot of new opening of hotels and that always has been a nice little steady stream of income as they open new hotels but that seems to have really been reduced, so that will be an issue. Now the other side, we also have uniforms that we sell to large companies and it really comes down to what type of business they are in. If they are in business where they are hurting and reducing headcount, they are going to give us, we got the same experience with them as we do with the Las Vegas casino or the big hotel. If on the other hand, they are in some industries that are doing fairly well and maybe can take advantage of lot of this stimulus money and that sort of thing, they will continue to be good buyers of uniforms. So, all-in-all though in this environment, the decline that we've seen to these levels have been basically unprecedented and unless we see a pickup in the not too distant future, kind of a steady state of where we at right now in the direct sale businesses is not beyond the realm of possibility or it could even decline a little bit further.
Gary Bisbee – Barclays Capital:  Okay. But it's safe to assume in this quarter there were a large number of this big upgrading of programs. So, this would be a lot of ongoing business?
William Gale: That will be a pretty safe assumption. Yeah.
Gary Bisbee – Barclays Capital: Yeah. Okay and then are there any costs to pullout here if it does continue to bleed a bit lower or could this business actually lose reasonable amount of money if that remains this challenge?
William Gale: I'm not sure we are going to lose a lot of money. I think there are other costs to pullout. You just got to be careful before you start pulling those triggers just to make sure how long the downturn is going to be, because we've got a lot of investment into people and train people and relationships but as we detect that we can’t continue to be profitable in that segment we have to adjust the cost structure accordingly. We have our very large distribution network that services those customers. Obviously, if we need to we could consolidate distribution centers that would be a fairly dramatic move because again that would be disruptive and costly, but in a protracted downturn we could take steps like that.
Gary Bisbee – Barclays Capital: Okay. And then just I guess, can you give us any sense how much of the incremental cost savings you achieved in the quarter. So that’s going from 5% headcount to 9%. Was that late in the quarter so, we might have a bit more reduction in cost as we move into the next one?
William Gale: You’ll have some reduction in cost as we go forward because some of that activity actually took place throughout the quarter. There were some severance that was paid. So, some of those benefits will, there will be a greater benefit of that into the fourth quarter.
Gary Bisbee – Barclays Capital: Okay. And just take one last point in, the $4 million of severance and other what sounds to me like sort of one-time charges and costs touched up, can you give us a sense what line items that was most evident in rental or was it more evenly spread?
William Gale: It would have been probably more in the other services side.
Gary Bisbee – Barclays Capital: Okay. All right. Thanks a lot.
William Gale: Sure.
Operator: Greg Halter with Great Lakes Review.
Gregory Halter – Great Lakes Review: Yes good afternoon.
William Gale: Hi Greg.
Gregory Halter – Great Lakes Review: On the SAP system, just wondered if you could provide us a status update there. I know it’s a multiyear effort but I’m wondering how that’s going so far?
William Gale: It’s going fine so far. It is a multiyear effort. Our first conversion of any part of it doesn’t going to take place for several more months. It is obviously a complex project but we knew that going in. We are still confident that it is a project that will pay the benefits longer-term that we need to have and that we are focussing on our financial systems and our global supply chain initially.
Gregory Halter – Great Lakes Review: Okay, and would there be additional CapEx in fiscal 2010 related to that?
William Gale: The majority of CapEx will have been spent in fiscal '09. There will be a moderate amount but it's much less than what we've incurred in '09.
Gregory Halter – Great Lakes Review: Okay, and in your Document Management Business I think you had mentioned you had a floor on the recycled paper or used paper, whatever I’m going to call it, pricing is that still the case?
William Gale: Yes it is.
Gregory Halter – Great Lakes Review: And we've actually noticed an increase in some of these like assorted office paper and so forth over the last several months, a slight increase, which at least there is something moving in the right direction there?
William Gale: Right. We haven’t and we were fortunately before was above what the spot price was. So as the spot price picks up, it’s just getting closure to where we are at anyway but certainly that will be a good sign if that continues to go up.
Gregory Halter – Great Lakes Review: And what have to go above that floor for you do see a benefit on the pricing side?
William Gale: Right. If it goes up it’s just an encouraging sign that there is a demand out there and that maybe that’s a indication that things are going to get better so.
Gregory Halter – Great Lakes Review: And then the hurricane, have any impact on the top line in this quarter? I think as you had indicated in the last quarter?
William Gale: No, not on this quarter. It did not.
Gregory Halter – Great Lakes Review: Okay, and related to the German acquisition. Is that management team, I guess led by Mark Metzlaff. remaining in place there?
William Gale: Absolutely, yes. They are Cintas employees now and I’ve met Mark and he is a great guy and I think we are going to have a great relationship going forward with them.
Gregory Halter – Great Lakes Review: And when in the quarter did you buy the company?
William Gale: The last day.
Gregory Halter – Great Lakes Review: Okay.
William Gale: We have no revenue for it.
Gregory Halter – Great Lakes Review: All right. And do they have any sort of CapEx needs that would be an increase over what you see here for your business in the U.S.?
William Gale: It wouldn’t even show right now. There are pretty well capitalized, but as we continue to work with them to grow the business they will need to acquire additional trucks, but this is a small business Greg, it’s probably in the neighborhood of U.S.$4 million to U.S.$5 million right now. Maybe it’s around $4 million. So, we are talking relatively small, but we feel very excited about the some of opportunities, so it will be some new trucks that will need to be purchased.
Gregory Halter – Great Lakes Review: Okay and that $4 million is per year, correct?
William Gale: Right.
Gregory Halter – Great Lakes Review: Okay, that’s all I have. Thank you very much.
Operator: And at this time, we have no other question standing by. I would like to turn the program back to our speakers for any additional or closing comments.
William Gale: Well I thank you all again very much for joining us and we appreciate the continued interest in our company. We are going to plan on reporting our fourth quarter results in mid-July. We look forward to talking to you then if not sooner. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you everyone for your participation on today’s conference call and you may disconnect at this time.

===== 2009 Q2  (2008-12-19 08:30:00) =====
Executives: Bill Gale - Senior Vice President of Finance and Chief Financial Officer Mike Thompson - Vice President and Treasurer
Analysts: Andrea Wirth – Robert Baird Ashwin Shirvaikar – Citigroup/Smith Barney Vance Edelson – Morgan Stanley Gary Bisbee – Barclays Capital Scott Schneeberger – Oppenheimer Greg Halter – Great Lakes
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Welcome to the Cintas Quarterly Earnings Results Conference Call. At this time I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Bill Gale, Senior Vice President of Finance and Chief Financial Officer.
Bill Gale: Thank you for joining us today to discuss our second quarter fiscal 2009 results. Joining me is Mike Thompson our Vice President and Treasurer. After some brief comments we will open the call to questions. For the quarter ending November 30, 2008, total revenue was $985.2 million a slight increase over the second quarter last year. The current economic slowdown impacted all of our business segments. We saw especially weak results in the sale of uniforms to the hospitality industry and also saw weakness in uniform rental as our customers reduced headcount or shut down facilities. Additionally, our rental revenues were negatively impacted by the rapid decrease in the value of the Canadian Dollar and the impact of the September gulf coast hurricanes. Net income was $71.8 million down from last year’s $82.9 million. Higher cost of energy, hangers, and employee medical expenses coupled with the rapid deterioration in revenues all contributed to the disappointing net income. Additionally, this years results were negatively impacted by a higher effective tax rate of 39.4% versus last years 38.3%. With the adoption of the new rules on tax accounting companies must be more precise on a quarterly basis in the recording of the tax provision versus the old rules which calculated taxes on an effective rate for the entire year. This quarter’s higher tax rate should be the highest of the year. By the end of the year we expect our rate for the entire year to be 37.1%. Shortly, Mike will provide you further details regarding growth by segment as well as a discussion of margins. During the quarter the company paid down approximately $80 million in Commercial Paper through aggressive management of capital spending and acquisitions. We will continue to focus on cash generation in order to take advantage of growth opportunities over the next few years as financial conditions improve. Due to the uncertainties that exist in the economy we must remove the previous guidance we provided for the fiscal year ending May 31, 2009. We are unable to determine the severity or the length of the recession and believe that any guidance we would provide would be subject to too much risk and therefore not meaningful. We recognize our obligation to our shareholders to manage our costs aggressively and are taking steps necessary to adjust to the new revenue levels. In addition, we will continue to focus on providing our customers with exceptional service. The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides us safe harbor from civil litigation for forward looking statements. This conference call contains forward-looking statements that reflect the company’s current views as to future events and financial performance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ materially from those we may discuss. I refer you to the discussion on these points contained in our most recent filings with the SEC. I would now like to turn the call over to Mike Thompson for additional commentary.
Mike Thompson: Total revenues were $985.2 million for our second quarter, a $1.3 million increase over the $983.9 million reported for the second quarter of fiscal 2008. As mentioned in our earnings release and by Bill, the current economic environment continues to impact our revenue. In addition, the weakening of the Canadian Dollar and the impact of September hurricanes reduced our revenue growth rate by approximately 1% for the quarter. This year’s second quarter had the same number of workdays as the second quarter of last year. However, this years first quarter had one less workday than the first quarter of fiscal 2008. Therefore, six month year to date results reflect one less work day in the same six month reporting period last fiscal year. Year to date revenue growth for the six months ended November 30, 2008, was 2.5% on a comparable workday basis. Total company internal growth was -0.7% for the quarter. Year to date internal growth was 1.6%. The remaining two quarters of fiscal 2009 will each have the same number of workdays, 65, as each of the last two quarters of fiscal 2008. Accordingly, fiscal 2009 will have 260 total workdays, one less than the 261 workdays last fiscal year. The number of workdays does have an impact on both revenue and income. As a reminder, we classify our businesses into four reportable operating segments; rental uniforms and ancillary products, uniform direct sales, first aid safety and fire protection services, and document management services. Uniform direct sales, first aid safety and fire protection service and document management services are combined and presented as other services on the face of the income statement. Detail for these operating segments is provided in the supplemental segment data included in the release. The rental uniforms and ancillary products operating segment consists of the rental and servicing of uniforms and other garments, mats, mops, shop towels and other related items. Our restroom and hygiene products and other related services are included within the segment. We are the largest uniform rental company in North America and have significant geographic coverage giving us the ability to reach approximately 95% of the workforce in the US and Canada with our existing infrastructure. Rental revenues were $711.5 million for the quarter compared to $708.8 million in the second quarter last year, a 0.4% increase. Internal growth for the segment was 0.4% as well. As with the company in total the significant weakening of the Canadian Dollar and the gulf coast hurricanes during the quarter also had a negative impact on our rentals revenue growth rate by approximately 1%. If the current US and Canada exchange rate remains at its current level for the rest of fiscal 2009 we expect our revenue growth rates in the third and fourth quarters to be negatively impacted by approximately 1%. As mentioned, business conditions deteriorated further during our second quarter. US economy has lost approximately two million jobs so far this year and the national unemployment rate rose to 6.7% in November, the highest level since 1993. While these conditions have affected revenue from all of our rental products and services, our uniform business has been impacted the most, experiencing slightly negative internal growth during the quarter. As with last quarter the most significant impact on the rental revenue has been through our add stop metric as many existing customers are being forced to reduce headcount and close or consolidate existing facilities. During our first quarter earnings call we indicated our new business results began to be impacted by the economic environment. Our second quarter new business results weakened further as prospects became more reluctant to add new services given current economic uncertainties. While our lost business increased slightly during the quarter this was mainly due to customers going out of business or not paying their bills timely. We have continued to do a solid job overall in maintaining our existing customer base. Price increases, while also affected during the quarter have held up relatively well.  While our growth metrics suffered we are encouraged with our customer retention results. Many of our existing customers are reducing staff and locations but overall they continue to retain our services understanding and appreciating the value our products and services provide them. This high customer retention provides us a solid foundation for when conditions improve. Our other services revenue which includes our uniform direct sales, first aid safety and fire protection and document management segments declined 0.5% for the quarter. Internal growth was -3.5%. Other services incorporate our uniform direct sales, first aid safety and fire protection services and document management services operating segments. Other services revenues were significantly impacted by lower revenue from uniform direct sales. Our uniform direct sales operating segment includes the direct sale of uniforms, branded promotional products and other related products to national and large regional customers through our global accounts and strategic markets division and the direct sale of uniforms and related products to local customers specifically also rent products from us including items sold through our direct sale catalog. We are the largest provider of uniforms and related ancillary products in North America. The uniform direct sales operating segment has been significantly impacted by the current economic environment experiencing a 10.7% reduction in revenues. There have been no recent acquisitions within this division so this reduction is all internal. Within this operating segment our global accounts and strategic markets division suffered substantially, declining approximately 15%. This division services main hospitality and gaming customers.  Many of these customers are delaying purchases, expansion programs and refresh programs in light of current conditions. As with customers in our rental division we continue to retain these customers but their purchasing levels have declined. The direct sales of uniforms and related products to our existing local customers while slightly negative as compared to the second quarter of last year fared better than global accounts. Within first aid safety and fire protection services we seldom deliver first aid products, safety products, and automatic defibrillators to our customers and provide safety training to their employees. We install, inspect, repair, and recharge portable fire extinguishers and sprinkler systems. We also provide and service emergency lighting systems and kitchen fire suppression systems. We are the largest on sight provider of first aid and safety products in North America and the second largest provider of fire protection services. During the quarter revenues within our first aid safety and fire protection services operating segment grew 1.3% in total a decrease of 0.5% on an organic basis. The first aid portion of this business continues to grow organically but at reduced levels. This business is relying on customer employment levels as much of the revenue is based on product usage within the first aid cabinets. Training revenue has also been impacted as customers have less employees requiring training and in some cases are reducing or delaying certain training programs. Fire service internal growth continues to be negatively impacted due to continued difficulty in the fire installation business reflecting the continued weakness in commercial construction. While we have reduced our installation business over the last six months it continues to have an impact on fire results. Our document management services operating segment is comprised mainly of document shredding services, although we do have storage and imaging capabilities. Service revenues within this operating segment continue to provide strong growth as revenue increased 28.5% for the quarter. While still strong the segments growth rate has been slowed by a combination of lower recycled paper prices and postponement and/or reductions in customer purge frequency and volume. Second quarter paper prices remained slightly higher than paper prices during the second quarter of fiscal 2008 but have come down to approximately 50% of the high mark level reached in March 2008. As customers look to save funds, many are requesting a reduction in their shredding service frequency. However, as with our other divisions we are continuing to retain our customers in this segment. Document management internal growth for the second quarter was 13% excluding the effective paper prices our shredding revenue internal growth was in the high teens. Second quarter total company gross margin was 42.1% a 60 basis point decline from the second quarter of fiscal 2008 and a 30 basis point decline from this years first quarter. Energy costs, which have come down steadily and significantly through this fiscal year second quarter were 3.55% of revenue which was 35 basis points higher than energy costs in last years second quarter. However, as compared to this year’s first quarter energy costs did decrease approximately 80 basis points. Energy costs came down consistently through the quarter, declining approximately 25 basis points each month during the second quarter. November’s energy costs were down to 3.25% of revenue while volume usage does fluctuate through the year if energy price remains at current levels we expect to experience better quarter-to-quarter comparisons moving forward. Excluding the energy impact company margins were negatively impacted by revenue reductions in uniform direct sales and fire protection services and the reduction in paper prices within document management. In addition, the company suffered approximately $1 million in losses related to September hurricanes and approximately $1 million due to the weakening of the Canadian Dollar. As mentioned in our earnings release, we are actively managing our cost structure, eliminating all non-valuated work in challenging our cost structure. As an example, over the last few months in anticipation of deteriorating economic conditions we have reduced our total company workforce by over 5%. This reduction has occurred over time as we are stringently analyzing all new and replacement hiring.  The full benefit of this reduction is yet to be seen through our financial statements. In addition, the 5% headcount reduction does not reflect the recent closing of two manufacturing plants which we announced in early December.  We are also challenging route structures and have consolidated what we call growth routes that are routes in most operations that previously maintained capacity for growth. While we look to continue to grow, we have and will continue to consolidate routes in order to properly reflect current market opportunities. We also are analyzing better production processes and equipment which we believe will have a positive impact on our operational cost structure in the future. Our rental gross margins were 43.6% of revenue for the quarter, a 110 basis point decline from last years second quarter but a 10 basis point improvement from this years first quarter of fiscal 2009. Energy costs increased over $2 million or approximately 30 basis points over last years second quarter. In addition, other commodity costs increased approximately 60 basis points with an increase in hanger expense alone of approximately $3 million or 40 basis points as compared to last year. As we mentioned last quarter, hanger costs increased significantly earlier in calendar 2008 as the US imposed a significant tariff on hangers produced in China where we source the majority of our hangers and also due to the volatility in steel prices. Other commodity costs, which increased include water usage and wash and water treatment solutions.  Losses related to the hurricanes and the weakening Canadian Dollar impacted margins by a combined approximately $2 million or 30 basis points. Certain other cost increases including an increase in material costs due to increased prices in restroom paper products we sell and service to our customers were offset by operation efficiencies. Rental margins improved from our first quarter as the segment benefited from the improvement in energy costs. The energy cost benefit was partially offset by the hurricane impact, the weaker Canadian Dollar and lower revenues compared to the first quarter. Other services gross margin was 38.4% a 60 basis point improvement from the second quarter of fiscal 2008 but a 110 basis point decrease from the first quarter. The improvement from last years second quarter was mainly due to sales mix as the more profitable first aid safety and fire protection services and document management operating segments continue to grow faster than uniform direct sales and therefore pulled margins up. Margins improved over last year despite energy costs being higher this year than last and the current revenue headwinds especially those in uniform direct sales. Higher energy costs were the main factor in driving document management margins lower as compared to last year while improvement sin streamlining our fire operations, especially our fire installation business provided healthy margin improvement in first aid safety and fire despite the energy cost increase. The margin decrease as compared to the first quarter is from the revenue shortfall in uniform direct sale and first aid safety and fire and the significant decrease in paper prices and reduced processing tonnage within document management. Selling and administrative expenses were 28.9% of revenue as compared to 28% for last years second quarter and 28.7% in this years first quarter. The increase from last year was a substantial increase in medical costs due to an increase in a number of claims. Medical costs have been high for two quarters; however, based on more recent trends and the recent headcount reductions we believe medical cost should come back to more historical levels. Bad debt expense also increased over the prior year as customers continue to struggle with the effects of the economy. The small increase from the first quarter was due to lower than anticipated revenue for the quarter. Net interest cost this quarter was $12 million, the same as net interest for our first quarter of this year. Our effective tax rate was 39.4% for the quarter as compared to 38.3% for the second quarter of last year reflecting reserve requirements under FIN48. Under FIN48 the effective tax rate will fluctuate with reserve requirements on a quarterly basis impacting quarterly net income and earnings per share results. However, we continue to expect our effective tax rate for fiscal 2009 to be approximately 37.1%. To reach this level, our effective tax rate for the remainder of the year will be below 36%.  We expect that due to the timing of reserve requirements and releases under FIN48 our year to date effective tax rate at the end of the third quarter will actually be below 37.1% and will then increase slightly in the fourth quarter to reach the 37.1% effective rate for the year. For the quarter, net income was $71.8 million and earnings per diluted share were $0.47 and our effective tax rate during the second quarter has been 37.1% as we expect it to be for the full fiscal year. Net income would have been approximately $74.5 million and diluted earnings per share would have been $0.49. Our balance sheet continues to be strong. Our current ratio improved to 3.8:1 at November 30. We have approximately $127 million in cash and marketable securities. The majority of our marketable securities are invested in highly rated short term Canadian Government Securities. Our cash position at the end of November was reduced as compared to August 31, as we took advantage of US tax law changes and accessed approximately $50 million in US Dollars of our Canadian funds.  These funds were used to reduce our outstanding Commercial Paper borrowings. We continue to target Canadian funds to be used for future international expansion. Our DSOs on receivables increased from 44 at the end of the first quarter to 46. This increase was due to a combination of slower paying customers and also the impact of the last day of November falling on the Friday after Thanksgiving which had an impact on collections at the end of the month. Our inventory levels have increased approximately $13 million over November 30, 2007 due to the opening of a new facility service distribution center which we discussed last quarter. Excluding the inventory build to bring this facility online new goods inventory for the company decreased approximately $3 million. Our accrued liabilities increased approximately $15 million over November 30, 2007, mainly due to the elimination of our VEBA account which historically was used to pre-fund employee medical costs. The change in tax code eliminated the benefit of maintaining a VEBA. The VEBA trust was therefore terminated and claims are now paid directly out of cash. In addition to the VEBA, accrued liabilities were higher do to an increase in accrued bond interest relating to our tenure bond offering which was issued in December 2007. A reduction in real estate accruals offset much of this increase. Our current income taxes payable was actually a pre-paid as of November 30. We presented this pre-paid as a so-called negative liability on the balance sheet in order to highlight the change. Last year we had a $72 million payable and this year we have an $8 million pre-paid. New requirements to finding how quarterly estimated federal tax payments are computed and made have gone into effect.  Additionally, as I mentioned previously, the company used a VEBA trust in the past to pre-fund employee medical costs. The tax advantage of these trusts was eliminated resulting in higher estimated tax payments earlier in the current fiscal year. Long-term debt, November 30, 2008, was $871 million, a reduction of approximately $80 million from August 31. The reduction occurred despite the increased estimated tax payment requirements but benefited from the Canadian cash issues discussed earlier. Total debt as a percentage of total book capitalization improved from 29.3% at August 31, down to 27.2%.  The majority of our debt is in long-term fixed public debt. At November 30 we had $83 million in outstanding CP which is included in our long-term debt. Using our credit facility we have been able to receive regular funding under our program at attractive rates. Our cash flow remains strong despite the required change in estimated tax payments previously mentioned our year to date cash provided by operations was $175 million. Our capital expenditures were $41 million in the second quarter and $96 million year to date. We are implementing SAP for our financials in our supply chain and we upgraded computer equipment in the field which has kept our CapEx in total about flat through six months of this year as compared to last year. While we continue to move ahead with the SAP implementation we are challenging all capital expenditures, raising our return expectations and scrutinizing assumptions on all investments. Because of this we have reduced our expected CapEx needs for the year and now believe it will be between $150 and $170 million. We spent approximately $6 million during the quarter acquiring a few small businesses mainly in document management. We continue to be very selective in our approach to acquisitions ensuring that the required investment is appropriate. The acquisition pipeline continues to remain active mainly with smaller businesses in our emerging business units. We remain very interested in using our capital to make strategic acquisitions but only at appropriate valuations. In summary, like most companies our business is currently being pressured by external economic factors. We are actively and aggressively challenging our cost structure and expect to gain benefit from these improvements as well as from lower energy and other costs. We firmly believe that our strong position in all of our lines of business combined with our conservative balance sheet position, strong cash flow, and manageable debt service level will provide a significant opportunity as we move through and out of this challenging environment. We appreciate your time and thank you for being on this call. Bill and I would now be happy to answer any questions you may have.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Andrea Wirth – Robert Baird
Andrea Wirth – Robert Baird: I’m wondering if you could first address, you call it in the press release, the $14.5 million higher costs associated with commodity costs and the hurricanes, etc. How much of that $14.5 million was actually already in your guidance or essentially how much actually came in greater than you had expected?
Bill Gale: The hurricanes and Canadian Dollar probably were not quite as much included in there but we did assume energy costs at levels that were comparable to the first quarter going forward through the year. Hanger costs we certainly had seen that increase last year so that was pretty much in our guidance. The major problem as we talked about was the rapid deterioration in the revenue line which it’s very difficult to adjust your cost structure that quickly.  That’s what we are aggressively doing but we’re concerned about what’s going to happen with the revenue going forward. That’s why we can’t give guidance at this point.
Andrea Wirth – Robert Baird: I was just trying to understand in terms of your cost side of things especially as it relates to the $14.5 million what was actually greater than expected.
Mike Thompson: Certainly the medical costs were higher than we anticipated for the year.
Andrea Wirth – Robert Baird: Is it fair that maybe even half of that $14.5 million was actually greater than you had originally expected?
Bill Gale: I would say that’s right.
Andrea Wirth – Robert Baird: In document management business your margins came down at least sequentially from about 13.5 to 9.6. Is it fair to say that that’s probably all related to lower scrap paper volume or just because actually energy costs should have been better sequentially?
Mike Thompson: Not all of it. I would say the majority of it but certainly some of it was based on volumes as some customers have reduced their frequency of service. The paper price was the majority.
Andrea Wirth – Robert Baird: I’m trying to understand the magnitude of where margins can go, I know you don’t want to give too much guidance but just given that scrap paper prices continually come down is it probably fair to say that margins probably continue to come down sequentially just given the environment holding everything else steady.
Bill Gale: We have a floor in our paper price contract so I don’t think you’re going to see substantial impact of paper prices from the pricing standpoint. What our concern would be would be more the volume.
Andrea Wirth – Robert Baird: You think that margins actually should be able to, assuming volumes hold?
Bill Gale: Volumes will be the key to it. It’s just impossible for me to predict volumes at this point.
Andrea Wirth – Robert Baird: On the energy side of the equation in terms of what had you been doing with your customers in terms of trying to recoup some of the higher fuel costs going back over the last year, was it just generally in the form of higher prices, was it fuel surcharges? Are you having customers coming back to you asking for some price relief on that front?
Bill Gale: It was primarily through the mechanism in our contracts of CPI price increases that we were able to pass along some of our cost increases. Although they tend to lag because they’re only done on an annual basis we don’t typically do just fuel surcharges. To answer your question, are customers coming back to us, not necessarily because the way it works is through the CPI increases. CPI changes that will get reflected in the annual price changes in the contract.
Andrea Wirth – Robert Baird: Essentially the way we should be looking at this is as contracts come up for renewal on an annual basis and that will be staggered throughout the year that you may have to take prices back to back a little bit with CPI being adjusted. Other than that we shouldn’t expect a wholesale drop in prices.
Bill Gale: Right.
Andrea Wirth – Robert Baird: I’m wondering if you could just give us a little bit of thoughts on what your field reps are telling you in terms of the environment are things expected to get materially worse in terms of add stops especially we’re hearing quit a bit about January especially could be a very difficult month. I want to get some color as to what your field reps are telling you.
Bill Gale: It varies by business unit. I would say that there is a lot of caution out there among our customers and our prospects because no one seems to know what’s going to happen. It’s almost a frozen mentality saying we really don’t want to commit any additional costs right now because we’re not sure how bad things are going to get. We also are concerned about how many plants which are being shut down here over the Christmas and New Years break are going to open up back right at the beginning of January. There probably will be some delays with regard to that. Our reps really probably don’t know much more than what you’re reading in the paper every day. Obviously every day that goes by and you see more closures and more reductions in headcount that’s concerning going forward.
Operator: Your next question comes from Ashwin Shirvaikar – Citigroup/Smith Barney
Ashwin Shirvaikar – Citigroup/Smith Barney: The steps that your taking to adjust to the new level of revenues, shutting down plants, lower headcount, could you help quantify and/or give some impact on timing of the benefit from it.
Bill Gale: As Mike told you we have reduced our headcount over the last several months by 5% overall in the company and we continue to aggressively challenge any new hires or any replacement hires. I think that that benefit will start to play itself out here in the second half of our fiscal year. We did announce in December the shut down of two manufacturing plants in the state of Kentucky which will have an impact more so next fiscal year but will be but the cost of that shut down will be pretty much offset by the savings associated with it this fiscal year. The other things that we’re doing are just looking at all of the expenditures that we’re making in the company and making sure that they’re required to continue to obviously provide the customers the service levels that they expect and make sure they understand the value of the product offerings we’re giving them. Any discretionary expenditure that can be delayed is obviously being delayed. Any capital as Mike indicated to you is being delayed so we don’t need to expand our capacity right now because of the volume level. A significant opportunity will exist as we’re able to consolidate routes as volume drops on routes its not a quick thing to do but we will consolidate routes and eliminate those that are excess so that we can maximize the volume that are on our routes and that will continue in earnest a we go forward over the next several months. We believe that we can reduce our overall cost of doing business and hopefully we’ll be able to offset the revenue shortfalls that we’re seeing from what our original expectations were for this year.
Ashwin Shirvaikar – Citigroup/Smith Barney: The revenue piece is not all that controllable but what is your assumption is it that the worsening continues for the next couple of quarters. How are you planning your business, are you assuming it plateaus out at this level or slightly worse?
Bill Gale: We’ve got different scenarios that we’re anticipating. We could see a much more dramatic drop off or we could see a steady situation of what we see today. What we’re doing is we’re looking at it on an ongoing basis and trying to be as flexible as we can with our costs to adjust to whatever happens. I’ll be honest with you; I can’t predict what’s going to happen. We talk to customers, we read, obviously everything that’s in the press and its just very difficult at this time to predict what is going to happen over the next several months. As I mentioned to Andrea, how many plants are not going to reopen here right after the end of the holidays but are going to stay shut down for a period of time. What’s going to happen with the gaming industry throughout the country as customers continue to see weakness? All of these things we’re just going to have to try to be as flexible as we can to react to that lower revenue line by trying to keep our costs under control. There could be a number of different scenarios that will play out and we’ll just try to react accordingly.
Mike Thompson: As we’ve done it I think as I mentioned earlier as well we’re really looking to protect that cash flow that we have which is still strong and by looking at our CapEx expenditures and scrutinizing acquisitions, etc. we’re doing just that because we want to keep the healthy cash flows and our strong balance sheet maintained.
Bill Gale: We actually anticipate right now, despite a pretty weak economic environment we’ll pay down our Commercial Paper by the end of the fiscal year. All we will have is all of our term debt where the first tranche of which doesn’t come due until 2012. We believe that that is a prudent thing to do at this point in time is really keep that strong balance sheet and keep our powder dry because as always happens in these downturns we’re going to see some great opportunities when we start coming out of it and we will be the strongest company in our businesses to take advantage of that.
Mike Thompson: To sum up we’re preparing for the worst but we want to react to the present conditions and we want to be able to service our customers effectively in the meantime. I think the flexibility Bill talked about is very important for us in maintaining that strong balance sheet and cash flow situation.
Ashwin Shirvaikar – Citigroup/Smith Barney: On the topic of being flexible is there any appetite in your client base due to accept more flexible contracts that may be pass on some of the variability and commodity costs?
Bill Gale: At this point in time I don’t think we’ve seen much appetite to change our normal contract terms. Obviously it becomes more of an opportunity in the non-uniform rental business because those typically have different types of contracts. We have to also be prudent in terms of dealing with our customers; they’re dealing with a lot of problems too. We look to the long-term relationship of our customers and we feel like we’ll work with them and they’ll work with us hopefully to keep both of us in a win, win situation.
Mike Thompson: We truly believe that our retention rates have held up well and it just shows that the products and services that we’re offering are being appreciated by customers. We’re retaining the customers where the customer is still there but it’s at lower volumes because of the financial impact they’re seeing through their business.
Ashwin Shirvaikar – Citigroup/Smith Barney: Did you say the tax rate will continue to decline through the year or did you say it will settle at a lower level?
Mike Thompson: What will happen is in the third quarter; right now our tax rate is high year to date versus where we think we’ll be at the end of the year. To get from where we are today at about 38.3% to the 37.1% for the year you’re actually going to have a rate less than 36% over the last six months. Most of that correction will occur, we expect in Q3 such that the Q4 if you just look at it on a quarterly basis the Q4 effective tax rate is going to be slightly above 37.1%. We believe you’ll see a tax rate actually below 37.1% year to date through Q3.
Ashwin Shirvaikar – Citigroup/Smith Barney: The results they don’t include the [inaudible] settlement that happened?
Bill Gale: That announcement that just was made last night the fine associated with that agreement with OSHA has already been reflected in our financial statements. We’re very pleased to get that settlement behind us and we believe that we’ve got a very good program going forward to make sure that our operations are safely run and all the financial impact of the fines have already been reflected.
Operator: Your next question comes from Vance Edelson – Morgan Stanley
Vance Edelson – Morgan Stanley: Does the sharp decline in recycled paper prices this year change your appetite at all for investing in that business and is that perhaps one of the best places to reduce investment and reduce expense going forward or do you see an eventual rebound in prices there that would make you want to keep charging forward?
Bill Gale: We see document shredding continuing to be a very good growth vehicle for Cintas. Obviously the paper prices are just a series of reactions and overreactions. We think they’ll settle in somewhat higher. Even at these levels that we’re seeing right now we’re comfortable that this is a great business. Our margins will continue to improve regardless of paper prices because as we acquire more density and volume and we’re spending a lot of money on the selling side to grow that business it’s still a great opportunity for Cintas and we’re still very bullish on it.
Mike Thompson: We got into this business about six years ago and the recent run up in paper prices has really been over the last 18 months and then correction therein. When we got into the business the paper prices aren’t significantly different from where they are today. Not much of a change from that standpoint.
Vance Edelson – Morgan Stanley: In terms of wanting to do smaller strategic acquisitions what are you seeing in terms of private market values have they been on the decline which might make for even more attractive targets out there is that what you’re seeing?
Bill Gale: I don’t think we’ve seen it yet to the degree it needs to happen in order for us to become very aggressive on acquisitions. There periodically will come across one, as Mike mentioned, we spent a few million dollars in the second quarter. I think there is a shock that’s hit a lot of these private companies with the rapid deterioration in valuation not only for their businesses but just looking in general across the equity markets. It’s going to take a while for their expectations to adjust and we’ll be patient waiting for their expectations to get more in line with economic reality.
Vance Edelson – Morgan Stanley: Going back on an earlier point, not to pound away at it too much but given that you expect economic improvement eventually and great opportunities as you put it could you talk about how much flexibility you really have in aggressively removing additional costs from here. How are you going to balance that in your mind with not wanting to hamper growth on the other side of the cycle?
Bill Gale: The greatest opportunities we have right now are to efficiently run our route-based businesses. We are very actively looking at ways to improve volume levels on routes so that we can obviously take advantage of that as the economic downturn continues. Certainly looking at G&A what can we do to consolidate some of the activities in G&A. We’ve got, as Mike mentioned, we have a major project going forward with SAP which we believe will have significant benefits down the road on the way we handle some of our financial systems as well as our global supply chain activities. We’re not slowing down on those types of things. It takes time to get that stuff in place. I think that when we start coming out of this economic downturn we will be a much stronger company, much more efficiently run and we’ll see great margin improvements as you get more volume up on that top line.
Mike Thompson: In addition to that we have a significant push of ensuring that everything we do is considered valuated work and that is work that the customer appreciates as wanting to pay for. When we are streamlining businesses and looking at operational efficiencies the key for us is if there is value to the customer and they’re willing to pay for it we’re going to do it because we can still make a good return on it.  It’s taking all these other processes that build up and ensuring that is everything that we’re doing really adding to what the customer appreciates. While that’s a concept that you can think negligibly about when you put it into actions there are a lot of things you can find and we’ve done that so far by reducing headcount by 5%.
Operator: Your next question comes from Gary Bisbee – Barclays Capital
Gary Bisbee – Barclays Capital: Not to beat this one further but is it realistic to think, I realize that it could take a couple of quarters to get a lot of the cost initiatives you’re working on. Is it realistic to think that you could actually cost either SG&A or on the cost to goods sold line decline at some point or is it more likely just a more severe slowdown in the growth of the costs?
Bill Gale: I think it’s realistic to think they could decline. We certainly have demonstrated some things there relative to our cost structure but as Mike said, we have medical costs ran away from us in the second quarter but the latest trends indicate that that’s going to come down to more normal levels. The impact of this headcount reduction is yet to be felt as we go forward. We’re very optimistic that we could see that happen assuming that something else just doesn’t go out of whack somewhere.
Mike Thompson: You just can’t get that immediately as Bill discussed earlier there is a little bit of a lag to get these things in place to make up for that loss of revenues.
Gary Bisbee – Barclays Capital: On the uniform sales business obviously that’s lumpy and its probably upgrading uniforms for the big global customers is sort of a discretionary spending put off. Was there anything either in the year ago comparison or that you saw this quarter that could make the magnitude of the drop somewhat more of a one time issue or is it totally possible that we could see double digit declines in the top line there for a few quarters?
Bill Gale: I’m having a difficult time predicting what’s going to happen but it would not be beyond the realm of possibility that these type of declines could continues because there really was nothing unusual in last years second quarter. As I stated earlier and as Mike talked about we just saw a really rapid decline on the part of our customers to purchase these uniforms because it was more of a discretionary spend.  I don’t think any of you are surprised if you think about what’s happening with some of the big gaming companies or even the big hotel chains, they’re seeing significant reductions in their guest traffic and that is basically resulting in them doing everything they can to reduce their costs.  It will come back, it always does I just think we’ve just got to get out of this doldrum here and get the economy moving again then we’ll be better positioned than any of our competitors because we’ve got the global supply chain, we’ve got the capabilities of providing a lot of different products and services that many of the smaller competitors may not be in existence to be able to do when the economy improves.
Gary Bisbee – Barclays Capital: Obviously it looks like energy will be something that will be helpful over the next couple quarters. What about some of these other commodities, it seems to me it could be 60, 80, 100 basis points of help easily; it seems like for a few quarters if prices stay there. What about this other stuff, steel prices and some of the things have come down so are you seeing hanger costs and some of these other commodities that you referenced being up 60 basis points come down at all? Is that likely to continue to be a pressure in the near term?
Bill Gales: Hangers are artificially being escalated because of the government intervention in putting the tariffs on. We are looking at opportunities to try to diminish the number of hangers that we’re using in our facilities to encourage recycling of hangers. There certainly will be a little bit of an impact because steel prices have come down recently. With all of the infrastructure projects that are being proposed steel may jump right back up. The big issue is there are not a lot of buyable hanger manufacturers left in the United States. Until we find a source that is not subject to the tariffs I’m not sure you’re going to see a lot of impact on hangers. It will anniversary itself in the fourth quarter because that’s when we began to first see the increases and hopefully through some of our conservation efforts we’ll minimize the use of hangers but that’s one that will probably stay there. Energy costs certainly should continue to provide a benefit going forward. We won’t have the hurricane issue. I can’t predict what’s going to happen with the exchange rates. The rapid increase in the Canadian Dollar has already been mitigated a little bit recently so hopefully that won’t be an ongoing issue. As Mike mentioned medical costs certainly we believe can improve going forward based on recent trends.
Gary Bisbee – Barclays Capital: I talked to one of your drivers here this morning here who had a truck full of mats getting ready for the snowstorm we’re supposed to get. Hopefully that will happen and drive a little incremental revenue for you.
Bill Gale: For our sake hopefully it will happen. For your sake I’m sure it will be more of a hassle.
Operator: Your next question comes from Scott Schneeberger – Oppenheimer
Scott Schneeberger – Oppenheimer: I’d like to ask about the pricing environment you’re seeing out there, obviously with the economic pressures. I believe you alluded to a recent pricing increase that had taken well. If I could just get a little more elaboration on the topic.
Mike Thompson: What I’d indicated was price increases while a little more difficult in the quarter held up relatively well. Pricing continues to be fairly aggressive in the marketplace. Certainly with customers our prospects being very diligent on their financial situations I’d say price increases have been a little more difficult but overall considering where the marketplace is we felt that they held up relatively well.
Scott Schneeberger – Oppenheimer: You guys have been making a gradual move to some global operations and some verticals that you’ve alluded to on this call that have been hit pretty hard. What is the status now obviously with cost constraints, are you slowing that effort or is that something that you’re still looking to push.
Bill Gale: We’re still looking to push it. It’s a longer-term play as we’ve mentioned before. We see opportunities they won’t have a material impact in our financials in the short term but we still think despite the economic issues that there are great opportunities for us to take some of or services outside of North America and we will continue to pursue those as the right opportunities present themselves.
Mike Thompson: From a capital perspective we’re holding a significant amount of dollars in our Canadian operations that we don’t repatriate back to the United States for tax reasons that we really have earmarked for foreign expansion that doesn’t affect our debt structure or anything like that. It’s really looking at the opportunities and ensuring that the growth that we’re projecting and the costs for that in those countries and in those divisions makes sense.
Scott Schneeberger – Oppenheimer: Looking a bit more at the cost side 5% headcount reduction thus far is that something that you see, we’ve had a few questions trying to gauge how much more of that is there to come and how do you want to look coming out of the backside of the economy hopefully in the economic turn. Is that something that you are continuing to aggressively do, it alludes to more to come in the future in the press release.
Bill Gale: There is more to come as we continue to adjust to the economic reality that we have and we’re doing that micromanaging as I said, every replacement hire, every new hire in the company to ensure that it’s absolutely necessary to create value added work and provide the service to our customers. If we don’t see the top line begin to grow quickly again you’re going to see more cost reduction through headcount reduction because we will continue to adjust to the economic reality.
Mike Thompson: Of the headcount reduction we have put in place we haven’t seen the full benefit yet. We didn’t have one set date where we reduced our entire workforce, its been based on turnover and not replacing that turnover and ensuring that we again evaluate value added work and ensure that position needs to be replaced and in many cases we’re deciding it doesn’t need to be and that’s where the 5% is coming from.
Scott Schneeberger – Oppenheimer: How are you handling your sales force is that larger, smaller than it was a quarter ago? The way you define non-value added, the sales force obviously has a direct touch on customers but if the customer is not spending are we discussing sales force as well in that group?
Bill Gale: We absolutely are. We’ll right size the sales force to reflect what the opportunities are. There is no group within the company that does not go without scrutiny. Sales force is certainly part of that.
Mike Thompson: You’ve go to also understand that we balance out the sales force among the different opportunities across all divisions.
Bill Gale: Keep in mind we were on plan through the first quarter of our fiscal year when we talked to you guys in September. We saw a little weakness in August but we really saw it just accelerate as we went through the second quarter. You’ve got to be careful here you don’t want to react too quickly but we certainly saw enough during this quarter that said we’ve got to react because things just continued to deteriorate. We’ll see the benefit of that going forward it just didn’t happen yet in this quarter.
Operator: Your last question comes from Greg Halter – Great Lakes
Greg Halter – Great Lakes: Relative to the competitive environment out there specifically surrounding the smaller guys what are you seeing in that regard?
Bill Gale: We are certainly seeing concern on the part of the smaller competitors. They certainly don’t have the same financial wherewithal that we do to continue to provide great services to their customer. I would tell you that if past is indication of future many of these smaller competitors are going to find it very difficult to continue as a private company and I think you’ll see more consolidation going forward as this economic downturn continues.
Mike Thompson: Their access to capital for growth has been hurt pretty severely as has with many companies.
Greg Halter – Great Lakes: Have you seen any of your competitors go out of business yet that you are aware of?
Bill Gale: No significant competitor yet. It’s early. While we’ve been kind of muddling through some economic headwinds throughout most of this year it really accelerated in our second quarter. I think it will be another year or so of that before you’ll really begin to see real pressure on a lot of these guys.
Greg Halter – Great Lakes: If you look around the country, at least in North America, are there any areas that are worse than others and any areas that are better than others if you could lay out?
Mike Thompson: Widespread, we’re having more difficulty certainly where most people are, Florida, the rust belt, Cleveland area, Detroit, up in those areas. Our Northeast is performing a little better; Southwest because of energy is performing a little better. When I say better I don’t mean it’s good I think across the country it’s been hurt.
Greg Halter – Great Lakes: Southeast with oil at $33 or $38 may not be doing a little better.
Bill Gale: That’s right. I would say it’s a pretty widespread downturn throughout the country. Obviously as Mike said, some areas are much worse than others. It’s not going to be a good situation for a while.
Greg Halter – Great Lakes: How much is Canada of your revenues in total?
Mike Thompson: Less than 10%. We don’t break it out separately.
Greg Halter – Great Lakes: Do you do any hedging on currency at all?
Bill Gale: We do some, we hedged a little bit, the Canadian Dollar weakened so fast that we weren’t able to hedge as much as we would have liked at this point in time. Hopefully another opportunity will present itself.
Greg Halter – Great Lakes: I presume your share repurchase is scrap for the time being?
Bill Gale: We did not buy any shares back in the last quarter and our focus right now is on cash generation and debt reduction.
Greg Halter – Great Lakes: If tax laws were changed in the US would you consider repatriating that cash?
Mike Thompson: Sure, absolutely.
Greg Halter – Great Lakes: On your ERP system you mentioned its going to the financial and one other area and I missed that?
Bill Gale: Global supply chain.
Operator: This concludes our question and answer session at this time I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Thompson for any closing or additional comments.
Bill Gale: Thank you again for participating in today’s call. On behalf of all of our Cintas partners we wish you and your families a very joyous holiday and hopefully a more prosperous 2009. We’ll look forward to speaking with you again in March.
Operator: This concludes today’s conference we thank you for your participation. At this time you may now disconnect your line.

===== 2009 Q1  (2008-09-18 17:00:00) =====

Operator: Welcome to the Cintas quarterly earnings results conference call. (Operator Instructions) At this time I’d like to turn the call over to Bale Gale, Senior Vice President of Finance and Chief Financial Officer.
William C. Gale: Thank you for joining us this evening to discuss Cintas’ first quarter fiscal 2009 earnings results. Joining me this evening is Mike Thompson, Cintas’ Vice President and Treasurer. Cintas reported revenues and net income in line with its plan for the year. Revenues increased 5% on a comparable workday basis over the first quarter of last fiscal year to $1 billion. This year’s first quarter had one less workday than last year. Earnings per share were $0.51 this year, the same as last year’s first quarter. Net income was $78.6 million versus $81.1 million in last year’s first quarter. As Mike will explain shortly, in addition to the impact of one less workday in this year’s first quarter we experienced significantly higher costs for energy and other supplies such as hangers as well as weakness in both our customer base and with new prospect conversions. We saw slightly lower organic growth in all of our segments which we believe is an indication of economic weakness in the general economy. However we still did post an overall organic growth of almost 4% and as I stated earlier, we met our plan for the quarter. Our current guidance of revenues and earnings per share for the fiscal year ending May 31, 2009 remains unchanged and calls for total revenues of $4.1 billion to $4.2 billion and diluted earnings per share of $2.22 to $2.30. We believe the guidance remains appropriate given the current economic conditions and the potential impact of the recent weather events. As a result of the hurricanes we had several operations that while physical damage was minimal to the facilities, they either had no power or are still out of power. This has occurred at operations in Texas, Louisiana and even in the Midwest. We are also experiencing issues with providing services to our customers in these areas as they are not able to operate. At this time we are unable to quantify the impact on our results but we do not believe it will be material to the company in total. We will pursue business interruption insurance recovery according to our policies in effect. Our financial condition is very strong and we continue to generate strong operating cash flow and maintain conservative financial policies. During the quarter the company acquired about 900,000 shares of its common stock. We continue to have about $200 million available for additional Cintas share purchases under the amount authorized by our Board of Directors. The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a Safe Harbor from civil litigation for forward-looking statements. This conference call contains forward looking statements that reflect the company’s current view as to future events and financial performance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ materially from those we may discuss. I refer you to the discussion on these points contained in our most recent filings with the SEC as well as in the press release issued today announcing Cintas’ first quarter fiscal 2009 results. I will now turn the call over to Mike Thompson who will discuss this quarter’s results in more detail and then we will be happy to answer your questions.
Michael L. Thompson: Beginning with the income statement, total revenues were $1 billion for the quarter a 3.4% increase over the $969 million reported for the first quarter of last fiscal year. However as Bill mentioned, this year’s first quarter had one less workday than the first quarter of fiscal 2008. When adjusted for the one less workday, revenue growth was 5%. Total company internal growth was 3.9% for the quarter. As a reminder, the remaining three quarters of fiscal 2009 will each have 65 workdays which is the same number of workdays of each of the last three quarters of fiscal 2008. As such fiscal 2009 will have 260 workdays which is one less than the 261 workdays in fiscal 2008. The number of workdays in a quarter does have an impact on both revenue and income. We classify our businesses into four reportable operating segments: Rental uniforms and ancillary products; uniform direct sales; first aid, safety and fire protection services; and document management services. Uniform direct sales, first aid, safety and fire protection services and document management services are combined and presented as other services on the face of the income statement. Detail for these operating segments is provided in the supplemental segment data included with the release. The rental uniforms and ancillary products operating segment consists of the rental and servicing of uniforms and other garments, mats, mops, shop towels and other related items. Our restroom and hygiene products and services are also included within this segment. Rental revenues were $721.4 million for the quarter compared to $710.4 million in the first quarter last year. When adjusted for one less workday, this represents a 3.1% increase over the first quarter of last fiscal year. Rental organic growth was also 3.1% down from 3.6% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008.  The difficult economic environment continues to affect our customers and we continue to experience increased loss of business and stops as they reduced headcount and closed locations. Also, unlike our fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 we have now seen our new business results begin to suffer. While we continue to be successful in demonstrating the value of our products and services to prospects, many of our customers and new business prospects have become more cautious on spending causing our new business rates to slow. Our other services revenue which includes uniform direct sales, first aid, safety and fire protection, and document management segments grew 10.2% on a comparable workday basis and had internal growth of 6.1%. Our uniform direct sales operating segment incorporates our global accounts and strategic markets division which direct sells uniforms, brand of promotional products and other related products to national and large regional customers and our direct sale catalog which direct sells uniforms and related products primarily to local customers who also rent products from us. The uniform direct sales segment grew 0.4% for the first quarter on a workday adjusted basis as customers delayed or canceled new programs and reduced headcount. We maintained our revenue stream by retaining our customer base but economic conditions are causing a headwind in this segment as well. Our third operating segment is first aid, safety and fire protection services. In this business we sell and deliver first aid products, safety products and automatic defibulators to our customers. We also provide safety training to their employees. Within fire protection we install, inspect, repair and recharge portable fire extinguishers and sprinkler systems. We also provide and service emergency lighting systems and kitchen fire suppression systems. During the quarter revenues within our first aid, safety and fire protection services operating segment grew 7.8% on a comparable workday basis. On an organic basis this segment grew 5.6% which was an improvement over the fourth quarter internal growth rate of 5.3%. While general economic conditions continue to impact this business, we were able to improve our internal growth rate slightly. After suffering through a difficult fiscal 2008 our fire protection business stabilized and improved providing the increase in this segment’s internal growth rate. Our document management services operating segment is comprised mainly of document shredding services although we do have storage and imaging capabilities. Revenues within this operating segment continue to grow at a rapid rate. First quarter revenues for the document management operating segment grew 47.5% on a comparable workday basis. Internal growth for the segment was 25% down from 30% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008. This deceleration occurred as the increased paper prices we experienced during fiscal 2008 have now been lapped. In fact we experienced a reduction in recycled paper prices of approximately 20% versus prices from the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008. In addition, our new business as a percent of revenues has decreased due to the overall size of this fast-growing segment and to a lesser degree than our other business segments’ overall economic conditions. First quarter total company gross margin was 42.4% a 70 basis point decline from last year’s first quarter and a 50 basis point decline from the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008. Energy costs for the company increased to their highest level reaching approximately 4.4% of total company sales as compared to 3.4% a year ago and 4.0% in last year’s fourth quarter. The increase in energy costs along with other increased commodity costs were partially offset by improved leverage over infrastructure within our rental division and margin improvement in our other services operating segments as we continued to gain scale especially in document management. Additionally, there is margin impact across all divisions when comparing results to the first quarter of last year due to the one less workday in this year’s first quarter. Our rental gross margins were 43.5% of revenue for the first quarter, a 140 basis point decline from last fiscal year’s first quarter and a 40 basis point decline from the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008. Energy costs increased 100 basis points over last year’s first quarter and hanger expense increased 50 basis points. The energy increase was mainly due to increased delivery gas expense but there was also some impact from increased natural gas pricing. Hanger costs have increased significantly as the United States has imposed a significant tariff on hangers produced in China which is where we source our hangers and also due to the volatility in steel prices. We are offsetting some of this increase by combining purchases and putting the volume through our new facility services distribution center. We are also looking into alternative sourcing arrangements. We have also experienced an increase in the cost of other commodities and supplies including wash chemicals. We were able to leverage our infrastructure to offset some of these increases mainly through leveraging labor costs across the organization. The 40 basis point decline from the fourth quarter was due to the same issues, just not as severe given the shorter time differential. Energy costs accounted for half of the increase as they increased 20 basis points over last year’s fourth quarter. Other services gross margin was 39.5% a 140 basis point improvement over the first quarter of fiscal 2008 but a 100 basis point decrease from last year’s fourth quarter. The improvement over last year’s first quarter was mainly due to sales mix. The document management segment continues to grow at a very rapid rate. This division which is higher margins than first aid, safety and fire protection and uniform direct sales is driving other services’ gross margin higher as it continues to become a larger percentage of other services revenue. Gross margins in the first aid, safety and fire protection and document management segments were relatively flat as compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2008 despite significant increases in energy costs which is mainly delivery gas for these divisions. These divisions were able to offset these energy cost increases through additional leverage of their infrastructures mainly in labor.  The uniform direct sales segment’s gross margins improved 110 basis points over last year due to continuing improvement in sourcing operations. The 100 basis point decrease in other services’ gross margin from the fourth quarter was a combination of lower revenues in uniform direct sales causing a lower coverage of fixed costs and a low recycled paper prices in document management as discussed earlier. As we have mentioned in the past, while paper prices impact revenue and internal growth results they have a bigger impact on margins as the change in price falls to the bottom line. In addition, energy costs were up in the other services operating segments. Selling and administrative expenses were 28.7% of revenue a slight increase over 28.6% in last year’s first quarter and 100 basis points higher than the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008. As compared to last year’s first quarter a 60 basis point increase in medical costs and a 20 basis point increase in bad debt reserve were offset by a reduction in G&A labor, lower payroll taxes associated with the labor leverage obtained throughout the company, and lower legal and professional fees as compared to last year. We were also able to leverage some of our selling costs and we expect more leverage in the future. The 100 basis point increase from last year’s fourth quarter was due to the increase in medical costs and the increase in our bad debt reserve. As a reminder, our bad debt reserving policy is conservative in that we require building a reserve on receivables that increases to a 100% reserve for most balances over 90 days. We have seen increased aging within our receivable balance during the first quarter and our DSOs have gone from 41 at the end of last fiscal year to 44 as our customers stretch their working capital. We were also able to leverage some of our selling costs as compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 and again expect more leverage in the future. Net interest cost this quarter was $12 million down slightly from the $12.1 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008. Our effective tax rate was 37.5% for the quarter as compared to 37.3% for the first quarter of last year reflecting reserve requirements under FIN 48. We expect our effective tax rate for fiscal 2009 to be approximately 37.1%. Under FIN 48 the effective tax rate will fluctuate with reserve requirements on a quarterly basis which impacts quarterly net income and earnings per share results. For the quarter net income was $78.6 million and earnings per diluted share were $0.51 both of which are in line with the plan we used in providing fiscal 2009 full-year guidance. Our balance sheet continues to be strong. Our current ratio improved to 3.75 to 1 at August 31. We have approximately $181 million in cash and marketable securities. The majority of our marketable securities are invested in short-term Canadian government securities and we expect to use these funds for future international expansion. As I mentioned earlier, our DSOs on receivables has increased and has caused our accounts receivable balance to grow. Our inventory levels have increased approximately $6 million over August 31 of 2007 due to the opening of our new facility services distribution center. This distribution center consolidates our corporate purchases allowing us to better leverage our purchasing power and control location inventory requirements on these items. Our accrued liabilities increased $52 million over August 31, 2007 mainly due to the elimination of our [VIVA] account which have historically been used to prefund our employee medical costs. A change in tax code has essentially eliminated the benefit of having a [VIVA] in place. As such the [VIVA] trust was terminated and claims are now paid directly out of cash. Long-term debt at August 31, 2008 was $951 million. Total debt as a percentage of total book capitalization was 29.3%. The majority of our debt is in long-term fixed public debt. At August 31 we had $170 million in outstanding CP which is included in our long-term debt. Using our credit facility we have been able to receive regular funding under our programs. Our cash flow remains strong with cash provided by operations of $88 million in the first quarter.  Our capital expenditures for the first quarter were $54 million. Cap ex has increased from the prior year as we are in the process of implementing a corporate ERP system. We continue to expect cap ex for the year to be between $180 million and $200 million. We spent $12 million during the quarter acquiring a few small businesses mainly in document management. We are being very selective in our approach to acquisitions ensuring that the required investment is appropriate. The acquisition pipeline continues to remain active but it is mainly with smaller businesses and our emerging business units. During the quarter, as Bill mentioned, we purchased approximately 900,000 shares of our common stock at an average price of $28.60 for a total cost of approximately $26 million. We continue to have $202 million remaining under our current share buy-back program. In summary, we believe we are uniquely qualified to provide value to our existing customers and new prospects. Our businesses continue to grow, generate solid consistent cash flow and are supported by a strong conservative balance sheet. While cautious due to the current economic environment and recent weather conditions, we reiterate our full-year fiscal 2009 guidance of $4.1 billion to $4.2 billion in revenue and fully diluted earnings per share in the range of $2.22 to $2.30. Thank you. And now Bill and I will be happy to answer any questions you may have.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Andrea Wirth - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.
Andrea Wirth - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: I just wanted to start with the quarter itself. It looked like you were saying that you had met your own internal plans but with the high cost of fuel and hangers and also the new business piece starting to fall off, I’m just wondering what actually made up or was better than what you had expected in the quarter?
William G. Gale: Andrea the energy costs and some of the commodity prices, if you recall we talked about in July that we had begun to experience in May and even into June, and we had pretty much built some of that into our plan. The new business really began to trail off I would tell you in the latter part of the quarter and we don’t know whether it’s just a short-term summer phenomenon or what but it is something that we’re going to really keep our eye on very closely. Now what we are doing to anticipate that we may continue to have these higher operating costs going forward and perhaps even slightly lower revenue is the company is very, very aggressive on looking at ways to reduce costs, maintaining a strict control over headcount additions, looking at ways to consolidate our purchasing power with our vendors, and I think we’ve done a lot of things to help offset some of this.
Andrea Wirth - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Just along those lines, when you look at the full-year guidance and given the fact that the new business is starting to trail off a bit and fuel prices I guess have come down a bit now as of late, what are your expectations? And have your revenue growth expectations changed and your actual energy costs changed in that guidance? I guess I’m just a little bit surprised that you’re able to hold that guidance flat just given the scenarios.
William C. Gale: The energy costs, we feel pretty good that our plan is probably correct for that. We gave a guidance on revenue of between $4.1 billion and $4.2 billion so t hat right now we see no problem with meeting that guidance given that range. And obviously as we are at the lower end of that range we’ll have to be more aggressive on cost control and trying to maintain our margins. But as we’ve looked at our forecast for the rest of the year compared to our plan and what’s going on in the business, we feel pretty good about it. Now with that said, obviously with all the turmoil that seems to be going on right now I don’t know what impact that’s going to have on the general economy. We anticipated kind of a gradually improving economy as we went through our fiscal year. Hopefully that will still be the case and we’re expecting it to be the case be it a very modest improvement, but if we go into a deep recession obviously we’ll have to relook at that and monitor the results going forward. We don’t think that’s going to happen but there is that risk out there based on kind of the upheaval that seems to be going on right now.
Andrea Wirth - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: And also along those lines, you had mentioned at least with the core uniform rental growth rate that you had thought the 3% to 3.5% rate was sustainable and actually you possibly thought you’d see some improvement actually throughout the year in that rate as new business does continue to pick up with projects continue to gain momentum. Is that still a possibility and does that kind of lean towards your comments about what happens with the overall economy or I’m just curious just what your thoughts are on the core rental business?
William C. Gale: As you summarized, that is correct. We still believe that our core rental business will show modest and gradual improvement as we go throughout the rest of this year and I have no reason to believe that that won’t take place right now barring a very, very deep recession type environment.
Andrea Wirth - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Last question on the ad stops. I think you had mentioned on the last conference call that at least the last six weeks before the call the rate of deterioration seemed to stabilize. Is that still the case or are you starting to see a reacceleration in the rate of deterioration in those ad stops?
William C. Gale: That’s still the case. We’re not seeing an improvement but we really didn’t see any significant deterioration.
Operator: Our next question comes from Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup/Smith Barney.
Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup/Smith Barney: Nice performance eon the operating cash flow. But on a year-over-year basis that number did seem to be driven by the accrued liability and accrued comp lines. Is there anything unusual going on in those lines? What drives the fluctuation? And I guess what I’m trying to eventually quantify is the impact on operating profit due to maybe a lower bonus accrual or things like that.
William G. Gale: I would tell you that there was nothing really that happened. The accrued liabilities thing is really offset by the taxes because of the item that Mike mentioned on the [VIVA]. The accrued compensation line is more the result of probably just the timing of when payrolls are made and how many days you have to accrue versus when payments are actually made. For example, August 29 this year was on a Friday and that’s our pay date so the accrual was probably down. But I would say there’s really no significant change in the cost elements of it. It’s just really more a matter of the switch on the [VIVA] between accrued liabilities and income taxes and then just the days on compensation.
Michael L. Thompson: Just a little more color on that. At the end of May we certainly have a larger bonus accrual for year-end bonuses. At the end of August it’s a smaller buildup so the accrual is much lower.
Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup/Smith Barney: Just to follow up on the prior question, to clarify, you are expecting modestly improving economy and were you also expecting the fuel prices to stay at the current level?
William G. Gale: Our guidance pretty much assumes fuel prices at generally the current level that we experienced through the quarter within 10 to 20 basis points.
Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup/Smith Barney: So where we are is really not a surprise?
William C. Gale: No.
Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup/Smith Barney: And you did say, just to confirm, that barring a very serious downturn you can make the numbers?
William C. Gale: Yes.
Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup/Smith Barney: If you could remind me what the profit contribution is as a percentage from the recycled paper sales in the document segment?
William C. Gale: We don’t disclose that level of detail Ashwin. As Mike said, the contribution from the recycling of our paper from document shredding did decline in the quarter but that was again anticipated in our projections, in our plan.
Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup/Smith Barney: And last question, M&A. I’m a little surprised you’re not maybe seeing more of a selling alignment by the smaller laundry owners.
William C. Gale: We are not seeing that, not at prices that are reasonable. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Michel Morin - Merrill Lynch.
Michel Morin - Merrill Lynch: Sorry to come back to this but on the margin in the document management segment, if we look at things sequentially there is a 160 basis point decline. You didn’t say that it was entirely due to recycled paper?
William C. Gale: No. It was energy also.
Michel Morin - Merrill Lynch: Was there also an impact from the one fewer day there?
Michael L. Thompson: Yes. That’s true throughout all of our segments.
Michel Morin - Merrill Lynch: On the first aid/fire protection side, good performance there. I think over the last six months or so you had talked about having seen some impact from reduced kind of new commercial construction. Has that changed or what has allowed you to see an improvement there?
Michael L. Thompson: It’s really that we have essentially gotten past a year. In fiscal 2008 we had each quarter that we’re comparing to a more difficult quarter in fiscal 07. We’ve now lapped that and then we’ve seen some improvement in our service component within the fire protection business.
Michel Morin - Merrill Lynch: So kind of the one-time part of that business is still under a little bit of pressure but at least you have easier comps?
Michael L. Thompson: That’s right.
Michel Morin - Merrill Lynch: Is there anything that’s moving the needle from the profitability of that segment in terms of the new installations? Is there a meaningful difference in terms of driving the profitability, because you also have a nice bump up in profitability this quarter?
William C. Gale: I think part of it is, a lot of this business came through acquisition and as you’re able to synthesize those acquired companies, put in our practices, look at opportunities for improving the margins of those acquired companies, you’re going to continue to see that happen.
Michael L. Thompson: Improved purchasing power.
Michel Morin - Merrill Lynch: Finally, you mentioned the weather a couple of times and the impact of the hurricane. It sounded from your description that this might be a more severe impact than what you saw from Katrina, maybe because also you’ve got more population density. Am I thinking about that right?
Michael L. Thompson: No. Again none of that impacted the quarter we’re reporting on; it all began for our second quarter. We just wanted to make sure that people understood we did have some weather issues. It was not as severe as Katrina. The issue with Katrina was many of those customers never came back. We don’t expect that to be the case here but there was an impact in that we had plants shut down for a period of time and still have a few of them down, especially down in the Southwest. But the damage in that part of the country is not as severe as during Katrina so we hope that it’s not as severe.
Operator: Our next question comes from Gary Bisbee - Lehman Brothers.
Gary Bisbee - Lehman Brothers: I wondered if you could remind us. Every once in a while I feel like you’ve given us the rough breakdown of the energy costs, what percent comes from what. I’m just trying to think about with gas and diesel prices having likely fallen sequentially in the next quarter how much of a benefit sequentially that might be? Is it still like 40% of that number you give us is gas and diesel or is it a little different than that?
Michael L. Thompson: For total company now it’s almost half that it’s delivery gas.
Gary Bisbee - Lehman Brothers: And the rest of it is mostly natural gas for the laundry plant but a portion of it energy costs?
Michael L. Thompson: You’ve got a portion of electric there as well.
Gary Bisbee - Lehman Brothers: You talked about the new business being impacted by the economy. How did that trend during the quarter? Did that get worse throughout the quarter? And is that something that’s gotten worse as we’re early in the next quarter or was it just a modest downtick that’s sort of staying at that same level?
William C. Gale: It was more of a downtick that began in August and kind of just was below our expectations in August and had carried a little bit into September but we only have like the first week of September at that level of detail.
Gary Bisbee - Lehman Brothers: Are you seeing any, given the continued challenges in the credit market, any issue at all with the commercial paper or your funding at all or has there been no problems to date?
William C. Gale: The only issue we had was a one-day event. Well, two issues I’d say. Monday apparently it was pretty much impossible to get any commercial paper sold. We’ve seen a slight uptick in the rates. I guess we’ve gone from [RFCP] rates were running around 2.2%. They’re now up to about 2.8% but we’re able to sell our paper as things roll. Monday was about the only day that that did not happen but after that the market seemed to have stabilized.
Michael L. Thompson: And with that we have certainly supporting under our credit agreement that we have support behind that.
Gary Bisbee - Lehman Brothers: Well, I guess I’ll take the blame then. It was the Lehman issue it sounds like.
William C. Gale: It’s good to hear you’re on the call though Gary.
Gary Bisbee - Lehman Brothers: Yes. We’ll soon be Barclays Capital I think but we’re still in business or back in business I should say.
William C. Gale: That’s good to hear.
Gary Bisbee - Lehman Brothers: Thank you. And one last question I’ll ask. You mentioned the cash in Canada again and specifically holding that for international acquisitions. Any update how you’re thinking about that? Is the document management business in Europe going well? Is that still an area you’d like to do more?
William C. Gale: Yes. We’d like to do more there. As we mentioned in the last call, we’re looking at providing direct sale of uniforms to many of our US based companies as they expand outside of North America. We’re working with them on that. So yes, we’re working on a number of opportunities. Nothing that I can announce at this point but we feel that there are several good things going.
Operator: Our next question comes from Greg Halter - Great Lakes Review.
Greg Halter - Great Lakes Review: Looking at the price side of things, is it still very difficult to get price through or are some of your competitors becoming less aggressive on their own pricing front?
Michael L. Thompson: I would say it still continues to be difficult. We are still getting some price increases but not out of line of where they’ve been historically. But I’d say overall new business pricing continues to be pretty aggressive.
Greg Halter - Great Lakes Review: Bill, I think on the last call you had indicated that some parts of the country were still okay and others weren’t so good. I wondered if you could give us just a brief rundown and obviously I know it’s a big country and so forth, but I wondered how you’re doing in areas of the country as well as Canada. What’s good and what’s bad?
William C. Gale: Canada’s pretty solid. I would tell you Canada looks good and that we really haven’t seen a lot of impact up there. Throughout the US I’m seeing generally the greatest weakness continuing to be in the Midwest and in the areas that really seem to be very sluggish like the Southeast now with Florida and all the problems that are going on out there. The West continues to be a little bit difficult to do business in. The Northeast has held up pretty well and the Northwest has been good. But it continues to be a Midwest issue primarily.
Greg Halter - Great Lakes Review: You mentioned the ERP implementation. Can you mention how long that will take, how you’re phasing it in, and then who’s system you’re using?
William C. Gale: I do not want to disclose the system at this point. We’re still kind of in the early stages but it’s going to be a multi-year project. The way these things work is you pay a significant part up front so I don’t want everybody to think we’re going to be incurring big charges every quarter. But Phase 1 is a relatively safe phase in that we’re going to be looking at our financial systems and we would hope to have a conversion of that here within 12 months. And then we’ll phase in the other pieces of the business over the next couple of years.
Greg Halter - Great Lakes Review: Any idea on total costs for that implementation?
William C. Gale: I’d rather not say at this time because you know how those things go. It varies. We’re still in the scoping phase and stuff so it’s hard for me to say that right now.
Greg Halter - Great Lakes Review: There was an interesting intriguing win last week relative to Unite and I wondered if you could speak about that?
William C. Gale: Yes. I’m glad you brought that up Greg. What happened on the Unite Union front is that a federal appeals court basically sent back to a lower court and reaffirmed a ruling that Unite was going to be held liable for privacy violations impacting I think approximately 2,500 of our partners in the Northeast and has affirmed a penalty against Unite of about $5 million as well as asked the lower court to reconsider that punitive damages might be in order. So it was a win for our partners who filed this suit against Unite indicating that Unite did violate their privacy rights.
Greg Halter - Great Lakes Review: That sounds like it’s very favorable there. On the energy side, we’re hearing Cleveland as you know, here in Cincinnati and we did see the gasoline prices and diesel come down. Gas was down to maybe $3.50. Since the hurricane we’re back at about $4.00 which is our peak. So really there has not been much relief from gasoline prices here at least in the Midwest. I don’t know if you can speak to that relative to your business around the rest of the country.
William C. Gale: I think that’s prevalent throughout the country Greg. Again, it is something that we kind of anticipated in our plan and when we gave you our guidance. We would hope that prices would come back down to where we saw they were coming or going to before the hurricanes hit. And that could present a little bit of an opportunity for us the rest of the year. It’s so hard to predict that. This whole oil market and gasoline and diesel and natural gas are just unbelievable and the volatility. So we’re prepared for it and I think our numbers anticipate a high degree of cost and maybe there’ll be a little upside opportunity if we can get a break here.
Michael L. Thompson: I think Greg if you remember back in our year-end call, prices were just starting to come down and we thought there might be an opportunity going forward because the way we projected using May and June levels. But now as you indicated and we agree, the levels have come right back to those May and June levels.
Greg Halter - Great Lakes Review: One last one. I see that Wyndham Hotels is introducing green uniforms made out of recycled polyester fibers and I guess you guys are working on that. I wondered if you could comment on that initiative?
William C. Gale: Certainly we’re working with our customers on a number of different things. That was one that Wyndham wanted to publicize. I believe that release may have just gone out by them. Green products and green servicing is a major point of several customers now, and to the extent we can help them with their initiatives we’re doing that. We’re also trying to do that internally with our own company. We’ve modified our wash chemicals to be more environmentally friendly. I think it’s important that we do be good corporate citizens and do what we can do to help in these situations. So we’re trying to do a lot in energy conservation which not only will help costs but obviously will also help minimize the use of energy. So I think every company needs to look at what they can do and see if they can do things that are economically beneficial.
Greg Halter - Great Lakes Review: And Wyndham I presume is a direct sale customer?
William C. Gale: Yes. Obviously as a hotel chain, they primarily are purchase uniforms from us but this new product that we’ve developed with them or are developing with them potentially has the capability of being laundered more in an industrial process as opposed to in a dry cleaning process. That’s one of the things that we’re going for. So this could present more of a rental opportunity for us if we can get this thing rolling.
Greg Halter - Great Lakes Review: Any differential on the cost on this versus regular?
William C. Gale: Greg, I really don’t know. I’m not familiar enough with the details of that.
Operator: Our next question comes from Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co.
Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co.: You said earlier in the call I believe that your bad debt you felt comfortable that you were conservatively reserved there. I saw DSOs creep up a bit. Could you just give us a feel of how confident you are there? What are you hearing from customers at 60, 90 day delinquents? How are those metrics tracking, just so we can get a better feel there?
William C. Gale: As some of you know and I think you do, we are very, very conservative and we require starting to reserve for a receivable once it’s 30 days past due and once it gets 60 days past due we even reserve more to the point where as Mike said most of it is fully reserved at 90 days past due. And the whole reason we do that is to keep the focus of our operating people that are spread of course all over the country on the need to collect the money for the work that they’re performing. It is a focus that hopefully our operating people will do and we’ll continue to monitor the collections. What we have seen over the last couple of months is certainly a tendency on the part of many of our customers to just be slower in the payment of their receivables and as a result of that we are reserving accordingly. Now I will tell you that the vast majority of our customers are relatively small-type companies. We do not have any significant receivables sitting out there from a major customer that we need to worry about. That’s not the case. I think what you are seeing or what we are seeing is that all businesses today are doing everything they can to try to figure out how to conserve cash, how to reduce costs and they’re using their vendors to the extent they can to try to help finance a little bit of their business. Now we’ve got leverage on that and obviously we’re not going to allow a customer to continue to build up a receivable and provide services if they’re not paying. So I have no concerns that we’re going to see a significant increase in write-offs and I would hope that as things stabilize a bit we’ll get back to our more traditional 40-day DSO outstanding. I think this is hopefully just a temporary situation.
Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co.: Just more broadly for the upcoming quarter, any one-time items or things we should be thinking about that haven’t come up?
William C. Gale: No. Not that I can foresee.
Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co.: Finally, if you could give us an update on the international initiatives that you have going and just any progress there; is that something you’re going to speed up or perhaps just your overall take currently?
William C. Gale: As I mentioned earlier to the question, I’d say activity has picked up because we made the announcement that we were wanting to work with some of our North American customers especially in the hospitality industry to help them expand outside of North America, and we’re continuing to discuss a way to do that with them. We have picked up additional sales activity albeit it’s relatively insignificant to the total in Macao and Hong Kong as we service our gaming customers that have now built facilities in Macao. We also have looked at some opportunities in Latin America with regard to some direct sale efforts, and we’ve got some things going there. And we continue to evaluate acquisition opportunities in document management throughout the European area including the UK. At this point we have nothing to announce but we have people working on it, looking at things and we just want to be sure that we don’t make a bad investment. So as we always have been, we’re very cautious on that. But I’m hopeful that we will be able to expand a bit more outside of North America, that some of these things will come to fruition here in the not-too-distant future. With that said, keep in mind that we do not anticipate having a material or significant amount of revenue outside of North America in the near term. This is going to be a gradual build up. Some of it will be being pulled by our customers and others will be initiatives like we did when we bought the company in the Netherlands about a year ago.
Michael L. Thompson: And likewise we don’t see a big infusion of capital. Most of this that we’re talking about are small businesses from a shredding standpoint or a direct sale business where it’s more sourcing.
Operator: Our next question comes from Shawn Barnes - Edward Jones.
Shawn Barnes - Edward Jones: I was wondering, given the economic environment in combination with the sales force initiatives, have you seen a change in your mix of business in terms of your new business with customers from an industry perspective?
Michael L. Thompson: We have seen a change in our mix of customers over time mainly as manufacturing companies have moved offshore. Certainly as we’ve sold more products and services across the breadth of our company, the uniform base is coming down but as far as mix within that there’s certainly more of a move to the service economy so to speak and consumer facing type customers. But not dramatic over the last six months to a year.
William C. Gale: Shawn, I don’t think it’s any different. I think it’s kind of the trend that we’ve been seeing for the last four or five years probably.
Shawn Barnes - Edward Jones: You mentioned the headcount controls. I was just wondering if you could give us a little bit more color in terms of where you’re looking to really implement that plan?
William C. Gale: We are looking across the board. We look at of course all of our G&A areas to make sure that what we are doing is of value to the company. So we’re looking at initiatives there. We’re doing things in our IT, information technology, area to improve productivity of our people and therefore reduce the overhead of G&A. The sales structure, I think we mentioned at the last call. The organizational structure we had in place for the new Project One Team initiative. We’ve reassessed that and tweaked that a bit such that we don’t need to have as much of a management structure as we once thought we would have. In all of our facilities, we’re evaluating the jobs that people are doing to make sure that they continue to add value to our customers. Nothing goes unturned. Everything is being looked at to ensure that it has value added and that it is something that the customer sees and is willing to pay for or meets compliance criteria that as a company we’re obligated to perform.
Michael L. Thompson: And we’ve really seen that leverage across all areas. We haven’t seen just corporate overhead go down or delivery or what have you. We’ve seen some improvement in most of our labor lines because of that.
Shawn Barnes - Edward Jones: One last thing. I might have missed this in terms of housekeeping. In the direct business, what were the organic sales?
William C. Gale: Organic growth for the uniform direct sale was the same as their growth which is 0.4%.
Operator: Our next question comes from Michel Morin - Merrill Lynch.
Michel Morin - Merrill Lynch: On the DSO front, are we as close as the top or highest that you’ve ever seen at 44 days? It seems as though it might be. Am I right on that?
William C. Gale: In probably the last couple of years Michel since you’ve been monitoring us, you probably are right we’re near the top. But I can recall back five or six or seven years ago it wasn’t unusual to have 44 or 48 days DSO.
Michel Morin - Merrill Lynch: So it potentially could stay or maybe even increase a little bit. And what about bad debt? When you look at the 20 basis point impact you just had overall in terms of where you’re reserved today, how does that compare to the worst of the last downturn?
William C. Gale: I can’t recall exactly but I’d say it’s still better than it was probably in the last big downturn.
Michel Morin - Merrill Lynch: So it’s reasonable to think that these two things could still be a little bit of a drag if the economy remains a little bit soft here?
William C. Gale: It could. Absolutely. If the economy remains soft or it gets very, very soft, it’s going to have an impact on us. But again I think we’re a little bit protected on that from many other companies in that we’re providing a service that is necessary and needed, and we often are able to use that as a clout to get paid before maybe some other people get paid.
Michel Morin - Merrill Lynch: Finally, in terms of the document management growth rate which organically it slowed from 30% to 25%, is this just the law of large numbers starting to impact you or was the economy a factor here?
Michael L. Thompson: I think it’s mainly the paper price had an impact to some degree. We had one less workday. And then there is some law of big numbers. And again that business is not significantly large at this point in time. It’s certainly getting to be a larger business but you do have some fluctuations quarter-to-quarter that can occur. But I think when you take the other pieces into consideration, we still feel very positive on that business and believe that the growth rates in the mid-20s to maybe 30 are possible and sustainable.
Michel Morin - Merrill Lynch: And just to clarify, you said the workday.
Michael L. Thompson: The workday would have been adjusted for.
Operator: And it appears that that is all the questions that we have at this time, so I’ll turn the call back over to Mr. Gale for any additional or closing remarks.
William C. Gale: Thank you again for joining us tonight and we appreciate your interest especially in light of this week’s upheaval in the markets. I just would leave you with a couple of thoughts. Cintas is generating a lot of strong cash, our businesses are very solid, and we’ve got a great balance sheet. So we’ll weather this upheaval very well and I hope all of you all are able to do the same. Thank you again. We look forward to speaking with you during the week of December 15 we anticipate when we report our second quarter results.

===== 2008 Q4  (2008-07-15 17:00:00) =====
Executives:  William Gale – Sr. VP Finance & CFO Michael Thompson – VP & Treasurer

Operator: Good day everyone and welcome to the Cintas quarterly earnings results conference call. At this time I would like to turn the call over to Mr. William Gale, Senior Vice President of Finance and Chief Financial Officer; please go ahead sir.
William Gale: Good afternoon and thank you for joining us to hear about Cintas’ fourth quarter of fiscal 2008.  Despite the pressure of increasing energy prices and a sluggish US economy we are pleased to announce that Cintas achieved its 39th consecutive year of growth in sales and profit. For the year revenues increased 6.2% to a record $3.9 billion and earnings per diluted share were $2.15, an increase of 3% over the amount in fiscal 2007. In the fourth quarter total company revenues increased over 6% on a comparable work day basis. Earnings per diluted share in the fourth quarter were $0.58 compared to $0.57 last year. Last year’s fourth quarter results included a $6.2 million pre-tax benefit from the termination of a forward interest swap that increased last year’s earnings per share by approximately $0.02.5. Excluding this unusual item the earnings per share growth for this year’s fourth quarter compared to last year was over 6%.  Joining me today is Michael Thompson, Cintas’ Vice President and Treasurer. After Michael and I provide some additional commentary on the quarter we will then open the call to questions.  Despite the continuing impact of rising energy prices the company’s total gross margin was 42.9%, the same as last year. Energy costs for the fourth quarter were over 4% of revenues, versus 3.4% in the prior year’s fourth quarter. For the total year energy costs were approximately 3.6% versus 3.3% for the entire fiscal 2007. We also did experience higher energy costs as we moved through our quarter which has increased even further so far this fiscal year.  We are also seeing increases in other costs such as in hangers and capital equipment. While we are attempting to pass on these increased costs through price increases, the sluggish economy and the aggressive prices being offered by our competitors continues to make passing on such price increases difficult. Our financial condition continues to be very strong. We are generating substantial cash flow and keeping our debt capacity available for opportunities that may arise for additional acquisitions, share buybacks or more rapid expansion throughout the world.  Our view of fiscal 2009 is tempered by the continuing pressure of increased energy and other commodity items as well as a deteriorating economy. We anticipate that these conditions will persist throughout the year. However despite these difficulties we believe that Cintas will grow both its top and bottom lines. As a result we are setting our initial guidance for fiscal 2009 to call for revenues in the range of $4.1 billion to $4.2 billion and earnings per diluted share of $2.22 to $2.30.  The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a Safe Harbor from civil litigation for forward-looking statements. This conference call contains forward-looking statements that reflect the company’s current views as to future events and financial performance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ materially from those we may discuss. I refer you to the discussion on these points contained in our filings with the SEC.  Now I would like to turn the call over to Michael Thompson for further discussion of our results. 
Michael Thompson: Thank you William and good evening everyone. Total revenues were $1.01 billion for the quarter, a 4.7% increase over the $964 million reported for the fourth quarter of last year. However when adjusted for having one less work day in this year’s fourth quarter as compared to last year’s, revenue growth was 6.3%. Total company internal growth was 5.2% during the fourth quarter and 4.6% for the year. As a planning note for next year, each quarter in fiscal 2009 will have 65 work days. As such there will be one less work day in fiscal year 2009; 260 versus the 261 work days in fiscal 2008. The first quarter of fiscal 2009 will have one less work day then the first quarter of fiscal 2008 which had 66 work days. All other quarters will be the same with 65 work days in each.  We classify our businesses into four reportable operating segments; rental uniforms and ancillary products, uniform direct sales, first aid, safety and fire protection services and document management services. Uniform direct sales, first aid, safety and fire protection services and document management services are combined and presented as other services on the face of the income statement. Detail for these operating segments is provided in the supplemental segment data included with the release.  The rental uniforms and ancillary products operating segments consists of the rental and servicing of uniforms and other garments, mat, mops, shop towels and other related items. Our restroom and hygiene products and services are also included within this segment. Rental revenues were $711.7 million for the quarter compared to $696.8 million in the fourth quarter last year. When adjusted for one less work day this represents a 3.7% increase over the fourth quarter of last fiscal year. Factoring out acquisitions made over the last 12 months, our rental organic growth rate was 3.6% for the fourth quarter and 3.4% for the year. The fourth quarter internal growth rate represents a slight decrease from our third quarter rental organic growth rate of 3.8%. The difficult economic environment is certainly affecting our customers.  Our lost business and ad-stop metrics continue to deteriorate through the fourth quarter as our customers reduced headcount and closed locations. This deterioration caused our revenue results to be toward the low end of our fiscal 2008 revenue guidance. On a positive note, new business results continue to be in line with our expectations. Despite the difficult economic environment we continue to have success in expanding our customer base as we demonstrate the value of our products and services.  In addition to offset increased fuel prices, we were able to obtain some price increases from our customers during the second half of the year. However we continue to experience very competitive pricing pressure within our customer base, most notably as contracts reach renewal. Our uniform direct sales operating segment incorporates our national accounts sales division which direct sells uniforms, brand and promotional products and other related products to national and large regional customers and our direct sale catalogue which direct sells uniforms and related products primarily to local customers who also rent products from us. The uniform direct sales segment grew 6.7% for the fourth quarter on a work day adjusted basis. Organic growth for the fourth quarter was also 6.7%. This growth represented a significant improvement from the third quarter when uniform direct sales growth was actually a negative 0.7%. The revenue improvement in the fourth quarter brought uniform direct sales revenue growth for the year to 3.2% for both total and organic growth.  The fourth quarter revenue improvement was in both national account division sales and in our direct sale catalogue with both achieving similar growth percentage results. As we have mentioned in the past our direct sale business is a choppier business then our other services which have a more regular delivery cycle and buying pattern. Customers within the direct sale business have the ability to accelerate or delay purchases based on economic conditions. Through the current difficult economic environment we have done a good job in retaining these customers and being flexible to their needs.  As we mentioned in a recent press release our national account sales division is beginning to focus more on international opportunities. In the past we have assisted certain global customers in their opening of certain hotels and cruise lines around the world. As more and more of our customers expand operations internationally the opportunity for the international expansion of our direct sale business has grown. Given our size and global sourcing capabilities we are now in a position to provide support to these current customers in strategic international markets and to expand our customer base in those markets as well. In conjunction with this expansion we have changed the name of our national accounts sales division to global accounts and strategic markets. While we believe there are significant long-term uniform direct sale international opportunities the short-term expected revenues and the initial investment required to drive those revenues are not yet material to Cintas in total.  Our third operating segment is first aid, safety and fire protection services, in this business we sell and deliver first aid, safety products and automatic defibrillators to our customers. We also provide safety training to their employees. Within fire protection we install, inspect, repair and recharge portable fire extinguishers and sprinkler systems. We also provide and service emergency lighting systems and kitchen fire suppression systems.  We are the largest on-site provider of first aid and safety products in North America and the second largest provider of fire protection services. During the quarter revenues within our first aid, safety and fire protection services operating segment grew 6.7% when adjusted for work days. On an organic basis this segment grew 5.3% which was the same as third quarter internal growth. As with our other businesses general economic conditions continue to cause a headwind in this business.  For the year first aid, safety and fire grew 11.4% in total and 6.1% on an organic basis. The first aid and safety portion of this segment provided double-digit organic growth for the year however our fire protection business suffered throughout the year due to pressure on fire installation sales, lower then anticipated recurring service revenue and difficult year-over-year comparables. Overall our fourth quarter revenue results in this division were comparable to those of our third quarter.  We continue to evaluate and make strategic acquisitions within this operating segment with a focus on expanding the geographic coverage of our fire protection service business in order to become a national provider of this service.  Our document management services operating segment is comprised mainly of document shredding services although we do have storage and imaging capabilities. Revenues within this operating segment continue to grow at a rapid rate. Fourth quarter revenues for the document management operating segment grew 53.8% as compared to 71.2% in the third quarter on a comparable work day basis. Internal growth for the segment was 30% down from approximately 40% in the third quarter.  As mentioned in prior earnings calls organic growth over the past year has been positively impacted by increased shredded paper prices which began to climb in January of 2007. The price of recycled paper stabilized over the last few months which caused a slowing in our fourth quarter organic growth rate. Excluding the effect of paper prices our shredding business grew approximately 30% during fiscal 2008 on an organic basis.  Despite current general economic conditions and the size of our shredding business we expect to continue to grow over 20% on an organic basis excluding any effect from paper prices. In addition, we service customers in over 85 of the top 100 markets in the United States and Canada and have become a national provider of this service. We continue to focus on acquisitions within this segment in order to gain access to the remaining large markets and also to supplement existing operations.  We continue to be pleased with the results of our document management business in The Netherlands. While small it is meeting our expectations and we are gaining valuable experience in running this international business. Over the last 10 years Cintas has undergone significant change transforming from predominantly a uniform rental company to a full fledged business services conglomerate.  Ten years ago total company revenue was less then $1 billion and approximately 70% of that revenue was from uniform rental. For fiscal 2008 our revenue breakdown was as follows: uniform rental is 39%; dust control which is mainly entrance mats is 15%; restroom supply and cleaning is 7%; shop towels are 5%; linen which is not tablecloths and bed sheets but rather is mainly garments such as lab coats and aprons is 6%; this brings total uniform rental and ancillary products to 72% of total company revenues; uniform direct sales 13%; first aid, safety and fire protection services is 10% and document management is 5%. As you can see uniform rental is now only 39% of our total revenue and uniforms in total, with rental and direct sales are only 52% of our $3.9 billion of revenue. In fact today over 50% of our customers do not rent or buy uniforms from us. We expect this trend to continue as our emerging businesses grow at a faster rate then our uniform business. We will continue to evaluate and implement new business products and services when appropriate financial and strategic parameters are met and also to create the foundation for international expansion. Fourth quarter total company gross margin was 42.9%, the same as last year’s fourth quarter and an 80 basis point improvement over this year’s third quarter total company gross margin. The total fiscal year 2008 company gross margin of 42.7% was the same as that for fiscal 2007. Gross margin improvement in uniform direct sales and first aid, safety and fire throughout the year overcame margin pressure caused predominantly by increased energy costs. Energy costs reached a historical high hitting 4% of revenue for the fourth quarter. This was a 60 basis point increase over the fourth quarter of last year and a 30 basis point increase from the third quarter. Traditionally energy costs would remain flat or decrease from the third to the fourth quarter due to lower consumption levels as we move out of the winter months. This significant increase in energy pricing did not allow this to happen in this year’s fourth quarter.  Our rental gross margins were 43.9% of revenue for the fourth quarter, an 80 basis point decline from the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 but a 50 basis point improvement over this year’s third quarter. The 80 basis point margin decrease from the prior year was predominantly a result of the 70 basis point increase in energy costs over last year’s fourth quarter. Our cost of hangers has also increased as a result of large commodity cost increases.  Rental gross margin improved 50 basis points from the third quarter despite rental division energy costs increasing 50 basis points. Leveraging of service and delivery labor, improvements in sourcing and logistics costs and the flow through benefit of price increases were the main drivers of this margin improvement. Other services gross margin improved to 40.5%, a 200 basis point improvement over the fourth quarter of last year and a 160 basis point improvement over the third quarter. Other services margins continue to improve as the higher margin first aid and safety and document management businesses becomes a larger portion of the base. Additionally despite increased energy costs both of these businesses continue to better leverage their cost structures as they gain scale. During the fourth quarter a combination of sales mix and improved revenue generation in uniform direct sale also drove margins higher covering more fixed costs.  Selling and administrative expenses were 27.7% of revenue, an increase of 90 basis points over last year’s fourth quarter but a 30 basis point improvement over this year’s third quarter. During the fourth quarter of last year we exited a forward starting swap that we have put in place in anticipation of a debt refinancing for a new issuance of debt with a 30 year maturity. When the decision was made during last year’s fourth quarter to refinance this debt through the issuance of commercial paper the swap was terminated and a credit of $6.2 million or 65 basis points was made to administrative expense.  Improvements in Workers’ Compensation costs in this year’s fourth quarter were offset by an increase in medical costs. Selling expense increased 30 basis points over the prior year fourth quarter reflecting the investment in the new sales organization. We have now reached the one year anniversary of the full investment and expect to see leverage in selling costs on a [perspective] basis. The 30 basis point improvement from the third quarter was due mainly to an improvement in administrative labor as we aggressively managed our overhead cost structure and an improvement in receivable collections.  An increase in medical costs was offset by the seasonal improvement in payroll taxes as payroll taxes reset during our third quarter each year. Net interest costs this quarter of $12.1 million or 1.2% of revenue remained relatively flat as compared to both the prior year fourth quarter and this year’s third quarter. Our effective tax rate was 36.5% for the quarter and 36.8% for the year. The improvement was due to reduction in reserve requirements as required under FASB interpretation number 48, accounting for uncertainty in income taxes, an interpretation of FASB statement number 109 or more commonly called FIN 48. For the quarter net income was $89.7 million and earnings per diluted share was $0.58 reflecting operational improvements and the impact of share purchases made earlier in the fiscal year. Our balance sheet continues to be strong. Our current ratio is 3.5 to 1 at May 31st and our equity has improved to a record $2.3 billion. Our cash increased $31 million from May 31st, 2007. The majority of this increase is due to a balance sheet reclassification we made during the current quarter. In the past we have netted outstanding checks against daily cash holdings at our depository bank.  Due to a transfer of certain cash holdings to another bank we no longer have a complete right of offset within cash and cash equivalents on our balance sheet as the cash and the outstanding checks are with different depository institutions. This reclassification increased cash and cash equivalents on the balance sheet by approximately $28 million and likewise increased accounts payable $28 million for the outstanding checks. When adjusted for this amount cash and marketable securities in total increased $8 million. Cash generated in excess of daily needs is used to pay down outstanding commercial paper. Our marketable securities are all held in Canada. These funds which were generated from operations there are held in short-term conservative government investments and are currently being held for investment opportunities outside of the United States.  DSOs on accounts receivable were 41 days which is a slight increase over last year. We are actively managing our accounts receivable in order to lessen any potential impact from current economic conditions. New goods inventory levels increased $7 million over May 31st, 2007. The increase is due to a combination of increased inventory requirements for the rollout of our direct sale catalogue and the opening of a new facility services distribution center. This new facility has been designed to improve logistics and enhance the cost structure of our facility services business.  Long-term debt at May 31, 2008 was $944 million. Total debt as a percentage of total book capitalization was 29.5%. Our cash flow remains strong with cash provided by operations totaling $545 million and free cash flow of $354 million. Capital expenditures are $190 million for the year of which $141 million was invested in our rental division; $31 million was invested in document management, $12 million in first aid, safety and fire and $6 million in uniform direct sales.  Approximately 30% of our CapEx is considered maintenance CapEx. For next year, fiscal 2009 we expect capital expenditures to be between $180 million and $200 million. In fiscal 2008 we spent $112 million on strategic acquisitions, mainly of first aid, safety and fire protection services and document management businesses. Historically during more difficult economic environments acquisition opportunities have increased. Our current pipeline is healthy and we have maintained our liquidity in order to be flexible if opportunities arise. We did not purchase any shares under our share buyback program during the fourth quarter, as we continue to balance purchases with cash flow generation and usage. Given the current economic environment and potential acquisition opportunities we have been maintaining liquidity and debt capacity or dry powder. For the year we purchased 5.2 million shares of stock. Since the program’s inception we have bought back 19.4 million shares. We continue to have $228 million in remaining authorization under the existing program. During the fourth quarter we paid a $71 million annual dividend that we announced and accrued during the third quarter. This represented an 18% increase in our dividend and demonstrated our continued commitment to our shareholders. This is our 25th consecutive year of increasing our annual dividend payment which is every year we have been public. As mentioned by William, and in our earnings release our guidance for fiscal 2009 calls for revenue to be between $4.1 billion and $4.2 billion and earnings per diluted share to between $2.22 and $2.30.  We expect earnings to improve as we progress through the year as we gain additional selling cost leverage and receive the impact of recent cost containment initiatives. Also please note that for fiscal 2009 there is one less work day in the first quarter and for the total fiscal year. Also included in this guidance is our expectation that our effective tax rate will be approximately 37.1% for fiscal 2009. Please note that as required under FIN 48 income tax reserve requirements will vary quarter to quarter.  We expect our effective tax rate to be higher in our first and second quarters and then come back in line during the third quarter mainly due to the timing of state and federal tax reserve requirements. Thank you and now William and I will be happy to answer your questions. 
Operator:  (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Kartik Mehta - FTN Midwest Research
Kartik Mehta - FTN Midwest Research: I wanted to get your thoughts on the organic growth assumptions you have for the uniform business for FY09, would you anticipate that it’ll range the same as it was in fourth quarter or would you anticipate any type of changes for FY09?
William Gale: We would anticipate right now based on our plan and our view of the economy that it will improve slightly but not significantly over what we experienced in the latter half of 2008.
Kartik Mehta - FTN Midwest Research: What about energy costs, obviously it seems as though energy costs have increased at least in this quarter, did your guidance assume energy costs stay stable or are you anticipating an increase there as well?
William Gale: The guidance that we provided assumes that energy costs that we’ve experienced pretty much in the latter part of May and June will remain at that level throughout fiscal 2009. 
Kartik Mehta - FTN Midwest Research: As you maybe look longer term, maybe over the next couple of years, is the uniform business in your opinion, can it get back to high single-digit organic growth or are we in a situation where you think organic growth is more mid single-digits?
William Gale: At this point I still am of the belief and I think our management is here too that ultimately it can get back up to the high single-digits however in the short run I think the mid single-digit growth is probably what we’re going expect. We’re continuing to see the impact on our traditional uniform rental customers being relatively significant and our people don’t see that changing at all for the next nine to 12 months. As a result of that I think the guidance that we gave you assumes that we will achieve somewhere in the mid single-digit growth in the rental business as we go forward but we still believe on our strategic plan basis that as we look out the next few years that we can get back up to the high single-digits without any question. 
Kartik Mehta - FTN Midwest Research: I want to know if you could maybe talk about trends you witnessed during the quarter, and maybe just from a big picture standpoint what you witnessed the first two months of this quarter, do you believe that things are improving, staying the same or deteriorating from an overall economic picture for the business? 
William Gale: Looking at our customers we saw a deterioration—we saw deterioration beginning last November but it accelerated I would say as we moved through our fourth quarter which ended May 31 and has kind of remained at that level throughout the first six weeks of this fiscal year. I don’t think it’s gotten significantly worse but it hasn’t gotten any better in primarily the garment business. Now on the other hand I would tell you that our emerging businesses still seem to be performing very well and we haven’t really seen any deterioration there to speak of. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Andrea Wirth – Robert W. Baird
Andrea Wirth – Robert W. Baird: If you could maybe just talk a little bit about just your view of the cycle in general, it sounds like things did deteriorate throughout the quarter, maybe at least maybe pause here, but one of your peers recently kind of mentioned that they thought just given the deterioration they were seeing that this may be approximating 2002, 2003, just curious what your views are on this current cycle and if this is looking like others we’ve seen in the past?
William Gale: I think it looks more like probably what we were seeing in the early 90s. The 2002, 2003 situation was a pretty quick down and then right back up. I don’t anticipate we’re going to go right back up. I think this is a little more prolonged and so therefore I’m anticipating that we’re going to have relatively sluggish economy throughout our fiscal 2009.
Andrea Wirth – Robert W. Baird: Just more in terms of your ability to actually maybe see some improvement in fiscal 2009 in the rental growth despite seeing some deterioration in employment markets, I guess is this just more a function of the Project One really just still gaining even more momentum or maybe kind of talk a little bit more about why you think you should be able to at least hold that growth steady and actually improve it?
William Gale: Well I think the major reason is that because of Project One Team we are seeing good new business. That has not deteriorated. As we anticipated our new business results have continued to be pretty good and actually have improved over the course of fiscal 2008. Therefore that will offset this sluggishness that we’re seeing with existing customers and that’s what gives us comfort to say that we’ll be able to grow the business next year albeit at not as high a rate as we would like it to be. 
Andrea Wirth – Robert W. Baird: And then along the lines of new business just curious what you’re seeing as far as interest from no programmers or customers, who don’t have a uniform rental program at this time, is the economy impacting interest in general or is there still relatively high interest from that level?
William Gale: Its still high interest; its still very good. I think that the value proposition is even more compelling today then it has been in the past because when you can talk about the fact that we can provide this uniform rental program to an employee of a customer for basically $1.25 to $1.50 a day and these poor people are paying $4 and $5 a gallon of gas, it begins to look like a tremendous value and therefore I think that is why another reason why our new business efforts continue to be pretty strong. 
Michael Thompson: Also when you look at that it eliminates an initial investment on their part, they’re going to purchase uniforms up front versus a rental program. They have a significantly higher investment day one and if they’re having difficulties with cash flow certainly a rental program is advantageous to them. 
Andrea Wirth – Robert W. Baird: In terms of energy I wonder if you could be more specific about what you did actually roll through in terms of it is actual price increases, a surcharge, and have you really kind of already seen the benefit of that or is there still more to come in the next quarter or two from the recent actions?
William Gale: As you may recall the way we handle our price increases in the rental business are primarily on the anniversary dates of the contracts. We don’t have a specific energy charge so what we’re doing is as those contract prices come up for the opportunity to increase prices, we’re going to our customers and doing that because of the significant increase in costs that we have had. So that’s the rental business. In the other businesses such as document management, first aid and safety, we’re going in as opportunities arise to offset our cost increases in energy with price increases in those particular businesses. I think you’re going to continue to see some price increases rolling through just the way the nature of our businesses work and how contracts come up and obviously if energy costs would stabilize we would begin to see a little bit of margin enhancement on that. 
Andrea Wirth – Robert W. Baird: I think you had mentioned particularly on renewals was where you were seeing increased competition in terms of pricing, I was just wondering if you can kind of address the difference there because I guess are your peers also doing some energy things in terms of pricing or I guess just trying to understand the contradiction there. 
William Gale: Well what’s happening is we’re seeing our competition be very aggressive at the end of our contracts to basically get our customers business. So they’re coming in at very low prices and we’re going to have to beat that competition at these contract renewals. What they’re doing with energy I don’t really know because it seems to be somewhat different in different parts of the country so I don’t know if they have a consistent approach or not. But they certainly are being especially the big players, are being very, very aggressive and offering extremely low prices in order to get business. 
Andrea Wirth – Robert W. Baird: And then document shredding, the margin very impressive there this quarter, just wondering if there’s anything in there making it a little bit higher then normal and essentially is this rate sustainable?
William Gale: Well it is sustainable as long as paper prices remain at these levels. As Michael mentioned in his comments we began to see an increase in the value of recycled paper back in January of 2007 and it really peeked probably around December, 2007 January, 2008, now it’s moderated a little bit but expectations are that it will probably stay at these levels. So unless there’s a dramatic fall off these margins are fairly sustainable. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Ashwin Shirvaikar – Citigroup
Ashwin Shirvaikar – Citigroup: You had a pretty good cash flow performance this quarter and could you go through again in terms of using your free debt capacity if you will, the order in which you would take a look at share buyback, international expansion, acquisition opportunities and other things you might be doing.
William Gale: Well I don’t think I can tell you how they rate, obviously we factor all of those together as we looked at the availability of cash and what our debt capacity is, acquisitions aren’t just looming out there, they come sporadically. We’ll just take an approach to look at our cash on a continual basis, look at our opportunities and put the money where we feel we can get the best return long-term for our shareholders. 
Ashwin Shirvaikar – Citigroup: It just sort of seems odd that you wouldn’t be doing a buyback at $25, $26 a share.
William Gale: Well as I said, it is constantly being reviewed and we have amounts remaining under the program but we’ll continue to keep you updated on a quarterly basis as to what we’re going to do. 
Ashwin Shirvaikar – Citigroup: In terms of the quarterly performance the stock compensation seemed to be a fairly low number in the quarter, is there anything worth noting there?
William Gale: Not really, you always have to kind of adjust your assumptions as you go forward but there’s nothing unusual.
Ashwin Shirvaikar – Citigroup: In terms of the first aid business, the fire protection side of it, are the problems there behind you getting better, any update on what the strategic ideas you’re looking at might be?
Michael Thompson: Certainly we are now a year out now from the difficulties with the year-over-year comparisons and that we’ve been a year out, that business is still suffering a little bit from the installation side but certainly we believe at least from a comparable standpoint it’ll be a little easier to see next year. The fire protection business we continue to look at the service and focus on the service side of the business versus the installation side, so we’re still going through some changes within that division to ensure that we’re focusing on the recurring revenue stream. That is what we’ve always wanted to begin with and so we expect improvement going forward. 
Ashwin Shirvaikar – Citigroup: In terms of the operating margin that you expect a range that you expect for fiscal 2009, would you say that there’s enough going on in terms of cost control and things of that nature that you can offset any pressure you might have on the gross margin side because of higher fuel and so on?
William Gale: Well I think as we pointed out our assumptions right now are that fuel costs will remain at these levels that we’ve seen over the last six to eight weeks. Obviously if fuel prices doubled that would be a very difficult thing for us to overcome. But we don’t expect that at this point. So I would say that as long as its modest we probably can overcome it but the more substantial it becomes the more difficult it is to do anything in the short run but I think its important to keep in mind that fuel prices could go down too. There could be an opportunity for us especially in light of all the things that I think we have undertaken to improve margins in other areas that we may see an improvement in the margins. 
Michael Thompson: We certainly believe that the cost containment initiatives we’ve put in place over the last couple of quarters will certainly provide us some additional leverage going forward, certainly difficult to predict fuel prices though. 
Ashwin Shirvaikar – Citigroup: But in terms of just looking at the margin expectation, assuming things stay roughly where they are do you think that operating margins can come in flat to slightly better?
William Gale: Yes. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Scott Schneeberger – Oppenheimer
Scott Schneeberger – Oppenheimer: Following up on an earlier question as far as new programmers what category verticals are you seeing that in, just looking for the areas of strength now that you’re pursuing?
William Gale: Well we’re pursuing it primarily in the service sector. We’re looking at opportunities in any companies that have their employees in the public view be it a retail environment, be it delivery, home repair or things of that nature. So that’s our primary focus at this time trying to take advantage of where the economy is at least stable or growing. 
Scott Schneeberger – Oppenheimer: I assume usual or obvious suspects where you’re seeing deterioration and lost business or ad stop, any verticals or categories that would surprise us there?
William Gale: No I don’t think anything would surprise you, it tends to be the manufacturing environment, the big distribution type environment that service the manufacturing operations. We’ve seen deterioration in the restaurant and hospitality business and that’s impacted some of our facility services business because there have been more failures there. That may be the only thing that maybe you wouldn’t have picked up on. 
Scott Schneeberger – Oppenheimer: Sounds like you’re hopeful that we get some improving comparisons on energy going forward, any updated thoughts on hedging or hedging strategy going forward?
William Gale: We continue to look at it. At this point in time we really don’t anticipate that it’s anything we’re going to go into in any big way/
Scott Schneeberger – Oppenheimer: You’ve been in press release recently about looking at going into a global operations, global accounts, thoughts on that, building or buying and it looks like you’re looking at very disparit parts of the world to approach, could you just give us a little bit more about the strategic approach there? 
William Gale: First of all I think everyone needs to understand that we have always done a little bit of international, it’s been on a very minor basis. But for example, one of our big customers, very high end hotel has utilized us throughout the world as they opened up a new facility in Asia or South America, wherever and we’ve often gone with them and put uniforms on all their people there. I think when the last big ship that was built in England, The Queen Mary, cruised out a few years ago from London; we were the ones who basically provided all the uniforms for those workers on that ship. So we’ve always been doing that.  Now I think the thing that we are ready and prepared to do is to respond to many of our customers’ requests that have been big customers of ours here in North America, people like Marriott, Starwood, Hilton, etc., who are being very aggressive and building facilities outside of North America and have asked us to help them with their uniform needs. We now feel we are capable of doing that and so that is the main focus that we have with this international expansion. The other aspect of that would be in terms of the gaming industry. In Macau there has been a significant build up of casino business in Macau, I guess they now even surpass Las Vegas in gambling revenue. And many of the big players there are major customers in Las Vegas so they’ve asked us to come over there and we are going to help them do that.  The other aspect of our international is what we’ve talked about throughout this year and that is the document management business. In Europe we see a lot of opportunities there. We did buy the company last year. We have learned that business. We are now looking at additional acquisitions and we see that coming about assuming we can get things for the right price here over the course of the next 12 to 24 months. Those couple of things that I just mentioned are the main focus of international. It doesn’t require a lot investment. It doesn’t require a significant amount of people but it is going to enhance our presence throughout the world for customers that we’ve been servicing here in North America for many years. 
Scott Schneeberger – Oppenheimer: Understanding the global expansion with the existing customers probably does not require extensive further investment but perhaps the acquisition strategy in Europe, would that be sizable? Is it going to be piecemeal here or there or are there sizable targets that you’re pursuing?
William Gale: As far as I can tell in Europe the targets that we would be looking at are relatively small. There are no significant sizable opportunities that we would be interested in Europe in document management at this time. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Michel Morin - Merrill Lynch
Michel Morin - Merrill Lynch: Specifically during the quarter did the ad stop in lost business metrics worsen during the quarter?
Michael Thompson: Yes. 
Michel Morin - Merrill Lynch: On the direct sales front, was there anything unusual that either impacted the top line or the gross margins there?
Michael Thompson: Well the top line certainly was the driver of the gross margin, as you cover more of your fixed cost in that business your margins move up quite a bit. From a top line perspective some of it was a little bit of timing and just with the customers in that business you’re consistently in front of them, you’re consistently selling to them. As we indicated it can be a little spottier of a business in that it can go up and down quarter to quarter. Obviously we were a little lower in Q3 but made it up in Q4. Again that business is a little harder to indicate on a quarter to quarter basis up front.
Michel Morin - Merrill Lynch: And in terms of thinking out to 2009 the gross margin level for the full year is probably the better metric to look at in terms of possibility?
Michael Thompson: Yes. 
Michel Morin - Merrill Lynch: Could you remind us on the SG&A front what the cost containment initiatives are and what your expectations are there?
William Gale: Well cost containment encompasses a lot of things, we are looking at every administrative expense that we incur in the company and trying to determine is it necessary, is it something that we have to do, and can we do it more efficiently? And that involves people as well as travel, supplies, housing, etc. So that’s where our major focus has been. We want to free up as much as we can to increase the top line. Put it into sales and marketing type efforts that will have a return. Looking at MIS or IT projects that could generate a return down the road. So those are the types of things we’re looking at but it just goes back to the [Spartan] approach that Cintas has always tried to follow is look at every cost and make sure that it is necessary and that it is something that’s going to have some value going forward. 
Michel Morin - Merrill Lynch: For the last few years your SG&A line has grown pretty consistently faster then the top line, should we, based on what you’re saying, should we anticipate that maybe in fiscal 2009 that they’re going to grow at the same rate perhaps or even maybe you’ll get some leverage on that SG&A?
William Gale: Well actually they’ve grown over this period of time primarily from the S side because of P1T, and some of the regulatory costs that we’ve had associated with stock option expensing, with restricted stock, with the union campaign, with other legal fights. And so barring anything unusual, we know we’re getting leverage now on the Project One Team on the sales side, we’ll continue to show improvement on the G&A side so when you factor out all these additional costs that public companies have had to contend with and that Cintas has had to contend with because of the union fight, I actually think its been quite remarkable that we haven’t had even a higher increase. So as we look forward we don’t have any, hopefully, any of those additional regulatory costs but we’ll have to see what happens, but we certainly should get leverage because we’ll continue to grow that top line. 
Michel Morin - Merrill Lynch: Included in that SG&A you’ve got bad debt I assume in there is that something you’ve seen starting to tick up at all?
William Gale: Well as Michael mentioned our DSOs ticked up slightly but our actual bad debt expense declined slightly so we’re seeing a little slower paying but I don’t think we’re seeing any significant increase in the number of actual write-offs that we’re having to incur. 
Michael Thompson: Write-offs were up just a little bit for the year not dramatic, so I’d agree with William, nothing significant there. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Gary Bisbee - Lehman Brothers
Gary Bisbee - Lehman Brothers: You mentioned a couple of times that new business is sort of inline with plan and may have gotten a little bit better throughout the year as you’re getting further and further away from the sales [inaudible] can you give us any better sense then that, quantify it or how much has it accelerated?
William Gale: Well we really don’t want to get into that level of detail but it has improved modestly as we went throughout the year and it is pretty much at our expected levels. 
Gary Bisbee - Lehman Brothers: Back in the day that used to be sort of mid teens, I take it--
William Gale: Its still double-digits, I don’t want to get in to the specifics but its double-digits. 
Gary Bisbee - Lehman Brothers: Is a lot of that coming from headcount, the headcount additions you’ve done or are you now further enough into it that you can say that the productivity on a per sales guy basis has actually begun to improve as well? 
Michael Thompson: It’s actually on a per sale rep basis because the headcount that we added was on the management side in that initial investment in the selling organization. It is in productivity and certainly you continue to add reps in the emerging businesses the one thing that this new organization gave us across the board was the opportunity to more aggressively add reps in our emerging businesses to take some opportunities in the new markets we’re entering and adding where appropriate based on the market. 
Gary Bisbee - Lehman Brothers: One of the things you talked about just going back to the Project One Team initiative a year ago was hopefully beginning to drive some more cross sell, is that working, are the sales people feeling like you set up the comp policy right, so that they get a referral that’s meaningful to them, any update on how that’s going and maybe what else is driving the productivity improvement?
William Gale: It’s working very well with regard to the emerging businesses because it’s now giving the sales people in the emerging businesses this huge customer list of Cintas customers. And I would say that its working to a lesser extent though as you go to our traditional uniform rental customers and try to convince them to use some of these other services, they may or may not need them, but there have been some wins and I would say we continue to tweak our compensation programs to make sure we’re getting the behavior that we want and I think that that is just a learning thing as we go through. But yes, we’re pleased with what we’re seeing there. 
Gary Bisbee - Lehman Brothers: You said I think in the prepared remarks that the marketable securities are largely in Canada and you’re keeping it there essentially for international acquisitions, I guess you commented that you didn’t see anything big in Europe, should we be thinking about anywhere else that there might be more medium or larger sized deals or is it going to be more of the same of what you’ve been doing over the last 18 months?
William Gale: I think we recognize that to just bring cash back into the United States from Canada is a very expensive thing so we’re looking at opportunities for using that cash for not just acquisitions but also capital type investments as we see the opportunities in various parts of the world. 
Michael Thompson: To bring back that cash to the United States is a taxable event so it’s been building up there with operations since we started investing in Canada. We’ve now obviously got over $100 million in Canada that we feel we can use for international opportunities and now with the move in both direct sale and also what we’re doing in document management in The Netherlands, we believe it provides us the capital without having to leverage the debt markets to do that. 
Gary Bisbee - Lehman Brothers: I guess the reason I’m asking the question that way is you did $110 million or $112 million of acquisitions this year, you’ve got more then that in cash in Canada today so are we, I’m talking total company acquisitions are you likely to step up the international acquisitions or is the money likely to sit there for awhile?
William Gale: Its very difficult for us to be too specific because we have a lot of different things going on and we don’t want to necessarily show our hand yet of what we’re going to do but let’s just put it this way, that we’re going to find the right opportunities and obviously if we see the chance to make a good acquisition outside of North America that Canadian cash is going to come in very handy in order to do that. 
Michael Thompson: Or if we find that the right opportunity to make an investment not necessarily and acquisition, but to start up either adding some more infrastructure for our direct sale or expanding document management or something else internationally, those funds are available to do that. It could be a combination of the two. 
Gary Bisbee - Lehman Brothers: In terms of the document management business it sounds like you’re in most of the major markets although I still don’t think I’ve seen a truck in New York anywhere but you’re in most of the major markets, how much investment is left to sort of build out the route densities and get more trucks into each market, I guess I’m just trying to understand how that $30 million of CapEx, is that a number that has to keep growing presumably for several years as you keep investing in the business or are we getting to a point where you’ve got reasonably good coverage?
William Gale: Well I think we’ve got a lot of opportunities, even though we may be in 85 of the top 100 markets, doesn’t mean we’re doing as much business as the potential that exists there. So what we would anticipate is that yes, the $30 million expenditure is probably going to grow over time because we’re going to continue to see that revenue go up quite substantially and you’ve got to have the truck to do the revenue—in order to generate the revenue so we anticipate that that business is going to continue to grow at very nice rates. And in order to support that growth obviously we’re going to have to invest the capital in it and therefore it will go up proportionately. 
Gary Bisbee - Lehman Brothers: Was there any major impact we should expect from the fire that we’ve read about that happened recently in one of your facilities or is that--?
William Gale: No there will be no major impact at all. One of the real advantages Cintas has is because of our geographic coverage we were able to shift the business for those customers very quickly into some of our other adjacent facilities and we were able to get uniforms out of our distribution centers that were destroyed in that fire. Obviously there’s adequate insurance coverage for the physical assets. Our customers did not miss a delivery. So it just shows another good reason that customers do business with us because we’re able to react so quickly when we have a problem like that. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Brandt Sakakeeny - Deutsche Bank
Brandt Sakakeeny - Deutsche Bank: On the tax rate, I think you said the first half was higher then the second half, should we assume something like 38% for the first half and maybe 36% for the second half?
Michael Thompson: We expect it to be 37.1% next year for the year, it will be a little higher, I don’t want to get into specifics but certainly I would trend it higher in those ranges for Q1 and Q2 it’ll take—as long as the reserve requirements under FIN 48 remain consistent with where they were this year, you’d see the correction come in Q3 fairly substantially to bring it back down in line at that point in time. 
Brandt Sakakeeny - Deutsche Bank: The extra day that you had in FY08 did that fall in the fourth quarter?
William Gale: It actually fell in the—it was actually in the fourth quarter and then--
Michael Thompson: The extra day was in Q3 but then we were one short in Q4. It was the same number of work days for the year. 
Brandt Sakakeeny - Deutsche Bank: So FY09 will have one fewer work day.
William Gale: And that will be in the first quarter.
Brandt Sakakeeny - Deutsche Bank: So then the 3 8 to 3 6 sequential drop, that’s on a same day basis or does that adjust for the differential in the days?
Michael Thompson: That adjusts for work days. 
Brandt Sakakeeny - Deutsche Bank: Back to the question around margins and the new business growth, I just remember back in 2002, 2003 Karen was always talking about the fact that new business growth was more expensive relative to renewal growth and that in periods where you saw accelerating new business trends, you often saw margin compression. (a) Do I remember that right and (b) as we look out to FY09 if you do in fact assume new business acceleration your flat margin assumption, does that presume then that you’ll get the added leverage on the SG&A line to offset for that higher new business cost?
William Gale: Well first off you’re absolutely right, new business is the most expensive business as long as you continue to provide new garments for your new customers which we always do. You have all that expense of the new garments beginning amortization and you have the sales commission costs, etc. so that is the most expensive. But when we put our plans together for the coming year, we’re very detail oriented and so we are—its basically as we look at margins and new business growth etc. we have factored all that into the guidance that we provided and to the answers to the questions earlier, and so I guess to answer your question is, yes we’re going to have pressure of new business but on the other hand you’re getting additional leverage in your facilities, maybe a higher route capacity and so it balances itself out to where as I said earlier, that we could if energy costs remained constant we could see a slight improvement. So that tells you you’re getting the leverage in some of the other fixed cost areas. 
Michael Thompson: And certainly based on our plan the increased revenues are not dramatic. We’re talking a lower growth rate next year. 
Brandt Sakakeeny - Deutsche Bank: On the balance sheet I just want to make sure I understood, so you said that that sequential increase in the payables was due to the cash, or at least the check payables being held, the offset was the cash and equivalents, is that right on the balance sheet?
Michael Thompson: Yes, in the past you used to net the outstanding checks with depository institution because you had marketable securities and other cash balances there—at the same institution. This year because we switched institutions you don’t have the right of offset so I have the cash so I had to increase the cash balance but now I have the outstanding checks as well. So it was strictly a balance sheet reclass where instead of netting it within cash and cash equivalents and to separate it back out and increase my payables and increase my cash. 
Brandt Sakakeeny - Deutsche Bank: On one other item on the balance sheet I did notice that inventories had declined, or at least grew but at a very low rate, any sort of liquidation there on inventory, is there anything else that would explain that very small increase?
Michael Thompson: No. I’d say overall better management, the dollar went up mainly because of the new facility services distribution center that we just opened up a couple of months ago, but overall I think its just better use of the existing inventory. There was no liquidation. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Greg Halter - Great Lakes Review
Greg Halter - Great Lakes Review: Regarding inventory, have you made any changes to the amortization schedules that you had in place since the last year or fiscal year?
William Gale: No we have not. 
Greg Halter - Great Lakes Review: On the CapEx side any commentary on new plants, either you have in progress currently or expect for 2009 and the retrofits or upgrades you’re going through currently?
William Gale: We’ve got a couple of new plants that are in the construction phase. I think there’s four maybe that we would probably be opening up over the course of fiscal 2009 and that is about it from the plant side. Where we’re seeing the capital being spent is obviously in supporting the truck fleets in the document management business and then just normal maintenance type capital. 
Greg Halter - Great Lakes Review: Regarding your debt, on an average basis what was the average for fiscal 2008 and I don’t know that you can comment on 2009 I guess depending on the fixed versus variable, but if you could comment where you stand on fixed versus variable currently, I would appreciate that. 
Michael Thompson: We have about $163 million in commercial paper currently at May 31st, and the remainder which is about $780 million is in fixed, our current blended rate is about 5.5%. 
William Gale: So what would happen is during the course of fiscal 2009 we would generate sufficient cash to pay off that commercial paper unless we became more aggressive on acquisitions or did share buybacks.
Greg Halter - Great Lakes Review: I haven’t heard much about the unite effort and just wanted to ask and see, I know they’re still out there but what you’re seeing and doing regarding that effort currently?
William Gale: Well we’re doing what we’ve continued to do is try to offset their propaganda. They have been relatively quiet. They show up at one of our facilities now and then distributing flyers. I don’t think their tactics have really changed much. The word is, I can tell you, they continue to make no progress with our partner base. We have less then 400 partners in labor unions right now. I think they’re going to focus on the political front and depending what happens in the elections in November we may see them trying to get their—what they wanted to try to accomplish through the legislatures and potentially the new administration. 
Greg Halter - Great Lakes Review: I know you have suits that you detail in the Qs and Ks and so forth, any updates on any of those particular lawsuits?
William Gale: We’ll be filing our 10-K here by the end of July and I think I can pretty much tell you that you’re not going to see there’s been much changes in the developments in those cases since the Q was filed at the beginning of April. 
Operator: Your final question is a follow-up from the line of Michel Morin - Merrill Lynch
Michel Morin - Merrill Lynch: You mentioned the cost of hangers; I was wondering if you could quantify that a little bit for us? It’s the first time we’ve ever heard you talk about that.
Michael Thompson: It wasn’t a dramatic increase but certainly it was enough that as you look at the increase in gross margin versus last year, the vast majority was in energy costs but there was an increase in hangers, basically the increase in commodity costs and some tariff situations caused that. 
Michel Morin - Merrill Lynch: And how big of a cost is that? 
Michael Thompson: I don’t have it on a percent to sale basis--
William Gale: It was like half of one percent, half of one percent, I just—the reason that we brought that up is just to give you all an indication that we’re beginning to see inflationary pressures in some of our other cost elements. There’s no big other cost elements but that’s one that’s risen fairly dramatically here in the last three to six months.
Michel Morin - Merrill Lynch: Are there any differences in trends between Canada and the US?
William Gale: I would say Canada is pretty good; their economy seems to be relatively strong. We don’t see nearly the ad stops and lost business that we’re seeing in the states. They’ve had, of course—they’ve done pretty well so it’s been a good steady business up there. 
Michel Morin - Merrill Lynch: The distribution center that you opened, that was opened during the quarter?
William Gale: Right at the end of the quarter. 
Michel Morin - Merrill Lynch: And were there any costs associated with that or is it mostly all capitalized?
William Gale: No there were some costs, some start up costs but they weren’t that significant in the whole scheme of things but we feel like they’re going to help improve our efficiency on distribution of our facility services products and ultimately will help lower the cost of that product in our business. 
Michel Morin - Merrill Lynch: So that’s attributable to the rental segment?
William Gale: Yes, its part of the rental segment, right. 
Operator:  At this time we have no further questions; I’d like to turn the program back over to Mr. Gale for any additional or closing comments.
William Gale: Thank you and thank all of you for joining us. We appreciate the interest in Cintas and we look forward to talking to you in September when we discuss our first quarter fiscal 2009 results. Thanks again for joining us.

===== 2008 Q3  (2008-03-19 17:00:00) =====
Executives:  William Gale – Sr. VP & CFO Michael Thompson – Vice President, Treasurer
Analysts:  Kartik Mehta - FTN Midwest Research Michael Schneider - Robert W. Baird Michel Morin - Merrill Lynch Scott Schneeberger – Oppenheimer Gary Bisbee - Lehman Brothers Greg Halter - Great Lakes Review Brandt Sakakeeny - Deutsche Bank 
Operator: Good day everyone and welcome to the Cintas quarterly earnings results conference call. At this time I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Bill Gale, Senior Vice President of Finance and Chief Financial Officer, please go ahead sir.
William Gale: Good evening and welcome to our third quarter fiscal 2008 conference call. We appreciate you joining us this evening. For the quarter ending February 29, 2008 revenue grew at a rate of 8% to $976 million. Earnings per share were $0.53 versus $0.48 a year ago, a 10% increase. Our financial condition continues to remain strong. During the quarter the company sold $300 million of 10-year notes using the proceeds to reduce its commercial paper outstanding and thus freeing up additional capacity in our CPP program if opportunities arise.  At February 29, our debt to capitalization ratio was 30.8%. Also last week the company paid its annual dividend which was $0.46 per share, an 18% increase over the dividend paid last year. Given our performance through February, as well as the economic slowdown being felt by our customers and prospects, we are adjusting our revenue guidance for the year. For the entire year we expect revenues to be in the range of $3,930 million to $3,965 million. While the revenues are still within our original guidance range, it is in the lower quartile. However we are also anticipating continuing high energy costs. These factors are causing us to reduce earnings per share guidance to be between $2.12 and $2.16, down from the previous total year guidance issued last July of $2.15 to $2.25. The company has implemented aggressive cost control measures in order to offset these lower revenues and increased costs.  With me today is Mike Thompson, Cintas’ Vice President and Treasurer. After some comments from Mike we will open the call to questions. The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a Safe Harbor from civil litigation for forward-looking statements. This conference call contains forward-looking statements that reflect the company’s current views as to future events and financial performance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ materially from those we may discuss. I refer you to the discussion on these points contained in our most recent filings with the SEC.  I’d like now to turn the call over to Mike Thompson.
Michael Thompson: Thanks Bill and good afternoon. Total revenues were $976 million for the quarter, a 7.8% increase over the $905.4 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2007. Our rental organic growth improved to 3.8% for the third quarter, a 55 basis point improvement over the second quarter when adjusted for the additional work day.  Total company third quarter internal growth however decreased slightly to 4.5% from 4.8% in the second quarter. Year to date, total company internal growth was also 4.5%. Our new business efforts continue to meet our expectations but deteriorating economic conditions caused additional weakness in our existing customer base. As mentioned on our second quarter call, we began to see weakness in our customer base in November. This weakness continued through our third quarter.  As a reminder our third quarter had 65 work days which was one more work day than the third quarter of fiscal 2007. Our second quarter of fiscal 2008 also had 65 work days. The number of work days does impact quarter to quarter comparisons. Our fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 will also have 65 work days. This is one less work day than our fiscal 2007 fourth quarter. For forecasting purposes, please note that the number of work days for next, fiscal 2009, will be 65 work days for each quarter. This will equate to one less work day in fiscal 2009 as fiscal 2008 will have 261 work days and fiscal 2009 will have 260 work days. Rental uniforms and ancillary products is our largest operating segment accounting for 72% of total company revenues during the third quarter. This segment reflects the rental and servicing of uniforms and other garments, mats, mops, shop towels and other related items. We also provide restroom and hygiene products and services within this segment. We are the largest provider of corporate identity uniforms and facility services in North America.  Uniform and ancillary product revenues were $703.6 million for the quarter, compared to $665.6 million in the third quarter of last year, a 5.7% increase. Year to date revenues for this segment are up 4.2% over last year’s first nine months. Factoring out acquisitions made over the last 12 months, our rental organic growth rate was 3.8% for the third quarter, again which is a 55 basis point improvement over the 3.25% internal growth in the second quarter.  We continue to see improvement in new business within our uniform and ancillary product segment resulting from our new sales organization and are encouraged by these results. The new business generated through the quarter and year to date has bet our expectations. The weakness we experienced with existing customers late in our second quarter continued through the third quarter causing our total uniform and ancillary product internal growth to be below our original expectations.  Our uniform direct sales operating segments incorporates our national accounts sales division which direct sells uniforms, branded promotional products and other related products to national and large regional customers and our direct sale catalogue which direct sells uniforms and related products primarily to local customers who also rent products from us.  During the third quarter uniform direct sales revenue declined 0.7% as we experienced weak sales in both our national account direct sale business and our direct sale catalogue. During challenging economic conditions these direct sale businesses tend to move with greater volatility than our rental business, as many of the direct sale customers will delay purchasing during economic downturns. We expect to continue experiencing weakness in this segment in the fourth quarter.  Our third operating segment is first aid, safety and fire protection services. Within this business we provide on-site delivery of first aid products, safety products and automatic defibrillators and we provide safety training to our customers and their employees. We install, inspect, repair and recharge portable fire extinguishers and sprinkler systems and we provide and service emergency lighting systems and kitchen fire suppression systems.  We are the largest on-site provider of first aid and safety products in North America and the second largest provider of fire protection services.  During the quarter revenues within our first aid, safety and fire protection operating segment grew 10.3%. On an organic basis this segment grew approximately 5.3% as compared to 6.2% in the second quarter. Our first aid and safety business continues to provide double-digit internal growth. However this growth was offset by a combination of lower than anticipated recurring fire service revenue and continued pressure on fire installation sales. We are allocating our sales resources within fire protection with a focus on the recurring service business and away from the sale and installation of fire suppression systems.  The fire installation business is dependent on commercial construction which is facing difficult business conditions. With additional deterioration expected in commercial construction, we are focusing on new business opportunities elsewhere in the fire protection space. We continue to evaluate and make strategic acquisitions within this segment but with a defined focus on expanding the geographic coverage of our fire protection service business.  As with our other businesses we believe a full national presence will provide us unique opportunities with large national customers and prospects, while we will still evaluate other acquisitions in this space. The evaluation would have to be compelling for us to more forward.  Our document management services operating segment is comprised mainly of document shredding services although we do have some storage and imaging capabilities. Revenues within this operating segment continue to grow at a very rapid rate. Third quarter revenues for the document management operating segment grew 71.2% as compared to 77.4% in the second quarter. Internal growth for the segment was 41%, down slightly from 43% in the second quarter. This division’s growth continues to exceed our expectations and our current annual revenue run rate is over $185 million.  Our small document management business in The Netherlands which we purchased approximately six months ago continues to meet our expectations while providing us a nice international proving ground. We continue to make strategic acquisitions in document management. While we now service customers in over 85 of the top 100 markets in the United States and Canada we continue to emphasize obtaining additional coverage in significant markets in order to be a true national provider. Today we have national coverage in our rental, uniform direct sale and first aid and safety businesses. Getting national coverage in document management and fire protection services would provide us still further opportunities with large national customers and prospects. Total company margins declined as compared to last quarter’s margins and last year’s third quarter margins. The main reason for the decline in margins as compared to both periods was energy costs which increased to 3.7% of total company revenues. Energy costs increased 50 basis points as compared to the second quarter due to an increase in delivery fuel costs and increased seasonal usage of natural gas. Delivery fuel increased 50 basis points over the third quarter of last year. The only other time energy costs reached this level was for our third quarter of fiscal 2006. Energy costs at that time were related to a combination of run up in natural gas and delivery fuel prices. Current quarter costs are related to delivery fuel. Our rental uniform and ancillary products gross margins were also significantly impacted by these high energy costs. The increased level of lost business and stops has also caused our gross margins to suffer. Profit from our customers who have been with us over one and a half to two years, are more profitable customers as we get further away from initial inventory requirements and selling costs. The softening economy has caused an increase in our lost business and stop ratios which has therefore hurt our returns. Other services gross margins improved as compared to the second quarter and last year’s third quarter. While increased energy cost impacted margins within our first aid, safety and fire business the continued improvement in scale and strong paper prices within our document management business drove other services gross margin higher.  Selling and administrative expenses were 28% of revenue for the quarter which is the same as our second quarter and the same as the third quarter of last year. As compared to the third quarter of last year, selling costs were up 50 basis points as expected given the additional investment in our one team initiative. Improvements in medical costs offset this increase.  When compared to the second quarter of this year, payroll taxes were up 60 basis points again as compared to the second quarter. This is a seasonal event as payroll taxes reset during our third quarter. Payroll taxes were consistent with the third quarter of 2007. Offsetting the payroll tax increase from the second quarter was a decrease in selling costs as we began to gain leverage under the new sale structure. We also had an improvement in lower bad debt write-offs and some improvement in professional fees.  Interest expense increased mainly due to additional levels of outstanding debt. The additional debt related mainly to acquisitions made over the last 12 months and the share buy backs made in the second quarter. Our affective tax rate decreased to 35% for the quarter and 36.9% through nine months as compared to 37.3% last year. This decrease was due to third quarter reserve requirements under FAS B interpretation number 48 accounting for uncertainty and income taxes and interpretation of FAS B statement number 109. We expect the company’s affective tax rate for fiscal 2008 to be 37.1%.  Net income for the quarter was $81.8 million, an increase of 6.6% over last year. Earnings per diluted share were $0.53, an increase of 10.4% over last year. Our balance sheet and cash flow remain strong. Our current ratio is 3.2:1. We currently hold approximately $163.6 million in cash and marketable securities with approximately $136 million of that held in Canada. The cash and marketable securities are held in short term, conservative governmental securities such as Treasury Bills.  DSOs on accounts receivable were 40, which is the same as last quarter. Accrued liabilities increased approximately $78.8 million from November 30 mainly due to the accrual of our dividend to shareholders of record on February 6th. The dividend was paid on March 12th. This year’s dividend represented an 18% increase over the annual dividend paid in fiscal 2007. Long term debt at February 29, 2008 was $965.4 million, an increase of $16.6 million from November 30th. The increase related to $46 million of acquisitions and $52 million of capital expenditures offset by cash flow generated during the quarter. Total debt as a percentage of total book capitalization increased to 30.8%, a slight increase from 30.6% at November 30th.  During the third quarter we refinanced $300 million of outstanding commercial paper and a 10-year 6.125% public debt. This refinancing allowed us to take advantage of current long term rates, maintain the flexibility to continue to pay down our remaining commercial paper levels and restore some dry powder. As of February 29th we had approximately $180 million in outstanding CP. As we work through these refinance solutions, we worked closely with our rating agencies and maintained our current investment grade ratings. We did not buy back any of our outstanding shares during the third quarter however we continue to have approximately $228 million in authorization under our existing buy back program.  We continue to balance our current cash needs and acquisition activity as we evaluate future buy back opportunities. Since the inception of our buy back program, we have bought back over 11% of our outstanding shares. Year to date cash provided by operations was $369 million. These strong cash flows allowed us to cover year to date capital expenditures of $145 million, acquisitions of $102 million and a portion of the share buy backs made this fiscal year.  We continue to expect capital expenditures for fiscal 2008 to be approximately $190 million. The $102 million spent on acquisitions has been mainly spent in our document management, fire protection service businesses. We expect our balance sheet and strong future cash flows to allow us to continue to invest in our business make strategic acquisitions and continue purchases under our buy back program if warranted. Thank you and we will now answer any questions you may have.
Operator: Your first question comes from Kartik Mehta - FTN Midwest Research
Kartik Mehta - FTN Midwest Research: I wanted to get your thoughts on the performance of the company, I guess in the last recession versus this recession, how you think it might be similar or different since the company is a little bit different today than it was probably in the previous recession.
William Gale: I guess what the differences today is the document management business and the first aid and safety business appear to be less sensitive to the recession. We also though are probably because of our size in uniform rental and in direct sale rental, we’re subject to that having a big impact on us and therefore I think it is going to keep our growth rates down probably for some time in the mid to upper single-digit levels because I just feel like that the drag on the economy that is impacting the rental business is going to continue for some period of time.  I think the thing that we as a company are recognizing the need to do is that this slowdown does not appear to be something that’s going to go away quickly. We feel because of that coupled with the high energy costs that are going to continue and probably get worse, we have got to do some things to really hone in some of our other costs and so we’re becoming very aggressive in looking at opportunities to reduce costs by consolidating some of our backroom operations perhaps, by looking at our suppliers and trying to make sure that we can withstand this and continue to post nice profit increases even though our revenues aren’t going to be growing at the rates that would like to see. 
Kartik Mehta - FTN Midwest Research: Well then Bill I guess then the second part of that question would be in this environment considering that you’re going to have some cost cuts, you obviously have a fairly strong balance sheet, what kind of earnings growth do you think you could sustain in this type of environment?
William Gale: That’s a very difficult question to think Kartik because I don’t know what’s going to happen but our expectation is that we should be able to get back up into double-digits in earnings growth even if our revenue growth are in single-digits. 
Kartik Mehta - FTN Midwest Research: So I guess maybe a better way to phrase it is if the environment stays the way it is, and kind of revenue growth stays kind of what you just said, mid single-digits, do you think that you could leverage that to double-digit earnings growth?
William Gale : Over time, yes, I think we can. 
Kartik Mehta - FTN Midwest Research: Alright, and one last question, would there be a change at all, I know you talked about reduction in costs, any change at all in the ability to grow your sales force, will you contract that or will you kind of continue that pace as it is even if we go into a little bit of an economic slowdown or remain in this slowdown?
William Gale: Well no, I think we’ll have to watch that sales force. Right now I would tell you that the sales…the new business efforts have met our expectations in all the business except for the direct sale of uniforms. Therefore we feel like we’re getting the value out of that sales force. But if we see things get much more difficult, we certainly can scale back on some of those sales efforts and probably need to do so if things got very difficult.
Kartik Mehta - FTN Midwest Research: Thank you very much Bill, I really appreciate it.
Operator: Your next question comes from Michael Schneider - Robert W. Baird
Michael Schneider - Robert W. Baird: Maybe first if we could just focus on rental, the organic growth rate you mentioned was slightly below your expectations but was still up sequentially by 55 basis points, given what you know about ad stops and kind of the rolling affect of that now looking forward over the next 12 months, is it possible to sustain this growth rate near 3 ½ to 4% organic growth based on your new business wins, just any color on your expectations or knowing what you know about the, again the lagging affect of these metrics.
William Gale: Mike, we’ve really looked at that a lot here especially over the last month or so and I think we feel confident that we can do what you just said, that is maintain this organic growth rate in the rental division despite the headwinds of the ad stops and the lost business. And again the reason I feel confident in saying that right now is because the new business efforts are yielding the results we expected and we only expect that to get better as tenure improves and as productivity improves. There are pockets of the country where things are continuing to go well. Canada continues to do very well for us. So we think that that is certainly an achievable situation to get that kind of rate of growth.
Michael Schneider - Robert W. Baird: And have you been more or less or equally aggressive on trying to recover price now, especially with energy surging?
William Gale: We’re trying to recover price. I’d say we are being more aggressive. We are finding our competition continues to be extremely aggressive in their pricing so it’s a very competitive environment. But we are going to our customers and we’re attempting to recover as much of these cost increases as we can but of course our customers are facing problems of their own and therefore they’re pushing back quite a bit. But I would say that we’re taking the opportunities to get price increases when we can and contractual…under the terms of our contract, but being realistic in meeting competition as we have to.
Michael Schneider - Robert W. Baird: Okay and then within the growth rate of rental, given that the uniforms are obviously the vast majority of that segment, presumably uniform is growing, call it 2% to 3%, at what rate are the ancillary products growing and I ask just to get a sense of what element of the business project one is really benefiting and what type of growth rates its driving.
William Gale: Mike, your 2% to 3% is probably too high. It’s really more than the 1% level in garments so a lot of our growth is coming from the ancillary products.
Michael Schneider - Robert W. Baird: And it presumably is double-digits then, just to get to the weighted average?
William Gale: Not sure of that.
Michael Thompson: It wouldn’t be that high. 
William Gale: We’d have to look at that number more detailed but I…just off the top of my head and Mike said, I don’t think that would be the case.
Michael Schneider - Robert W. Baird: So then project one team as of now is benefiting the ancillary products far more than it is the garments?
Michael Thompson: Actually the big benefit of one team is the emerging businesses where we’ve been able to leverage those sales territories by adding additional reps and in the document management and first aid and safety businesses.
William Gale: But yes, I would say going back though, that because of project one team we also have been able to add additional headcount in certain markets that have been able to push some of the facility services type products.
Michael Schneider - Robert W. Baird: Okay and then final question just on gross margins in rental, Mike you had mentioned that energy was up 50 basis points sequentially if I heard that correct then that accounts for 50 of the 130 basis point deterioration sequentially, what else would explain the deceleration in margins sequentially?
Michael Thompson: The main thing from our standpoint is the additional lost business and stops that we’ve been seeing. That is very profitable business for us that has gone away as these stops increase and the additional costs factor is because of that lower margin business has put some pressure on us. 
Michael Schneider - Robert W. Baird: And can you put the ad stop rate at least in some historical context. I know you don’t discuss specific numbers but if you look back to the last recession, are we at the same rate you saw mid way through that decline or are we at the same rate at the trough of the employment cycle?
Michael Thompson: We haven’t really given that detail. I would say that it is certainly worse than we’ve seen in the last couple of years and the trend is getting worse. Really to go back to the profitability though, think about what happens when we have a stop in an account. We go from a 10 man account and they stop two individuals to get to eight, we’ve still got to cover the truck, we’ve got all the delivery costs still of stopping that truck, we have material costs coming back in certainly but it still amortizes and it just really puts a crimp really on your profitability within those accounts when you lose 20% of an account. I’d say the stop metric has certainly been as well as the lost business has been the key issue for us over the last quarter. 
William Gale: And Mike its hard for us to compare one economic downturn to another but I have seen…I see no signs yet of things getting better. I see signs of things getting…continuing to get a little worse. So we’re still early in our fourth quarter but that was what prompted us really to adjust the guidance down. We’re not going to recover in the fourth quarter that’s for sure. 
Michael Schneider - Robert W. Baird: Right, okay, thank you again.
Operator: Your next question comes from Michel Morin - Merrill Lynch
Michel Morin - Merrill Lynch: Document management margins, is this all the recycled paper prices or is there something that’s been helping margins?
William Gale: The paper prices help a bit but also just establishing scale. We’ve been very aggressive in rolling these services out throughout the country by making small acquisitions and building up sales forces and you’re starting to see some benefit that we anticipated would happen as we scaled in these markets.
Michael Thompson: These significant growth rates are really helping the local operations begin to cover some of those costs.
Michel Morin - Merrill Lynch: And is there anything seasonal that might have boosted this quarter?
Michael Thompson: Not really. 
William Gale: I think the trend has certainly been improving and that we expect that to continue. 
Michel Morin - Merrill Lynch: Great, and then you made some comments about competitors being aggressive on price, is that pretty much across the board Bill or is it kind of specific to certain markets or to a specific competitor?
William Gale: Actually it’s with the large competitors, the big companies and from what I hear from our operating people it’s pretty much across the board. They are being very, very aggressive.
Michel Morin - Merrill Lynch: Okay and then just finally on the buy backs, you said that you did not repurchase any shares this quarter, was there a specific [inaudible] to preserve capital knowing that the economy was worsening or was there any other reason that you mentioned that I might have missed?
William Gale: There were several reasons, first off I think we wanted to get our balance sheet in order with the debt offering and so that was part of it. We also met with the rating agencies and we were very careful to tell them we’re going to maintain conservative financial policies. We are not going to do something to deteriorate the balance sheet because we expected the downturn to start coming because we started seeing that late in our second quarter. We also believe as has been the case before that there will be some great acquisition opportunities that might present themselves now that things are getting tougher and so we want to be sure that we maintain some dry powder so that we can take advantage of those things.
Michel Morin - Merrill Lynch: Right and the criteria that the Board has set has not changed?
William Gale: The Board…we’re in constant communication with the Board as to direction from them and I would say that generally they’re direction to us has not changed from what it has been over the last nine to 12 months.
Michel Morin - Merrill Lynch: Great, thanks very much.
Operator: Your next question comes from Scott Schneeberger – Oppenheimer
Scott Schneeberger – Oppenheimer: I have several questions, first just wonder you mentioned that you were continuing to do acquisitions in your other services business and how about the, how’s the acquisition environment looking like in your core uniform rental business. Is this something that you may be considering?
William Gale: I would say we are always evaluating opportunities in the rental business. At this point in time we have found very few compelling opportunities to allocate part of our acquisition capital. However as I just stated that those opportunities tend to come along in the downturns and I would not expect anything to be any different. We will be very careful though in making acquisitions. We don’t need a footprint in any particular area of the country. We pretty well have that all covered so an acquisition will have to make a lot of financial sense to us before we would be willing to be aggressive on pricing.
Scott Schneeberger – Oppenheimer: Okay, actually a follow-up on that is what would be a good target for the acquisitions. You mentioned that you may not look for geographic diversification then, what could interest you in that targeting market?
William Gale : An acquisition such as the one we completed a couple of years ago, which was a strong regional player; a company by the name of [Andine Crawdy] would be very attractive to us. It was an extremely well run company, good books of business, had some nice capacity that we were able to utilize. Those are the types of acquisitions that make the most sense to us. We have to be very careful that the business that we are acquiring is good business and that’s what we would look at most closely when we evaluate one.
Scott Schneeberger – Oppenheimer: Okay and second question about margins, so you see higher energy costs and you mentioned that you have not using hedging, would you consider that going forward?
William Gale: We will certainly consider it. We haven’t found a good reason yet to do that because I think energy has been so unpredictable and obviously when everybody thinks energy is going to go up, the value of a hedge becomes very difficult to justify so…but it’s something that we look at and we just haven’t found a compelling reason to do it at this point.
Scott Schneeberger – Oppenheimer: Okay and for costs, would you consider other measures like maybe a headcount cut, I mean you said you won’t do that in the sales force but maybe other corporate areas and also regarding your recent battle with the union will that impact your costs structure in your near future?
William Gale: Well one of the advantages that Cintas has and we believe we’ll continue to have is that we are a growth company and we’ll be able to continue to grow. And we can do headcount leveraging by not adding people and you have attrition that takes place and so what we’re going to do is we’re going to be very careful that when we lose an individual that we don’t necessarily replace them by making a new hire. And I think by doing that we can keep headcount under control and actually show an overall reduction given just a normal attrition and continued growth.
Scott Schneeberger – Oppenheimer: Okay, is there anything else that you can share with us within your cost control project besides maybe considering hedging and the headcount additions?
William Gale: Well I think every cost area is subject to review and scrutiny and we certainly have charged all of our management to take a look at every line item of cost that they have from the supplies they purchase to the travel expenditures they’re incurring to deciding whether or not to make a capital investment, so it covers the whole gamut of the income statement and we expect our people to manage their particular operations to ensure that they control costs and conserve cash.
Scott Schneeberger – Oppenheimer: Okay, thank just want to clarify on your share repurchase because you suspended it during first quarter ’08, when you were trying to explore some strategic alternatives. Just want to confirm is that something that you will reconsider or is that totally not relevant for now?
William Gale: I really can’t make any comments on that at this point.
Scott Schneeberger – Oppenheimer: Okay, and last question, you mentioned that you are losing some older customers, can you give us more color in terms of like how much percent of older customers versus new customers right now on your total customer pool.
William Gale: No, we don’t disclose that level of information.
Scott Schneeberger – Oppenheimer: Okay, thank you very much.
Operator: Your next question comes from Gary Bisbee - Lehman Brothers
Gary Bisbee - Lehman Brothers: A couple of questions, first of all the extra work day this quarter, am I thinking about this right that this added like close to 2% to revenue growth?
William Gale: It adds about a point and a half but Mike adjusted that when he gave you the organic growth.
Gary Bisbee - Lehman Brothers: Okay, that’s what I wanted to confirm, so the 3.8% is adjusted for that.
Michael Thompson: That is adjusted for the work day. Whenever we give internal growth numbers we always adjust for work days. 
Gary Bisbee - Lehman Brothers: Okay, I guess just following up on that last question or one of the last questions there about acquisitions in the core business, you’ve basically got a fully build out footprint in the US and Canada for uniform rental, I guess would it make sense if…do you have routes around the country where if you made an acquisitions it would allow you to increase the route density and thus be highly profitable or is that not really the reason you do acquisitions. I’m trying to understand it seems like if its getting tougher for you it’s got to be a lot tougher for the small and mid sized companies and so it seems like you would have a good opportunity if you wanted to to buy other uniform rental companies, but I’m trying to understand economically. If you can find one, you pay the right price, is it really accretive or how should we think about that?
William Gale: Well we won’t do it unless it’s accretive Gary. I think the way you look at it, maybe you don’t necessarily gain leverage on the routes but what you gain leverage on is in the plants and in the backroom, the corporate functions. We certainly have demonstrated that time and time again when we make an acquisition, we can consolidate it into our company pretty quickly. And very cost affectively. The routes themselves…the opportunities we typically see on an acquisition is that we will be able to sell additional products and services to the customers of the acquired company because they typically don’t have the full gamut of service offerings that we have in some of the facility services and ancillary products. So we do see some benefit there. We see benefit in our purchasing power. We’re able to buy things cheaper than our competitors, especially the small to regional players. The fact you pick up capacity, you’re able to take and consolidate what maybe was one plus one becomes three because you end up shutting down some of their plants and branches or some of our plants, some of our branches and consolidating some of their operations and then to not have to build them. So acquisitions do make a lot of sense but you just have to be very careful on what you’re paying for because of the fact that you’re not really getting the presence in a particular area like we did when we were making acquisitions in the 80s and 90s. 
Gary Bisbee - Lehman Brothers: Alright, so it’s much more close down either your plant or their plant, get the customers, increase the utilization of the plant that you keep and through that drive accretion.
William Gale: Right. 
Michael Thompson: It definitely comes down to valuation and the benefit you get, like Bill said, if you moved into a new market you get the positives of the additional growth rate that you would have in a new market place but since we’re everywhere today, we are strictly looking at valuation and what you can drive out of the bottom line.
Gary Bisbee - Lehman Brothers: Just one other one on acquisitions, you’ve done a great job over time of doing the small mom and pops, every quarter sort of continuously, is there anything larger out there that makes sense in some of the non-uniform areas and I guess why have you not been more aggressive, is it a matter of price, or they’re just not the right assets or ….
William Gale: Well the non-uniform areas, if you want to specifically talk about document management, the couple of other big players are Iron Mountain and Shred It, neither of which I think have any interest at all in selling those businesses since they’re growing very well for them. In the first aid and safety there isn’t anyone. And in the fire business the big player is Tyco and they I don’t think have any interest in selling their business. So, there are regional players but most of the….there really aren’t any big players out there other than the things I mentioned that aren’t actionable I would say at this time.
Gary Bisbee - Lehman Brothers: Okay, I think back to your Investor Day a couple of years ago, one of the things that I remember being a focus is some new areas of opportunity and maybe some less cyclical end markets for uniforms and one with health care that I remember you talking about over the last few years, any progress there or is there any initiatives that you can take in a more challenging market like this to try to expand in less economically sensitive areas or is that something you’ve continued to do and that’s benefiting growth to a certain extent already?
Michael Thompson: We have certainly focused on a few different areas. I’d say health care; we’re still just scratching the surface. We are certainly putting more effort into that although that’s not really uniform rental, that’s other products and services that we have. We’ve certainly done that with things like flame resistant clothing, expanded our foray into those type areas. We certainly have looked into additional niche opportunities and done well there. Food processing is another area that’s done well. With health care I’d say that we are improving in that area but we’re still a very small player at this point.
William Gale: Gary, the company has a very active ongoing strategic planning process looking at opportunities, of where the growth is going to be and what we think would make sense for us to be involved with and we certainly are…we have a number of initiatives in place that we believe will benefit us down the road to take advantage of, the higher growth segments. And some of which we really just can’t talk about at this time.
Gary Bisbee - Lehman Brothers: Okay, that’s fine and then just one last question. Can you give us any sense within the first aid, safety and fire business how much of that has been these fire suppression systems or the stuff that’s somewhat tied to construction, I mean is that a big piece or has that been a pretty small piece but its just a piece that’s probably shrinking right now.
William Gale: Well it’s a significant portion of it. It’s not the majority but it’s a significant amount of the business. 
Gary Bisbee - Lehman Brothers: Okay so that could be a headwind for a while here then?
William Gale: Probably so.
Gary Bisbee - Lehman Brothers: Okay, thanks for all the color.
Operator: Your next question comes from Greg Halter - Great Lakes Review
Greg Halter - Great Lakes Review: I wondered if you could provide any commentary on what’s going on with the situation with Unite recently.
William Gale: Actually very little. I think Unite is focusing as all the unions are right now primarily in the political front, getting behind their preferred candidates to push forth their agenda. So what we have seen here is just a continued lawsuit support that they have for some of those suits that are out there and they just create noise now and then. They’ll show up to our plant periodically and hand out some literature but that’s about it.
Greg Halter - Great Lakes Review: Okay and you briefly touched on some of the cost measures, attrition and so forth, are there any other things that you’re specifically focusing on in that area?
William Gale: Well as I mentioned to the prior questioner on that, we focus on everything Greg. I don’t think any costs can go unlooked at in terms of what opportunities might exist. You can always try to do things more efficiently, work with your suppliers to get costs reduced. You know, look for opportunities in other parts of the world to get supplies and products. It goes through everything. Travel and entertainment, we talk to our people and do you really need to take that trip, can a phone call do? You have to attack all the little things and then they add up to something more significant.
Greg Halter - Great Lakes Review: And I know you’ve been successful in the document management, first aid, fire safety so forth and so on, are there any other new initiatives that you’re continuing or currently experimenting with?
William Gale: Yes there are, there are several things that we’re experimenting with none of which I can talk about at this point. But we are bullish on some things that might build up to something more significant down the road. 
Greg Halter - Great Lakes Review: Okay, and given the commentary about lost business and the increase in stops, what kind of I guess I would characterize it as obsolete inventory risk do you run with uniforms that may not be used by someone at some point?
William Gale: Very little because in the rental business, you don’t rent something that you couldn’t utilize for another customer without a…if somebody wants something so unique in a rental program we require a guaranteed buy back of that inventory regardless of what happens and we won’t even sign a contract with a customer unless we’re comfortable with their credit…to make sure that they can stand behind that commitment. Most items, the vast majority of items in a uniform rental program are items that can be used on a multiple number of different types of customers. 
Greg Halter - Great Lakes Review: Okay, that sounds good. And you’re comment about the cash with the majority of it being in Canada, I’m just wondering why that is?
William Gale: Well there are laws that prohibit you from bringing cash back into the United States without incurring some costs associated with that and so as our businesses have built up in Canada we’ve accumulated some cash up there that has exceeded what we’ve been able to redeploy in acquisitions in Canada and so we are looking for other opportunities to the point of that cash perhaps as we seek out acquisitions in other parts of the world. 
Greg Halter - Great Lakes Review: Okay and obviously if you brought it back you’d have to pay some sort of tax on that repatriation of the funds?
William Gale: Yes, it’s fairly expensive. 
Michael Thompson: So it’s accessible but at this point it’s not necessary.
Greg Halter - Great Lakes Review: And there’s been obviously concern over investments and auction rate preferreds and just I know Mike you made a commentary about T-Bills and all that, but just wanted to touch on that again whether or not there’s any kind of wacky stuff in the portfolio.
Michael Thompson: Cash is invested, short term very conservative, governmental type securities. 
Greg Halter - Great Lakes Review: Alright, just wanted to check, we’ve heard it before.
William Gale: Greg, it’s a very valid question but we have not done anything exotic.
Greg Halter - Great Lakes Review: Okay and would you expect your tax rate for fiscal ’09 to be around this 37, 37 ½ area?
Michael Thompson: We’ll comment on that a year end but we think it’ll be around that level.
Greg Halter - Great Lakes Review: One last question here, a comment on the first aid or document management that there’s not a whole lot of public companies, in the past I think you’ve talked about, or maybe there’s been commentary about a company called Brambles, just wondered if that would peak your interest?
Michael Thompson: Yes, that’s Recall, is the division that does the document shredding. They’re slightly smaller than Shred It. So they could be the third of the larger companies. 
William Gale: You know there are a lot of businesses outside the US which would probably be a little bit bigger thing to swallow for us at this point but we’d certainly be interested in talking to them if the opportunity presented itself on their US business.
Greg Halter - Great Lakes Review: Okay, I know you’re share repurchases, you’ve made buy backs as high as on an average $41.81 or almost $42.00, I guess it is, and with the stock at $28.00, $29.00 here just a little interested in your commentary and obviously you’ve provided some about powder dry and get your balance sheet in order and discipline and so forth, with the share price where it is now, I would have to think that you’d be more willing to look at the share repurchase at these levels than in the 40s. 
William Gale: Well we might be. We’ll tell you in July what we did.
Greg Halter - Great Lakes Review: Okay. 
Operator: Your next question comes from Brandt Sakakeeny - Deutsche Bank
Brandt Sakakeeny - Deutsche Bank: Could you just talk to the energy exposure in the document management business, I think we’re pretty comfortable with the risk obviously in the core business but is that business less energy intensive at all?
Michael Thompson: The costs were up; you do have fuel costs in that business as well. But it was not as dramatic as the other divisions. 
William Gale: I don’t have exactly that number in front of me but it’s something we can maybe follow back up with you on. 
Brandt Sakakeeny - Deutsche Bank: Great, and I guess just over time, obviously given the growth in the margins, sort of sustained success in that division can help offset weakness in your other areas on a blended sort of mixed basis, how comfortable do you feel about sustaining last quarter’s growth going forward in light of the environment offset by its still a reasonably small business right now.
Michael Thompson: We’re pretty comfortable with the long term growth rates there. Certainly we’re not going to stay in the 40s forever we don’t believe but it continues to exceed our expectations and it could slow into the 30s potentially but overall we feel very good about the growth opportunities in that business and it’s been so far very resilient within the economy so, we’re keeping our fingers crossed a little bit because its still relatively new business for us but right now it’s been very, very positive. 
Brandt Sakakeeny - Deutsche Bank: And just finally on the sales force productivity you mentioned obviously some successes, how do you disaggregate sort of the same store successes outside of the tougher ad stop and lost business numbers and do you think there’s risk that as things get worse you start to see higher attrition and start to lose some of those productivity gains.
Michael Thompson: That’s difficult to say. I think we certainly are concerned about the trend within both the stop ratio and the lost business but again as we indicated the new business has been going pretty well and really allowed us to [inaudible] from growth rate within rental to improve. So we’ll certainly keep an eye on that and it’s a concern but overall we feel pretty good with where we are. 
William Gale: I’d say at this point we’re still confident in our ability to sell new business given the number of people we have out on the street, the products that we have offering, the value proposition that exists, and I think the real risk we have is more on the existing customer attritions that they’re having, reduction in workforces et cetera. So, but as Mike said, we’ve got to be very careful here and we monitor this stuff all…every week and so we can tell if we start seeing too significant a slowdown in new business we’ll have to make sure that our cost structure is adjusted accordingly to compensate for that. 
Brandt Sakakeeny - Deutsche Bank: Okay, and just a follow-up on the new business can you just give us a rough breakdown between or among the percentage that’s come from folks who have never had a uniform program before from whom you’re taking share?
Michael Thompson: Its still in excess of 60% of the new customers are customers that have never had a uniform rental program before.
Brandt Sakakeeny - Deutsche Bank: Okay, thank you.
Operator: And we have no further questions in queue; I’d like to turn the conference back to our speakers for additional or closing remarks.
William Gale: Well thank you all very much for joining us. We hope you appreciated it that we didn’t’ interfere with those of you interested in the basketball for tomorrow evening. But we wish you all a very good holiday coming up this weekend and then we’ll look forward to speaking with you in July when we release our fourth quarter earnings.

Operator:  Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Cintas quarterlyearnings results conference call. Today’s call is being recorded. At this time,I would like to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Bill Gale, Senior VicePresident of Finance and Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead. 
William C. Gale: Good morning and thank you for joining us to discuss ourcompany’s results for the second quarter of fiscal 2008. With me today is MikeThompson, Cintas' Vice President and Treasurer. After some brief comments, wewill open the call to questions.  We are pleased to announce increased sales and profits forthe quarter ending November 30, 2007. Total revenue increased 6.6% and earningsper diluted share increased 3.9%. We had continued strong growth in both ourdocument management division and the first aid side of the first aid and safetybusiness. We also showed improved organic growth in both our rental and uniformdirect sale businesses.  Net income was $82.9 million, up slightly from last year’s$82.5 million. This year’s results were negatively impacted by a highereffective tax rate of 38.3% versus last year’s 37.3%. With the adoption of thenew rules on tax accounting, companies must be more precise on a quarterlybasis in the recording of the tax provision versus the old rules whichcalculated taxes on an effective rate for the entire year. Thus, this quarter’shigher tax rate should be the highest of the year. By the end of the year, weexpect our annualized rate to be at 37.3%.  Shortly, Mike will provide you further details regardinggrowth by segment as well as a discussion of margins.  During the quarter, the company purchased 5.2 million sharesof its stock in open market purchases. Since the initiation of the buy-backprogram in May of 2005, Cintas has purchased 19.4 million shares, representingabout 11% of the outstanding shares at the inception of the program.  We currently have $228 million remaining under theauthorization from the board to purchase Cintas stock. Subsequent to the end ofour quarter, Cintas also issued $250 million in 10-year bonds. These proceedswere used to pay down commercial paper.  As Scott Farmer stated in the release, our results are inline with the plan for the year. Our current guidance of revenues for thefiscal year ending May 31, 2008, remains unchanged. That guidance calls fortotal revenues of $3.9 billion to $4.1 billion. Earnings per diluted share arestill expected to be in the range of $2.15 to $2.25.  The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995provides a safe harbor from civil litigation for forward-looking statements.This conference call contains forward-looking statements that reflect thecompany’s current views as to future events and financial performance. Theseforward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which couldcause actual results to differ materially from those we may discuss.  I refer you to the discussion on these points contained inour most recently filed Form 10-K.  I would now like to turn the call over to Mike Thompson. 
Michael L. Thompson: Thank you, Bill. Good evening, or good morning, rather.Total revenues were $983.9 million for the quarter, a 6.6% increase over thatreported in the prior year. Internal growth was 4.8% during the second quarter,which is an increase from our first quarter internal growth rate of 4.2%. Whilegeneral economic conditions worsened as compared to our last two quarters, ournew sales organization continued to gain strength and provided us with theimproved new business results. Most notably in our emerging business units.  All of our businesses are growing but our emerging businessservices continue to grow at accelerated rates. Our transformation into a morewell-rounded service provider continues.  At the end of fiscal 2007, revenues from our first aid,safety, and fire protection and document management segments representedapproximately 13% of total company revenues. Through this year’s secondquarter, these segments represent 14.4% of total company revenues.  As a reminder, our second quarter had 65 work days, the samenumber of work days as the second quarter of fiscal 2007 but one less work daythan our first quarter of this fiscal year. The number of work days does impactquarter-to-quarter comparisons. For the remainder of fiscal 2008, the work dayswill be as follows: our third quarter will have 65 work days, which is one morework day than the third quarter of fiscal ’07; and 65 work days in the fourthquarter, which is one less work day than the fourth quarter of fiscal ’07.  Our rental uniforms and ancillary products is our largestoperating segment, accounting for 72% of total company revenues during thesecond quarter. This segment reflects the rental and servicing of uniforms andother garments, mats, mops, [shop towels] and other related items. We alsoprovide restroom and hygiene products and services within this segment. We arethe largest provider of both corporate identity uniforms and facility servicesin North America.  Uniform and ancillary product revenues were $708.8 millionfor the quarter, compared to $684.5 million in the second quarter of last year,a 3.6% increase. Year-to-date revenues for this segment are up 3.4% over lastyear’s first six months.  Factoring out acquisitions made over the last 12 months, ourrental organic growth rate was 3.25% for the second quarter, which is animprovement over the 3.0% internal growth in the first quarter of last year.  We continue to see improvement in our new business resultswithin our uniform and ancillary product segment, resulting from our new salesorganization and we are encouraged by these results. The new business generatedwas more prominent toward the end of the quarter.  While we have not seen a significant change to our overallcustomer base, our combined loss business and add-stop ratios have worsened ascompared to our previous two quarters.  Our uniform direct sales operating segment incorporates ournational account sales division, which direct sells uniforms, brandedpromotional products, and other related products to national and large regionalcustomers, and our direct sale catalog, which direct sells uniforms and relatedproducts primarily to local customers who also rent products from us.  During the second quarter, uniform direct sales revenuegrowth improved to 5.1%, up from 1.5% in the first quarter. Second quarterorganic growth for this business was also 5.1%.  As we mentioned last quarter, this business tends to be achoppier business quarter to quarter. While our national account direct salebusiness improved as compared to the first quarter, the more significantimprovement came from revenue generated from our direct sale catalog, whichfocuses on local customers that also rent products from us.  Our third operating segment is first aid, safety, and fireprotection services. Within this business, we provide onsite delivery of firstaid products, safety products, and automatic defibrillators, and we providesafety training to our customers and their employees.  We install, inspect, repair and recharge portable fireextinguishers and sprinkler systems and we provide and service emergencylighting systems and kitchen fire suppression systems.  We are the largest onsite provide of first aid and safetyproducts in North America and the second-largest provider of fire protectionservices.  During the quarter, revenues within our first aid, safety,and fire protection operating segment grew 13.4%. On an organic basis, thissegment grew approximately 6.2% as compared to 8% in the first quarter. As inthe first quarter, this decrease was due to lower-than-anticipated installationsales.  Within fire protection, we sell and install certain firesuppression systems. The timing of the sale of these installations is closer toa direct sale business than to the repetitive nature of most other sales withinthis segment. This business is also dependent on new business construction. Thecontinued weakness in this area of fire protection is causing our overallinternal growth rate for first aid, safety, and fire to suffer. Given theirsize, a relatively small dollar shortfall in our emerging businesses can havean impact on internal growth results. Excluding this installation business, ourfirst aid, safety, and fire business is growing approximately 10%.  We continue to evaluate and make strategic acquisitionswithin this segment, with a particular focus on expanding the geographiccoverage of our fire protection service business. As with our other businesses,we believe a full national presence will provide us unique opportunities withlarge national customers and prospects.  Our document management services operating segment iscomprised mainly of document shredding services, although we do have somestorage capabilities. Revenue within this operating segment continues to growat a very rapid rate. Second quarter revenues for the document managementoperating segment grew 77.4% as compared to 78.1% in the first quarter.Internal growth for this segment was 43%, the same as our first quarter andcomparable to the 44% internal growth achieved during the fourth quarter offiscal 2007.  Paper prices continue to be very strong and do play acontributing factor to these internal growth rates. However, excluding thesehigher paper prices, our service revenue continues to be very strong, withinternal growth rates in the high 30s.  We continue to make strategic acquisitions in this businesswith an emphasis on gaining full national coverage in the United States andCanada. As previously mentioned in the discussion of our fire business, webelieve a true national presence in all of our business services will provideus the opportunities with large national customers and prospects.  As we announced last quarter, we expanded our documentmanagement business beyond North America by acquiring a document managementcompany in The Netherlands. While still fairly new to Cintas, this acquisitionis meeting our expectations. We are gaining valuable experience in running thisinternational operation and we continue to actively evaluate otherinternational opportunities within document management as well as our otherlines of business.  Total company margins of 42.7% declined 40 basis points ascompared to first quarter margins, but improved 30 basis points as compared tothe 42.4% in the second quarter of 2007. The decline from the first quarter wasdue to a slight reduction in rental margins and the margin impact of the fireinstallation revenue shortfall. The 30 basis point improvement over last year’ssecond quarter was due to a slight improvement in rental margins and thecontinued improvement in the overall emerging business margins.  Our rental uniform and ancillary products gross margin was44.7% of revenue for the second quarter, which is a slight 20 basis pointdecrease from the 44.9% gross margin achieved in the first quarter, but a 20basis point improvement over the 44.5% gross margin in the second quarter oflast year.  The second quarter had one less work day than this year’sfirst quarter, which impacted margins. The margin improvement from last yearwas due to improved material costs. Energy costs as compared to the firstquarter and to last year’s second quarter were flat.  Other services gross margin declined 30 basis points fromthe first quarter but improved 150 basis points as compared to last year’ssecond quarter. The decline from the first quarter was due to pressure onmargins within our first aid, safety, and fire protection segment, due to theshortfall in installation sales within fire protection, despite being staffedfor growth.  Despite this pressure, other services margin improved 150basis points over last year’s second quarter due to improvement in the uniformsales segment and document management segment. Improved sales within uniformsales enabled us to cover more overhead while increased scale and strong paperprices drove document management margins higher.  The significant total growth within first aid, safety, andfire protection services and document management services is allowing us togain scale in these businesses, driving margins higher. Given the current sizeof these businesses, there is the potential for margin movement on a quarter toquarter basis. However, we expect other services gross margin to continue togenerally trend upward as these businesses continue to grow and achieve scale.  Selling and administrative expenses were 28.0% of revenuefor the quarter, as compared to 26.9% for the second quarter of last year and28.6% for the first quarter of this year. The increase over last year wasprimarily due to the increased investment in our sales organization.Additionally, increases in legal and professional fees and other smallincreases were offset by an improvement in medical costs.  The selling and administrative 60 basis point leverageachieved from this year’s first quarter was due to a decrease in professionalservice fees and medical costs. Payroll taxes also decreased on a percent ofsale basis, which is typical for our second quarter as we are in the laterstages of the calendar tax year for individuals. This improvement in sellingand administrative costs provided for an overall operating margin improvement of30 basis points over the first quarter of fiscal 2008.  Net interest costs were 1.1% of revenue this quarter, aslight improvement from 1.2% in the first quarter, as well as last year’ssecond quarter. Our effective tax rate increased to 38.3% for the quarter,which is a 100 basis point increase over last year and last quarter. Thisincrease was due to second quarter reserve requirements under FASBinterpretation number 48 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes andinterpretation of FASB statement number 109. We expect the company’s effectivetax rate to be below 37.3% for the remainder of fiscal 2008 and that oureffective tax rate for the full fiscal year will be approximately 37.3%, whichis the same as last year’s effective tax rate.  Net income for the quarter was $82.9 million and earningsper diluted share were $0.53 per share.  As Bill mentioned, we are concerned with current economicconditions but they have not deteriorated to the point where we believe achange in our fiscal 2008 guidance is warranted. Therefore, given our resultsthrough the second quarter, we are reiterating our fiscal 2008 revenue anddiluted earnings per share guidance which calls for total revenues for the yearof $3.9 billion to $4.1 billion and diluted earnings per share of $2.15 to$2.25.  Our balance sheet and cash flow remains strong. Our currentratio is 3.4 to 1. As compared to our August 31st balance sheet, cash andmarketable securities increased approximately $16 million. This is due totiming as excess cash is used to reduce outstanding commercial paper balanceson a regular basis.  DSOs on accounts receivable were 40, which is the same aslast quarter. Accrued liabilities increased approximately $50 million fromAugust 31st, mainly due to seasonal items. Approximately half of this changerelates to our Aviva funding. We typically pre-fund Aviva, which is apre-payment vehicle for employee medical benefits, during the first quarter ofeach year. The remaining $25 million is mainly from increased bond interest accrualsand employee retirement benefits accruals.  As a reminder, we do not have any significant definedbenefit plans.  Long-term debt at November 30, 2007 was $949 million, anincrease of $68 million from August 31st. The increase related to $23 millionof acquisitions and $191 million of share buy-backs, offset by cash flowgenerated during the quarter. Total debt as a percentage of total bookcapitalization increased moderately to 30.6% from 28.2% at August 31st.  As of November 30th, our total debt consisted of $475million in public debt, $464 million in outstanding commercial paper, and $10million of other bank debt. Throughout the quarter, we were able to issuecommercial paper at attractive rates, experiencing solid demand.  On December 7th, subsequent to quarter end, we refinanced$250 million of our commercial paper into 10-year, 6.125% public debt. Thisrefinancing allowed us to take advantage of current long-term rates, maintainthe flexibility to continue to pay down remaining commercial paper levels, andrestore some dry powder.  As Bill mentioned, we bought back approximately 5.2 millionshares during the second quarter. Our total outstanding shares as of November30th were 153.7 million shares. Since the inception of our buy-back program, wehave bought back over 11% of our outstanding shares.  Year-to-date cash provided by operations was $271 million.These strong cash flows allowed us to cover year-to-date capital expendituresof $93 million and acquisitions of $56 million, and a portion of the sharebuy-backs made during the quarter. We continue to expect capital expenditures-- I’m sorry, we expect capital expenditures for fiscal 2008 to be between $180million and $200 million.  We continue to actively pursue acquisition opportunities,spending $56 million for businesses so far this year, focusing on opportunitiesin fire protection service and document shredding lines of business. Theacquisition pipeline continues to experience good flow. We expect our balancesheet and strong future cash flows to allow us to continue to invest in ourbusiness and make strategic acquisitions. Thank you and I would now like to open the call up to anyquestions you may have. 
Operator: (Operator Instructions) We’ll go to our first question inthe queue from Ashwin Shirvaikar with Citigroup.
Ashwin Shirvaikar -Citigroup: Thank you for taking my question. I’d like someclarification on the first aid side of the business. How much is installationversus the recurring revenue and is the profitability different in the twoparts of the business?
William C. Gale: We don’t disclose the components of the first aid and safetybusiness for competitive reasons, so we are not going to get into that at thistime. I can tell you that the reason we’re in the installation business thoughis as much to obtain the services businesses down the road as anything. We findthat as an opportunity for us to do more for our customers and then enable usto get the ongoing revenue streams of the fire extinguisher servicing and thevarious sprinkler systems servicing on a recurring basis. 
Ashwin Shirvaikar -Citigroup: Okay, but given the dependence on new business construction,which doesn’t seem like it’s coming back in the near term, would you expectsort of a flattening of the margin levels at what you achieved in this currentquarter or would you expect a rebound because you are doing better with theother part of the business? I know it’s a small part of the business but it isa -- 
William C. Gale: It’s very difficult for me to give a precise answer on that.Obviously you are right, that the new construction is going to impact theamount of opportunity in that business. We’ll certainly adjust our coststructure going forward. If we anticipate that there will be a slowdown in thatsegment, so that we’ll try to maintain or improve margins from this pointforward. 
Ashwin Shirvaikar -Citigroup: Okay, and one last question, if I may; the direct sales,nice up-tick in that part of your business. Whatever you signed in the quarter,is that sort of a multi-quarter event where it’s a large client and you have --you are ramping up a program for a couple of quarters or is it sort of a singlequarter event?
William C. Gale: Well, as Mike pointed out in his comments, a lot of thatgrowth did come from our catalog business, which is basically sold off of ouruniform and facility services routes, so that’s more of a one-time sale asopposed to a recurring sale going forward. 
Ashwin Shirvaikar -Citigroup: Okay. Thank you. 
Operator: Thank you. We’ll take our next question from Gary Bisbeewith Lehman Brothers.
Gary Bisbee - LehmanBrothers: Good morning, guys. I guess the first question, with thedocument management business, can you give us an order of magnitude, a sense,or any guidance on how we should think about the revenue contribution and alsothe margin contribution from the services you are charging versus the sales ofpaper on the back end? I mean, is this -- you know, you’ve mentioned it two quartersin a row, that this is a drive of both the top line and the margin and thatthat may not persist if paper prices fall, but is that a really big piece? Isit just on margin?
Michael L. Thompson: From a growth standpoint, we indicated that the internalgrowth of 43% this quarter, we would have been in the high 30s without theimpact of paper prices. We have not talked about or provided detail from themargin side. Certainly there is benefit there and the reason for theimprovement in other services margins is two-fold. It’s certainly paper price isplaying a part of that but also just the increased scale and the amount ofdocument business services business that we have and revenues that we have intotal are driving that.  So we haven’t provided detail on the margin side but I thinkyou can kind of back into it from the sales side. 
Gary Bisbee - LehmanBrothers: Okay, and then just looking at that, the last couple ofquarters, even if you assume that the paper had a part of it, there’s been asubstantial increase the last three quarters. Is it safe to say that theyear-ago period and the first half of last year were low single digits is alevel you are unlikely to ever go back to at this point, even if paper softenssomewhat?
Michael L. Thompson: I don’t know what you mean by low single digits. We’ve neverbeen low single digits in document management internal growth. 
Gary Bisbee - LehmanBrothers: No, no, no, I was talking about the pretax margin. 
Michael L. Thompson: Pretax margin -- no, we expect that to continue to be at thehigher levels. The only difficulty would be if you had a severe reversal ofpaper prices. Obviously instead of being a benefit, it goes negative but weexpect margins to be pretty healthy. 
Gary Bisbee - LehmanBrothers: Okay, all right. And then, can you give a little more coloron your comments about the economy weakening this quarter? I guess you said add-stopsweren’t as strong and lost business might have ticked up. Any other commentaryor what you are hearing from customers that you can give us?
William C. Gale: Well, I think what we are seeing is what you are generallyreading in some of the press, in that businesses appear to be cautious. I knowI read something recently that talked about that the number of companies hiringin the first quarter of next calendar year is going to be less than it’s beenfor some time and so what I sense that our customers are doing is they arebeing cautious also, waiting to see what happens with the consumer goingforward and as a result of that, I think that there has been a reluctance toreplace workers as they leave various companies. And that impacts our stop adratio and then I think companies are also tending to struggle a bit and ourlost business has ticked up a little, so it’s not significant but it’s enoughto give me some caution that says there is a little bit of concern out there.  We still anticipate that we will meet our guidance butobviously if the economy takes a turn for the worse, it’s going to be at thelower end of the guidance than it will be in mid to upper end of the guidance. 
Gary Bisbee - LehmanBrothers: Okay, and then just one last one; following on that, aquarter ago you made the comment that you were confident that the organicgrowth in rentals, just due to the sales force reorganization going better now,could accelerate sequentially throughout the year. I don’t think I heard yousay that again. Is there some sense that maybe if the economy did get worse inthe second half that it would potentially more than offset the progress you aremaking with the sales force, or does it still seem likely that that improvedsequentially from here? Thanks. 
William C. Gale: Well, I think as I’ve always said is that our guidancealways has assumed a cooperating economy, at least a modestly improvingeconomy. We still believe that the project one team with the salesrestructuring is continuing to provide us benefits. You can see it in the otherbusiness services especially but even in our rental business, organic growthhas improved.  Turnover of our sales people continues to ratchet down,productivity increases, so I still expect that to be a contributor goingforward and improve productivity on the new business side.  With that said, obviously if the economy took a significantdownturn, selling new business becomes more difficult also. I don’t see thathappening but it’s hard to predict what might take place over the next sixmonths. But right now, we are very happy and pleased with the way project oneteam is going. It is meeting our expectations with regard to new business andwe don’t see anything to say that that’s going to change. 
Gary Bisbee - LehmanBrothers: Great. Thanks for all the color. 
Operator: Thank you. We’ll now move on to Mike Schneider with RobertW. Baird.
Michael Schneider -Robert W. Baird: Good morning, guys. Maybe first just sticking with projectone team, can you address I guess the interplay between the economy and projectone team? It seems as though the economy maybe is a notch lower than youexpected. Is it then the equal offset though that project one team is actuallyahead of your internal projections or are things just on plan?
William C. Gale: Things are pretty much on plan. It’s not a significantdifference, Mike. Our new business projections are pretty much we expected themto be, a little bit higher in the other business services, which is maybeoffsetting a little bit of the sluggishness on the rental side in add-stops andlost business, but basically it’s -- we’d be nitpicking it to get into thedifferences. 
Michael Schneider -Robert W. Baird: Okay, and then just within the metrics that you follow forproject one team, the sales force turnover, maybe you can address sales forceturnover and new business written, that you’ve mentioned customer retention diderode a bit during the quarter but the prior two metrics, can you give us somequalitative or quantitative feel for indeed how those are trending?
William C. Gale: Well, the trends are -- I’m not going to get into qualitativenumbers at all, or quantitative numbers, but the trend is certainly improving.Our turnover has continued to modestly improve, which then has a correspondingimprovement in productivity. But the trendlines are going in the rightdirection. 
Michael Schneider -Robert W. Baird: And the productivity improvements, are they being drivenprimarily at the route level or at the professional sales level. 
William C. Gale: No, I’m talking -- when I talk about project one team, I’mtalking a professional sales level. 
Michael Schneider -Robert W. Baird: Yeah, but take a step back; are you also making equalimprovements at the route level?
William C. Gale: In terms of what?
Michael Schneider -Robert W. Baird: Productivity improvements among the sales force or theroute. 
William C. Gale: Well, their route volume is probably improving somewhat butI don't have that data with me. 
Michael Schneider -Robert W. Baird: Okay, and then pricing, what is that metric generallytrending at this point? 
William C. Gale: Pretty much no change over the last 12 months. It’sgenerally a very competitive environment. We are seeing a lot of pressure uponcontract renewals to get pricing improvement, or avoid a pricing decreaseduring the term of the contract. We’re pretty much being able to exercise ourCPI increases as needed but certainly it is a very competitive situation whenthe contract is up for renewal. 
Michael Schneider -Robert W. Baird: Okay, and then a final one on project one team; the lastquarter or two quarters ago you admitted that things were a little morechallenging than you expected. Last quarter you said you are back on track.This quarter we’ve shown some sequential improvement again. I don’t know if youwant to put it in baseball terms or however, but where are we in thistrajectory? Have you accomplished 20% of what you had hoped to in terms ofproductivity improvements? Just to give us some sense of the 12-24-36 monthplan here, how much is left or yet to be realized for project one teamimprovements?
William C. Gale: I don’t have exact data, Mike, but I would say we are in themiddle of the game. 
Michael L. Thompson: To expand on that, I’d say from an organizationalstandpoint, we feel like the organization is in place, we have our reps are inplace, we are fully staffed but to get through and get it completely up, I’dagree with Bill that we are in the middle innings. 
Michael Schneider -Robert W. Baird: And has the indoctrination or I guess leverage period beenlonger than you expected? We generally talk about I think six to nine months ofdelay before a salesman truly makes an impact. Has that timeframe stretched orhas the training program shortened it?
William C. Gale: I don’t think it’s stretched. I think we did indicate lastquarter that it did take us longer than we thought but again, we feel we are ontrack and that we should continue to see improved new business results throughthe end of this fiscal year and into next fiscal year, barring a significantdownturn in the economy. 
Michael Schneider -Robert W. Baird: And did I hear you correctly, Bill, that trends during thequarter -- or Mike, I apologize -- did trends in new business written actuallyimprove through the quarter? 
William C. Gale: Yes, they were strongest at the end of the quarter.
Michael Schneider -Robert W. Baird: Okay. Thank you again. 
Operator: Thank you. (Operator Instructions) We’ll move on to ChrisGutek with Morgan Stanley.
Chris Gutek - MorganStanley: Thanks. Good morning, guys. Just a couple of follow-up questions;so the first one, Bill, I guess in terms of the increased lost business orincreased attrition rate of the customers, do you think that’s primarily afunction of the macro environment or is there any change in the competitivelandscape? In particular, some of the growth initiatives at G&K or maybewith ARAMARK now being private for a couple of quarters, maybe aggressivelyattacking the cost structure but also being aggressive with pricing? Anythingyou are seeing with those two or any other competitors that are changing thelandscape?
William C. Gale: Chris, to the best of my knowledge, it is more of a macroissue than it is a competitive issue. 
Chris Gutek - MorganStanley: Okay. Switching gears, so the CapEx budget, it looks likeyou guys have raised it by $10 million versus your guidance in the previousquarter. In the context of economists seeming to think there is a 50-50 chanceof a recession and therefore maybe a little bit slower growth, a little bitless need for new plants in the short to medium term, is this really beingdriven by the emerging businesses or what else -- is anything else impactingthat CapEx budget increase?
William C. Gale: It’s being driven primarily by the emerging businesses. Tocontinue to accommodate that rapid growth and the potential that exists there,we’ve increased the level of expected spending, primarily in the emergingbusinesses. We really haven’t reduced anything in the traditional businessesbut we are seeing opportunities to expand presence in the emerging ones. 
Chris Gutek - MorganStanley: Okay, and in terms of acquisitions, could you elaborate abit on the updated thinking regarding Europe and I guess starting with how yourone acquisition so far is performing? I know it’s early but a quick update there.And then what the next couple of quarters or next year or so would look like interms of maybe expanding off that base in Europe. 
William C. Gale: Well, to remind everyone, we made the European acquisitionright at the end of July and just announced it, of course, in September. It’s arelatively insignificant acquisition but it does give us the presence overthere.  At this point in time, we have no further announcements tomake with regard to acquisitions either having been concluded outside of NorthAmerica or pending, but I will tell you that our corporate development groupcontinues to be active in looking at opportunities but as we stated inSeptember, we’re going to approach this conservatively and we’re going to makesure that we understand the environment over there before we put a lot ofcapital into Europe or even in other parts of the world.  But we continue to be pleased with the results of ouracquisition, albeit only for a couple of months, in The Netherlands. We arevery pleased with the management team we have there and they are being veryhelpful to our corporate development group here at corporate in looking foradditional opportunities, and I would expect there to be something concludedduring calendar ’08 as far as further acquisitions. But at this time, it’s hardfor me to predict when that will take place. 
Chris Gutek - MorganStanley: Okay, great. And then my final quick question; what interestrates were you paying on your old commercial paper program, now that you’ve gotthis new $250 million of senior debt?
William C. Gale: Well, commercial paper interest of course fluctuates on aday-to-day basis but it was certainly less than the 10-year rate we’re payingbut we made a decision with the board’s concurrence and with our advisors thatit was prudent to lock in 10-year money at the rates that we obtained. So it isbuilt into our guidance that the higher interest costs that we would pay overthe commercial paper but it gives us more certainty and it also helps I thinkwith our ratings and making sure that we have adequate cash available andcredit line available to withstand anything that might come down the line. 
Chris Gutek - MorganStanley: Okay, great. Thanks, Bill. 
Operator: Thank you. We’ll not take our next question from BruceSimpson with William Blair. 
Bruce Simpson -William Blair: Will you anticipate an increase in the dollar amount of yourinterest moving forward, given the aggressive stance on share repurchases, oris that kind of mitigated by free cash flow?
William C. Gale: Well, what do you mean? In our guidance, we’ve assumedobviously a certain level of interest expense and we never anticipate anyfurther repurchases when we provide you guidance. 
Bruce Simpson -William Blair: Okay, did you give us a full year guidance expectation forthe interest, the dollar amount of interest you’ll spend this year, interestexpense?
William C. Gale: No, no, we don’t get into that level of detail, Bruce. 
Bruce Simpson -William Blair: Okay, let’s attack it from this angle. You posted about $13million this quarter and the prior quarter. Would you expect that to increasematerially, given that you spent a couple hundred million in the quarter onshare repurchases?
Michael L. Thompson: No, it would not increase materially. 
Bruce Simpson -William Blair: Okay, and then again, kind of a nit on modeling here for thetax rate, is that likely to be a situation where you have kind of a catch-uprate in the fourth quarter that brings the full year rate down to the 37.3?
Michael L. Thompson: Actually, you’ll have a catch-up we expect more in the thirdquarter than the fourth quarter. 
Bruce Simpson -William Blair: Okay. Mike, could you go over, I couldn’t quite keep up withsome of the puts and takes on SG&A on both a sequential and annual basis,with specifics about medical costs. 
Michael L. Thompson: Okay. Again, selling -- our selling and administrativeexpenses on a percent of sales basis were 28% even, which was down from 28.6%in Q1, so in comparing to Q1, the 60 basis point improvement was due to adecrease in professional service fees and medical costs, and also payroll taxesbecause we are later in the individual calendar year for taxes -- onindividuals, that’s a seasonal thing we get every year. So those were the keypieces for the leverage from Q1.  If you go back to last year, there was about a 110 basispoint increase, which is primarily the investment in our sales organization.The other piece last year, if you’ll recall in Q2 we had a spike in medicalcosts. That’s come back down more in line with where it traditionally is,although over the years, it tends to increase but as compared to last year,it’s more a traditional level but increases in legal and professional fees andsome other small increases in administrative costs offset that improvement inmedical. 
Bruce Simpson -William Blair: So when you think about the absolute dollar amount ofSG&A moving forward, typically it rises through the year, I thinkparticularly into the fourth quarter and now you’ve had kid of a flat level.Integrating what you expect the impact of project one team to be here, as youhave your typical increase in sales as we head into the back half of yourfiscal year, are you anticipating a little bit more leverage than you ordinarilyget out of your SG&A? That is to say, will SG&A be a little bit flatteror even down from here?
Michael L. Thompson: We expect, and I’m not sure on each quarter to quarterbasis, but we expect SG&A to continue to be leveraged on a percent of salesbasis. The absolute dollars, I think -- as I think I indicated last quarter, I’d model it more on a percent tosale basis and show some improvement versus trying to get the absolute dollarsbecause a lot of it is driven by top line. 
Bruce Simpson - WilliamBlair: Okay, and then the last thing I have, just to return to theoverall economic macro picture for a moment, can you give us just a little bitmore color beyond saying customers are cautious? Are there particular regionsof the country? Is that automotive driven or Midwest driven or housing driven?So that we can understand where demand is ebbing and flowing. 
William C. Gale: Pretty much seeing it across the board, Bruce. And again, Idon’t want to overplay this but it is certainly a little more sluggish than Iwould like to see but it is not confined just to the Midwest anymore. It seemsto be generally across the spectrum. 
Bruce Simpson -William Blair: Okay, thanks. 
Operator: Thank you. (Operator Instructions) We’ll move on to ScottSchneeberger with CIBC World Markets. 
Scott Schneeberger -CIBC World Markets: Thanks. Bill, just following up on the economy question, youhad mentioned before that the guidance for the year assumes a gradualimprovement in the economy and then you said subsequent to that, that you stillfeel pretty good. Should we be concerned about the outlook changing if thingscontinue to dampen going forward? Just a little bit more color on thosecomments. 
William C. Gale: Well, I think all I’m trying to signal is that we did notsee the amount of activity we would like to have seen with our existingcustomers this past quarter, and so while I continue to expect the economy toimprove, it is safe to say that if all of a sudden we start seeing a tremendousnumber of lay-offs and companies just being very, very conservative, it’s goingto have an impact on our business and I just hope that what we saw maybe hereover the last couple of months is not indicative of what might be coming downthe line but it certainly makes me want to just alert you guys that okay, ifthis does happen, if we do go into a recession, that’s going to have an impacton our businesses. 
Michael L. Thompson: I think on top of that, I think also when you look back, ourQ4 and our Q1 lost business and add-stops ratios had kind of solidified, so tospeak. They hadn’t gotten much better but they hadn’t gotten worse. Thisquarter, they took a turn and just again, with the conversations we’ve had withcustomers, with investors and analyst, et cetera, just the general mood is arewe heading into a recession? At this point, we haven’t seen that in our numbersbut we haven’t seen a slight downturn, so we wanted to alert you to that. 
Scott Schneeberger -CIBC World Markets: Okay, thanks. That’s helpful. Turning now to some of the costlines, legal fees have been bouncing around for you recently. You mentionedthat that was offset in the quarter by some positives in medical. Could youspeak about legal fees, how material they are, what direction they’ll go goingforward?
William C. Gale: Well, we’re not going to get into that level of detail,Scott, but legal fees are erratic because depending on where you are inparticular cases, you can ratchet up your costs quite heavily in a particularquarter, if you’re into discovery mode or getting ready for a trial or whathave you.  My expectation is that we will have probably similar levelsof legal fees for the next quarter or two and then, barring any new significantactions, we would expect the legal fees to start declining as a percent ofsales. 
Scott Schneeberger -CIBC World Markets: Thanks, that’s helpful. And then one final one for costs,could you speak a little bit to fuel, what you saw in the quarter, maybe as apercent of revenue and how that’s trending and looking into this presentquarter?
William C. Gale: We have analyzed that. Mike’s got it. He’ll share it withyou. 
Michael L. Thompson: It’s essentially flat year over year and quarter to quarter.We did see some movement in November with some diesel prices coming up, soreally we were looking at it being slightly down for the quarter coming intothe month of November, but diesel costs spiked up a little bit. So overall, wewere flat and don’t see any changes on the horizon other than we’re going towatch that diesel costs. 
William C. Gale: The diesel fuel worries us a bit because about 70% of ourfleet is diesel and that did really take a spike up. Fortunately, we saw areduction in natural gas pricing, which helped offset it a little bit but goingforward, if we don’t see a reduction in the diesel expense, that’s going tohave a little pressure on margins. 
Michael L. Thompson: All right. Thanks so much. 
Operator: Thank you. We’ll now move on to Brandt Sakakeeny withDeutsche Bank.
Brandt Sakakeeny -Deutsche Bank: Actually, most of my questions have been answered but I didjust want to ask you a little bit about the pricing environment on therenewals, because I remember just last cycle that that was sort of the tougherenvironment. Can you just give a little comment about how that’s been so far?
William C. Gale: As I mentioned earlier, maybe you didn’t hear, we arecontinuing to see a very competitive situation on renewals. Our competitors arevery active in trying to convince our customers at the end of their contractterms to go with them as opposed to stay with us, and so they tend to beaggressive on pricing. And we are obviously going to be aggressive back inorder to maintain the business.  So it is a situation where I think everyone is going aftershare with the existing customers and we are having to meet competition in manycases. 
Brandt Sakakeeny -Deutsche Bank: Okay, great, and just finally with the add-stop and the lostbusiness trends, did those deteriorate through the quarter or were they justfairly soft throughout the quarter? Did they behave in any specific way?
William C. Gale: I think it’s tough to really pinpoint. You know, you lookout at weeks through the quarter, you’ll see ups and downs. I would just say generally the trendline was slightlydown. 
Brandt Sakakeeny -Deutsche Bank: Okay, but I think I heard you right in saying that newbusiness through the quarter actually accelerated and peaked in November. 
William C. Gale: Yeah, it did. Right. 
Brandt Sakakeeny -Deutsche Bank: Okay, perfect. Thank you. 
Operator: Thank you. And we’ll now take our next question in the queuefrom Greg Halter with Great Lakes Review.
Greg Halter - GreatLakes Review: Good morning. Relative to energy costs, I know in the pastyou’ve discussed the fact that you haven’t used any sort of formalized hedgingprograms. Any change in that thought process?
William C. Gale: At this time, Greg, no, there has been no change. Wecontinue to believe that the way we are doing it is the best way right now.
Greg Halter - GreatLakes Review: All right. And relative to the share repurchase, I know youare back in the market. I just wondered if you could provide some level ofinput there, given your average was I think 36.73 and with the stock lower thanthat now, what your appetite is on the share repurchase going forward. And ifyou were to use up the final $220 million plus, whatever it is, what theappetite is for the board to increase that going forward. 
William C. Gale: I cannot speak for the board, so I’ll have to avoid thatquestion. Obviously we have direction from the board on how they want us tofulfill the authorization. I’m not at liberty to discuss that but given ourpast history, I think you’ll see that we’ve been very conservative in our approachand we’ll -- I don’t see any reason to change that. 
Greg Halter - GreatLakes Review: All right, and one last one, new goods inventories were upabout 10% on a year-over-year basis. Can you get into the reasons for thatincrease, which is somewhat higher than your sales growth, or revenue growth?
William C. Gale: I think a lot of that is due to a couple of specificcustomer rollouts that are ongoing in our direct sale business. You build up alot of garments for a big customer rollout and then it takes a while for thecustomer to roll that out.  The other thing is that we launched what we call the new bigbook in our direct sale business this past fall, early in the fall. What thatdoes is that’s done every couple of years and it’s like a -- you know, the newproduct offerings that we are going to provide to the top end uniformpurchasers, the hotels, the gaming, et cetera, and there is always a build-upin anticipation of that big book being rolled out. So that’s being done.  And I guess the third thing is that we talked in the pastabout some of our new products, like the cargo pant that we are now providingin many of our rental programs and there’s been a ramp-up in some of thoseofferings in order to make sure we have it. And then that obviously supportssome of our new business efforts. As you can see, the new business wasreasonably good.  So I’d say those were the three major reasons. 
Greg Halter - GreatLakes Review: All right, and I did have another one; relative to thecapital spending in technology and so forth, are you continuing to make anyin-roads on the RFID side, as well as installing additional garment sortationsystems?
William C. Gale: Garment sortation systems are generally becoming the rule ofthumb in most of our new plants, so that’s pretty much a standard requirementof new plants. The RFID continues to be a series of pluses and minuses. We’reabout ready to launch a new test with a new chip in one of our facilities herethis coming year. The old chip that we were using did not withstand theindustrial process to give us the readability we needed, but we continue tobelieve in the technology. We just haven’t been able to prove it out yet. 
Greg Halter - GreatLakes Review: Okay, great. Thank you. 
Operator: Thank you. We’ll now move to Michel Morin with MerrillLynch.
Michel Morin -Merrill Lynch: A couple of questions; first, I just want to make sure Iunderstand, in terms of the fire protection installations, has that typicallytracked commercial construction spending? Is that kind of what’s been impactingthe business of late? 
William C. Gale: Yes, it certainly is tied to new business construction. 
Michel Morin -Merrill Lynch: Okay, great. And then secondly, I want to try to tie thesoftness that you’ve seen in the add-stop and in the lost business with thestrong catalog sales. Is that an unusual development, that you are seeingdivergent trends there? Or are they just simply not correlated?
William C. Gale: I don’t think they are really correlated. You know, Michel,maybe over a longer period of time, there might be some correlation, but Iwouldn’t draw any conclusions with one quarter. Because we can launch variousmarketing initiatives and incentive programs, et cetera, for those type ofsales, so I’d hate to draw any conclusions from that. 
Michael L. Thompson: Yeah, and just to be clear, those are the sales that ourSSRs, or sales service representatives or our route drivers are making versusour individual sales reps that are selling new business. 
Michel Morin -Merrill Lynch: Right, but still, these are sales that are being done toyour existing account base and they are cutting back workers or they arechurning out, so that’s why I’m a bit surprised to see that divergent trend,but okay. And then finally, just to follow-up on the previous question aboutthe buy backs and the appetite for further buy backs, I guess maybe spinning itanother way is what’s the thinking or has there been some increased thinkingaround the dividend and perhaps increasing the pay out?
William C. Gale: There certainly is discussion about our dividend policy andI’m not at liberty to disclose those discussions but the board is looking atthat, as well as other ideas and I would say just we’ll see what happens. 
Michel Morin - MerrillLynch: Great. Thanks very much, guys. 
Operator: Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. Mr.Gale, Mr. Thompson, I’ll turn the conference back over to you for final oradditional comments. 
William C. Gale: Well, thank you, everyone. I appreciate you all joining usthis morning. We did it this morning knowing that many of you are lookingforward to getting away for the holidays, so on a final note, Mike and I andthe entire Cintas team want to wish you and your families a very happy holidayand a prosperous 2008. We’ll look forward to speaking with you again in Marchwhen we release our third quarter results. 
Operator: That does conclude today’s program. We thank you for attendingand have a great day.

Operator: Please stand by. Good day everyone and thank you for you patience and standing by and welcome to the Cintas Quarterly Earning Results Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I will turn things over to Mr. Bill Gale, Senior Vice President of Finance and Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead, sir.
William C. Gale - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Good evening and thank you for joining us tonight. With me this evening is Mike Thompson, Cintas's Vice President and Treasurer. The Company reported revenues and net income inline with its plan for the year. Revenues increased 6% over the first quarter of last fiscal year to $969 million. Earnings per share were $0.51 this year compared to $0.53 in the first quarter of last year. Last year’s numbers included a credit, due to the adoption of FAS 123R with a change in the forfeiture rate. This year’s results include a more normalized expense related to share based payments as well as higher legal and professional services. Additionally, as we have explain previously, Cintas has adopted a new sales organization, that in the short-run will have an increased investment in selling expense, but should result in higher growth in all business segments. Net income was $81 million, representing 8.4% of revenue. Rental gross margins were approximately the same as last year, while other services gross margins continue to improve as the emerging businesses are First Aid & Safety and Document Management continue to grow at very exciting rates. In fact, we have expanded our segment data to give more visibility to these newer businesses as they are having a larger impact on our results. As you review the supplement data included in our release, please note the split of other services to the following. Uniform direct sales, which also includes our catalog business sold on our rental routes, First Aid & Safety and Fire protection and Document Management. Mike will talk more about these in his comments. Organic growth in our rental business did improve modestly from the fourth quarter last year. We expect that organic growth should continue to improve as we move throughout the year barring any significant economic downturn. As mentioned in the release, we are excited to announce that Cintas has made a modest entry into Europe with it’s acquisition of an outstanding document management company based in the Netherlands, Certo Information Management. While this company is small it provides us with an excellent opportunity to expand in Europe, potentially not only with document management services but also with some of our other service offerings. Our current guidance of revenues and earnings per share for the fiscal year ending May 31st, 2008 remains unchanged and calls for total revenues of $3.9 billion to $4.1 billion and diluted EPS of $2.15 to $2.25. With the end of our quiet period in conjunction with this earnings release and with our strong balance sheet, we will be able to resume share repurchases under the parameters provided to us by the Board of Directors under the remaining $420 million authorized amount. The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a Safe Harbor from civil litigation for forward-looking statements. This conference call contains forward-looking statements that reflect the Company’s current views as to future events and financial performance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ materially from those we may discuss. I refer you to the discussion on these points contained in our most recent filings with the SEC. I will now turn the call over to Mike, who will discuss this quarter’s results in more detail. We will then be happy to answer your questions.
Michael L. Thompson - Vice President and Treasurer: Thanks Bill and good evening everyone. Total revenues were $969.1 million for the quarter, a 6% increase over that reported in the prior year. Internal growth was 4.2% during the first quarter, which is comparable to our internal growth rate for the fourth quarter of fiscal, 2007. Weakness in our direct sales business was offset by improved internal growth in our repetitive service businesses including our Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products operating segment. As a reminder, our first quarter had 66 work days, the same number of work days as the first quarter of fiscal 2007. For the remainder of fiscal 2008, the work days will be as follows; for the second quarter, 65 work days which is the same as the second quarter from fiscal 2007. Third quarter will have 65 work days which is one more work day than the third quarter of fiscal 2007 and 65 days… work days in the fourth quarter which is one less work day in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007. As Bill mentioned, we now report our results in four operating segments as well as the corporate segment. The largest of the operating segments is our Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products segment. Previously titled rentals this segment reflects the rental and servicing of uniforms and other garments, mats, mops, shop towels and other related items. We also provide restroom and Hygiene products and services within the segment. We are the largest provider of both, corporate identity uniforms and facility services in North America. No change has been made to this segment other than we have renamed it the segment to more properly describe the services provided within it. Uniform ancillary product revenues were $710.4 million for the quarter compared to $687.7 million in the first quarter last year, a 3.3% increase. Factoring out acquisitions made over the last 12 months, our rental organic growth rate was 3% for the first quarter, which is an improvement over the 2.5% internal growth in fourth quarter of last year. This growth is in line with our internal first quarter projections. The organization of the new sales structure is complete and we are seeing positive results. All positions under the new structure have been filled at all levels and our new sales representatives are gaining experience and expertise. New business leading indicators continue to be positive with sales force turnover continuing to remain below historical levels. Sales representative productivity continues to improve as new sales professionals gain experience and build their sales pipeline. Communication across the sales organization is improved and cross selling activity has strengthened. External economic pressure exists as traditional Uniform line industries continue to experience declines in employment levels. We would characterize the current economic conditions as being fairly consistent with that experienced in our fourth quarter of last year. In spite of this external pressure, we continue to grow our Rental Uniform and Ancillary Products operating segment. This has been achieved by consistently expanding our serve market and by providing Rental customers with additional products and services such as entrance mats, restroom supplies and restroom cleaning services. While we expect the economic headwind will continue, we believe the continued maturation of our new sales organization will combine with our focus on customer service to result an improving revenue growth as we move through fiscal 2008. Our Uniform direct sales operating segment incorporates our national account sales division, which directs sales Uniforms, Rental promotional products, other related products, to national and large regional customers and our direct sales catalog which direct sales uniform and related products primarily to local customers who also rent products from us. During the first quarter, this business grew 1.5%. Organic growth for this business was also 1.5%. Sales within our national account sales division have softened. Unlike our prior two fiscal years, there have been very few program rollouts with our existing customers in the hospitality and gaming industries. This business tends to be a choppier business as customers decide when and how often to institute new image programs. We expect the softness… the softness in this business to continue in the near-term. Our third operating segment is First Aid & Safety and Fire Protection services. Within this business, we provide on-site delivery of first aid products, safety products, and automatic defibrillators, and we provide safety trend for our customers and employees. We inspect, repair, and recharge portable fire extinguishers and sprinkler systems and we provide and service emergency lighting systems and kitchen fire suppression systems. We are the largest on-site providers of First Aid & Safety products in North America and the second largest providers of Fire Protecting services. During the quarter revenues within our First Aid & Safety and Fire Protection operating segment grew 15.8%. On an organic basis, this segment grew approximately 8% as compared to approximately 10% in the fourth quarter of last year. Within Fire Protection, we sell and install certain fire suppression systems. The timing of the sell of these products and the related installations while intertwined with our other services within this space, are closer to our direct sale business than to the repetitive nature of most other sales within this segment. A combination of a large number of these installations in the fourth… in the first quarter of last fiscal year and fewer installations in first quarter of this fiscal year have caused the internal growth of this segment to the client. While the internal growth for this segment was below our expectations for the first quarter, we continue to believe this division will reach our double digit internal growth expectation for the year. We continue to make strategic acquisitions within this segment, with a particular focus and expanding geographic coverage of our Fire Protection business. As with our other businesses, we believe a full national presence will provide us with unique opportunities with large national customers and prospects. Our Document Management services operating segment is comprised mainly of document striding services, although, we do have some storage capabilities. Revenues within this operating service continue to grow at a very rapid rate and we are now the third largest providers of Document Management services in North America. First quarter revenues for the Document Management operating segment increased 78.1%. Internal growth for the segment was 43% in the first quarter, which is comparable to the 44% internal growth achieved during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007. Paper prices have been very strong and do play a contributing factor to the internal growth rates. However, excluding these high paper prices, our shredding service revenue continues to be very strong, posting internal growth rates in the high 30s. We also continued to make strategic document management acquisitions in this business, with an emphasis on gaining full national coverage in the United States and Canada. As mentioned previously in the discussion of our Fire business, we believe a true national presence in all of our business services will provide us unique opportunities towards national customers and prospects. As Bill mentioned in his opening comments, we have now also expanded our Document Management business beyond North America, while the revenues from the Certo acquisition are not material to Cintas as a whole. This acquisition provides us with a very well run company in a fast growing industry. In addition to focusing on operating and growing this business, we hope to gain valuable experience in running an international operation. While we learn from operating this business, we will also continue to evaluate international opportunities and document management, as well as our other lines of business. Total company margins of 43.1%, improved 40 basis points, as compared to 42.7% in the first quarter of 2007 and we are comparable to the 42.9% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007. Improvement over the first quarter of last year was due to the continued improvement and emerging business margins. Our Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products gross margin was 44.9% of revenue for the first quarter, which is very comparable to the 45% gross margin in the first quarter of fiscal 2007 and the slight improvement over the 44.7% gross margin in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007. Other services gross margin improved 230 basis points over the first quarter of fiscal 2007, but down 40 basis points as compared to the prior year fourth quarter. The significant improvement in margins comes from the continued rapid growth in the First Aid, Safety and Fire and Document Management businesses. Margins in these businesses continue to improve, as they grow and cover infrastructure cost. This improvement can be seen in our new segment data with First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection margins improving 200 basis points and Document Management margins improving 120 basis points over the first quarter of last year. The 40 basis points decline in other services gross margin from last year's fourth quarter was due to lower revenues in our national accounts sales division. The significant growth within Fire Protection Services and Document Management Services is allowing us to gain scale in this business, driving margins higher. We expect other services gross margin higher. We expect other services gross margin to continue to improve, as these businesses continue to grow and achieve scale. Selling and Administrative expenses were 28.6% of revenue for the quarter, as compared to 26.7% for the first quarter of fiscal 2007. On a percent of sale basis, approximately 75% of the increase was increased selling expenses, resulting from the additional investment in our sales force. In reviewing our new segment information, you will notice the large amount of investment, we are making in our management infrastructure and our sales efforts within the First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection and Document Management emerging businesses. As our new sales organization gains momentum over the entire organization, we expect selling cost to begin to turn back to more traditional levels. The majority of the remaining 50 basis point increase in selling and administrative expense, related to an increase in legal and professional service fees. Also as a reminder, in last year's first quarter, we adopted FAS 123R share based payments and performed the detailed analysis of share based payment factors and assumptions including forfeitures. That analysis resulted in a cumulative adjustment that benefited the first quarter of last year by approximately $2.2 million. Going forward, we expect to have a more comparable year-over-year results. Selling and administrative expenses were 28.6% in the quarter versus 26.8% for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007. Selling costs were up 30 basis points due to the investment in new sales structure, as we expected. During the fourth quarter of last year, we booked $6.2 million of miscellaneous income when we exited a forward starting swap. An increase in reserve for accounts receivable with traditional increases during our first quarter due to slower collections and the increase in legal and professional service fees were the other factors contributing to the increase. Net interest cost were 1.2% of revenue this quarter, consistent with both the first quarter and fourth quarters of last year. Our effective tax rate was 37.3% for the quarter, again consistent with last year. Net income for the quarter was $81.1 million and earnings per diluted share were $0.51 per share. While these figures represented a decline from last year they are in line with the projections for the year. Moving on to our balance sheet and cash flow, both remain strong. Our current ratio is 4.5 to 1. This ratio increased significantly since May 31st, mainly due to changes required in conjunction with our adoption of FIN 48, accounting for uncertainty and income taxes and interpretation of FASB statement number 109, which I will discuss in a moment. Cash and marketable securities decreased approximately $17 million, as we used maturing marketable securities to pre-fund VIVA account for medical benefits. DSOs and accounts receivables were 40, which is slightly higher than at May 31, 2007. Accrued compensation and related liabilities declined approximately $28 million as four less work days were required to be accrued at August 31st versus May 31st. Short-term accrued liabilities decreased due to the annual pre-funding of our VIVA medical account, our annual profit sharing and 401-K matching… match funding and timing on bond interest payments. Long-term debt at August 31, 2007 was $881 million. Total debt as a percentage of total book capitalization was 28.2%. Our long-term debt consists of $475 million in public debt, $393 million in outstanding commercial paper and $13 million of other bank debt. Throughout the first quarter, we were able to issue commercial paper at attractive rates experiencing solid demand. We suspended our share buyback programs throughout the first quarter while we considered various alternatives to enhance shareholder value. We have approximately $420 million of authorization under our share buyback program and we intend to be back in the market moving forward. As I mentioned, we adopted FIN or FIN 48 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes and interpretation of FASB statement number 109, effective June 1, the beginning of our fiscal year. Upon adoption, an entry was made to decrease opening retained earnings by approximately $14 million and a corresponding increase was recorded in the tax liability. Also as a result of adoption, our short-term deferred tax liability at May 31st was separated into its deferred tax asset component and a FIN 48 reserve. The total FIN 48 reserve on the liability side of the balance sheet is separated into its long and short-term components within accrued liabilities. Cash provided by operations was $57 million for the quarter when combined with the net marketable securities that matured during the quarter; we were able to finance $45 million in capital expenditures and $33 million in acquisitions without taking on additional debt. We continue to expect capital expenditures for the year to be between $170 million and $190 million. During the quarter we spent approximately $33 million acquiring mainly Fire Protection service and Document Shredding businesses. Going forward, we expect operating cash flows to remain strong. With that we will now open the call for any questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. And first with JP Morgan we go to Mike Fox.
Michael Fox - J.P. Morgan: Good afternoon. Just a couple of quick ones. When you look at the Fire Protection business and the Document Management business, you talked about the margins should increase as you gain national scale. Can you talk about how bigger geographic presence you guys have today and how long you think it will take to get national?
Michael L. Thompson - Vice President and Treasurer: Certainly. In Document Management, we are in approximately 80 of the top 100 markets, obviously expanding very quickly in that space. Fire went approximately 60 of the top 100 markets. So, as we continue to expand, we will get further acquisitions to enhance that and then also greenfield startups where there is not an acquisition opportunity available.
Michael Fox - J.P. Morgan: Again with regard to the document management business, have you noticed any increase or decrease in the multiple that you guys have been paying?
William C. Gale - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Probably, they have come down a bit, Mike, as we have basically, I think, established the presence in the major city that we wanted and bought some of the better companies. Now, as we look for other acquisition opportunities, we can take a little harder line and I think that you would probably, these are multiples down slightly from what they have been initially.
Michael Fox - J.P. Morgan: Okay. And then with regard to the international acquisition, can you give us an idea of kind of a timeframe what you guys are looking at as far as when you might grow that business or start to make more acquisitions there?
William C. Gale - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Well, we are going to certainly be opportunistic in looking at when things become available. I would say, we don’t have a definitive plan that we want to be certain size in any particular period of time, but we are very aggressive in trying to understand the market over there. The management team that came with this acquisition is very well known on continent in this business and therefore will be very helpful to us as we expand. And I would say, it's just a matter of time and the right opportunities presenting themselves because we are committed pretty much to moving forward with this business over there.
Michael Fox - J.P. Morgan: Okay. And can you talk about, you guys have been… a lot of other… a lot of businesses for a long time and this is certainly one of your newer businesses, and venturing to Europe. Can you talk about, why you chose to go into Europe with the Document Management business, as apposed to some of the other businesses that you are in?
William C. Gale - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Yes. The primary reason, Mike is the fact that the laws in Europe regarding privacy are just slightly behind with the laws in the U.S. and Canada have been. Therefore we believe, we are really in the forefront as this industry really starts taking hold in Europe. The other reason for doing document management is that as evidenced by what we have been able to achieve the first… the last couple of years in Document Management here. We believe that it is a very rapid growing company, a very rapid growing industry that we can take advantage of, doesn’t require significant capital investment and is a pretty quick start up as far as the ability to obtain, enough business to start making profits really quickly.
Michael Fox - J.P. Morgan: Okay, great. Thanks a lot.
Operator: Next we move on to Mike Schneider with Robert W. Baird.
Michael Schneider - Robert W. Baird: Hi, good evening guys.
William C. Gale - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Hi, Mike.
Michael Schneider - Robert W. Baird: First, I guess, you had mentioned you are suspending the share repurchase program as a result of the strategic review. I guess that’s news to me. Can you tell us what you were exploring and indeed what you concluded?
Michael L. Thompson - Vice President and Treasurer: Mike as we have stated in the past, I really can’t get into any details or any specifics. What I can tell you is that we did spend time looking at various alternatives and now that we have finished that. We are ready to reenter the market in our own open purchases like we under the authorization that we have.
Michael Schneider - Robert W. Baird: So, the review is complete and presumably no actions that would interfere with buying back stock?
Michael L. Thompson - Vice President and Treasurer: Well, at least for right now it is and I think when you say complete, obviously, it’s come to a conclusion that enables us to get back into the market, but our Board is always committed to looking for ways to enhance share holder value.
Michael Schneider - Robert W. Baird: Okay. And on the organic growth in the rental division, take that as slightly sequentially. Can you give us a sense when you look at the components of growth, was that primarily driven by new sales account growth, accelerating sequentially?
Michael L. Thompson - Vice President and Treasurer: Yes, yes. Michael, I would say that the other drivers, when you take lost business at stops and price increases, I would say that’s very comparable to the fourth quarter in nature. And I would say that the growth is predominantly from the new business increase.
Michael Schneider - Robert W. Baird: Okay. And looking forward now, this Project One Team, as it relates just to the rental division. What are those factors do you expected to have the most impact, because I presume they could impact, certainly attrition rates and new business sales. But I am curious as to what you are targeting to experience the biggest benefit from Project One Team?
Michael L. Thompson - Vice President and Treasurer: Yes. I think it is going to affect all the components. I think the first one that we are targeting, obviously is the new business side because that’s where the focus one with the new sales organization, but certainly as we talk from the past, a significant reason to go to this organization was to allow our local management teams to focus on the servicing of customers and looking at ways to lower the amount of lost business and stops that are occurring. So, we hope to see it across the Board, but I would say, if you had to rank them the new business would be the first driver there?
Michael Schneider - Robert W. Baird: Okay. And then kind of different way, when you look at your different product lines now, what product like do you think stands the benefit most from Project One Team?
Michael L. Thompson - Vice President and Treasurer: I think out of the gate first, it’s the other services emerging businesses because you are bringing a lot of customers to that with Fire and Document Management especially, Fire. If you have a lot of customers that we have that you can use that service when you have thousand business customers, most of this are in a rental business as you know. So, I think out of the gate those emerging businesses should have the best opportunity, but we also believe this new sales organization… for the fact that we talked about previously are going to benefit all of the divisions.
Michael Schneider - Robert W. Baird: Okay. Then final question on Rental, you mentioned the sales force attrition or internal where it was below historical levels and that productivity was improving, but is productivity actually back to historic norms or above or below it?
Michael L. Thompson - Vice President and Treasurer: Productivity is I would say slightly above historical levels but you got to look at… depending on how you cut it with the tenure of the sales force. You can’t look at us at sales reps within their first year of higher and really get a field because that they are showing a base of nine to 12 months as you know.
Michael Schneider - Robert W. Baird: So, in other words, Mike, you are saying that the more tenured sales people are achieving productivity level today that are higher than what they were historically?
Michael L. Thompson - Vice President and Treasurer: Right.
Michael Schneider - Robert W. Baird: But because of the mix of our sales people, you know, we have a lot of newer sales people, so it hard to drive conclusion on the total sales.
Michael L. Thompson - Vice President and Treasurer: Yes, especially, when we promote a lot of those manager… sales reps in the managerial type of positions.
Michael Schneider - Robert W. Baird: Okay, that’s helpful. And then switching out the services and thank you for the detail on the segmentation… very helpful. When you look year-over-year, the First Aid and Safety margins have basically been flat just over 10% on an operating basis, yet Document Management is more nearly doubled say from 5% to 11%, can you give us a sense as to what that will look like going forward? Is there some reasons structurally that First Aid has yet to have a gain leverage or is there some reason that Document Management would maybe experience less leverage going forward?
Michael L. Thompson - Vice President and Treasurer: I would say that really the movement within the First Aid, Fire and Safety business, you have got a lot of fire locations that are coming online and we hope to increase the profitability there. I think as you can see we believe that the Document Management business is a very strong business, both from a growth and a profitability standpoint. Well, I continue to skyrocket each and others, it’s going to be upper limit obviously, but as we have been able to gain scale a lot quicker in that business just because of the effect businesses it is than we have in the Fire Protection Services business.
Michael Schneider - Robert W. Baird: Okay. Thank you again.
Operator: Move on to Brandt Sakakeeny with Deutsche Bank.
Brandt Sakakeeny - Deutsche Bank Securities: Just, I have got a couple quick house keeping items. First, do you have the stock comp for the quarter?
Michael L. Thompson - Vice President and Treasurer: I am sorry, I missed that. Can you repeat?
Brandt Sakakeeny - Deutsche Bank Securities: Yes, do you have the stock compensation charge for the quarter?
Michael L. Thompson - Vice President and Treasurer: Stock compensation?
Brandt Sakakeeny - Deutsche Bank Securities: Yes. Please.
William C. Gale - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: It’s about $2 million.
Brandt Sakakeeny - Deutsche Bank Securities: Okay, great. And then, obviously, you have done a good job in cost control particularly given what we have seen in fuel prices any color there? Are you able to pass those fuel price increases on to customers through better pricing or absorbing it or just sort of managing that better?
Michael L. Thompson - Vice President and Treasurer: The fuel price systems sales are about comparable to the first quarter of last year. We were at about 3.4% both in the first quarter of last year and the first quarter of this year. So, we haven’t seen any appreciable change from what we have experienced. In fact, it was about 3.4% in the fourth quarter of this last fiscal year. So, as a result, I would tell you that we were able a year ago to pass on… a year to 18 months ago to pass on some of these cost increases through to our customers. And that’s why our price increases were a little bit higher as we talked through in fiscal ’06. Right now though the cost of fuel are basically comparable to what they had been. So, there really hasn’t been a dramatic change there.
Brandt Sakakeeny - Deutsche Bank Securities: Okay, great. And then I think you talked to the ratio being flattish I think relative to the prior quarter. Did you see any behavior either in the months that might make you think that either things were improving or perhaps eroding a little bit at all and the numbers or was it even possible to get that granular?
William C. Gale - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: We look at it every week and I would tell you based on my review; there is not enough fluctuation to really tip say there is a directional change in any one month versus the other.
Brandt Sakakeeny - Deutsche Bank Securities: Okay, great. Finally, I guess any potential impact or color on the GM strike. I mean, I know obviously, autos are a big percentage, although, it’s not necessarily the OEMs. Do you expect anything favorable to come out of that or potentially unfavorable?
William C. Gale - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: We had very little business with General Motors. I am sure we had some business with some of their suppliers but the impact is negligible to Cintas. Going forward, I guess the health of the auto industry if it’s improved as a result of this settlement will certainly help our business here in the U.S. and Canada.
Brandt Sakakeeny - Deutsche Bank Securities: Okay, great. I am sorry; finally, can you remind us what you had left on the authorization?
William C. Gale - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: $420 million.
Brandt Sakakeeny - Deutsche Bank Securities: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Now, onto your question from Scott Schneeberger, with CIBC World Markets
Scott Schneeberger - CIBC World Markets: Just a question on the pricing environment out there for Uniform Rental, are you seeing… you said it looks like solid sequential improvement in the organic growth. What do you see on the pricing front there?
Michael L. Thompson - Vice President and Treasurer: I would say it’s a very competitive marketplace, especially, with large national type customers.
Scott Schneeberger - CIBC World Markets: Okay. Thanks. And I guess looking down at the cost line; you had stated that heightened legal expenses had an impact in the quarter. Is that union related, perhaps related to your incident in Tulsa? Is that something I guess bottom line question here is that something that’s going to persist, how should we think about that going forward?
Michael L. Thompson - Vice President and Treasurer: Good question, Scott. It’s a… it’s basically all of the above, it had some costs associated with the incident in Tulsa, as well as the law suits that we disclosed in our 10-K
William C. Gale - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: There was a heightened period of discovery this past several months. So, I think that could have some impact on it. However, I would say that legal expenses are going to continue to be high as we… as these cases move themselves through the court system. And then we had some other professional services that we incurred that would probably not be repeated, so I would hope that overall we would see an improvement in the SG&A as we move forward through the year.
Scott Schneeberger - CIBC World Markets: All right. Thanks. And one final one if I could. It sounds like a little bit of a slowdown in Uniform sales, could you just give a little bit more color? You mentioned it could be lumpy year-to-year, and I think you indicated you think it’s going to be a little softer for foreseeable future. Just kind of a little bit bigger picture color there? Thanks.
William C. Gale - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Yes it… we certainly are a little disappointed in the results in the direct sale Uniforms. That is the one area that surprised us a little bit coming out of the gate here this fiscal year. It looks like that many of the large lodging and casino gaming type businesses are not doing as aggressive a roll out as we initially had planned. So, our hope is that the… as we move throughout the year, we will be able to get some of that back. But it’s one of those businesses that is very choppy. We talked about that over the years, so we hope that we will see an improvement as we go throughout the year. But right now, I can’t say that for certainly that that’s going to happen.
Scott Schneeberger - CIBC World Markets: Thanks very much.
Operator: And now we will take a question from Bruce Simpson with William Blair
Bruce Simpson - William Blair: Hi guys.
Michael L. Thompson - Vice President and Treasurer: Hi Bruce.
Bruce Simpson - William Blair: First on SG&A, you talked about that returning to a more predictable level. And obviously, it was real highs as a percentage of sales for the quarter. So, when you talk about more traditional, more predictable levels, where we headed is it reasonable to think that’s kind of back in the 27 range?
Michael L. Thompson - Vice President and Treasurer: What we can say is we think they will improve as we move through the year, just like when selling cost with additional investment in that area that doesn’t come right back down, you need the revenues to grow. So, we think that will improve as we go forward, we also think as Bill mentioned, that we think the administrative portion of SG&A will begin to trend down. I think potentially on a 27 range… between 27 and 28, I would say, as we progress through the year, but it’s not as quick drop as you know.
Bruce Simpson - William Blair: Okay. And in terms of the absolute dollars, typically… sequentially is your progress through the years, its at least flat and usually going up quarter-to-quarter, would you still expect that or was there enough of this kind of one-time professional expenses that inflated in this quarter that’s going to come out?
Michael L. Thompson - Vice President and Treasurer: Yes. I would say there is… there has been enough of that to say that you are going to see a significant decline in the absolute dollars. I would look at it more on percent-to-sale basis.
Bruce Simpson - William Blair: Okay. And then turning focus to the European acquisition, moving forward, I mean, should we expect this to be a real foothold that you would relatively consistently look to a acquire your way throughout geographically… throughout Europe? Or is it rather this is kind of a just a toehold and you could let a half a year or even a year go by as you begin to understand the culture and financial dynamics of working over there without doing another acquisition?
William C. Gale - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Bruce, I would say we want to be sure that we don’t make the mistake and get too aggressive over there. But on the other hand, I would tell you that we are… we have got a list of potential candidates for acquisition and if we can meet with the sellers at reasonable prices, we are not afraid to acquire a few more operations because we have a lot of confidence and the management team that came with us, with the acquisition in the Netherlands and we feel that, if we find the right opportunity at the right prices, we will certainly move forward.
Bruce Simpson - William Blair: Okay. Now, I think in the past you always indicated that you really didn’t think the Europe was particularly for the ground for Uniform Rental operation just because of the differences in economy and cultural Uniform and opportunities, so forth, is that changing? Or should we expect the growth in Europe to be in your emerging areas rather than on traditional Uniform?
William C. Gale - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: But what excites us about Europe is things like Document Management but also facilities services. So, while we may not be as bullish on Uniform Rental in Europe, we are very bullish on the facility services, opportunities that exists, both in Europe and as well in the U.K. In fact, in some case, in some respects the facility services business may have a little bit more potential over in Europe than it necessarily does here in US and we are very happy about the opportunities we have in U.S. So, we think that the Document Management and potentially, facility services will be the big opportunities for us in the short run.
Bruce Simpson - William Blair: Facility services still being reported in your Rental Uniform and Ancillary Products and by that you mean like Hygiene?
William C. Gale - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Yes.
Bruce Simpson - William Blair: Okay. And that last thing, can you talk about the growth of Hygiene business is kind of buried within that bigger segment and in particular the UltraClean that had been grown in the pretty exponential rates and have you hit a certain level of maturity in that business?
Michael L. Thompson - Vice President and Treasurer: Well, we certainly have the rate… the rate of growth in that business has slowed somewhat as it has a bigger base but it still continues to grow. The Hygiene and UltraClean are growing faster than the Uniform Rental business is growing. I mean, we are still seeing the headwinds of the shift in types of labor that exists in the U.S. and therefore it is having an impact on our Garment Rental Programs. But the Hygiene in the UltraClean businesses are certainly the factor growing pieces of it albeit on a much smaller base.
Bruce Simpson - William Blair: So, when you told us earlier when you gave us… know that we got granularity on the operating segments, when you earlier gave us the organic growths rate, is that strictly beautiful rental or is that includes facility services?
Michael L. Thompson - Vice President and Treasurer: That includes facility service. That segment is exactly like used to be including all this. And that’s all with Rental segment.
William C. Gale - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: One of the things that we have is that we have is that, that business operates from the same facilities, the same management team. There is a lot of intertwining of that business together. So, we do not believe in the near future would be breaking that segment out any finer than what you are saying right now.
Bruce Simpson - William Blair: Can you tell us weather the Uniform Rental business alone is positive or negative growth?
William C. Gale - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Well, as I think if you could imply from my comments that certainly is the slower growing or flattish part of that business right now.
Bruce Simpson - William Blair: Okay. Is it possible… I promise I will get off after this. Are you going to be able to give us historic information restated along these segment line or isn’t it possible? So, that we can compare year-on-year.
William C. Gale - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: We are just going to be doing at for the prior fiscal year and going forward. So, we are not going back beyond fiscal year ’07. But as we go through every quarter, we will show you not only the current quarter in fiscal year ’08 but also fiscal year ’07.
Bruce Simpson - William Blair: Okay. But we will wait to each quarter to get it… you are not going to give us the full fiscal ’07 now?
William C. Gale - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Yes.
Bruce Simpson - William Blair: Okay. Thanks guys.
Operator: Next with Merrill Lynch, we have Michel Morin.
Michel Morin - Merrill Lynch: Yes. Good afternoon guys. First a quick one. The corporate line in the new segment data, why did assets drop 21%?
William C. Gale - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: That’s cash.
Michel Morin - Merrill Lynch: Okay. That’s a good answer. And then can you just on your Document Management plans, I think in your comments you mentioned that the focus was really on shredding and I just wanted to touch a bit more on that. Am I interpreting that correctly? Is the focus really on shredding or do you still have also a significant interest in pursuing the storage business?
Michael L. Thompson - Vice President and Treasurer: As I have said before, shredding is by far our immediate focus and the one that we are the most excited about. The storage side is intriguing to us and we have acquired a couple of operations but we have not expanded rapidly in that area as we have in the shredding side.
Michel Morin - Merrill Lynch: And the storage operations you are referring to are the ones in Ohio.
Michael L. Thompson - Vice President and Treasurer: Correct. We also have one right now in Indianapolis and a small one in Missouri. But, yes basically it’s in Ohio.
Michel Morin - Merrill Lynch: Great. That’s all I had. Thanks very much.
Operator: And now we will hear from Gary Bisbee with Lehman Brothers.
Gary Bisbee - Lehman Brothers: Hi guys. Mike, in the segment detail commentary you gave… you specifically mentioned the desire to make acquisitions in first day in Document, but didn’t say that in Uniforms, is that a signal of everything or is that just--?
Michael L. Thompson - Vice President and Treasurer: I think as we have mentioned in the past. We are being a little more conservative in the Uniform Rental space. I think we still look at all opportunities that are in that space. But again, we have a full geographic coverage in U.S. and Canada for Uniform models, so we can be a little more selective. But as we have shown about a year and a half ago, we bought Van Dyne Crotty. We saw a great opportunity and went after it and we still do make acquisitions in that space. But I tell you there our focus right now is on those emerging businesses, especially, Fire and Document Shredding. But again, we have a team that looks at all opportunities in all of our business lines and we will continue to make acquisitions one that can meet the thresholds with our rate of returns.
Gary Bisbee - Lehman Brothers: Okay. If you do go back as it sounds like you will, both purchasing stock, how are you planning to fund that with further commercial paper borrowing or--?
Michael L. Thompson - Vice President and Treasurer: We will evaluate that going forward. I think the commercial paper worked well for us over the last quarter. We had very attractive rates and had the good demand for it, something that we will obviously address. We have $600 million authorization in total work and our CP launch. So, we will have to do something at some point. If we do a lot but I think that’s something, we will just evaluate internally and obviously make a disclosure at that point in time when necessary.
William C. Gale - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Gary, and also, we do generate a lot of cash from operations and we will certainly use some of that and the second quarter tends to be a pretty good cash generator for us, so that will help us also. But it’s certainly our responsibility to look out for more permanent financing opportunities if they present themselves and I am sure Mike and I will be doing that.
Gary Bisbee - Lehman Brothers: Okay. So, it’s safe to assume this whole credit crunch that happened, you didn’t see your commercial paper rates sky rocket or anything that was undesirable?
William C. Gale - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Not at all. Not at all, it was very, very consistent for the quarter.
Michael L. Thompson - Vice President and Treasurer: Remember we are pretty highly rated so…
Gary Bisbee - Lehman Brothers: Yes. And then I guess just one question on the segment data, and I will echo my thanks to you for giving this. I guess when you look at the document management, obviously there has been huge profitability gain over the last year and the gross margin is far and away the highest in the business. Can you give us some sense on a relative basis? How you think about the composition of cost of goods sold versus SG&A? And I know you are not going to tell me where you think the margin ultimately end up at maturity, but is there some sense that as you look at all the businesses, there is not really that much structural difference? And what costs going those two lines?
William C. Gale - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: I think you asked two things. One paper prices have been very solid, recently that helps, but then also you have to remember that in document shredding you don’t have material cost. You are paying a driver, you have a plan that’s essentially on wheels, if you are shredding it at customer’s location, so margins are improved, but you are paying more in the SG&A lines to run the business from our operation so to speak, from the management perspective and from the logistics perspective. But not every material cost can actually turn around selling the paper makes a difference when paper prices are higher, again, some benefit there. So, I think, we see that the margins in that business over the long-term will be above what we have been experiencing historically in our Uniform Rental business, but we are not commenting on how high they can go and… but we do think it’s very positive.
Gary Bisbee - Lehman Brothers: Okay. And then just on that last point. Can you help me understand exactly how the economics of that work around selling the paper on the back end? And how much of the profitability comes from that? The business nicely profitable without that or can you give me any metrics to help understand that?
William C. Gale - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: We won’t provide metrics on it obviously, but we can tell you is the way it operates is not only are you picking up a very saleable commodity. So you are turning back around either bailing it at room side or selling into recycler and when the demand for that product is very high like it is currently, you are essentially covering a lot of cost by selling that paper. Though it’s very, it’s positive at this point in time and it's a… we believe, we will continue to be positive.
Gary Bisbee - Lehman Brothers: And then just one last question on this, at any point, would you consider giving us CapEx on this segment data in addition to assets and all the other numbers you are giving?
William C. Gale - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Yes, we are looking at that and I would say that we hope to provide more detail on the next quarter.
Gary Bisbee - Lehman Brothers: Okay, great. Thanks a lot.
Operator: Now we will take a question from Chris Gutek with Morgan Stanley.
Christopher Gutek - Morgan Stanley: Thanks, hi guys.
Michael L. Thompson - Vice President and Treasurer: Hi, Chris.
Christopher Gutek - Morgan Stanley: Since your last call, I guess, it was about 18 seats and one could argue that's the macro outlook has moderated a bit and I guess in that context I am curious what is sort of embedded in the guidance to extent… reiterating the full fiscal year's revenue guidance. Have you in fact assumed that the economy soften a bit if so how much, is there something else in the business and self productivity or something else that’s ramping little bit better? We are on a better trajectory that might offset a slight macro softening since your last call.
William C. Gale - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Chris, I would say that while we are… our original plan that we put together, we talked about in July upon which guidance was based, assumed that there would be a modest, continuing growth in the economy, but that the real impact that would happen to Cintas is that we would to accelerating organic growth as we move throughout the year as the Project One Team became more productive with regard to its ability to sell, generate new business to cross selling. But we still believe that is the case, while the overall economic environment, you say has moderated some. It really hasn’t changed our expect… from what our expectations were. It's certainly not a very rapid growth business, but we didn’t expect our rapid growth economy, but we didn’t expect that any way. So, my only concern is assuming there is not a recession, where we start to see a bunch of people being loosing their job and there is certainly no indication of that yet. I think that we feel pretty confident that the guy, the leads as it stands right now our guidance is solid and that we can achieve the guidance that we gave you.
Christopher Gutek - Morgan Stanley: Okay, fair enough. And then there as a follow-up on the notion of having done a… having completed a strategic review. It sounds like if I am interpreting your comments correctly, is that the… there is no intention of doing anything aggressively in the short-term here from a strategic perspective, but I am curious if there is anything still on the table short of what was considered as part of the strategic review for example try to monetize some of the real estate assets or changing some of your sourcing to buy uniform from Asia or anything else more from an operational perspective that could be incremental to margin improvement opportunities, you talked about in the past shy of the strategic review.
Michael L. Thompson - Vice President and Treasurer: Well, I think our job is always to look it for opportunities and the Board’s jobs is always to look for opportunities to enhance shareholder value along with management. So, everything is always on the table and we are always looking for ways to improve things, but we don’t’ look… both long-term and short-term is to what makes sense. So, that’s continued activity that we are all involved with.
Christopher Gutek - Morgan Stanley: Okay. Fair enough. And finally, just a quick one. Your press release mentioned the FIN 48 and accretion of tax liability. Could you explain what’s driving that or what the issue is around it?
Michael L. Thompson - Vice President and Treasurer: Sure. It’s actually with FIN 48 you are required to essentially analyze your tax reserves and has to be based on technical merits is to whether or not you can have something in your tax return that is separate from most on your financial statements. Based on that review, we essentially took our deferred tax liability, and if you look at the balance sheet, you essentially have that liability that was emplaced at May 31 and that has been broken down to the deferred tax asset and the accrued liabilities mainly in the long-term accrued liabilities, you will see that of the flip side portion of that come through essentially. And there was a $14 million additional reserve that we established through retained earnings, which is really based on the competition on technical merits of FIN 48. And so, I think when you go through that merit, you will see that that is essentially just a move from that deferred tax liability as of May 31 up until.
Christopher Gutek - Morgan Stanley: Okay, got it. Thanks.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. We have a follow-up from Mr. Morin with Merrill Lynch.
Michel Morin - Merrill Lynch: Yes, hi, again. Very quick one. Energy cost, how has that changed over the year… year-on-year?
Michael L. Thompson - Vice President and Treasurer: Michel, we probably didn't hear it before, but I did say that it really has not changed at all over the last 15 months. It’s basically been about the same level of 3.4%.
Michel Morin - Merrill Lynch: Great. And do you have any plants, laundry facility either openings or greenfield openings or closings?
Michael L. Thompson - Vice President and Treasurer: No closings, we certainly have a few plants that will be opened this year. I don’t have the exact number, but it’s probably along the lines of last year three or four.
Michel Morin - Merrill Lynch: Okay. And then finally, there has been a little bit crackdown on checking for social security mismatches, and I was wondering if that’s something that affected you at all.
Michael L. Thompson - Vice President and Treasurer: Well, that’s been going on for couple of years and our operations periodically will receive a list from the social security administration saying that there are some mismatches and we work with our partners at those locations. Those partners are our employees, to try to help them resolve that situation. There certainly have been a few situations where the employee was using false identification and they are no longer with the organization as is required by law. But we certainly tried to assist our partners if those things are identified and often, we are able to work those things out with the social security administration.
Michel Morin - Merrill Lynch: Great, okay. Thank you and thanks again for the segment data as well.
Operator: And that is all the time we have for questions today. I will turn the conference back over to our presenters for any concluding or further comments they may have today.
Michael L. Thompson - Vice President and Treasurer: Thank you all for joining us. I hope that there were no more questions. We did not put a limit on the timeframe, so usually that’s… its more that there were no more questions. But we appreciate all of you being here and we will look forward to talking to you in the… for our second quarter earnings during the week of December 17.
Operator: Once again, everyone this will conclude today’s program. We thank you for joining us. Please enjoy the rest of your day.

Operator: Good day everyone and welcome to the Cintas Quarterly Earnings Results Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Bill Gale, Vice President of Finance and Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead, sir. 
Bill Gale: Good evening and thank you for joining us to hear the results for our third quarter of fiscal 2007. We are pleased to announce increased sales and profits for the quarter ending February 28, 2007. Revenue grew at a rate of 8.2% to $905 million. Earnings per share were $0.48 versus $0.45 a year ago, a 6.7% increase.  During the quarter, the company purchased 1.4 million shares of Cintas stock under the authorized share repurchase program. Our financial condition continues to remain strong.  At February 28, debt-to-capitalization was 30.1%, despite the expenditures of over $135 million for acquisitions this year and the repurchase of approximately $200 million of our stock so far in fiscal '07.  Last week, the company also paid its annual dividend of $0.39 per share, an 11.4% increase over the dividend paid last year.  Due to the lower rental revenues in the third quarter from what we had previously expected, as well as the recent trends in the growth components, we are adjusting our guidance for the year.  For the entire year, we expect revenues to be in the range of $3.675 billion to $3.725 billion and earnings per share to be between $2.03 and $2.08.  With me today is Scott Farmer, our Chief Executive Officer and Mike Thompson, our Vice President and Treasurer. After some comments from both Mike and Scott, we will open the call to questions.

Mike Thompson: Thanks, Bill. As Bill mentioned, total revenues were $905.4 million for the quarter, an 8.2% increase over that reported in the prior year. Our third quarter had 64 workdays, the same number of workdays as the third quarter of fiscal 2006.  As a reminder, the workday breakdown for each quarter of fiscal 2007 is the same as the quarterly breakdown in fiscal 2006, which means that our fourth quarter which will end at May 31, 2007 will have 66 workdays.  Internal growth for the company was 4.5% as compared to 6.1% in the second quarter. Rental revenues for the third quarter were $665.6 million compared to $631.3 million last year. This was an increase of 5.4%. Factoring out acquisitions made over the last 12 months, our rental organic growth rate was 3% for the quarter.  As mentioned in our earnings release, our revenue growth has been impacted by a few factors. First, we experienced a mild winter season into early February. Our third quarter is traditionally a slower growth quarter when looked at on a sequential basis. This is due to the fewer amount of workdays caused by customer closings around the holidays and the short month of February.  Typically, increased volume from the seasonal injection of jackets and mats helps offset these items. This year's delayed winter weather did not allow this to occur.  We also continued to experience external economic pressures, especially in our uniform rental business. Many traditional uniform wearing industries continued to show declines in domestic employment due to off-shoring and improving technologies.  Employment levels within our customer base continue to be negatively impacted, not only through the direct reductions in the number of people wearing uniforms in such businesses, but also via the ripple effect this reduction has on numerous ancillary businesses that depend on those businesses for a portion of their livelihood.  These ancillary businesses include all types of companies, ranging from part suppliers to distribution centers, to electricians and plumbers servicing these facilities, to local restaurants and bars surrounding these facilities.  Unemployment levels in the overall economy have remained relatively low with offsetting growth occurring mainly in the healthcare, financial services, government, and until recently housing sectors. These sectors have not been a large part of our traditional uniform rental base.  We continue to grow in all of our lines of business, but the leakage from lost business and staffs continues to be higher than traditional levels.  There has also been a disruption in our new business from the continued implementation of our new sales organization. Scott Farmer will provide an update on the current status of this initiative in a moment.  Other services revenue of $239.8 million increased approximately 16.9% from last year's third quarter revenue of $205.1 million. On an organic basis, this segment of our business grew 9.3% in the third quarter as compared to 8.9% in the second quarter.  As a reminder, the other services segment includes: The direct sale of uniforms to national account customers. The sale of uniforms through our catalog to local customers, primarily customers who rent products from us. Our First Aid and Safety Division including Fire Protection Services. And our Document Management Division, which is primarily document shredding.  Our uniform direct sale business, which includes both our National Account Sales Division and our Rental Division catalog sales, in total increased approximately 5.3% on an organic basis for the quarter. As a reminder, this business does experience more volatility in its revenue base, due to the timing of new account rollouts.  We continue to see strength in healthcare, hospitality and gaming, which are the key sectors for our National Account Sales Division.  The First Aid and Safety Division, which includes the Fire Protection business, continues to expand at a rapid rate with 25% growth during the quarter and 11.4% on an organic basis. Our First Aid and Safety business and our Fire Protection Services business each achieved double-digit internal growth rates again this quarter.  We are very encouraged by the value proposition that we offer to our customers and our expanding line of first aid, safety, and fire protection services. And we continue to expand our products, services, and geographic coverage of this business.  Our Document Management business is expanding at a rapid rate with total third quarter revenues growing 56% over the second quarter of fiscal 2006. After entering this space approximately four years ago, we have now grown to a business with an annual run-rate of over $110 million in revenue.  We are servicing approximately 115 markets in United States and Canada, including approximately 80 of the top 100 markets. Given our size and scope in this business, we now consider ourselves to have a national coverage.  We will continue to fill in the remaining footprint with strategic acquisitions or greenfield startups, as opportunities arise.  Our Document Management Division continues to deliver strong organic growth rates, achieving 27% organic growth in the third quarter.  I will now turn the call over to Scott for some additional comments. 
Scott Farmer: Thanks, Mike and good evening, everyone. Before Mike takes us through the rest of our third quarter results, I felt it important to provide everyone with an update of our ongoing sales reorganization which we call Project One Team.  At Cintas, we have always prided ourselves on having a top-tier selling organization. In fact, Selling Power Magazine recently identified Cintas as one of the top 50 companies to sell for. This award is presented to companies with large sales forces based on various factors including compensation, training, and career mobility.  We believe that our new Project One Team initiative will make a great sales organization and make it even better.  As you may recall, historically, our sales process was managed on a local level with individual sales reps and sales managers reporting through local general managers within a specific line of business.  The Project One Team structure provides for a separate professional sales organization that reports through the organization directly to me. The new structure is designed to improve revenues, to increase sales rep productivity, and to improve cross-selling opportunities and reduced sales rep turnover.  Another benefit of the new sales organization is the additional time our local general managers now have to devote to the operational side of their business. By having the sales teams now report to a separate organization, we freed up approximately 20% to 25% of our general managers' time. Time they can now use to address their service and production areas of the business as well as take better care of their customers.  Many projects are underway in these areas, which are designed to reduce lost business and to become more efficient in our processing and delivering techniques.  While we are still in the early stages of this process, one encouraging sign is that our Rental Division customer satisfaction index has risen to its highest level in many years.  As we mentioned in our second quarter earnings call, the Project One Team organization was rolled out to all of our groups as of the end of December. The new organization is now in place across the company.  We are very encouraged by the early results of this new organization. The transition of this new organization, as expected, has led to some disruption in the amount of new business being sold.  During the process, we promoted many high-performing sales representatives to managerial positions. And then, we hired or backfilled a significant number of partners into the open sales territories. These new sales representatives are not producing at levels comparable to those sales representatives who were promoted.  We expect the full benefit of the new sales organization to occur once the new sales managers and sales representatives have been properly trained in their new areas of responsibility and gain experience in their new positions. For example, a new uniform sales rep typically takes 9 to 12 months to become fully productive.  Even though it's still early in the transition process, we are already seeing positive signs from the new organization. Our sales rep turnover is improving. In fact, our sales rep turnover is now lower than it has been in many years. We are also seeing some very positive results of our sales retraining efforts.  The new training programs have been established in order to provide our sales force with the tools necessary to properly identify and execute on cross-selling opportunities. These new programs also are providing a more consistent approach to the fundamentals of the sales process along all lines of our business.  In the short-term, this training has pulled our sales reps and our sales managers from the field, thereby reducing the amount of time they have to sell new business. However, these new training programs are providing a solid foundation for future growth.  For example, while we are still very early in the process, preliminary results have shown that we are now achieving better pricing on new uniform rental business being sold. And our cross-selling results are improving.  Cross-selling improvement is currently being seen through the improved growth within our other services segment. This is mainly due to the size of these divisions and the amount of customers, versus the size of the rental division.  As mentioned earlier, our internal growth for our other services segment was 9.3% for the quarter. While we are experiencing some economic headwind, we are excited about our future growth prospects in all lines of our business. We believe that we are now better organized today to take advantage of these opportunities.  In fact, after seeing our preliminary results under Project One Team and the positive impact we believe it will have once it is fully in place, we wish we would have implemented this structure two or three years ago.  I will now turn the call back over to Mike for some additional financial information. 
Mike Thompson: Thanks, Scott. I will now discuss our margins for the quarter. Total company margins for the quarter were 42.6%, a 20-basis point increase over 42.4% in the second quarter of fiscal 2007 and a 40-basis point increase over 42.2% in the third quarter of last year.  From a historical perspective, energy costs remained high. Energy costs for the third quarter were approximately 3.3% of sales versus 3.1% in the second quarter and 3.8% in the third quarter last year.  The 20-basis point increase in energy costs from the second quarter was mainly due to increased fuel costs or natural gas used primarily to run our rental plants. Delivery, gas and electricity were comparable with the second quarter.  We traditionally experience an increase in energy costs from the second to the third quarter due to colder weather. This year's quarterly increase in energy costs was not as significant as prior years mainly due to milder weather.  The 50-basis point margin improvement in energy costs, when compared to last year's third quarter, was due to a decrease in fuel costs mainly to run our rental plants. This was due to a combination of the milder weather this year and a reduction in the price of fuel.  Delivery, gas and electric were comparable to the prior year. We have not seen a sustained reduction in the price of gasoline or diesel.  Our rental margins for the third quarter were 44.2% of revenue versus 44.5% for the second quarter of fiscal 2007 and 44.5% in the third quarter of fiscal 2006. The decrease in rental gross margin of 30 basis points from the second quarter was due to the increase in energy costs, as well as an increase in service labor.  When comparing rental gross margin to the third quarter of fiscal 2006, the favorable energy benefit of 50 basis points was offset by increased delivery costs.  The additional reduction in rental gross margin was due to a combination of factors, including increased depreciation on Ultra-Clean trucks and some additional equipment maintenance.  As we have mentioned on previous calls, we are experiencing increased delivery labor costs due to the introduction of our Sanis Ultra-Clean service. This is a more labor-intensive service and our current route volumes and densities are low.  We expect labor costs to come more into line as we further penetrate our geographic markets and increase route volumes.  The gross margin in our other services segment continues to strengthen, reaching 38.1% for the third quarter versus 35.3% for the third quarter of fiscal 2006 and 36.3% of revenue for the second quarter of 2007.  Our First Aid and Safety and Document Management divisions continue to gain scale and become more profitable businesses. Their high growth rates and related margin improvement are driving the overall margin improvement in the other services operating segment.  Our selling and administrative expenses were 28.0% of revenue as compared to 26.9% in the second quarter of fiscal 2007 and 26.8% in the third quarter of the prior year.  As a reminder, all employee benefit costs for the entire company, other than wages and bonuses, are included in our administrative expenses. This includes medical and retirement costs, as well as payroll taxes and workers' compensation.  Medical costs increased by 10 basis points from the second quarter, but we are 50 basis points higher than last year's third quarter. The decrease from the second quarter was a combination of a lower, more normalized high-cost claimant figure than we saw in the second quarter. This was offset partially by an increase in the number of participants in our plan.  Our medical plan is especially self-insured. We did switch administrators on January 1st. At that time, we also had our annual open enrollment. With a move to the new provider and plan, we experienced an increase in the number of partners that are on our medical plan. When compared to the third quarter of last year, the 50-basis point increase in medical costs is a combination of rising medical costs and the increase in number of participants.  Payroll taxes were flat when comparing the third quarter of fiscal 2007's percent of sale to the third quarter of 2006. However, there was a 60-basis point increase in these costs from the second quarter of 2006. This is an annual occurrence as the calendar tax year ends during our fiscal third quarter and payroll taxes reset.  Selling expense increased 30 basis points over the second quarter and 70 basis points over the third quarter of fiscal 2006. This investment is being made in the new sales structure in order to benefit growth in the long-term.  G&A labor was flat as compared to the second quarter and down 10 basis points versus last year. Income before net interest and taxes increased 3.2% over the third quarter of fiscal 2006 and is a healthy 14.7% of revenue.  Income before income taxes for the rentals operating segment was $105.2 million or 15.8% of revenue. And income before income taxes for the other services segment was $27.5 million or 11.5% of revenue.  Net interest costs increased 1.1% of sales from 0.6% of sales in the prior year third quarter. This increase is due to additional debt taken on to fund acquisitions and the funding of our share buyback program.  We continue to hold approximately $157.5 million in cash and marketable securities rather than prematurely liquidating investments and taking a loss. As investments reach maturity, our intention is to use the proceeds to pay down remaining commercial paper borrowings, contingent on cash needs and acquisition opportunities.  As of February 28th, we had approximately $170 million of commercial paper outstanding, an increase of approximately $93 million from the second quarter.  Our third quarter effective tax rate was 37.3% for the quarter, which is consistent with the second quarter. We expect the effective tax rate to remain at 37.3% for the remainder of this fiscal year.  For the quarter, net income of $76.7 million increased 0.2% over the third quarter of fiscal 2006 and earnings per share increased 6.7% to $0.48 per diluted share, reflecting operational results and the impact of the share buyback program.  The balance sheet continues to be very strong. Our current ratio stands at 1.7 to 1. This ratio includes $225 million of debt currently included in current liabilities, as this debt becomes due in June 2007.  As previously disclosed, we entered into a forward starting swap, which we intend to exercise in conjunction with an anticipated $200 million debt issuance in 2007, in order to offset the majority of the debt coming due in June. Additional information regarding this swap is included in our most recently filed 10-K.  Cash and marketable securities stood at approximately $157.5 million. As marketable securities mature, we anticipate using these funds to pay down debt depending on operating and acquisition needs.  DSOs on accounts receivable were 40 days, which represents a slight increase over the prior year. We have noted our customers on average taking longer to pay their bills, which is indicative of a more difficult economic environment. We have not experienced a change in our level of write-offs, but rather in the timing of collections.  Inventories have increased $29 million from May 31, 2006. This increase reflects the build-back to normalized levels after a significant reduction at May 31, 2006, as well as the introduction of new products and the result of the revenue growth.  Our Rental and National Account Sales divisions had strong revenues in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006, especially in May.  Inventory levels have subsequently been replenished to more appropriate levels in order to properly support customer service.  Accrued liabilities increased approximately $46 million from May of 2006. This increase was due to the dividend payable to shareholders of approximately $62 million.  Our total outstanding debt stood at $884 million at the end of February, which includes the long-term debt due within one year. Total debt as a percentage of capitalization was approximately 30.1% and net debt-to-cap was 26.1%.  As mentioned in our earnings release, we've purchased 1.4 million shares of outstanding common stock during the quarter at a cost of $57 million. This increases the total number of shares purchased since the inception of our share buyback program to 14.2 million shares at a total cost of $580 million. We have an additional $420 million of additional authorization to purchase our common stock under parameters established by our Board.  Since the inception of the buyback program, we have purchased approximately 8% of our outstanding shares.  Operating cash flow for the nine months ended February 28 was $322 million, an increase of $11 million as compared to the $311 million generated during the first nine months of fiscal 2006. This increase was mainly generated from an increase in net income.  Capital expenditures were approximately $129 million for the first nine months of the year. We expect capital expenditures for fiscal 2007 to be approximately $160 million to $170 million.  During the third quarter, we spent approximately $140 million on a combination of acquisitions and share buybacks. In addition, we accrued approximately $60 million for our annual dividend payment. The $0.39 dividend was paid to our shareholders in March.  This concludes our formal remarks, and I would now like to open the call to any questions. 
Operator: Thank you. (Operator Instructions) And we'll hear first from Scott Schneeberger of CIBC. 
Scott Schneeberger - CIBC: Hey, good afternoon. A Project One question to start off, on an absolute level, how has headcount changed throughout the process? And where do you see that going from here? 
Scott Farmer: Well, we don't typically report on the number of sales people that we have in our sales organization. I think that what the benefits of this will be is that it will be a more consistent sales force as a result of lower turnover. So that we'll have more people in their sales positions longer and therefore see sales productivity go up.  Our sales headcount is going to be based on the opportunities that we see within the certain geographic markets and things like that. So, the ideal headcount will be designed around the number of prospects and the number of opportunities that we have in that market. But the One Team organization is more designed to improve rep productivity, reduce turnover and improve our opportunities to cross-sell our various businesses. 
Scott Schneeberger - CIBC: Thanks. You had indicated in the press release that six months to a year is what it takes for new reps to fill the shoes of the reps that were promoted. Where are we in that process? Do we have to wait another couple of quarters? When do we see a turn there, would you say? 
Scott Farmer: Well, the full organization went live by the end of the calendar year on the new organization. So, in the third quarter we had a lot of training time. A lot of those people were promoted into their jobs at the beginning of that quarter. So, as every month goes by, we'll see their tenure and their expected productivity continue to improve.  The guidance that we want to give is through the end of this fiscal year. And we don’t want to be overly optimistic about what's going to happen beyond that. So, although we are very excited about what the impact will be, I can tell you that I would like to get a couple more months under our belt to watch what the real activity is. And we'll provide guidance for next fiscal year based on what we see.  That said, every month that goes by and that these sales reps and sales managers are in their new position, it is going to generate improvement in their ability to accomplish their jobs. 
Scott Schneeberger - CIBC: Thanks. Just on the core rental business. You noted some verticals where you've been seeing decent performance overall, but I think with decelerating growth. What are you doing within some of those verticals, healthcare, financial services, government, etcetera, to continue to drive business? 
Bill Gale: Well, we are looking at some additional products that will be more conducive to a couple of those segments. But I would tell you that as far as uniform rental is concerned, we are not going to be seeing much activity in the segments of financial services or government.  But we are seeing some great opportunities with some of our other businesses, especially in financial services. And we are seeing a lot of great opportunities in the uniform business in the healthcare market. So, as we continue to develop products and delivery techniques in those segments, I think that will help to fund the growth as that area of the economy continues to improve. 
Scott Schneeberger - CIBC: One more quick one and then I will hop out. You had foreshadowed that you were thinking of going international. And it wouldn't be a matter of a year or two, but multiple years. Does the slowing that you are seeing now will speed-up that initiative? Thanks very much. 
Scott Farmer: Well, I guess the best way to answer that is that we are analyzing where our opportunities would be in our different business segments, relative to opportunities internationally. I think you all know we are in Canada, in Mexico, in the Caribbean, and with the hotel industry and the cruise line industry and things like that. But really offshore into Europe or Asia or something like that, we are looking at our opportunities that make sense.  While we have said in the past that we would look out into the future and it might be a few years out, I would say that if the right opportunity presented itself sooner than that, we would certainly take a look at it. And so, we are in that process right now of evaluating what would make sense for us. 
Bill Gale: I think on top of that also. The other part of the question was because of our slowing growth rate. We would not look to international because of a slowing growth rate. Here we see a lot of opportunity. We see a lot of benefit from this new sales organization. So, we don't feel compelled to look for that growth. Elsewhere at this point in time although if opportunities arise, as Scott indicated we would look at that. 
Scott Schneeberger - CIBC: Thanks. 
Operator: Next, we will hear from Michael Schneider of Robert W. Baird. 
Michael Schneider - Robert W. Baird: Good evening guys. 
Bill Gale: Hi, Mike 
Scott Farmer: Hi, Mike 
Michael Schneider - Robert W. Baird: Maybe first we can start just with Project One. Scott and all of you are very optimistic about the ultimate returns from this. Can you give us a sense and it sounds like you have got some data from the early field deployments to back this up? Can you give us a sense of what new business growth is in some of the first territories to adopt Project One? And who are presumably beyond the 6- to 9-month period versus some of the newest ones that are just being impacted by the disruption to give us some confidence? And give us the basis for which you are confident? 
Scott Farmer: Well, I guess that I can give you some generalities in this regard. We have seen improvement in sales rep productivity. We have seen a reduction in sales rep turnover to the level of sales rep turnover that we haven't seen in several years. So that's a big positive. The cross-sell activity continues to improve in these markets, more so than the markets that we just rolled this out to. So, the experience and the tenure of these folks in these areas help to drive that.  And I would say one of the big things from an overall company standpoint is the opportunity that our general managers now have to spend significantly more time in their business is definitely showing an overall improvement in our customer satisfaction scores. And I think that obviously bodes well for our ability to continue to cross-sell. It's more likely for a happy customer that wants to add one of our new products or services. The likelihood of renewing those customers and reducing lost business is a benefit as well.  So, I would say that those are the type of indicators that we have seen that we would expect to continue throughout the rest of the organization.  The biggest disruption and the biggest issue that Project One Team has had for us at this point is the time to take the reps out of the field to do the training. And the fact, we are putting rookies in behind our most experienced and really some of our most productive and active sales reps who just got promoted.  So you are replacing one of our more productive people with somebody who has really no production at the beginning of his tenure. 
Michael Schneider - Robert W. Baird: And the first territory to be rolled out was in what quarter, was that Q1? 
Scott Farmer: No, we actually tested the program through the end of last fiscal year, the later part of fiscal 2006. 
Michael Schneider - Robert W. Baird: Okay. So when you look at the organic growth in that so called territory one, is organic growth today higher than it was a year ago? 
Scott Farmer: Yes. 
Michael Schneider - Robert W. Baird: So, you have actually seen an improvement in the organic growth rate in that territory despite the economic deterioration? 
Scott Farmer: Yes, an improvement over where the organic growth rate was for comparing that group prior to Project One Team or to after Project One Team. 
Michael Schneider - Robert W. Baird: Okay. That's great news. And then just switching gears to acquisitions during the quarter. It looks like you spent by my quick numbers, I think some $80 million in the quarter. Can you tell us how that breaks down between the two divisions? And what type of revenue you've actually purchased, so we can model those acquisitions going forward? 
Bill Gale: Michael, I can't give you the exact details, but it was primarily in the Document Management and the First Aid and Safety divisions. There was very little in the uniform and rental. 
Michael Schneider - Robert W. Baird: Okay. And a similar question, how much was contributed in each segment by acquisitions this quarter? 
Bill Gale: We are not going to be disclosing that detail at this time. 
Michael Schneider - Robert W. Baird: Okay. And then final question, just on the earnings guidance for Q4, it is actually at the mid point, at least down year-over-year. And it is the first quarter in a long time or frankly, I can remember that it's actually going to be a negative comparison. Is that something you would expect to spill over into fiscal '08 at least in the first half? 
Bill Gale: Well, a lot of it is dependent upon what happens, obviously, with the top line growth, as well as what happens with interest expense. A part of what you are seeing there in the fourth quarter is the impact of the additional interest expense also. It's too early for me to give you a prediction on next fiscal year. We will have to wait and do that in July when we talk about the call, because we are just in the beginning of our budgeting cycle right now. 
Michael Schneider - Robert W. Baird: Thank you again. 
Operator: Now we will hear from Kartik Mehta. 
Kartik Mehta - FTN Midwest: Scott, I wanted to ask your opinion about the uniform business. As you look at the business, notwithstanding maybe the economy, but some of the stuff you have talked about in the past, the offshoring. Do you think the growth rate for this business has changed as we look out two to three years or do you think the growth rate is still the same, and it's a matter of getting Project One completed and executing on that? 
Scott Farmer: Well, first of all let me say that I think we will be much better positioned to take advantage of whatever opportunities we have in these businesses as a result of Project One Team. So, I think we will perform better as a sales organization under Project One Team than we have been able to in the past relative to whatever opportunities are out there.  As I look at the uniform business, I would say that one of the biggest problem areas that I see in that business is that when we take two steps forward by selling a number of new accounts and we take a step back with one of our existing accounts, eliminating a shift or moving an operation or a job offshore or something like that. That causes the headwind. If that bottoms out, if it levels off then I think that part of that headwind goes away. And we can improve our internal growth rate in that business as a result of that.  We faced this issue for many quarters in a row now. It's nothing new that this has been going on. I think that it's a matter of severity from time to time. The automotive plants make a big announcement and the timing of those things could impact our growth rate one quarter more than another. But, we also face the economies of our size in that business as well.  But, I think, we can grow in that business, and I think we will grow better as a result of our new sales organization than we could without it. We'll have to see what the economic conditions bring. 
Kartik Mehta - FTN Midwest: Then from an entire company standpoint, Scott, do you feel that the way the businesses that you have now can still help you deliver double-digit organic growth as you move forward? Are there changes you would need to make to get to that point? 
Scott Farmer: I think that the new businesses that we have are contributing very nicely. They are growing double-digits. And as they continue to get bigger and become a bigger part of the company, they are going to help the overall growth rate to continue to improve.  In addition to that, I think that we will continue to be able to make acquisitions in a number of these different businesses. We will continue to look at opportunities for us to develop new products and services, even within our core businesses and the rental business as an example. The Sanis Ultra-Clean is a great example of that which should give us continued opportunities to generate a future growth within our existing customer base and to prospects. So, I would say that those things being part of our arsenal of opportunities, we should be able to continue to grow the company.  I don't know in the short-term that double-digit internal growth, as a result of the disruption that Project One Team has had, is going to be there. But I would expect to see, as it takes hold an increasing rate of internal growth as Project One Team evolves and matures and becomes part of our way of doing business. 
Kartik Mehta - FTN Midwest: And one last question for you Bill. If you look at the divergence between net income and free cash flow over the next one to three years, would you expect that to be similar to what it has been in the past? Or is there any reason for that to change either way? 
Bill Gale: Based on limited thought of what you just said, I don't expect there to be any significant change. I would anticipate the relationship between net income and cash flow to be relatively constant. There is going to be a little bit of difference with regard to how CapEx is spent, because of the nature of some of the businesses that are growing faster. For example, a document management business requires trucks that are more expensive than uniform trucks, but doesn't require the processing of a rental plant.  Working capital requirements are less in the First Aid and Safety and the document management business than they are in the uniform rental business, because of the lack of in-service inventory. But just thinking through, Kartik, I would think that it shouldn't change dramatically. 
Kartik Mehta - FTN Midwest: Thank you very much. 
Operator: Moving on, we will hear from Chris Gutek. 
Chris Gutek - Morgan Stanley: Not to beat a dead horse here with the growth outlook. I know you don't want to give guidance, I won't ask for it. But could you talk generally about the organic growth rate outlook for the core rental division over the next couple of quarters. Specifically what I am getting at is, do you think that the growth rates have bottomed, net of all of these moving parts?  And based on the year-over-year growth you have seen in the last couple of months and maybe even in the first couple of weeks of the fiscal fourth quarter, are you seeing signs of stabilization? Or are we not even necessarily close to stabilization yet? 
Scott Farmer: I don't want to give internal growth guidance looking out too far into the future. But if you look at the guidance that we have for the fourth quarter, it would assume at the low-end of the range we had about flat growth and at the high end of the range [one to six] internal growth. So that's about where we are and I would say that would therefore predict that we're at least close to the trough and if not, working our way through that. 
Chris Gutek - Morgan Stanley: Given that the growth rates have decelerated though, and taking a longer term view. And in the context of the company not needing access to capital, in fact aggressively buying back stock and also potentially in the context of having some valuable real estate, is there any reason or advantage to the company being public? 
Scott Farmer: I think that's a very speculative thing to talk about. We are not really at liberty to discuss that, Chris. 
Chris Gutek - Morgan Stanley: Okay. Let me try a completely different question if I could then. There was apparently an unfortunate death at a Tulsa plant recently. And I am curious if that was in your view sort of a freak one-off accident or if in fact the company is behind some mandated safety upgrades at some of the facilities? 
Bill Gale: Well this event that happened in Tulsa was first and foremost a very tragic accident and we are personally saddened by the death of one of our fellow partners. Now the investigation of this accident is continuing. We have determined based on the preliminary results that the machinery was operating properly, and that the partner did not follow established safety rules, which would have prevented the accident.  But at this point, because it's under investigation by OSHA, we don't believe it's appropriate to make any further comments. But I will tell you that we have been using this equipment. It's standard industrial equipment. It's used by companies throughout the world. And it has approximately been in existence for 15 to 20 years. And we've never had an accident in the past anywhere near to this extent. 
Chris Gutek - Morgan Stanley: Okay. I am curious, given ARAMARK's recent going-private transaction, if you have seen any change in their competitive behavior in particular, may be less focused on growth and potentially more focused on profitability? Have you seen any change from your perspective out in the field? 
Scott Farmer: Chris, we haven't seen any change yet. But I think it's important that everyone understands that transaction was just completed not too long ago. So I think to see any dramatic change this early in the process would have been unlikely. So it's really too early to tell. 
Chris Gutek - Morgan Stanley: Okay. And then finally a quick one. Bill, what's the targeted capital structure as you guys have been aggressively buying back stock? Where do you think the optimal capital structure currently lies? 
Bill Gale: Well, I think that's under review; because I think at one point in time, we've always told people that we thought a 35% to 40% debt-to-cap was a good rate to go with. But we've been listening to a lot of interested parties and shareholders. We have been to several conferences. We have had a lot of visits. There is a different set of opinion and we are evaluating all that internally to determine what we believe would be in the best interest of the shareholders. So, I would say that it's under review and we will continue to assess what make sense. 
Chris Gutek - Morgan Stanley: Okay. Thank guys. 
Operator: Gary Bisbee has our next question. 
Gary Bisbee - Lehman Brothers: Hi guys, good afternoon. I'm wondering if you would be willing to tell us what the revenue impact approximately was year-over-year of the warmer winter? 
Bill Gale: No, we don't have the details of that Gary, but it was a factor in the lower revenues quarter-to-quarter. 
Gary Bisbee - Lehman Brothers: Let me ask you differently, are you willing to tell us an order of magnitude, rank those three things that you mentioned, the warmer winter versus the Project One Team disruption versus I think what you call just the general economic conditions? 
Scott Farmer: I would say that the winter effect was the least significant of that, but did have a noticeable and obvious impact. And one of them is an economic issue that we have been dealing with for sometime. The other is a timing issue. So, I think they are just different categories, and I am not sure how I would try and rank those two. 
Bill Gale: It would be difficult to do that Gary with any degree of accuracy, because it's hard to go through all of the components of that. But I think relatively speaking what Scott said would be something that makes sense. 
Scott Farmer: The quarterly weather thing is a one-time occurrence. The organization change is a significant operating organization change. So, that's an intermediate term thing. And the economic conditions have been a longer term thing. They are just three completely different sets of circumstances. All three of them came to play in one quarter and had an impact. 
Gary Bisbee - Lehman Brothers: Yes, it's a pretty dramatic sequential deceleration. And so I was trying to see if we could parse apart what really changed from quarter-to-quarter. From my viewpoint, it's the amateur's attempt of being an economist. It seems like the industrial economy has weakened somewhat, but maybe not that dramatically. So, I was trying to figure out, if there was anything else. But that's fine. That's a fine answer. Let me move onto the next question.  At what point, do you accept that some of these, what you are calling economic conditions, are likely to persist for a while and decide that you need to get more aggressive in pursuing acquisitions outside of the core uniform businesses? And are there even targets out there within the three non-uniform businesses that are of a scale that they would allow you to dramatically move that mix of the business in the next year or two? 
Bill Gale: Well, I think there are acquisition opportunities in those businesses that would certainly have an impact on the company. But I don't think we are going to do anything rash at this point, because we certainly don't believe that. With the businesses that we are in today, we still believe we have the potential to provide good growth opportunities in the company.  With that said, we are also though very active in looking at acquisitions. We are still very disciplined in our approach to looking at companies, and we will continue to add business as we think is beneficial to the shareholder. 
Gary Bisbee - Lehman Brothers: And so, I guess it's safe to assume you are not at a point where you think you have to be more aggressive to move the mix away from the uniforms? 
Bill Gale: I think as Scott said, before he and the rest of the management team here still believe that there are great opportunities in all of our businesses, including uniforms. And we are confident that at this point the Project One Team is going to help us to take advantage of those. 
Gary Bisbee - Lehman Brothers: Okay, great. Then just a couple of quick clean-up ones, if I could? I think it's a second quarter in a row that you mentioned that you had some short-term securities that you would wait till they mature to consider paying off some of that commercial paper. Over what time period is that stuff likely to mature? Are we talking 30 to 60 days or several months? 
Bill Gale: We have a few months left. I would say it's a decreasing balance as we move forward, but there are still some out there that go out to about nine months. 
Gary Bisbee - Lehman Brothers: Okay, all right. And then on the SG&A, it was obviously up dramatically. You did a good job of telling us about some of the components there. But I guess as we think forward to the May quarter, are there any of those that you would expect to change? And I know you are not giving '08 guidance, but is there any reason to think that the company could move towards seeing some leverage on that line over the next 6 to 12 months or is this going to keep rising?  And I guess what I am wondering is within the three non-uniform businesses, is that possible that you are seeing sort of higher gross margins, but also higher SG&A such that that's helping the gross margin, but maybe as you grow those could hurt SG&A? Or is that not accurate? 
Bill Gale: Those other businesses are hurting SG&A a little bit because of the large amount of selling expense we've in there. But as those businesses continue to grow and each location is of a size that the percent of selling expense to those locations will be reduced. We buy a lot of small or open a lot of small locations, for example, in document shredding and then we go ahead and dump in three or four sales reps into these new businesses. So, it does have a significant impact. That said when you look at everything in total, it's not moving the needle dramatically, but it is moving the needle.  I'd say in the other areas of G&A, there may be a little impact, but it's not dramatic. Again, it would be more from a scope perspective and a size and scale. That it would be a long-term issue.  Looking at the different components for this quarter is what may trigger the other way up. Traditionally payroll taxes drop back down, because they are out of the first quarter. And that's something I can tell you. As far as the other piece, it's difficult to say. We wouldn't expect SG&A to continue to rise though in total. But, different components go different ways at different times. You have pieces in there, such as medical, that are hard to quantify going forward. 
Scott Farmer: But, we wouldn't expect G&A to rise in percentage wise, but in dollars it will. 
Bill Gale: Right. 
Scott Farmer: As we grow the company, but I think if you go back in time you'll always find that the third quarter SG&A number is traditionally one of the highest of all the quarters. And you would expect there to be some benefit, as you go forward in other quarters. 
Gary Bisbee - Lehman Brothers: Okay. Great. Thanks for all the color. 
Operator: Now we'll hear from Pete Carrillo. 
Pete Carrillo - Citigroup: This is actually for Scott. Not certainly looking for you to speculate into this LBO issue. But, I was surprised to hear Scott, not come out and you guys say absolutely not, we would not consider going private. So, given the history of the company here, is there any involvement and etcetera. Anything you can say to that at all? Would you not rule it out? 
Scott Farmer: We don't have liberty to discuss any issues surrounding that matter. 
Pete Carrillo - Citigroup: Okay. Even conceptually you can't say -- you're against the idea or not? 
Mike Thompson: You are asking a hypothetical question. But, we are a public company and there are certain things that we just can't respond to and unfortunately this is an area that we just can't talk about. 
Pete Carrillo - Citigroup: Okay. In terms of the SG&A line, have you guys at all considered coming back to your partners and saying we need a potential raise in healthcare co-pays or have some sort of public company partners to contribute a little bit more to some of the healthcare increases that are going on? And is that something you considered at all or is that definitely not a possibility? 
Scott Farmer: We look at it every year, Pete. That is something we just feel it's appropriate for our partners to have an affordable healthcare program for them. Obviously, it's a balancing act, but we need to be fair to our partners. They are the main reason this company does well every year and we've got to be fair to them.  So, we look at it every year and you can see we are doing other things. We've just changed administrators on January 1, for the second time in three of four years, again looking for better networks but also to help reduce costs. So, it's a balancing act. I think every company has that across the country, but we intend to be fair to our employees as well. 
Pete Carrillo - Citigroup: Okay. And just last quick question was in terms of the winter effect. Did it affect not only rentals, did it also affect some of your catalogue business or direct sale business as well? 
Scott Farmer: Yes it did. Again more from a jacket and mat rental, but a large portion of our catalog is jackets or a good portion at that time of the year. So, it had an impact through that as well, certainly. 
Pete Carrillo - Citigroup: Okay thanks a lot. 
Operator: Moving on we will hear from Bruce Simpson. 
Bruce Simpson - William Blair & Company: Scott, I know that you no longer break out individual line items of the four components of organic growth as you once did. But, just directionally, as you look over the last year and your organic growth has come down, may be on the magnitude of 400 to 500 basis points, what is the largest and the second largest impact there? Is it primarily what you used to call the [drop-head] metric that you are just seeing too much erosion shrinkage of the existing wearers? Or is it primarily the Project One Team impact on new business written? 
Scott Farmer: I would say that all of it has an impact. But the biggest issue that boils down to us, I would say is not having as many sales reps selling weeks in the field as a result of these people going through training programs and time out of the field, as we have rolled this out. And it was completed at the end of December. But we have been working on it through this fiscal year. So, they just haven't had as many weeks in front of the prospects to sell and therefore it's impacting our new business.  It also means that we've taken an awful lot of most productive sales reps, our most experienced sales reps. Many of them were promoted into sales management positions. And the people coming in behind them, even after they get through their training program, are not nearly as productive in the first part of their sales tenure, as the person that they just replaced. And that takes some time for them to build that backup. So, that has had an impact as well. I think it's the new businesses where we had seen the biggest impact. 
Bruce Simpson - William Blair & Company: What about the pricing environment overall versus a year ago for new business accounts? Is it more intense than it once was or is that pretty predictable? 
Scott Farmer: Well, I would tell you that as I stated in my comments, one of the initial and early indicators of I think a more coordinated training program, and a sales management effort that is more focused is that we are seeing. For example, in our uniform rental business, new businesses are being sold at higher prices than they were before we had Project One Team in place. 
Bruce Simpson - William Blair & Company: Okay, switching gears. Can you give us what the run rate is on the Ultra-Clean business now? 
Bill Gale: We have not provided that previously. And at this point in time for competitive reasons we are not going to provide that. 
Bruce Simpson - William Blair & Company: Okay. On margins, the last time I heard an update on margin targets for the whole firm, it was net income rather than operating margin. And this goes back a couple of years ago when, Bill, I know you used to talk about 10% to 11% is what you thought was sustainable. 
Bill Gale: Right. 
Bruce Simpson - William Blair & Company: Given the changes in the business, and the investments in the business and the shift in mix, is that still really realistic? Is it either a net income or an operating income that's realistic over the next couple of years given your current portfolio of businesses? 
Bill Gale: Well, our net income given the change in the debt structure of the company obviously has been impacted. So the old 10% to 11% has to be adjusted for the interest factor that's in there, which means that you are looking at probably a pre-interest number, which is somewhere in the magnitude of 9% to 10%. 
Bruce Simpson - William Blair & Company: Okay. So, I guess what I am trying to get at is, has there been through maturation of the business through investments in growth [in] areas as an offset to try to create a favorable mix shift? Have we entered an area of permanently lower profitability that’s sustainable or is it realistic to think you are going to get back to the 16% operating margins? 
Scott Farmer: Bruce, I think, we have said that. And we know that these new businesses that we have gotten into have operating margin potential equal to our core rental business. So, we are confident that as they continue to grow and mature that they will be able to provide the same level of profitability that the rental business has.  Now, what have been the changes in the rental business? Well, the most significant change has been the impact from a cost standpoint of energy costs and it appears to me that based on what I am seeing is that energy costs may have reached a more permanent level of over 3% of sales. That was traditionally more of a 2% line.  So, while we'll continue to look for opportunities to conserve energy, use more fuel efficient vehicles, fuel efficient processes in our plants. There maybe the impact of higher energy costs, some of which might be able to be passed through to cost or price increases, but certainly at this point in time not all of it.  So, I am hedging the answer a little bit here, because I have got a couple of wildcards and I just don't know what is going to happen with it. But I would say the basic fundamentals of our businesses are that the new businesses are as profitable as the rental business. 
Bruce Simpson - William Blair & Company: Okay. And then, Bill just focusing once again on the SG&A line, from a pure dollar amount, it looks like there is roughly a $4 million to $5 million sequential increase in the number of dollars in that category from the November to the February period. And just to make sure, I understand that 5-ish million increase, even though it's over a shorter period, is that largely a factor of Project One Team and the change in sales? Or is the primary factor driving that sequential increase in medical benefits or --? 
Bill Gale: The big part of the sequential increase is payroll taxes, Bruce, because as you get to the third quarter, it includes the months of January and February. So the amounts have to start being accrued again, and paid out for all the payroll taxes associated with all our employees. That would be probably the most significant sequential increase in dollars from the second quarter to the third quarter. 
Bruce Simpson - William Blair & Company: Can you quantify what that largest piece represented? 
Bill Gale: I don't have that detail in front of me, Bruce. 
Bruce Simpson - William Blair & Company: Okay. And then the last question that I have. It has to do with something we haven't talked about in a while, RFID. Is that something that is still on the plate or has the company reached a conclusion that that’s not really economically viable any longer? Where do you stand with the adoption of that technology? 
Scott Farmer: Well, as we have stated, we are still committed to the concept. Our problem is that the chip that we were using could not meet the criteria of readability. And therefore, we are working now with some other chip suppliers to see if we can come up with a chip that can withstand the industrial laundry process and have the reliability that we need to have in order to make this more viable than just the barcode system that we use today. We still have the software and the antennas in place in our test plant, and we will be able to test with other suppliers' chips and we have got a few suppliers that we are working with, and we hope that we can come up with something that will make sense. 
Bruce Simpson - William Blair & Company: Okay. Thank you. 
Operator: Greg Halter has our next question. 
Greg Halter - Great Lakes Review: In the past, I think you have talked about other operating margins, other service revenue margin of 32% to 37% as a goal. And obviously you have exceeded that at 38.1% in this quarter. I am just wondering if you have given any reconsideration to where you stand in that area? 
Bill Gale: We are reconsidering that, and we will be providing more guidance on that at yearend. Obviously as the document shredding and First Aid and Safety businesses get to be larger components of other services, that is ratcheting up the gross margin. And also some improvements within our National Account Sales division through sourcing activity have been a positive as well. So, we are aware of that and obviously at this point, we think we will be towards the upper end of that range. But we will give more guidance in our 10-K. 
Greg Halter - Great Lakes Review: Okay. And I wondered if you had the rentals and other service revenues -- the pre-tax income figures for those two segments? 
Bill Gale: I have got it here, and I can't put my finger on the page right now. I am sorry. 
Greg Halter - Great Lakes Review: That's alright. I have got. Two other quick ones if you are still looking. Just wondered, in the past you had mentioned that your share repurchase was not in your guidance figures? And I wonder if there is any change in that? 
Bill Gale: No, there has been no change in that concept. So, we don't have that anticipated in the guidance. 
Greg Halter - Great Lakes Review: Okay. 
Bill Gale: I found it Greg. 
Greg Halter - Great Lakes Review: Okay, thanks. 
Bill Gale: Income before income taxes for rentals' operating segment? 
Greg Halter - Great Lakes Review: Right. 
Bill Gale: Was $105.2 million. And other services segment was $27.5 million. 
Greg Halter - Great Lakes Review: So that was up 35% year-over-year. Okay. And the last question is, what do you normally pay for the acquisitions. And again I can presume primarily in document management and First Aid in relation to EBITDA for the companies you are acquiring, is it five times or ten times? 
Bill Gale: It really varies Greg. It depends on the acquisitions. I would say that we are paying today in the same range that we have been paying. But I can tell you, it really comes down to the quality of the underlying business. Uniform rental is looking at the customer contract situation and their customer relationships and the inventory that you are getting, etcetera, and whether or not you are buying a plant. And you can follow that through every business that we are acquiring.  We really have a set parameter, where we obviously have made a lot of acquisitions in the past and we think we are pretty astute at it. We follow a very rigid approach to make sure that we are not overpaying and hold to that and look for strategic opportunities. So we don't provide those ranges. But I can tell you that it's a very stringent process. 
Greg Halter - Great Lakes Review: Okay. I am just wondering if it's above or below the 9.6, you are currently trading at now? 
Bill Gale: Yeah. 
Greg Halter - Great Lakes Review: Thanks. 
Bill Gale: Sure. 
Operator: And now we will hear again from Michael Schneider. 
Michael Schneider - Robert W. Baird: Guys, just on the margin topic within other services again. You have been basically accelerating incremental margins within other services. You look back a year ago, you were doing this 7%, 8% incremental margins, and now you are doing over 22% pre-tax incremental margins. Is that a function again of just beginning to leverage the sales force and sales initiatives that you have got in place? I guess question one.  And then question two, does that number actually continue to accelerate, or are you at a pace now of investment, which will probably cap that incremental increase? 
Bill Gale: Well, I think the answer to your question is that we expect those margins to continue to improve, because those businesses continue to become bigger. We are working on ways of picking a lot of acquisitions and bringing them into the Cintas way. We are looking at opportunities in sourcing in our direct sale business that are paying benefits. So, our expectation, Michael, is that we would hope that that will continue to improve.  Now with that said, also we keep buying other businesses and then we keep bringing those in. We wanted to establish the national footprint. So we've got that investment aspect that's going on at the same time.  But as Mike talked about before, there certainly is no question that our expectations from the contribution from those businesses is higher to-date than what it was a few years ago and we are going to maybe be updating that in our next 10-K. 
Michael Schneider - Robert W. Baird: Yes, Bill, I understand that operating margins in other services are rising. I am focused on incremental margins and those have been running. Operating margins in this quarter are 11.5. Incremental margins on that increase in revenue are running at 21%. What I am asking is that number has been rising now for four or five quarters. Is that number prone to continue to rise because you are investing on the margin less? Or is the 21% incremental margin the theoretical cap for this business? 
Bill Gale: The timing of that really depends, Michael. It doesn't necessarily indicate that that's going to continue to rise at a faster rate. We can say that in total it's going to continue to rise, but from a sequential basis type of approach, I can't say that it is always going to continue to rise or that we have capped out. I don’t think it's capped out completely, but I can't say if next quarter is going to be higher than this on a sequential basis. 
Michael Schneider - Robert W. Baird: Okay. Thank you. 
Operator: That was our last question. I will turn it back over to you for any closing remarks. 
Bill Gale: Thank you all for joining us. We appreciate your interest. We will be releasing our fourth quarter results sometime in mid-June. We will be looking forward to talking to you at that time. 
Operator: That does conclude today's conference. We do thank you for your participation.
