===== 2024 Q4  (2025-03-13 16:30:00) =====
Operator: Good afternoon. And welcome to Ulta Beauty's conference call to discuss results for the Ulta Beauty fourth quarter 2024 earnings results. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question and answer session will follow the formal presentation. We ask that you limit yourself to one question and then reenter the queue for any additional questions. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce Ms. Kiley Rawlins, Vice President of Investor Relations. Ms. Rawlins, please proceed.
Kiley Rawlins: Thank you, Alicia, and good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us for a discussion of Ulta Beauty's fourth quarter and fiscal 2024 results. Hosting our call today are Kecia Steelman, Chief Executive Officer, and Paula Oyibo, Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I'd like to remind you of the company's Safe Harbor language. Many of our remarks today will contain forward-looking statements, which speak only as of today, March 13, 2025. We refer you to our earnings release and SEC filings where you will find a number of factors which could cause actual results to differ materially from those forward-looking statements. Kecia will begin our call with key highlights from our fiscal 2024 results and share our priorities for fiscal 2025. Then Paula will review our fourth quarter results in more detail and discuss our outlook for fiscal 2025. Following our prepared remarks, we will open the call for questions. Our call will be a little longer than usual this time, and so to allow us to accommodate as many questions as possible during the hour scheduled for this call, we respectfully ask that you limit your time to one question. If you have additional questions, please requeue. And as always, the IR team will be available for any follow-up questions after the call. Before I turn the call over to Kecia, I want to share that both Paula and Kecia are fighting seasonal colds and you may notice that their voices are a bit raspy this afternoon. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Kecia. Kecia?
Kecia Steelman: Thank you, Kiley, and good afternoon, everyone. I've had the pleasure of participating in these calls over the last few years as COO, and I'm excited to host my first call as CEO today. I appreciate your continued interest in Ulta Beauty, and look forward to engaging with each of you. Today, I'll provide my perspective on the strength of our business, highlight where I focus my first sixty days as CEO, and share some of our 2024 achievements. And discuss how I'm thinking about our long-term growth opportunities and prioritizing our actions. It all starts with our mission. Simply put, there's magic in our mission. Every day, we seek to use the power of beauty to bring to life the possibilities that lie within each of us. We have a unique opportunity to serve beauty enthusiasts at nearly every stage of life and in so many milestone moments. From their first date, to their first job interview, to their wedding day and so many moments in between. It's a mission uniquely suited for Ulta Beauty. One I feel very privileged to steward. And I know that no one can bring this mission to life the way we can. While I've been at Ulta Beauty for more than a decade, in my first sixty days as CEO, I made it a priority to spend meaningful time with our brand partners, guests, leadership team, and store associates to assess the state of our business including where we're winning, and where we have opportunities. I've made organizational changes to streamline decision-making, and align our teams around guest-centric goals and I've leaned in where we have immediate opportunities to improve our execution. All through the lens of protecting and nurturing the culture that we believe makes us so special. I stepped into this role with incredible optimism because it's evident to me the foundational advantages of our business model are strong and more relevant than ever. We have an unmatched breadth of assortment, we provide convenient and engaging omnichannel accessibility. We built meaningful brand equity and a leading loyalty program. We have a strong financial foundation, with stable operating cash flow and we have more than fifty-eight thousand talented associates who are the heart of our company and represent our brand to our guests every day. The beauty landscape has fundamentally changed. Guest expectations continue to rise and the pace of change is accelerating. The competitive environment in beauty has never been more intense. For the first time, we lost market share in the beauty category in 2024. I'm aware of the challenges that we face, some of them are external, while others we own. Our business is bigger, and we've managed unprecedented category growth. And it is more complex. As we've expanded our assortment and added new fulfillment choices like buy online, pick up in store, ship from store, and same-day delivery. These capabilities are driving guest engagement and enhanced accessibility that have also resulted in execution challenges particularly in product transitions and launches, as we leverage new tools and processes. As a result, our in-store presentation and guest experience today are not as strong as we would like. These are opportunities well within our control. We've identified specific gaps and we're working quickly to address. And I'm leaning in with our teams and brand partners to improve in-store presentation and inventory levels to deliver a better guest experience. It's clear to me that how is operated must change to ensure that we capture the opportunities in front of us. We are focusing to ensure the guest is at the center of everything we do, and we intend to move faster, invest strategically, and optimize our business to achieve our long-term goals to drive profitable growth and market share. I'll dive into our long-term plan to achieve these objectives shortly. But first, let's review the progress made in 2024. We're proud to have finished the year ahead of our expectations. Paula will share more about our financial performance in a few minutes, but I want to highlight just a few of our key 2024 achievements. Including enhancing our assortment, through the relaunch of our Ulta Beauty collection, and the launch of forty new brands including exclusive brands like Exo Chloe, Noise, Wynn Beauty, guest favorites like Charlotte Tilbury, ILLIA, and Pacha. Expanding accessibility through the opening of sixty net new stores, a hundred new Ulta Beauty at Target shop-in-shop locations, and improved digital functionality. We also initiated plans to launch in Mexico and most recently announced our expansion into the Middle East in 2025. Re-launching and growing our loyalty program three percent to a record high of forty-four point six million members, driving significant gains in brand love and social engagement through compelling marketing and advertising efforts and completing several transformational infrastructure investments, including the upgrade of our ERP system digital store, and data ecosystem. Looking forward, we remain optimistic about the strength and resilience of the beauty category. We are mindful that consumers are navigating a dynamic macro and but we continue to expect healthy consumer engagement in beauty. While the category has normalized, we believe in the positive dynamics within the category. Including a strong and growing connection between beauty and wellness. Increased digital usage, a strong innovation pipeline, and consumer engagement. And we expect these dynamics will support continued category growth in the low to mid-single-digit range over the next few years. Now I want to share how we're prioritizing our actions as we look to deliver a stronger guest experience and value to our stakeholders. The long-term strategies and financial targets that we outlined in our COBRA Investor Day we continue to guide our path forward. To bring further focus to our efforts, we've aligned our plan around three main priorities. First, drive core business growth. Second, scale new accretive businesses. And third, realign our foundation for the future. We're calling our plan Ulta Beauty Unleashed. We recognize the need to move quickly, and we will be deliberate about pacing and prioritization to ensure that we can execute well and manage the short-term financial impact. Turning to our first priority, driving core business growth. We have a strong model and have identified significant opportunities to unlock further advantages. This means continuing to push for excellence in all areas of our operations and strengthening our go-to-market approach. With the guests always at the center of everything we do. As I shared earlier, our teams are focused on opportunities to sharpen our execution and get back to the basics of running excellent stores that are easy to navigate, fully stocked, appropriately staffed, clean, and inviting. Beyond a return to best-in-class execution, in 2025, we will focus primarily on three initiatives, to drive core growth. Brand building, personalization, and digital acceleration. We will enhance our assortment through further investments in brand building with a particular focus on exclusive emerging and established brands. We've kicked off 2025 with an exciting start with the announcement of several notable brand launches. These include fan favorite Note Makeup, and the innovative K Beauty skincare brand Anua. Exclusive to Ulta Beauty. And we're thrilled about the upcoming retail debut of Beyonce's hair care brand Sacred. Also exclusive to Ulta Beauty, which we will bring to life in unique ways through our salon. We'll continue to build this momentum throughout the year and into 2026. We will deepen guest engagement through accelerated personalization, increasing automation and real-time content across digital channels. We will accelerate our digital efforts delivering new enhanced features on our app, and website aimed at elevating the guest experience. Second, we intend to scale new and accretive businesses to capitalize on key growth opportunities and ensure that we remain resilient in a rapidly changing world. In 2025, we'll focus on four initiatives. Accelerating our focus on wellness, launching a new marketplace which will expand our e-commerce presence and allow us to offer a broader array of beauty and wellness products to our guests build upon our international presence, and we also plan to introduce several key enhancements to our Ulta Beauty Media offering. Including new product innovation that provides brands with new ways to reach consumers. Along with enhanced closed-loop measurements. Finally, realigning our foundation for the future. To successfully achieve our long-term growth ambitions, reassert our leadership position, and deliver value to our stakeholders, we must optimize ways of working and streamline our cost structure. It starts by focusing on the heart of our company, our teams and our culture. At our core, I believe that we have the very best talent and culture in retail. We're taking steps to reenergize this critical competitive advantage by optimizing the ways of working and positioning our leadership team to meet the needs of our evolving business. We've made several organizational changes to accelerate decision-making, remove friction, and align teams and resources around guest-centric goals. This includes taking steps to optimize our corporate and field support staff, reducing management layers, and shifting resources to higher growth driving areas. Additionally, I may have made several changes to our executive leadership team better focus on our key priorities, To support a stronger guest experience in stores, we've centralized all store functions under Amy Bayer Thomas, an Ulta Beauty veteran, who will serve in the newly created role of chief retail officer With this change, Amy will add real estate, and store design to our existing scope which includes leadership of our store teams, and the loss prevention organization. To align our transformation efforts with our cost optimization initiatives, Mike Maresca, joined our team in 2023, will add enterprise-wide responsibilities to his scope will now serve as chief technology and transformation officer. Amy and Mike are transformational leaders. Who are guest and associate-centric and results-driven and they will continue to impact our organization with broader scope that results in our strategic focus and vision for the future. To facilitate a stronger omnichannel assortment of all things beauty and wellness, we've brought our digital and e-commerce teams together with our merchandising and planning teams under Monica Renato, who now serves as chief merchandising and digital officer. As you may know, Monica announced her plans to retire later this spring. Monica has been a great partner to me, and her vision has elevated our assortment enhanced our brand partnerships, and driven meaningful market share growth. I look forward to sharing an update on her successor very soon. We've also promoted Kelly Mahoney to chief marketing officer to advance our brand, personalization, and loyalty efforts. Kelly is uniquely qualified for this role. Her understanding of a beauty enthusiast is unmatched. And in her ten years with Ulta Beauty, she has played a pivotal role in evolving and expanding the Ulta Beauty rewards loyalty program to more than forty-four million members. Additionally, Jody Caro, our general counsel, chief risk and compliance officer, has shared her intention to retire later this spring as more than ten years of service at Ulta Beauty. An energetic and passionate leader, Jodi has been a true business partner I want to thank her for her contribution. After conducting a nationwide search, I'm pleased to announce that Renee Kazares previously chief legal officer from Academy Sports, be joining our team next month as chief legal officer. Renee and Jody will work together to ensure a seamless transition. Today, I've shared our plan to make important guest-facing investments which are necessary to improve our competitiveness and reaccelerate long-term share growth. These investments will pressure profitability in 2025. But we believe they are critical to driving long-term sustainable growth in a competitive innovative category. However, we cannot sustain this level of annual expense growth and achieve our long-term profitability goals. Disciplined management of our cost structure is an ongoing area of focus, As we've shared at our Investor Day in October, we are targeting cost optimization of two hundred or over the next three years. Since 2019, we've delivered five fifty million dollars in cost savings from optimization efforts across merchandising, real estate, operational process improvements. And I am confident that we can deliver our cost future saving target. We're in the early stages of these efforts will provide regular updates on our progress. Our Ulta Beauty Unleashed plan positions us to reassert our leadership position. Building on our strengths by fueling growth of our core business, scaling new accretive businesses that further our differentiation, and realigning our foundation for the future. While sales growth is the ultimate performance indicator, we are closely tracking a series of KPIs for each of our focus areas, including in-store conversion, member growth and retention, and app engagement. Over the coming quarters, we'll provide more details of our plan and updates on our progress. In closing, I'm incredibly optimistic about the future of Ulta Beauty. 2025 will be an important year as we improve our execution and lay the groundwork to deliver on our long-term financial targets. Including net revenue growth of four percent to six percent, mid-single-digit operating profit growth, and low double-digit EPS growth. It will take time for us to fully see the impact of our efforts, but with our exceptionally talented team leading the charge, I believe we are taking the right steps to drive profitable growth and market share leadership in beauty and wellness over the long term. And with that, I'll turn it over to Paula for some specific quarter results and our financial outlook before we take some questions. Paula?
Paula Oyibo: Thanks, Kecia, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, I will start with a discussion of our fourth quarter and full-year financial results and then provide color on our expectations for fiscal 2025. Starting with the fourth quarter, we delivered better-than-expected performance across the P&L reflecting stronger revenue growth, lower inventory shrink, better merchandise margin, and continued financial discipline and expense management. Net sales for the thirteen-week quarter decreased one point nine percent to three point five billion dollars compared to three point six billion dollars in the fourteen-week period last year. During the quarter, we opened nine new stores, closed one store, and remodeled five stores. Comparable net sales comparable sales for the thirteen-week period increased one point five percent driven by a three percent increase in average ticket, partially offset by a one point four percent decrease in transactions. Other revenue declined six million to seventy-one million primarily due to lower income from our credit card program. Now looking at the cadence of sales through the quarter, comp sales decreased in November and accelerated in December. Reflecting the shift of Thanksgiving, and a compressed holiday season. Growth moderated in January, primarily reflecting adverse winter weather. Sharing more detail on our holiday performance, comp sales for the combined November and December period increased in the low single-digit range. Reflecting the cross-functional efforts of our team to deliver for our guests this holiday season. Our marketing and social strategies drove strong omnichannel chat traffic. Our enhanced fulfillment options provided increased convenience and accessibility for guests. In our curated assortment of new and exclusive core products balanced with value-focused holiday kits drove strong engagement. With additional staffing, new tools, and unique events, our store teams delivered great guest experiences and our DC teams flexed up to ensure our stores recovered quickly post-holiday. From a channel perspective, we saw growth across both store and digital channels. Ecommerce sales for the quarter increased in the mid-single-digit range and comp store sales were modestly positive, an improvement from the third-quarter trend. Turning to sales performance by category. Fragrance was our strongest category. Delivering double-digit comp growth, primarily driven by newness. Men's fragrance and multi-branded gift sets. Comp sales in the skincare category increased in the mid-single-digit range as strong growth in body care, was partially offset by decreases in prestige and mass skincare. New brands, including Sol de Janeiro, Naturium, and Tatcha delivered strong growth for the quarter. But this strength was partially offset by lower sales from brands, which have experienced increased distribution or lapped strong social engagement last year. Comp sales in the hair category increased in the low single-digit range, primarily due to newness in exclusives in hair tools as well as healthy guest engagement with key promotional events. The makeup category experienced a mid-single-digit decrease largely driven by mass makeup. Reflecting softness in brands which lapped strong newness in social engagement last year. Finally, services delivered low single-digit comp growth, driven by increases in salon and specialty service including ear piercing and makeup services. For the quarter, gross margin increased fifty basis points to thirty-eight point two percent, primarily due to lower inventory shrink. Our investments in protective fixtures, training and labor combined with enhanced inventory management processes are delivering results. For the full year, shrink as a percentage of sales was twenty basis points lower than fiscal 2023. Additionally, gross margin in the quarter benefited from favorable channel mix due to lower e-commerce shipping costs, and higher merchandise margin, mostly offset by higher supply chain costs lower other revenue, and deleverage of store fixed. Moving to expenses. SG&A was eight sixteen million dollars five million dollars lower than last year. Largely due to lower corporate overhead, partially offset by higher store payroll and benefits. Corporate overhead was lower for the quarter, driven primarily by lower consulting expense. As we anniversaried implementation costs associated with key infrastructure investments. The increase in store payroll and benefits was driven by higher health care costs, increased payroll hours per store, to support the guest experience during holiday, and higher average wage rate. As a percentage of sales, SG&A increased thirty basis points to twenty-three point four percent. Depreciation increased twelve percent to seventy million dollars for the quarter compared to sixty-three million dollars last year. Primarily reflecting new store and supply chain investments. Operating profit was five hundred and sixteen million, approximately flat with last year. As a percentage of sales, operating margin increased thirty basis points to fourteen point eight percent of sales and diluted earnings per share increased four point seven percent to eight dollars and forty-six cents. I am proud of how our teams persevered in quarter and Q4 to deliver these results, positioning us to close out the year better than expected. And I want to express my sincere appreciation to all our Ulta Beauty associates for their continued commitment and focus on serving our guests. While continuing to manage our business thoughtfully. To recap the full year, net sales increased zero point eight percent to eleven point three billion. Comp sales increased zero point seven percent driven by a one point one percent increase in average ticket and a point four percent decrease in transactions. We opened sixty net new stores, relocated two stores, and remodeled forty-one stores. Gross margin deleveraged thirty basis points to thirty-eight point eight percent, SG&A expense increased four point two percent to two point eight billion. Operating profit was thirteen point nine percent of sales compared to fifteen percent of sales in fiscal 2023. And diluted EPS decreased two point seven percent to twenty-five dollars and thirty-four cents per share. Moving to the balance sheet. And our capital allocation priorities. We ended the quarter with seven hundred and three million dollars in cash and cash equivalents. Total inventory increased thirteen percent to two billion dollars primarily reflecting additional inventory to support new brand launches, the impact of sixty net new stores and investments to improve merchandise in stocks post-holiday. From a category perspective, most of the inventory growth is attributable to investments made to support fragrance and body care which are key growth categories. Turning to capital allocation. Our healthy business model generated more than one point three billion dollars in cash from operations, enabling us to reinvest three hundred and seventy-four million dollars to support future growth and return one billion in capital to shareholders through our stock buyback program. Since launching our share repurchase program in 2014, we've effectively returned six point eight billion dollars to shareholders while continuing to invest in strategic growth drivers. Turning now to our outlook for 2025. The operating environment continues to be dynamic. And as we navigate ongoing consumer uncertainty, we believe it is prudent to take a cautious approach to our guidance for fiscal 2025. Additionally, as we shared at our investor meeting in October, we are planning fiscal 2025 to be a transition year and our view has not changed. For the year, we expect net sales will be between eleven point five billion dollars and eleven point six billion dollars with comp sales growth in the range of flat to up one percent. We expect operating profit will decrease in the low double-digit range as we begin to implement our Ulta Beauty Unleashed plan and continue to manage the headwinds and lap one-time expense benefits in 2024. Reflecting our expectations for revenue growth, we expect operating margin will be between eleven point seven percent and eleven point eight percent of net sales. To share more color into the primary drivers of the expected operating margin pressure. The largest driver of the deleverage is expected inflationary pressure on wages, health care, and transportation rates. As well as the impact of investments we've made over the last few years, including greater utilization of software as a service and higher depreciation. The second largest driver is pressure from the investments Kecia discussed earlier, including brand building, personalization, digital acceleration, wellness, and marketplace. Incentive comp will also be a headwind as we lap lower incentive compensation in 2024. We expect these pressures will be partially mitigated by lower inventory shrink, supply chain optimization, benefits from UB Media, and targeted cost savings. We are confident that investments we plan to make this year are critical to strengthening our long-term market position and we are tracking our spend and returns closely to ensure we deliver expected benefits. We also recognize the operating environment will evolve and we will continue to be thoughtful about chasing and prioritization. For modeling purposes, we expect gross margin for the year will delever primarily driven by store occupancy costs and supply chain costs partially offset by lower shrink. We expect SG&A will increase approximately ten percent for the year. Driven primarily by our strategic investments, and advertising as well as increased store payroll and benefits. Reflecting these assumptions, we anticipate diluted EPS for the year will be between twenty-two point five zero dollars and twenty-two dollars and ninety cents per share. Finally, we plan to spend between four twenty-five million dollars and five hundred million dollars in CapEx. Including approximately two hundred and fifty to two hundred and seventy-five million for new stores, remodels, and merchandise fixtures. One hundred and twenty-five million to one hundred and sixty-five million for supply chain and IT and fifty to sixty million for store maintenance and other. We expect depreciation for the year will be between two hundred and ninety and three hundred million. In closing, we operate in an innovative and expanding category. We intend to continue to invest to strengthen our competitive position and drive growth while simultaneously looking for opportunities to reduce cost and increase efficiency. While we view 2025 as a transitional year, we are confident the actions we are taking will enable us to deliver our long-term financial goals and drive value creation. And now, I'll turn the call over to our operator to moderate the Q&A session.
Operator: Thank you. We will now be conducting a question and answer session. Queue by pressing the star keys. One moment please while we pull for questions. Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Dana Telsey with Telsey Advisory Group. Please proceed.
Dana Telsey: Good afternoon, everyone. Congratulations, Kecia, on your new role. With the Unleash plan that you discussed today, almost it seems like a greater sense of urgency, to address and reexcite the core store base. How are you thinking about the in-store experience and guest presentation needs to change? And as that target of four to six percent sales growth, that's out there on the long term, how do you think about getting back there? Is the Investor Day targets which is a transitional year in 2025, given the unleashed plan and what you need to do, should we expect a transitional year in 2026? Or how do you frame it and Paula is there any cadence to or shaping to 2025 that we should be mindful of? Thank you.
Kecia Steelman: Well, thank you, Dana, for the question. Yeah. We're very excited about the Ulta Beauty Unleashed plan. And really what we did was we took the long-term strategies from our financial targets that we outlined at our Investor Day, and we developed this plan to really simplify our focus for our internal team so we can help them really prioritize and drive around the three areas of our business. Driving core business growth, building new accretive businesses, and realigning the foundation. It's not necessarily new information since we had our investor day. It's really how we're approaching it internally. What we found is when the teams clearly understand their objectives and their mission, the execution level continues to raise. And then I would say the other nuance is the change that we've made with the transformation office now reporting into Mike Morska. Having full visibility end to end in stage gating our investments so we can see and track how the investments are performing and also holding our teams internally accountable give us great confidence and that we can continue to drive the execution in 2025 and continue to move the business forward.
Paula Oyibo: Sure. Hi. Hi, Dana. What I would say is, we continue to expect, as I said, 2025 to be the transition year, and so we are not anticipating anything beyond that to be considered a transitional period. And, regarding your questions regarding comp, so expecting comp from, you know, flat to up one. What I would say is you know, we're not planning any wide variation in, comp quarter to quarter. You know, the environment continues to be dynamic with ongoing kinda uncertainty and and such. And so we we've set this level at at a comp level that we're we're confident we'll be able to to achieve. We do recognize, though, that given Q1 and Q4 were our strongest quarters in 2024, that Q2 and Q3 likely has the greatest opportunity from a a comp perspective. Hope that helps.
Dana Telsey: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Lorraine Hutchinson with Bank of America. Please proceed.
Lorraine Hutchinson: Thank you. I was just hoping for an update on how you're thinking about the fleet. I saw the sixty new openings this year. I know you have a goal for two hundred over the next three. Can you talk about the locations of these stores, the sizes, and then expectations for performance of those new stores that you roll out?
Kecia Steelman: Well, I would say that we have a very robust process around our real estate site selections. And, you know, the rich member data that we have we can see opportunities where there's infill opportunities and there's also opportunities in where we can continue to expand in the areas that we already have stores because there's additional market share opportunities. We see these being a mix of formats going forward. Very balanced in our approach. We don't really see that we're leaning one way or another on any of the formats in terms of size. So I'd say it's it's more of our traditional plan of new store launches and rollouts for the future. And the the additional point to add is that we continue to see strong new store performance. In our our 2024 class. And so anticipating similar results with our 2025 class.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Binetti with Evercore ISI. Please proceed.
Michael Binetti: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking our question. So Kecia, you've been in Ulta a long time, and developed a unique knowledge of what's made it successful in the past with the industry dynamics. That led to a lot of those successes have obviously changed. You take over the point of time with a lot of crosscurrents in what's a very resilient category historically. Also, I guess, also experience through that period with slower sales and perhaps some share losses that you mentioned earlier on. You've been a part of the early innings of resetting the strategy with the analyst they plan that you referenced, and the company reset the near-term margins lower to allow for some investment. What do you what do you see as the most important things to rebuild your moat around the business? Given the competitive dynamics today. Is it through assessment or sorry. Through assortment, or do you need to make meaningful changes to loyalty, serious changes to the to the supply chain? What are the critical pieces to get right today that are that are different in the past?
Kecia Steelman: Well, thank you, Michael, for the question. I would say that you know, the retail environment, especially in beauty, has always been competitive, but the competitive intensity is continuing to accelerate. So there's not just one area, I believe, of the business that you can lean on. You have to really be balanced in your approach. Which is why we've called our, Ulta Beauty Unleashed plan really focusing on all of the parts of the business that make us not only uniquely special at Ulta Beauty, but are also the drivers of leveraging our strengths in supercharging them. For example, brand building. We know how to build brands, but you know, leaning into building brands in a different and unique way in a three sixty approach in partnership with those brands. Marketplace, allowing us to have an even broader assortment in a lower risk way to offer broader assortments to our guests. Personalization, I can go on and on because they they all really matter. And the the beauty of this business is when we hit on all cylinders, it's like magic. And you're right. When I go back to my early days, we were hitting on all of those cylinders. I do truly believe that by focusing on these parts of the business along with getting back to basics, and the everyday running of the the business in exceptional way is what's going to really take us to the next level. And I mentioned in my comments too of really keeping the guest at the center of everything we do. And that's really what this Ulta Beauty and Lease plan is. It's about keeping the guest at the center of everything we do along with closely aligning our associates at the same time because our associates are the best representation of our brand because they're the ones that are interacting every single day the guests that are coming in our stores.
Michael Binetti: Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Adrienne Yih-Tennant with Barclays. Please proceed.
Adrienne Yih-Tennant: Good afternoon. Congratulations, Kecia. I wanted to go to my my one question is gonna be on the new categories that you talked about kind of just for growth over the long haul. Can you talk about where you're underpenetrated? Like, when we were at the Analyst Day, you and I talked about kind of health and wellness. As an emerging secular trend on top of beauty. If you could talk about some of the opportunities you see in the near term and then over the longer-term horizon. Thank you very much.
Kecia Steelman: I you cut out a little bit on the beginning, but I think you were asking about wellness. Wellness is a category that's largely growing and we see consumer engagement and product innovation continuing to expand. Today, you know, we have dedicated space but it's limited in our stores. It's about eight feet eight feet in most of our store locations. You know, there's new categories that we really feel like we can lean into. Like nutrition, mindfulness, everyday care, and sleep. It's all really, really important. In 2025, where we're gonna be looking at leaning into is really it starts with our leadership. We've created a new dedicated commercial leader and team that they're committed to just driving wellness at Ulta Beauty. We're also looking at expanding our wellness assortment to at least twenty new brands in short order. And then looking at designing and implementing an expanded in-store presentation in select stores. You know, we were continue to lean in on this. We do think that there's just this emergence between beauty and wellness and we'll be able to share more in the coming months. But we've got it. The plan and the team, and we're ready to now start moving in the right direction to bring this to life. And I appreciate the question.
Adrienne Yih-Tennant: Great. Thank you very much. Best of luck.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.
Simeon Gutman: Hi, Kecia. It's Simeon. How are you doing? My question is, you know, back at analyst day, I was a little surprised that there was more focus on new store growth as opposed to looking back at the fleet and enhancing the current fleet. I wanted to get your take on it. You know, what can you do with the fleet? I'm surprised there isn't more of a refresh. Do you agree with that perspective? And then can the the focus of the business tilt in 2025 or 2026 to focus more on remodels? Thanks.
Kecia Steelman: Yeah. I'm gonna take the start of it, and I'll ask Paula to weigh in on sub submarines. You know, what I shared earlier is that we do have such great data around where there's opportunities for us to continue to take share in the United States. And that's where we're leaning in and additional new stores. We don't wanna overbuild our store fleet. I've we've seen that before in retail. And, I don't wanna be a part of that by any means at Ulta Beauty. So when we're looking at new stores, we're very confident that we can take continue to take share and open those new stores in a very profitable way. In fact, one of the largest assets that we have are our stores in and of itself. I appreciate your question around, can you make the stores that you have currently in place even more profitable? And I would say yes. We're we're continuing to lean in and look at ways in which we can continue to drive even more profitability out of our existing store fleet. Wellness is one of those areas that we're leaning into. Where you look at, can we trade out categories that are less productive and give this space to a new and emerging type category? Also looking at assortment. Are there opportunities for us to continue to refine assortment to make sure we're looking at the tail? It's it's something that is really, really important. And then you know, keeping the guest experience front and center, our stores are just so important for us to be able to continue to refresh our brand and the brands that we're bringing in. The one thing that's changed even in my ten years here at Ulta Beauty is that beauty is becoming a little bit more, fashionable. And in and out, You've gotta be on the cutting edge and the trend, and you gotta be really flexible with the space that you have dedicated to to brands in the store. And that's one of the things that we've really been leaning into with our renovations is having more universal type fixtures so we aren't locked into bigger boutiques, etcetera. So it gives us a lot flexibility to bring brands in and out. And then Paula, did you wanna add anything about renovations?
Paula Oyibo: The only the only thing that I I would add is just a reminder. We're expecting the remodel forty to forty-five stores this year. But the other thing to to keep in mind is that we actually we with our merch as we are bringing in newness into our stores and launching brands and lifting certain category. And so, actually, we we do a really good job of keeping our fleet up and updated and fresh. And then also as as we shared at our our analyst day, I mean, our fleet profitability is very, very high, and we watch it very closely to continue to maintain that level of profitability.
Simeon Gutman: Thank you. Good luck.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Stephen Forbes with Guggenheim Securities. Please proceed.
Stephen Forbes: Good evening, Kecia Paula. I wanted I wanted to follow-up on on market share and certainly appreciate the optimism around the unleashed plan. Curious if you can maybe frame or reframe how you guys are thinking about planning for some of the factors that may be out of your control. Right? Cannibalization and distribution point expansion. And then and then specific to cannibalization impacts, now that we've, you know, sort of had more time pass here, can you maybe renew give us your renewed thoughts around how long it has you know, takes a cannibalized store to recover and and return to sort of company average comp profiles.
Paula Oyibo: May maybe, Steve, I'll I'll start and if there's more to add. You know, we as we've talked about, this has been unprecedented period over the last several years with the increased points distribution, particularly for Prestige. Prestige beauty. We expect competitive pressure will continue to impact our fleet, but we expect the impact will be lower than what we experienced in 2024. You know, at the end of 2024, more than ninety percent of our stores have been impacted by one or more competitive openings. In recent years, and then two-thirds of them impacted by multiple competitive openings. The good news is that we are seeing an improving trend in the performance of the stores that were impacted by physical points of distribution the last several years. And we believe both the lapping of the new openings and the impact of our operational efforts are contributing to the improving trend. And then layer on top of that, the actions we're taking as a part of the Ulta Beauty Unleashed plan, we feel confident that it will still take some time but things are moving in the in the right direction.
Stephen Forbes: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mark Altschwager with Baird. Please proceed.
Mark Altschwager: Good evening. Thanks for taking my question. And, Kecia, congratulations. With respect to the revenue guidance, up two percent to three percent, is how does that compare to your underlying assumptions for the beauty category? In 2025? Then Ulta did lose a bit of share in 2024. In the prepared remarks, you talked about spending more on marketing. What's baked into the margin guidance in terms of promotions and then other actions to defend or recapture market share in 2025? Thank you.
Kecia Steelman: Alright. Well, I'll start with talking a little bit about the category trends. Yes. The consumers are navigating a dynamic macro environment, but we continue to expect the healthy consumer engagement with beauty. While the category did slow in 2024, it continued to grow in the low to mid-single-digit range. You know, part of that growth was driven by the growing connected connection between beauty and wellness, which is where we're leaning into. There is a healthy innovation pipeline, and we feel good about our innovation pipeline also for 2025 and also just having strong overall engagement within the category. You know, while others have commented and there's a lot going on clearly out there in the world today, January and February were impacted by a combination of some weather and fires in LA and heightened economic and geopolitical volatility. So, you know, it's I'd say it's too early for us to know if this is really structural or a reflection of some of the weather disruptions or some of the things that were happening happening because you know, we're lapping some strong growth also from last year. And then Paula, do you wanna lean into the second part of the question?
Paula Oyibo: Sure. Specific to promotions and how we're thinking about promotions as it relates to our our sales and our comp side, what I would say is that underpinning our expectation is that the promotional environment will continue to be rational. And so what we we we saw last year in 2024 is that the promotional environment increased. It's still, in our opinion, was rational. And so we're planning 2025, to be rational as well. Now we do under understand that things could change. Well, you know, if the consumer demand deteriorates requiring or needing having others to be more lay leaning and more heavily with promotions. Then that is something that we would consent to. But we'll continue to evolve based on the environment and the con and and consumer demand. One thing that I will say is that we continue to lean into our capabilities to optimize both the timing and execution of our promotional offers. You know, we will, of course, balance discounts with value messaging and quality and leverage our member insights to really focus on executing productive targeted offers and continue to optimize our promotional effectiveness.
Kecia Steelman: I would just maybe add, in this environment, we're really focused on controlling what we can control.
Mark Altschwager: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Lasser with UBS. Please proceed.
Michael Lasser: Good evening. Thank you so much for taking my question. Kecia, in your remarks, you noted that competitive intensity of the category continues to increase. So was that in reference to both online as well as offline competitors? And it does that mean that the cost of doing business within the beauty category increases, which should diminish the potential that Ulta will be able to nail its margins over time as it goes through this transition period this year. Thank you very much.
Kecia Steelman: Well, thank you for the question, Michael. I will say, like, as I mentioned earlier, it's always been a competitive category. There are more players that are continuing to lean in. And I do believe that our Ulta Beauty Unleashed plan is really designed to accelerate and amplify our differentiation and what makes us unique. So we're really refocusing to ensure that the guest is at the center of all of our decisions. We intend to move faster and invest with purpose and we're really looking to optimize our business. And it's really in those go-to-market areas. It's about brand building, digital acceleration, personalization, marketplace, and wellness. And this is what we do. A lot of players are playing in the world of beauty, but this is what Ulta Beauty does. And the fact that we have everything from masks to prestige to luxury and everything in between, and we just need to continue to focus on our strengths, and lean into them. It will help us continue to build that moat. And then, Paula, if you wanna talk about the margin.
Paula Oyibo: Yes. Michael, you know, I as we think about some of the the the commentary we shared in our October with Investor Day, we talked about that this continues to be a competitive category. And in order to be a market share have growth and be a market share gainer in this competitive and innovative category, that we think it's important to continue to reinvest in the business to fuel to fuel growth. And that is why we share the guidance that we we gave, four to six percent top line growth and and that we expect it from a margin perspective. To be able to maintain margins around twelve percent. And so that reflects the current environment from our lens.
Michael Lasser: Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Baker with DA Davidson. Please proceed.
Michael Baker: Thanks. I guess I'll ask about tariffs. Remind us your exposure now to Europe potentially seeing two hundred percent tariffs and presumably that they'll retaliate. So if you could sort of break down your exposure by different parts of the world. And then there were definitely some price increases as I recall in two thousand seventeen and eighteen, but the timing was a little skewed. I think you took price before you even saw the margin. So it was a before you saw the price increases, so it was a margin enhancer early on. Can you remind us how that price versus cost dynamic played out last time and what you expect this time? Thank you.
Paula Oyibo: Yeah. Thank you, Michael, for the question. What I would say, like, in light everyone, we are monitoring the ever-changing landscape as it relates to tariffs. We we don't believe the exposure. While we don't know the exact exposure our brand partners have upstream, only about one percent of our shipments over the last twelve months were direct imports. And so our exposure is relatively limited. I would say beyond merchandise, we have some exposures with areas like fixed fixtures and lighting and supplies from a store perspective. And then largely from a merchandising perspective is our Ulta Beauty collection. Brand. But, again, like I said, relatively limited. And similar to how we successfully navigated in the twenty eighteen, twenty nineteen, period, our teams are staying very close to the long being situations, and we're continuing to navigate it, in scenario plan. Both for our business as well as with our our brand partners.
Michael Baker: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ike Boruchow with Wells Fargo. Please proceed.
Ike Boruchow: Hey, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. I think, Paula, can can I have two clarifications? So first on the on the on the promo or or I'll I'll call it the merch margin line for this year. You said rational similar to twenty four. The merch margin trend in the first and I'm sorry, in the first half of last year was very different than the back half. You were much more stable. I think you were flat to up. You were you were down decently in the first half. So just to compare it to twenty four is tough. Like, are you would it would you compare it to the back half? Of of twenty four? Just some clarity on how to think about merch for the year. Would be helpful. And then, I'm sorry, just a clarification on the on the comp. Outlook. Zero to one I think you said similar every quarter, but Q4 and Q1 may I guess the low end of the zero to one just wanna make sure I understand how to think about the first quarter comp relative to your commentary. Thanks.
Paula Oyibo: Okay. I I'm gonna answer the the last question around the the the comps, and then I might need you to give me what you're asking for on promo and merch margin if you were speaking of twenty twenty four or twenty twenty five. On the comp for for twenty twenty five. So what I shared is, yes, flat to one for the year, and we are not planning a wide variation in comp quarter to quarter. And then additional color I I was given is that because Q1 and Q4 were our strongest quarters, in twenty twenty four, then I would expect Q2 and Q3 to have the greatest opportunity from account perspective.
Ike Boruchow: Got it. And then, just to go back. Yeah. Thank you. And then the the way basically, I was asking on the merch margin for twenty five. You you said similar rational promo pricing in twenty five which is what you said you saw in twenty four. I was just saying your merch margins were down in the first half and flat to up in the back half. So are you saying similar to what you saw in the back half of twenty four? Just because it it was very volatile.
Paula Oyibo: To the year, which is a a similar way to ask is just are your merchandise margins planned flat to up, or or should they decline again? Yeah. Based on based on what I'm saying? No. I appreciate the question. I I I'm probably not gonna get into specific expectations around merch margin for for the year, but the point that I was making about promotionality is that we expect promotions to be rational this year. And that is assumed within within our our guidance. You know, if I I go back to gross margin for twenty twenty five, we expect gross margin will deleverage primarily driven by store occupancy cost and supply chain cost, partially offset by lower shrink. And, obviously, gross margin is impacted by the the comp of zero to to one, which is causing us to deleverage on many of our fixed costs.
Ike Boruchow: Got it. Thank you.
Kiley Rawlins: I think, Alicia, we have time for one more question.
Operator: You got it. Our last question comes from the line of Ashley Helgans with Jefferies. Please proceed.
Ashley Helgans: Hi. Thanks so much for squeezing me in. Any more color you can share on the new marketplace and just how it differs from your current online platform? And then, Paula, you called out that brands the brands that have increased distribution have been dragged. Just curious how you combat can or how you're planning to combat that headwind.
Kecia Steelman: Thanks, Ashley, for the question. I'll start. So, yes, you know, what we're seeing is that our beauty guest needs they are continuing to evolve, and we wanna be able to expand our offering in a lower risk way. And this really enables us to do that with marketplace. We have thousands of brands that wanna come work with us and what we're doing is we're opening a closed marketplace. So it's imitation only to enable, like, a curation site that actually went up live today. So brands can actually start signing up officially today. You know, we're expecting a mix of new and established and emerging brands that are really focused around beauty and wellness. One of the other things that we're really really focused on is that our members will be able to earn points on their marketplace purchases. And that the guests will be able to return their marketplace purchases to our stores. So we're trying to make this as seamless as possible for our guests. The plan is to launch this in the back half of twenty five. And we've got a dedicated team that we're building around selling and operations to operate this model. We don't expect it to be material in twenty five, and we're gonna continue to share more details as they become available. Paula?
Paula Oyibo: Sure. And hi, Ashley. On your question about what we're doing to combat potentially some specific brands, the declines. Generally, I guess that I would I would zoom out and say, really, when we think about where there's opportunity for us from a business, you know, newness, we continue to to work with our existing brands and new brands to bring newness into our assortment. And even for brands who've had expanded distribution, our merchant teams do a wonderful job with finding and launching specific and exclusive newness that's unique to Ulta, and so that helps. And then one of the key priorities within our Ulta Beauty Unleashed plan is brand building, which is focused on building and growing brands and increasing the level of brands that are exclusive in our our assortment. And so those are the key strategies that we have that would would would help with that.
Kecia Steelman: Great. Thanks. I would just like to I would like to just thank everyone for joining us today. To wrap up, I'd also like to thank our loyal guests, our trusted brand partners, and dedicated associates for their engagement and support. I'm confident in the team's ability to reignite our momentum while making wise investments to set the business up for long-term performance. Thanks to you all for your interest in Ulta Beauty. And I look forward to meeting and connecting with you in person in the coming months. Thank you, and have a good evening.
Operator: This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.

===== 2024 Q3  (2024-12-05 16:30:00) =====
Operator: Good afternoon, and welcome to Ulta Beauty's conference call to discuss results for the Ulta Beauty Third Quarter 2024 Earnings Results. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. We ask that you please limit yourself to one question and then re-enter the queue for any additional questions. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce Ms. Kiley Rawlins, Vice President of Investor Relations. Ms. Rawlins, you may proceed.
Kiley Rawlins: Thank you, Julian. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us for a discussion of Ulta Beauty's results for the third quarter of fiscal 2024. Hosting our call today are Dave Kimbell, Chief Executive Officer, and Paula Oyibo, Chief Financial Officer. Kecia Steelman, President and Chief Operating Officer, will join us for the Q&A session. Before we begin, I'd like to remind you of the company's safe harbor language. Many of our remarks today will contain forward-looking statements which speak only as of today, December 5th, 2024. We refer you to our earnings release and SEC filings where you will find a number of factors which could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements. We'll begin this afternoon with prepared remarks from Dave and Paula. Following our prepared comments, we'll open the call for questions. As always, the IR team will be available for any follow-up questions after the call. Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Dave. Dave?
Dave Kimbell: Thank you, Kiley, and good afternoon, everyone. We appreciate your interest in Ulta Beauty. Our team delivered improved performance for this quarter with better-than-expected sales and profitability. For the quarter, net sales increased 1.7% to $2.5 billion and comparable sales increased 0.6%. Diluted EPS increased 1.4% to $5.14 per share. As we shared on our last call, we are navigating a number of headwinds, including the normalization of the US beauty category, a dynamic consumer environment, and elevated competition, particularly in prestige beauty. We are starting to see benefit from actions we are taking to reinforce our market position and improve our performance. And while the headwinds have not abated, we are making progress. In the third quarter, our prestige market share trends improved, resulting in flat market share this quarter based on Circana data for the 13 weeks ended November 2, 2024. The trend was driven primarily by improvements in makeup and hair, and we continue to see strength in fragrance and skin care. Our share performance in Mass Beauty was consistent with the second quarter. Comp growth improved from the second quarter trend, driven by stronger transaction trends across both stores and e-commerce channels. We continued to expand our loyalty program, ending the quarter with 44.4 million active members, 5% more than last year. We continued to convert new members, we reactivated more lapsed members, and we improved existing member retention. Our marketing strategies to support our tent pole events and drive relevance and buzz deliver double digit growth in earned media value and stronger sentiment. And we made progress to optimize our new ERP system and help our teams adapt to new processes, balance inventories across the network, and deliver a better guest experience. Our teams are working hard to strengthen our market position, and I want to thank all of our associates for continuing to deliver great guest experiences while working collaboratively to drive improved performance in a dynamic operating environment. Turning to performance by category. Fragrance was our strongest category, delivering high single-digit comp growth, driven by men's fragrance, gender-neutral fragrances, and new products, including new fall and holiday gift sets. The growth of men's fragrance was fueled primarily by newness from ARMANI and YSL and the appeal of established franchises from Jean Paul Gaultier and Valentino. Consumer interest in gender neutral scents is increasing and our assortment including Billie Eilish and NOYZ, an exclusive fragrance LUSH that's launched this summer, is driving guest engagement. New women's brands Kylie Jenner and Orebella, both exclusive to Ulta Beauty and new women's fragrances from Valentino, YSL, and NEST also contributed to overall category growth. The skincare category delivered mid-single-digit comp growth this quarter, as strong growth in body care was partially offset by a decline in prestige skin care. Mass skin care was flat. The strong performance of body care was driven in large part by newer brand Sol de Janeiro, which continues to engage guests with exciting innovation and exclusivity and Touchland, which introduced compelling newness. In prestige skin care, newness from brands OLEHENRIKSEN, Sacheu, DIME Beauty, and others resonated with guests, while engagement from Naturium, Bubble, and La Roche-Posay delivered growth in the mass skin care category. Comp sales in the makeup category decreased in the low single-digit range driven primarily by softness in mass makeup. Strong growth from recently relaunched Ulta Beauty Collection was offset by certain brands lapping space expansion, strong innovation or social media engagement last year. Prestige makeup was flat. New prestige brands Charlotte Tilbury, ILIA Beauty and DIBS Beauty resonated with guests and compelling product newness combined with in-store investments delivered growth for established brands MAC and Clinique. Promotional events during the quarter including 21 Days of Beauty and Fall Haul performed well, driving growth for several makeup brands, while our engaging Wicked collaboration was well received, highlighted by exclusive brand r.e.m. beauty. Comp sales for the hair care category also decreased in the low single-digit range. Exciting newness from Matrix, [Way] (ph), Divi, and Odele delivered growth for the category, while Redken continued to drive healthy guest engagement with their Hero product lines. In hair tools, new products from Shark Beauty and Dyson resonated with guests. This growth was offset by softness in key brands with expanded distribution and limited newness this year. Our services business delivered low single-digit comp growth, primarily driven by engagement in core services, including color, styling, and hair treatments. Ear piercing and makeup services also performed well. And our salon backbar takeovers, which get stylists an opportunity to introduce brands to guests, continued to drive product attachment, and new guest acquisition for participating brands. We are seeing improvements in our business, and we are focused on strengthening our market position and performance further. In October, we shared our refreshed strategic framework designed to lean into our existing strengths while also driving innovation to meet the evolving needs of beauty enthusiasts. As the beauty destination of a lifetime, we intend to drive profitable growth and market share leadership in beauty and wellness over the longer term through curating the best of all things beauty and wellness for all beauty enthusiasts, fostering authentic empowering human connections that inspire, delight and engage at every touch point, engaging our guests wherever they want to shop by expanding our reach through seamless and immersive omnichannel experiences, and building lifelong loyalty and brand love through member growth and personalization. We are confident our focus on these foundational areas will drive stronger revenue and earnings growth over the long term. And the near term, we are addressing key areas to reinforce our competitive position. Let me share some highlights of the progress made this quarter, starting with our efforts to strengthen our assortment. We are enhancing our brand portfolio to drive category growth. During the third quarter, we launched new makeup brands ILIA Beauty, DIBS Beauty, and RMS Beauty, as well as emerging skincare brand Oak Essentials. Additionally, we expanded our wellness offerings with emerging brands, The Honey Pot and Joylux. Looking ahead, we have an exciting pipeline of brand launches planned for the fourth quarter, including the recently announced prestige skincare brand, TATCHA, celebrated for balancing timeless Japanese botanicals with proven clinical ingredients, XO KHLOE, an exclusive fragrance brand created by Khloe Kardashian, and Apothekary, an emerging wellness brand. In addition to new brands, we launched two exciting exclusive collaborations this quarter. First, as the exclusive beauty retail partner with NBCUniversal Pictures for the movie Wicked, we worked with key brands to develop a limited edition collection of products across multiple price points and categories. The Wicked inspired collection features products from leading brands including r.e.m. beauty by Ariana Grande and Beekman 1802, both of which are exclusive to Ulta Beauty, as well as OPI and Scunci among others. With immersive in-store experiences and engaging displays, Wicked came to life in Ulta Beauty stores through our digital channels and through Ulta Beauty at Target. Second, we launched an exclusive and a disruptive beauty offering of the beloved Mini Brands, which offers miniature versions of popular consumer brands. This first ever Beauty Mini Brands collection includes 68 tiny replicas of best selling products from 13 brands, including e.l.f., NYX, Drybar, and Supergoop!. Both of these unique collaborations are driving strong sales, awareness, traffic, and engagement, especially with Gen Z millennial members. As we discussed at our recent Investor Day, engaging guest experiences drive differentiation, loyalty, and meaningful business value, and we are focused on creating authentic, personalized experiences across all our channels. In Q3 we hosted more than 13,000 in-store events including unique celebrity and brand founder events, multi-branded events, and skin care focused events. We also expanded our salon event, The Workshop, to more stores and invited guests to learn how to create salon-worthy blowouts while receiving customized coaching and personalized recommendations from our talented in-store stylists. We are enhancing our digital experiences to drive traffic and sales. During the quarter, key online activations drove guest engagement, and our expanded sampling program delivered double-digit sales growth. Our digital merchandising strategies, including enhanced search, guided navigation, and enriched product pages drove conversion, and our site optimization efforts are improving the guest experience and delivering stronger conversion trends. Importantly, we continued to drive increased app adoption. In the third quarter, we saw double-digit growth in member engagement with the app, which accounted for about two-thirds of our e-commerce sales in Q3, up about 600 basis points from last year. We continued to introduce new digital experiences and resources to drive discovery and trial. This quarter we enhanced our suite of virtual try-on and AI enabled skin and hair analysis experiences with the launch of GLAMlab 2.0 which includes a new 3D engine to enhance precision and stability, shoppable makeup looks, and a new user interface that includes sharing capabilities. We also launched new digital buying guides that amplify search engine optimization while providing guests with educational content, beauty tips, and product recommendations. To deepen the meaningful connection we have with beauty enthusiasts, we launched UB Community, a welcoming, inclusive, digital forum for guests to connect, learn, empower, and engage learn, empower, and engage in the immersive world of beauty to foster authentic connections. Launched in October, our community amplifies the intersection of beauty, wellness and joy, and our user count is already three times our initial target, confirming the meaningful role Ulta Beauty plays in our members' lives. With more than 44 million active members, Ulta Beauty Rewards is an unmatched strategic asset that provides us with unique consumer insights to drive sales. In Q3, we expanded personalization across digital channels with enhanced product recommendations, replenishment reminders, site experiences and retargeted and social channels. Leaning into targeted life cycle campaigns in both owned and paid channels, we reactivated members with greater efficiency. Additionally, we grew our platinum and diamond member base, leveraging unique incentives like exclusive and early access to key events and brand launches, gifting and personalized offers that drive engagement. Platinum and diamond members shop more frequently and spend more each visit and continue to retain at best-in-class rates. Increasingly, social relevance drives authentic customer connection and brand advocacy, especially in beauty, and we're evolving to position social at the center of our marketing strategies to accelerate browse and earned media value growth. During the third quarter, we leveraged our marketing and social capabilities to lean into emerging trends, amplify key growth brands and activate new trend-focused events. We also engage talent from our UB Collective, our affiliate program, and Ulta Beauties, our new associate ambassador program as well as key brand founders to support key brand launches, exclusive collaborations and tent pole events in new and innovative ways across social channels to drive guest buzz and engagement. Efforts delivered accelerated EMV growth, increased impression and expanded key brand health metrics. We continue to enhance our product capabilities to grow our retail media network, UB Media. We recently partnered with e-commerce tech company, Rocket, to introduce AI non-endemic ads for products and services outside the beauty category, and we are partnering with Roblox, the ultimate virtual universe to create innovative advertising opportunities for our partners. Over the years, our Ultaverse has grown into one of the largest beauty games on Roblox, attracting over 11 million visits. With growing interest from beauty brands to participate in our Ultaverse, we're unlocking new possibilities at the intersection of gaming, innovation and media to bring those brands to life in exciting new ways through our UB Media capabilities. Now leveraging lessons in the second quarter, we continue to evolve and tailor our promotional strategies to reiterate our value offering and drive sales and traffic. We began the quarter with a new hair event showcasing the glossy hair trend, replacing last year's fall Gorgeous Hair event, this event featured a strong promo offer, new and exclusive items from Dyson and a spotlight on gloss and shine products. Especially strong in stores, the new event exceeded our expectations and drove strong results for participating brands. At the end of August, we brought back our beloved 21 Days of Beauty event. New beauty steals, member-only events and bonus offers, combined with robust marketing and social support, 21 Days of Beauty delivered strong growth versus last year's event. We wrapped up the quarter with a successful Fall Haul event, which drove mass engagement and new member acquisition with compelling offers that surprised and delighted guests. In addition to strengthening and evolving our merchandising tent pole events, we optimized our loyalty offers, proactively planning the timing, type and target audience of these offers. As a result, our promotional effectiveness improved from the first half trend. Shifting now to our plans and expectations for holiday. The formal holiday season is in full flight. And while we're encouraged by our performance through Cyber Monday, we have several significant holiday sales weeks still ahead. While consumers continue to spend, our insights suggest that economic concerns are driving a greater focus on value. With our diverse assortment of products and price points, compelling offers and convenient omnichannel touch points, we are well positioned to support our guests as they celebrate the season and our teams are excited, engaged and ready to help them deliver a joyful holiday. Our holiday campaign this year is Find Joy in the Present, a reminder of the joy that comes not only from gifts of beauty, but from the big and small moments that drive authentic emotional connection. With the goal of driving deeper emotional engagement, our campaign is supported with robust integrated activation across media, member marketing, PR and social channels as well as festive experiences in stores and on our digital platforms. We have strategies in place to fortify our competitive positioning and manage through the compressed holiday selling season. We are transforming our channels into a concierge for all things holiday, providing greater value to consumers with real-time beauty solutions, gift guides and tips tailored to our guests' needs and creating fun experiences that drive awareness and make Ulta Beauty the go-to destination for the holidays. Our merchandising team has created an exciting holiday assortment, with a strong focus on newness and exclusives balanced with value-driven holiday kits and core items that make great gifts. Whether guests wants to gift others or treat themselves, we have thoughtfully curated options across every category and budget. Our corporate and supply chain teams have been working hard all year to ensure Ulta Beauty is ready to bring our guests joy this holiday season. And our store teams are ready to bring the holiday to life for our guests, with new in-store events and demonstrations to build guest connection and drive sales and traffic. And with BOPIS, same-day delivery options and new for this holiday, our participation in DoorDash and soon-to-be launched Instacart marketplaces, it's never been easier or more convenient to shop at Ulta Beauty. With our engaging holiday messaging, incredible holiday assortment, knowledgeable associates ready to provide guidance and recommendations, new innovative digital tools and multiple ways to shop, I am confident we are well positioned to deliver another successful holiday season. In summary, I am encouraged by the improving trends we are seeing in the business and optimistic about our holiday plans. We believe the beauty category will remain resilient, and we are confident the actions we are taking to deliver stronger performance combined with our outstanding associates who are committed to offering guests authentic inclusive experiences across all of our touch points will enable us to reinforce our market position and drive long-term profitable growth. Now, before Paula discusses our financial results, I want to share that Monica Arnaudo, Chief Merchandising Officer, has announced her plan to retire from Ulta Beauty in the spring of 2025. Since joining Ulta Beauty in 2017, Monica has built an outstanding team and elevated our assortment in ways that have helped us deliver remarkable sales and market share growth, while furthering our mission to be our guests’ most loved beauty destination. I want to thank Monica for everything she has contributed as a member of our executive team and for the impact she has had on our organization. While we work to identify Monica’s successor, she is fully committed to supporting her team and Ulta Beauty with a successful transition. And now, I will turn the call over to Paula for a discussion of the financial results. Paula?
Paula Oyibo: Thanks, Dave, and good afternoon, everyone. I want to echo Dave's sentiments and congratulate Monica. Monica has been a trusted leader and steadfast ambassador of our brands, and we are so grateful for all of her contributions. Now turning to our financials. I'll begin with a discussion of our third quarter financial results and then provide more color on our fourth quarter and full year expectations. For the third quarter, we delivered better-than-expected performance across the P&L, reflecting stronger top line growth, continued financial discipline and expense management and favorable shrink trends. Net sales for the quarter increased 1.7%, sales contribution from new stores and a 0.6% increase in comp sales was partially offset by lower other revenue. During the quarter, we opened 28 new stores, closed two stores and remodeled 27 stores. The comp sales increase was driven by a 0.5% increase in transactions and a 0.1% increase in average ticket. Other revenue declined $5 million to $48 million, primarily due to an increase in deferred revenue related to our loyalty program, driven by the expansion of our member engagement efforts, which were partially offset an increase in income from our credit card program. Looking at the cadence of sales throughout the quarter. Comp sales in August decreased slightly primarily due to a shift in timing of our semiannual 21 Days of Beauty event, which resulted in stronger comp performance in September. October trends were positive but softened compared to the previous period. From a channel perspective, our e-commerce channel delivered mid-single-digit sales growth. The sales trend in comp stores improved from the second quarter, decreasing modestly compared to last year. For the quarter, gross margin decreased 20 basis points to 39.7% compared to 39.9% last year. The decline was primarily due to deleverage of fixed costs and lower other revenue, which was partially offset by favorable channel mix due to lower e-commerce shipping costs and lower shrink. Lower revenue growth resulted in deleverage of store and supply chain fixed costs. Additionally, more new store openings and the expansion of our supply chain network pressured these areas. As a percentage of sales, inventory shrink was lower than last year. Our investments in secure fragrance fixtures combined with new inventory management processes and enhanced training for our field teams are helping us control inventory shrink. Year-to-date, shrink as a percentage of sales is roughly flat with last year, and we continue to expect shrink will be flat for the full year. Merchandise margin was flat with lower inventory reserves primarily related to the relaunch of Ulta Beauty Collection, offset by unfavorable brand mix. Moving to expenses. SG&A increased 3.2% to $682 million. Overall, SG&A spend was better than planned again this quarter, primarily due to focused expense management. As a percentage of sales, SG&A increased 40 basis points to 27% compared to 26.6% last year, reflecting lower top line growth, most expenses deleveraged this quarter. In addition, SG&A deleveraged primarily due to higher store payroll and benefits, primarily due to higher average wage rates and higher corporate overhead, primarily due to strategic investments. These pressures were partially offset by lower incentive compensation, reflecting operational performance that was below our internal targets. Depreciation was $67 million for the quarter compared to $61 million last year, primarily due to new store and supply chain investments. Operating profit decreased 2.7% to $318.5 million. As a percentage of sales, operating margin was 12.6% of sales compared to 13.1% of sales last year, and diluted GAAP earnings per share increased 1.4% to $5.14 compared to $5.07 last year. Moving to the balance sheet and our capital allocation priorities. We ended the quarter with $178 million in cash and cash equivalents and $200 million in short-term debt. Similar to third quarter last year, we drew on our revolving credit facility during the quarter to support working capital needs and ongoing capital allocation priorities, including share repurchases and capital expenditures. Total inventory increased 1.9% to $2.4 billion compared to $2.3 billion last year. The increase was primarily due to the impact of 63 net new stores. Year-to-date, through the third quarter, we generated $302 million in operating cash flow. Capital expenditures were $114 million for the quarter, primarily reflecting investments in new and existing stores, IT investments and merchandise fixtures. In the third quarter, we returned $267 million of capital to our shareholders through the repurchase of 731,000 shares. At the end of the quarter, we had $2.9 billion remaining under our $3 billion share repurchase program we announced at our investor meeting in October. Now turning to our outlook. We have refined our sales and EPS guidance for the fiscal -- for fiscal 2024 to reflect our third quarter results, while continuing to take a cautious view of the consumer and operating environment. We expect net sales for the year will be between $11.1 billion and $11.2 billion, with comp sales growth between negative 1% and flat. For the year, we continue to plan to open approximately 60 to 65 net new stores and remodel or relocate 40 to 45 stores. We expect operating margin will be between 12.9% and 13.1% of net sales, with deleverage to come from both gross margin and SG&A, reflecting our top line expectations. Reflecting these assumptions, we now expect diluted EPS for the year will be between $23.20 and $23.75. With one quarter left in the year, I want to share how we are thinking about Q4. While we are encouraged by our third quarter results and our performance quarter-to-date, we also acknowledge that the fourth quarter will likely be impacted by a compressed holiday season, a dynamic operating environment and continued uncertainty around underlying consumer demand. For Q4 modeling purposes, we expect comp sales will decline in the low single-digit range and operating margin will be between 11.6% and 12.4%. One final update. We have updated our capital expenditure expectations for the full year and now expect to spend between $400 million and $425 million in CapEx in fiscal 2024, including approximately $230 million for new stores, remodels and merchandise fixtures, $130 million for supply chain and IT, and about $50 million for store maintenance and others. In closing, we know it will take time to see the full benefits from our efforts, but we remain confident that our go-to-market strategies and investments along with continued operational and financial discipline will enable us to drive stronger sales and value creation over the long term. And now, I'll turn the call back over to our operator to moderate the Q&A session.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Simeon Siegel, BMO Capital Markets.
Simeon Siegel: Thanks. Hey, everyone. Nice job, and if I forget later, I hope you and your families all have a nice holiday season. Dave, any further color you can share on how you're thinking about the broader competitive and promotional landscape over holiday? And then just Paula, could you quantify any of those gross margin pressure points this quarter, how you're thinking about the next quarter and beyond? And then just does any of today's progress in the full year guide lift impact your initial margin views you had given us in October? Thank you.
Dave Kimbell: Great. Thanks, Simeon, and happy holidays to you as well. I'll start with just the broader competitive and promotional landscape. And Paula, you can pick up on some of the margin specific areas. So for the third quarter, what -- as we -- as I mentioned in the remarks, we continue to see this is an intensely competitive time frame. And we've been managing and discussing that throughout the year. We feel like our actions, the adjustments we made in the third quarter helped us improve our performance, strengthen our performance, but we also recognize we have more work ahead of us. The dynamics in the marketplace continue, particularly in the prestige space, but we're seeing progress. And our unique proposition, the aspects that only Ulta delivers through our assortment, our loyalty program, our points of presence, the experience we deliver have always been key to our business and continue to be core drivers. Promotionally, what we experienced in the third quarter was continued normalization after some reduced promotion coming right out of COVID. So we anticipated that coming into Q3 -- coming into this year. We saw that in Q3. Our promotional rates in Q3 were lower than Q2, but still somewhat higher than last year. But as I mentioned in the remarks, our efforts to adjust our promotional strategy to lean in and amplify our tent-pole events, made our overall efforts more effective leveraging our CRM program and our personalization efforts are driving the business. As we look into the holiday, it is obviously a very promotional time frame, the most promotional time frame. That's certainly true this year. And as we navigate through and share our fourth quarter results, we'll have reflections on the overall dynamics, but we're anticipating continued promotional intensity, but not significantly outside of what we would expect so far this holiday. Paula, do you want to talk about that?
Paula Oyibo: Sure. Good afternoon, Simeon. Yeah, so we raised our full year operating margin and EPS, reflecting Q3 performance and also ongoing expense discipline. What I would say as we think about kind of Q4, generally for the full year, we continue to expect gross margin deleverage, and when we think about Q4, reflecting the top line expectations in a competitive environment. Gross margin will continue to de-leverage. And really, the trends we've seen all year will continue. So, headwinds are the deleverage we expect to see from a fixed cost perspective, merchandise margin pressure will continue given promotions and category mix. And then our tailwinds, lower transportation costs, which we've been speaking about all year, we'll continue to provide some offsets to that. I would say from an SG&A perspective, we're expecting growth from a full year in the mid-single-digit range. But Q4, expecting that to be in the low single-digit growth range. We still expect or most of our expenses to deleverage on the lower sales. But we'll continue to maintain financial discipline as we have in Q3.
Simeon Siegel: Great. Thanks…
Paula Oyibo: And I think the second -- okay. Thank you.
Simeon Siegel: No, sorry. Didn’t mean to cut you off.
Paula Oyibo: No, all good. Thank you, Simeon.
Simeon Siegel: Thanks, guys.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Kelly Crago, Citi.
Kelly Crago: Hi, thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to see if you could provide a little bit more context on the prestige makeup line that was flat in the quarter. How was it for the industry overall? And if you could just talk about the innovation pipeline in prestige -- I'm sorry if I said prestige beauty before, I'm talking about prestige makeup. If you could talk about the innovation pipeline there. And then just secondly, any way to kind of quantify the drag you've seen from the competitive pressures specifically with those new points of distribution and sort of where we're at in the timeline for when you expect those headwinds to abate further? Thanks.
Dave Kimbell: Great. Well, thanks, Kelly. Yeah, let's see, starting with prestige makeup, obviously, an important category, our largest category. And I'd start with saying, overall, we're pleased in the third quarter that prestige makeup was flat for the quarter for us, which was improvement from some of the trends. The drivers behind that are our innovation that we continue to launch brands like ILIA coming into our portfolio, strong execution across our key programs like 21 Days of Beauty, which is focused on prestige and make up, of course, is the highlight of that, and real emphasis on some of our core brands like the Clinique and MAC and other strong performing brands that we've been working closely with to ensure we're delivering for our guests and our guests respond well to them. And so we're really -- we've been focused on this category for a long time to strengthen its performance and we're really pleased that it was able -- that we were able to do that. Overall, in the category, we saw the category, the total prestige makeup category a bit more than us in low single-digits. So we saw pressure share, although our share performance, while still pressured, improved from the second quarter. So we're making headway, and we're pleased with that. Overall, on the competitive environment, you asked about competitive openings. As we've been talking about throughout the year, that's certainly a meaningful dynamic as there's been more than 1,000 new points of distribution in prestige beauty that over the last couple of years. And that has been a pressure. I shared in previous discussions that 80% of our stores have experienced at least one competitive opening and more than half have had multiple competitive openings, and that continues to be a dynamic that's going on in the marketplace. Having said that, we're confident in the actions that we're taking. We know we've seen historically new store openings. We're able to absorb the shorter-term hit, but then turn our stores back into positive contributors to our business over the long term. This is a different dynamic given the scale, just the sheer number of new stores opening in a short period of time. But we're confident in our ability to do that. We did see improvements in Q3 that contributed to the stronger performance we had in Q3 in total versus Q2. So we feel like we saw some headway in that. But we're not -- but it's we're still in the midst of it. And so by no means are we claiming that we're through it. We've got more work to do. We're working through the dynamics. And our focus there is continue to do what we do best, lean into our strengths in our stores and online and all of our experiences that activity, those things that I highlighted on earlier are what helped us make progress this quarter and other things that are going to drive us into 2025 as we continue to strengthen our business.
Kelly Crago: Thanks. Best of luck and happy holidays.
Dave Kimbell: Happy holidays.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Korinne Wolfmeyer, Piper Sandler.
Korinne Wolfmeyer: Hey, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question and congrats on the quarter. I'd like to touch a little bit on the competitiveness on the mass piece of business. I feel like we talked a lot about prestige, but I do want to understand mass, a lot of the broader mass -- larger mass retailers have been talking a little bit more positively about beauty. You've got dollar stores expanding more in beauty. So, how is this impacting the competitive landscape would you say for that piece of the business? And how are you thinking about the mass piece going forward and heading into 2025? Thank you.
Dave Kimbell: Well, yes. Thanks, Korinne. The -- I'll start with saying that beauty is a very attractive category. And so we've talked many times about the fact that anybody in beauty, whether in the mass side, prestige side, luxury is emphasizing the category, investing in the category and that's been going on across all of our competitors. In the mass specific business, yeah, that -- the total mass business continues to perform in that mid-single-digit range for the quarter in total mass. And it's an important category for us. As you know, one of the key differentiators of our business is strength in mass and [mass] (ph) and prestige and luxury. And so we continue to be focused on our mass business and the important role that it plays. So that we're well aware of the dynamics. We have seen mass makeup as a category -- cost of category decelerate. Certainly, there's brands that are stronger, but the total category has been more pressured, but we're seeing strength -- continued strength in mass skin, which is an important business for us. So we're focused on continuing to drive our mass business and make sure we're delivering the assortment that we know our guests love the ability to engage with us across all price points and continue to be confident in our ability to excite them and engage them in our mass business.
Operator: Okay. Thank you. And our next question comes from Anthony Chukumba, Loop Capital Markets.
Anthony Chukumba: Thank you so much for taking my question. Hopefully, you can hear me okay. And I'll just keep it to one question. Obviously, you had a very impressive sequential improvement in your performance. And you've touched on a few different things, but if you had to sort of almost like kind of stack rank what you thought drove the better performance, would it be the more effective promotions? Would it be some of the merchandising changes? Would it be some of the partnerships you talked about, like, with Wicked and I guess, the Mini Brands or whatever. Yeah, if you could just give us -- help us to understand what, from a sequential perspective led to the improvement in performance. Thank you.
Dave Kimbell: Great. Thanks, Anthony. Yeah, I mean, I wouldn't point to one thing. There was not one thing that ever really drives our business. And we talked about coming out of the second quarter. While we're pleased with some aspects of our business, we were clear on areas that we needed to address, and we leaned into several of the key factors. Assortment is always critical. Bringing in newness, some of the brands I highlighted like ILIA into the quarter played an important role. The collaborations that you mentioned also drove excitement and enthusiasm. Assortment is always a key driver and certainly was in the third quarter. Our promotional effectiveness, we had some learnings in the second quarter as we were faced with more pressure sales, how we adapted our promotional environment. We had learnings there that we built from into the third quarter. Leaning in, strengthening our core tent pole events that our guests value from Ulta Beauty, 21 Days of Beauty, our hair brand and Fall Haul as well as smart, purposeful targeted and effective complementary promotions throughout the quarter in a very personalized. So that drove a strong effectiveness. We worked hard throughout the quarter. Our teams across the organization, store teams, for sure supply chain, our IT teams, our digital teams to make sure we were delivering a great experience to improve conversion, and we're pleased that we were able to do that both in store and strong performance online. And that took a holistic effort with making sure we have strong engagement from our store associates and strong execution online. And we also -- the last thing I'd mention is we highlighted in the second quarter, some disruption from some system changes and we made improvements in that space to make sure our products were where they needed to be. So multiple elements contributed. It was a really holistic effort across the organization, and we're pleased. Having said that, we know we've got more work to do. We're -- while we're pleased with the sequential improvement, we are focused on stronger improvement over time as we move both through the holiday period and into 2025 and beyond. So we'll continue to lean into all of those things and the broader strategies that we went through in a lot of detail at our Investor Day in October.
Anthony Chukumba: Very helpful. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Christopher Horvers, JPMorgan Chase & Company.
Christopher Horvers: Thanks, good evening. So I'll throw a quick two-parter in there as well. So the first part is, are you positive quarter-to-date? You mentioned encourage -- and how are you thinking about the balance between the five fewer days but at the same time, have a very substantial gift card business and five fewer days would suggest a strong January follow-through. And then following up on an earlier question, any further thoughts on how you think about '25. You talked about a floor of 11% long-term 12% plus, how did this quarter change that point of view, if at all? Thanks.
Paula Oyibo: Hi, Chris, thanks for the question. What I would say is we won’t necessarily get into the details of specifically comp quarter-to-date. But what I will say is that, our holiday season is off to a solid start and our teams are executing well. We are encouraged by what we're seeing, but we also recognize that we have several important weeks ahead of us in the holiday season, even an operating environment is dynamic. And so that is why we shared that we're expecting Q4 comp sales to decline in the low single-digit range. So that's what we're thinking from a quarter perspective. And I would say, yeah, there is a component of the dynamic environment that is related to how consumers the fewer shopping days and things of that sort that we are obviously contemplating as we think about our expectations for Q4. As we think about 2025, again, still several important weeks left ahead of us, and we're focused on closing -- getting to a holiday strong and closing out the fiscal year strong. And we will provide additional color on 2025 when we provide our guidance in March, consistent with what we typically do. Now that being said, I would say directional color that we provided at our Investor Day remains the same. We expect 2024 and 2025 to be transitional period as we invest to reaccelerate our growth, and we continue to expect to make investments in 2025 that will position us for a stronger long term. but we will make decisions to enable -- to ensure that we're delivering operating margin at least above 11%.
Christopher Horvers: That’s great. Thanks very much.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Kate McShane, Goldman Sachs.
Emily Ghosh: Hi, this is Emily Ghosh, on for Kate. We were wondering on UB Media, how big of a competitive moat do you think it could be, especially considering what it does to help your relationship with vendor partners? And how much is UB Media contributing to the long-term operating margin outlook that you provided at the Investor Day?
Dave Kimbell: Great. Thanks, Emily. Yes, the -- we think we're very optimistic and excited about the role that UB Media is and will play on our business going forward. As you suggest, we have a real competitive opportunity because of the scale and the breadth of our business, the data that we have, the understanding of beauty engagement and transactions across really all beauty enthusiasts of all ages and all geographies is really unmatched. And so we've worked hard to deliver an experience for our brand partners that adds value and most importantly, adds strong ROI in their media investments and the growth that we've seen in that business reinforces that we're able to do that. We're -- as we did talk about at our Investor Day, continued investment and capabilities. I highlighted a couple of those capabilities on the call earlier today related to roadblocks and other ways that we can further give our brands opportunities. But because of the brand relationships that we have and the role that we play in the category, we are confident that our opportunity to grow this business, continue to grow this business over time will be will be a positive impact on the business. Paula, do you want to talk about the financial impact?
Paula Oyibo: Sure. What I would say is UB Media, Emily, is contributing positively to gross margin in a way to think about it over time is that it plays in for role for us, and it will help offset some of the merchandise margin pressure. We currently see we have shared as we make certain investments in brand building and other things in 2025 and beyond that would serve to help offset some of those pressures.
Emily Ghosh: Thank you.
Operator: And our next question comes from Oliver Chen, TD Cowen.
Oliver Chen: Hi, thanks, David and Kecia. On your thinking longer term, what will it take positive comp in terms of what categories perhaps you see as the biggest opportunities? And was the commentary on October being a bit softer. Was that surprising to you? It sounds like you may continue to expect to see a fair bit of volatility. And Kecia, online half store sales, is it a mid-single-digit leverage occupancy. Anything we should know about that in terms of achieving fixed cost leverage based on the comp? Thank you.
Dave Kimbell: Thank you. Oliver, let's see. So first on long-term growth, what's going to deliver positive comps. I guess I would go back to what we talked about in detail at our Investor Day. We really see a combination of leaning in and reinforcing our established strengths as well as innovating across our entire ecosystem as key contributors to our performance. We talked about four key pillars or platforms assortment, having the best assortment across beauty and wellness experience, delighting our guests in every touch point that we have access, continuing to expand our availability, both with stores, accelerated new store openings as well as strong online expressions and then, of course, loyalty and building brand love. We're really focused on driving innovation across each of those and making sure that we're ready to do that. And what we -- what I talked about in an earlier question, that contributed to the third quarter improvement versus the second quarter. It's the foundation. It's the fundamentals. It's the core things, Oliver, you know about our business having tracked us for a long time. When assortment is stronger and experience is right and our loyalty is working and our touch points are driving both in-store and online, those are the things that will come together. So much -- really all of it, we just shared a couple of months ago, those are the aspects that will drive our business going forward.
Paula Oyibo: Yeah. And, Oliver, this is Paula. Given you asked a question about October and whether or not we were surprised. What I would say is now -- and we thought, Dave mentioned and we talked about the timing and some of our tent pole event. And so that had a role to play in kind of the by period performance in Q3. And then I think you had a question about leverage points, and we don't specifically disclose a specific point, and we've shared in the past one way to think about things is from a rent perspective, expense is around 4%. And so as you think about comp and total growth, maybe think about it in that perspective.
Oliver Chen: Happy holidays. Thanks.
Dave Kimbell: Thanks, Oliver.
Operator: And our next question comes from Krisztina Katai, Deutsche Bank.
Krisztina Katai: Hi, good afternoon. Congrats on a nice quarter. So I just wanted to follow up on your early learnings from your market share reinforcing strategy. It obviously enabled you to maintain flat market share in the third quarter, at least in prestige. Where are you seeing some of the biggest gains in member engagement? I think, Dave, you talked about both platinum and diamond members are up in the program year-over-year. And then just as the competitive opening pressures abate, is it fair to say that maybe the worst is behind us? And is there a timeline for when you think maybe you could return to market share gains? Thank you.
Dave Kimbell: Well, let's see. So, on the -- where we've seen engagement, yeah, you highlighted an important part of our business, which is what we call our lead guest, our Platinum and our Diamond members. And we're pleased that we continue to see strong performance from them, high engagement, high spend, they are obviously our best guest. But we're seeing that across the board, and it's something we've been focused on to continue to grow our business. Our loyalty program in total was up 5% for the quarter, and that was a combination of attracting new members as one of the things we talked about in October was even though we've had a lot of growth in that -- in our loyalty program over time, we still see a lot of opportunity ahead, and we're continuing to attract new members and bring them into our business. And that, of course, is important fuel for future growth. We also had success reactivating lapsed members, a lapsed member is somebody that has a -- is part of the program but hasn't purchased with us for the at least once in the last 12 months. And we have a very focused CRM personalized program going after that group, and we continue to see success with that. And then our retention is strong. There is an intense competitive environment, but our guests continue to demonstrate that they like what Ulta is offering. And so retention remains healthy. And so those things come together. We're seeing it across all ages, all geographies, strength across all types of beauty enthusiasts, which is an important part of our business. Competitively, you asked about the dynamics there. And I continue to say something that we've shared in the past is, it's difficult for us to exactly predict or lay out when we would see us completely moving through this because we've never experienced the scale of this in such a concentrated period of time. Having said that, I'll reiterate something I mentioned earlier, which is we have confidence. We've seen it in the data before new store openings. Our stores are able to recover and return to strong contributors. The data that we see now, stores that have not been impacted by competitive opening continue to perform better and positively, and we saw improved performance in Q3. But I would not take that fully as a, okay, we're through 100% through it, and it's totally behind us. This is a meaningful disruption in the category. We're learning every period. What -- how the dynamics are evolving, but we did make progress in Q3, and it's our focus to continue to do that as we move into 2025.
Dave Kimbell: All right. So with that, thank you all. I will wrap up. Thank you for joining us today. So, I want to close out by thanking our more than 55,000 Ulta Beauty associates working together in our stores, in our distribution centers and across our entire corporate team. I sincerely appreciate their continued focus and commitment to delivering unique and memorable guest experiences across all our channels. So, as we close, I want to wish you all a happy and healthy holiday season. There's still time to get out and shop at Ulta Beauty. So make sure you put that into your holiday shopping plans, and we look forward to speaking to you again when we report results for fiscal 2024 on March 13. Have a great evening. Thank you all.
Operator: Thank you. That does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time.

===== 2024 Q2  (2024-08-29 16:30:00) =====
Operator: Good afternoon, and welcome to Ulta's Beauty's Conference Call to discuss results for the Ulta Beauty Second Quarter 2024 Earnings Results. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce you to Ms. Kiley Rawlins, Vice President of Investor Relations. Ms. Rawlins, please proceed.
Kiley Rawlins: Thanks, Alicia. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us for a discussion of Ulta Beauty's results for the second quarter of fiscal 2024. Hosting our call today are Dave Kimbell, Chief Executive Officer; and Paul Oyibo, Chief Financial Officer; Kecia Steelman, President and Chief Operating Officer will join us for the Q&A session. .

We'll begin this afternoon with prepared remarks from Dave and Paula. Following our prepared comments, we'll open up the call for questions. [Operator Instructions] As always, the IR team will be available for any follow-up questions after the call. And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Dave. Dave?
Dave Kimbell: Thank you, Kylie, and good afternoon, everyone. We appreciate your interest in Ulta Beauty. For the quarter, net sales increased 0.9% to $2.6 billion and comparable sales decreased 1.2%. Operating profit was 12.9% of sales and diluted EPS was $5.30 per share. Although, we anticipated the headwinds experienced in the first quarter would continue, our results were short of our expectations, driven by a decrease in comp store sales, specifically comp store transactions. E-commerce sales increased as expected. We do not believe these results reflect the strong engagement with our brand, the strength of our operating model, or the performance I know we can deliver over the longer term. Importantly, we are clear about the factors that adversely impacted our store transaction growth in the second quarter, and we have actions underway to address the trends. We attribute the decline in comp store transactions to four factors. First, while the beauty category remains resilient, growth is normalizing after three years of unprecedented gains. Additionally, consumer behavior is starting to shift as consumers increasingly focus on value and become more cautious with their spending. Based on data from Circana, U.S. beauty growth slowed to approximately 3% through the first half of 2024, with prestige beauty experiencing high-single digit growth and mass beauty maintaining low-single digit growth. Second, competitive intensity in the beauty category remains high. As we have shared previously, the strength of the beauty category, combined with an attractive margin profile, has drawn substantial and diverse competition to the category. Today, there are significantly more places to buy beauty, especially prestige beauty, with more than 1,000 new points of distribution opened in the last three years. As a result, our market share continues to be challenged, particularly within prestige beauty. Based on Circana data for the 13 weeks ended August 3, 2024, we maintained our share in Mass Beauty, but lost share in the beauty -- prestige beauty, particularly driven by makeup and hair categories. We know beauty enthusiasts love to shop for beauty, and they love Ulta Beauty and the unique experiences we offer. But they also love engaging in new beauty offerings. As a result, we often see a short-term impact of new distribution points on an existing nearby store, whether it's a competitor opening or a new Ulta Beauty store. What is unique about the current environment is the scale and pace of change. More than 80% of our stores have been impacted by one or more competitive opening in recent years, with more than half impacted by multiple competitive openings. This significant portion of our store fleet is experiencing a prolonged sales impact. Notably, the positive signals we see in our broader business reinforce the appeal of our differentiated model and our confidence that we will mitigate these near-term competitive pressures. Our brand awareness and brand love continue to increase with strong gains across multiple demographics, demonstrating the broad appeal of our unique, All Things Beauty, All In One Place offering. We continue to attract new and lapsed members to our loyalty program, while maintaining strong retention of our existing members. At the end of the second quarter, we had 43.9 million active Ulta Beauty Rewards members, 5% more than last year. Importantly, we continue to experience healthy growth in our platinum and diamond members. Newness continues to resonate with guests and drive growth. Newer brands, including Sol de Janeiro, Charlotte Tilbury, and OLEHENRIKSEN are driving sales, new member acquisition and member reengagement while newness from a variety of existing brands, including Clinique, Way and PEACH & LILY are driving healthy comp growth. Guests continue to engage with our unique in-store services offering, which delivered mid-single digit growth in the quarter. And new stores continue to perform well. During the quarter, we opened 17 stores, including our 1,400 store and their performance was in line with our expectations. Now we've disrupted the beauty category for more than 30 years and we understand how to successfully manage competitive forces. To reinforce our competitive position and drive stronger performance, we are aggressively taking actions across five areas: strengthening our assortment, expanding our social relevance, enhancing our digital experience, leveraging our powerful loyalty program, and evolving our promotional levers. I will discuss each of these areas in detail shortly. Now in addition to these external factors, we experienced unanticipated operational disruption during the quarter, resulting from the completion of our ERP transformation. In March, we began updating key store systems through a thoughtful and controlled implementation plan. And in July, we finished the migration of all of our stores to our new ERP platform. We are pleased to have successfully completed this important phase, but we have experienced some unexpected operational challenges as our teams have adjusted to new capabilities, new processes, and new ways of working associated with the new systems. Specifically, through the transition, our teams were managing portions of our fleet on both the old and new systems, which led to some store inventory allocation disruption. With all of our stores and DCs now operating on the same core systems, we are shifting from implementation to system optimization and are working quickly to help our teams navigate these new ways of working in order to balance inventories across the network and deliver an optimized guest experience. To minimize future disruption, we have identified key legacy processes that are creating friction and implemented proactive monitoring as well as dedicated support to quickly address issues when they arise. I am confident that our new capabilities will support better, more agile decision-making in the future. And I'm grateful for our collective team's hard work and dedication to manage through this critical transformation. The fourth factor impacting our performance this quarter was the effect of incremental promotions, which did not deliver the expected sales lift. As the top line trends softened in late June and July, we executed incremental promotions to drive revenue. These offers drove strong sales and traffic across our digital platforms, but did not deliver the expected incrementality in stores. The increased frequency of offers, combined with the introduction of new offer structures, put pressure on average selling price without activating incremental purchases in stores. We understand why the incremental promotions did not deliver as expected and will apply these learnings as we manage promotional activity in the second half. Turning now to performance by category. Fragrance delivered double-digit growth, driven by strong guest engagement with Mother's Day and exciting newness. Newness from existing brands, including Valentino, YSL, and Burberry as well as new brands, NOYZ, Orebella and Kylie Jenner, all of which are exclusive to Ulta, contributed to the category's growth. Our exciting Mother's Day gift with purchase offers and gift sets fueled strong guest engagement and our unique assortment of gift sets for Father's Day and back-to-school also delivered growth for the category. The skin care category delivered mid-single digit comp growth this quarter driven by strong growth in Body Care. Sol de Janeiro continues to excite guests, and this quarter, we introduced an exclusive body mist, which is resonating well. Reflecting the appeal of dermatologist recommended brands and favorite La Roche-Posay and new brands, PanOxyl and VANICREAM delivered strong growth. And relevant mass brands, including Bubble and BIOMA continued to engage guests. Overall, prestige skincare was pressured as engaging newness from PEACH & LILY and OLEHENRIKSEN was offset by softness from certain brands impacted by increased distribution or the lapping of strong social media engagement last year. Comp sales in the makeup category decreased mid-single digit range. Among new brands, Charlotte Tilbury, Polite Society, and WYN BEAUTY as well as exclusive newness from Clinique delivered strong growth. This growth was more than offset by sales decreases from existing brands that had newness that did not meet expectations or have experienced increased points of distribution in the market. In Mass makeup, e.l.f., about-face, and Milani delivered strong growth, but this growth was mitigated by planned softness in Ulta Beauty Collection as we prepared for the brand relaunch. Comp sales for the hair care category decreased in the high-single digit range, driven primarily by planned promotional shift. As we shared previously, we incorporated prestige hair care offers in our first quarter semi-annual beauty sale and eliminated our Gorgeous Hair event, which took place in May of last year. In addition, the impact of exciting newness from Wahl, Divi and Odele and strong engagement with Redken was offset by pressure from key brands lapping strong newness last year. As I mentioned at the outset, we are focused on five key areas to reinforce our competitive position. And we are pleased with the progress we've made in many areas and have identified further opportunities to shift our momentum. Starting with our efforts to strengthen our assortment. During the quarter, we continued to enhance our brand portfolio with new engaging brands, including Orebella, Naturium and Naked Sundays while also launching several emerging exclusive prints through our Spark program, including Door, a clean French beauty inspired skincare brand; Magic Molecule, a skincare healing brand; and NOYZ of premium gender-neutral fragrance. We also expanded the key growth driving brands like Sol de Janeiro, MAC, and Kiehl's into additional stores. Looking ahead, we have an exciting pipeline of brand launches planned for the balance of the year, including the recently announced ILIA Beauty, a clean skin centric prestige makeup brand; and DIBS Beauty, a multipurpose easy-to-use makeup brand. In addition to enhancing our assortment with compelling newness, we are focused on building greater awareness and engagement with key exclusive brands, including PEACH & LILY, Polite Society, WYN BEAUTY, and LolaVie, while also collaborating closely with strategic legacy brands to drive stronger growth and profitability. I'm excited to share that we have relaunched Ulta Beauty Collection to inspire beauty discovery, celebrate self-expression, and create a deeper emotional connection with guests. With simplified and good-for-you formulas, the new collection includes refreshed fan favorites as well as new innovations that reflect modern trends across skin care, body care, bath, suncare and cosmetics. Certified with clean ingredients and cruelty free products across the entire assortment, the reimagined collection is positioned at a masstige price point and is designed to make beauty discovery purposeful and accessible for beauty enthusiasts of all ages. While the new assortment has only been available for a few weeks and is still ramping up as we roll out additional SKUs, we are pleased with our early results. Social relevance powers customer connection and loyalty. To accelerate our social relevance and enhance our brand awareness, we have scaled our creator and influencer networks, and we are expanding our culture forward activations to ensure we are at the heart of the social and cultural conversation for beauty. As a result, this quarter, we delivered meaningful growth and earned media value and social sentiment and drove more than 250 million social impressions. During the quarter, we doubled the size of our influencer network to include a double -- a diverse range of influencers across key audience segments to reflect our inclusive audience targeting strategy. We also launched Ulta Beauties, our new associated ambassador program to harness the superpowers of our team and highlight the expertise and passion of our talented associates. As a group, these talented creators developed compelling content in support of our big summer Beauty sale, back-to-school, and the Joy project, which increased our EMV by more than 10% this quarter. Additionally, we launched a new affiliate program, UB Creates to drive traffic and conversion. Last year, we launched the Joy project, a multiyear initiative to make Beauty and the world a more joyful place. In celebration of National Day of Joy, we kicked off the second chapter of our Joy project with the launch of a social movement to spark positivity in the beauty space, partnering with brands, celebrities and creators as well as our own UB collective and UB beauties, our viral complement chain reached more than 260 million people and generated meaningful growth in EMV. To continue to expand our social relevance, we plan to deploy amplification and content strategies in the second half, leading into trend in cultural moments, leveraging our expanded creator network and enhancing brand partner activations. Leveraging new capabilities, we are enhancing our digital experiences to drive traffic and sales. During the quarter, we enhanced search and filtering functionality and make it easier for guests to find what they want quickly. And we streamlined the path to purchase with a new quick add-to-bag feature, making it more convenient for guests to add products to their cart. And to facilitate greater basket building, we introduced new personalized product recommendations and additional upsell placements along the guest purchasing journey. Importantly, we continue to drive increased app adoption through associate engagement, targeted communications, and app-only offers. In the second quarter, member engagement with our app increased 16%. And now our app accounts for about two-thirds of our e-commerce sales, 600 basis points higher than last year. While the app is a vital tool to drive e-commerce sales, the majority of our spend from app users actually incurs in store, making the app another key engagement tool to drive sales per member. As we look forward, we will continue to create and apply new digital features and functionality to give our guests new and more convenient ways to discover, transact and engage with Ulta Beauty. With more than 44 million active members, our loyalty program is a strategic asset that provides us with unique insights across categories, price points and channels and enables us to drive traffic and spend per member. To drive deeper connection and greater awareness, we are amplifying the value of our rewards program through member-only events, social engagement, and marketing activations. In May, we launched Member Love, a member only event of enticing category focused points offers, which delivered healthy member engagement and higher spend per member. And in July, we launched our first member tiered offer to drive traffic, new member acquisition, and member reactivations. In addition to targeted events and communications, we have integrated our rewards program into our digital experience, MAGs and tentpole events to drive engagement and reinforce the value of the program. Looking ahead, we are focused on attracting customer segments to drive new member growth, driving differentiated engagement early in the life cycle to enhance retention, and leveraging our extensive member data to accelerate traffic. Finally, we continue to evolve our promotional strategies to drive traffic and sales. Supported by a robust media strategy, in-store amplification, and engaging social content, we enhanced our big summer Beauty sale event with compelling offers across categories and price points. In addition to driving strong sales, the event delivered growth in new members and member reactivation as well as increased penetration of existing members. And always a fan favorite, we're excited to kick off 21 Days of Beauty with a new look, new beauty steals and unique events for our best members. As the competitive and promotional environment evolves, we will apply the learnings I mentioned earlier and leverage our member insights to execute productive, targeted offers while eliminating less effective promotions and applying new capabilities to create engaging events for our guests. In closing, Ulta Beauty remains a key beauty destination with strong consumer awareness and brand love. And our exceptional teams are committed to offering guests unique inclusive beauty experiences across all of our touch points. We are confident we have identified the factors that impacted our performance in the second quarter and are focused on the right actions to deliver stronger performance. As we turn to the second half of the year, our teams are focused on driving stronger sales and traffic, executing with excellence for our guests, exercising financial discipline as we adapt to a more challenging operating environment, and protecting and cultivating our unique culture, driven by our talented and passionate associates. While it will take time to shift the top line trend, I remain extremely confident in our model and in our ability to execute and win in an increasingly competitive category. And now, I will turn the call over to Paula for a discussion of the financial results and outlook. Paula?
Paula Oyibo: Thanks, Dave, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll begin with a discussion of our second quarter financial results and then provide more color on our updated outlook. We faced greater-than-expected challenges in the second quarter, resulting in overall financial performance that were below our expectations. Sales growth from comp stores was softer than expected and gross margin was pressured by incremental promotional offers. However, our teams exercised financial discipline, and we took swift actions to mitigate impacts of the top line trend. Net sales for the quarter increased 0.9%, solid new store performance from 49 net new stores and a 12% increase in other revenue, primarily due to an increase in credit card income and growth in royalty income from our target partnership was partially offset by a 1.2% decline in comparable sales. During the quarter, we opened 17 new stores, closed one store, remodeled nine stores and relocated one store. The comp sales decline was driven by a 1.8% decline in transactions, which was partially offset by a 0.6% increase in average ticket. The increase in average ticket reflects growth in average selling price per item, offset by lower average unit per transaction. Looking at the cadence of sales. Net sales trends decelerated as we moved through the quarter, with July being our most challenged period. Comp store sales climbed in the low-single digit rate, primarily driven by a decrease in store transactions. Average ticket also decreased. Our digital channel performance was stronger with e-commerce sales increasing in the low-single digit range. Across digital channels, the sales trends accelerated as we moved through the quarter, with incremental promotional activity driving stronger guest engagement particularly in July. For the quarter, gross margin decreased 100 basis points to 38.3% compared to 39.3% last year. The decline was primarily due to lower merchandise margin and deleverage of store fixed costs, which were partially offset by growth in other revenues and lower shrink. Merchandise margin declined primarily due to increased promotional activity, adverse impact from brand mix and the continued lapping of benefits from price increases last year. While the impact of promotional activity was higher than planned, it was well below 2019 levels. Store fixed costs also delevered driven by lower top line growth and more net new store openings. As a percentage of sales, inventory shrink was lower in the quarter. We completed the rollout of our new fragrance fixtures to all stores and introduced an additional fixture to protect our assortment of popular smaller rollerball fragrances. These investments are having a meaningful impact on fragrance test, and we expect the additional fixtures will support a continuation of the trend. In addition, we continue to increase our ORC focus and have deployed new tools, capabilities and training to our store and field loss prevention teams. Year-to-date, shrink as a percentage of sales is flat with last year, and we continue to expect shrink will be roughly flat for the full year. Moving to expenses. SG&A increased 7.3% to $645 million. Overall, SG&A spend was better than planned again this quarter, primarily due to focused expense management. As a percentage of sales, SG&A increased 160 basis points to 25.3% compared to 23.7% last year. Reflecting lower top line growth, most expenses deleveraged this quarter. In addition, we preserved sales driving expenses, including store labor and marketing, and completed key elements of our transformational agenda this quarter. These pressures were partially offset by lower incentive compensation, reflecting operational performance that was below our internal target. Operating margin was 12.9% of sales compared to 15.5% of sales last year. And diluted GAAP earnings per share was $5.30 compared to $6.02 last year. Moving to the balance sheet and capital allocation priorities. We ended the quarter with $414 million in cash and cash equivalents. Total inventory increased 10.1% to $2 billion compared to $1.8 billion last year. In addition to the impact of 49 net new stores, the increase was primarily due to inventory to support new brands and the opening of our new market fulfillment center in Greer, South Carolina, which opened in the third quarter last year. Year-to-date, through the second quarter, we generated $359 million in operating cash flow. Capital expenditures were $95 million for the quarter, primarily reflecting investments in new and existing stores, IT investments, and merchandise fixtures. Depreciated was $65 million compared to $62 million last year, primarily due to higher depreciation related to new stores and IT investments. In the second quarter, we returned $212 million of capital to our shareholders through the repurchase of 550,000 shares. At the end of the quarter, we had $1.6 billion remaining under our current $2 billion repurchase authorization. Now turning to our outlook. We have taken a more cautious view for the year. We now expect net sales for the year will be between $11 billion and $11.2 billion, with comp sales in the range of down 2% to flat. In addition to reflecting our first half performance, our updated outlook for sales assumes it will take more time for our actions to change the top line trajectory, and that stores impacted by multiple competitive openings will continue to be pressured more than the rest of the fleet. The operating environment remains dynamic, and the low end of our range implies incremental pressure on consumer spending. For the year, we expect operating margin will be between 12.7% and 13% of net sales. Most of the reduction in our expectation for operating margin compared to our previous view is due to the lower top line. But we have also included flexibility to respond to the evolving promotional environment. For the year, we expect gross margin will deleverage 70 basis points to 90 basis points as lower merchandise margin and deleverage of store fixed costs are partially offset by other revenue growth and lower transportation costs. For the year, we expect SG&A expense will increase in the mid-single digit range. We expect many of the trends we experienced in the first half will continue in the second half, with SG&A driving most of the operating margin deleverage. Reflecting these assumptions, we now anticipate diluted EPS will be in the range of $22.60 to $23.50 per share. We continue to expect to generate strong operating cash flow for the year, which will support our planned CapEx investments of $400 million to $450 million and share repurchases of $1 billion. In closing, we are focused on improving performance in the second half, and we believe our newness and go-to-market strategies, along with continued operational and financial discipline will enable us to navigate the dynamic environment and drive improved sales and profit momentum over time. And now, I'll turn the call over to our operator to moderate the Q&A section. Operator?
Operator: Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Steven Forbes with Guggenheim Securities. Please proceed with your question.
Steven Forbes: Good evening, Dave, Paula. Dave, I was hoping you could expand on the competitive pressures you noted in the prepared remarks. Any way to help us contextualize the size of this headwind such as year one cannibalization rates, and any early insights on the recovery path? Meaning, what does the recovery for those stores impacted look like? And maybe you can give us an example of some of those earlier stores that were impacted, any time frame to sort of get back to those prior levels pre cannibalization? Thank you.
Dave Kimbell: Great. Thanks for the question, Steve. And yeah, let me just start with saying, we -- of course, we're no strangers to competition. We know how to compete effectively. And this is, as I said in the remarks, a very attractive category that continues to increase in the competitive environment. As it relates to increased points of pressure, what we've shared before is that we have historically seen a short-term impact on new distribution points on our existing store when a competitor opens near one of our stores. What's unique about this time in this environment is the scale and the pace of change, which is it made it difficult for us to fully forecast the cumulative impact. 88% (ph) of our stores have been impacted by one -- at least one store. And as I said in the remarks, more than half of our stores have been impacted by multiple competitive openings, which to give you context of what that means is, if you take a single Ulta Beauty store, two or more competitive stores have opened within that store's trade area, which is unusual for us historically and something that we're navigating through. What we saw during this quarter is that stores that have had multiple competitive openings, which again could happen over the -- at different times over the three years that we've been navigating, as those stores with multiple competitive openings are underperforming those stores with no or limited competitive impact. Stores that have -- the segment of stores that have not had a direct in-market trade area competitive impact delivered positive comps for the quarter, which is another reason that we feel confident in our model, in our business, in our guest engagement. Stores that have just one competitive opening that occurred early in the expansion cycle are performing in line with historical trends, another data point that gives us confidence as we look forward. But we know we're still in the midst of this. Stores have opened aggressively over the last couple of years. These competitive pressures will likely continue into the near term. But the positive signals I highlighted in our broader business, the guest engagement, the impact of newness, the impact of our new stores, the success of our salon business, the loyalty growth, all of those factors suggest to us and give us a lot of confidence that our business continues to have underlying strength in health and we're navigating through this short term. We know it will take time, but we are not sitting still and we're aggressively taking actions across all the things that I highlighted in the prepared remarks.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mark Altschwager with Baird. Please proceed with your question.
Amy Teske: Hi. Good afternoon. This is Amy Teske on for Mark. With the demand backdrop continuing to be pressured, can you talk more about the actions you were taking within SG&A to limit the amount of deleverage you're seeing in the model? Thank you.
Kecia Steelman: Sure. Thank you. Thank you, Amy. As I mentioned in our prepared remarks, we did deliver better than planned SG&A due to focused and disciplined cost management as we navigated our top line pressures. As we think about the second half, we've planned SG&A expenses to increase in the mid-single digit range for the year, reflecting a more moderated growth in the second half. We continue to exercise financial discipline as we navigate these near-term pressures, while still making sure that we're investing and ensure we're well positioned for success over the long term. But as we look ahead, we're expecting that moderation in SG&A growth because we are completing our transformation, many of our transformational investments are completing. And we will continue to, like I said, exercise financial discipline as we navigate.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Lasser with UBS. Please proceed with your question.
Michael Lasser: Good evening. Thank you so much for taking my question. Given the competitive overlap with all these new points of distribution is not going to go away anytime soon, how long do you expect that it will take to restore the business to positive comps? And since it seems that hitting the promotional lever is not having the intended impact, what is the backup plan or what is the alternative if the actions you are taking don't work to restore positive comps? Thank you.
Dave Kimbell: Thanks, Michael. Yes, it is, as we've discussed, a dynamic and competitive environment that we're navigating through, and I gave you some of those dynamics in my prepared remarks. We are -- and as I said, we remain confident and bullish in the long-term outlook for this business because of all the positives that I've highlighted. We're executing across a number of efforts to drive our business. Here's what I know about our business right now. We are seeing many positive signals that are gaining traction, and we're addressing areas that maybe are not working as well as we had hoped. Assortment is always key. So when we look at key levers, assortment is critical. Newness is working and resonating with our guests, brands like So de Janeiro, Charlotte, OLEHENRIKSEN are driving sales. Our new -- our exclusive brands are playing an important role, and we continue to add brands, Naturium in Q2. And tomorrow, we launch ILIA, an important makeup brand that we're excited to add to our assortment. So continued innovation is a key lever for us that's working, and we'll continue to drive that. I talked about the importance of marketing and social relevance and connecting, deepening brand love. We're pleased with the progress, all-time high of brand love and brand awareness. And we'll continue to drive that because we know that drives connection and awareness and reinforces the role that we play in our guests' lives. Our digital business is critical. And I shared that our digital sales were on expectation, and we're focused on delivering across all of the experiences, you know that we've invested heavily in our digital capabilities over the last couple of years. Earlier this year, we completed our new digital store platform, and that's giving us new ways to delight our guests. And that's working, and we'll be focused on driving that. Loyalty is core to our long-term success. We're pleased with the 5% year-over-year growth, high level of retention, high level of engagement from a best guest, our platinum and diamond guests and a critical part of that business going forward. Services and experience is also driving positive. Promo is an important piece of our business, and I'm glad you highlighted it. As I mentioned in the prepared remarks, some of the incremental offers that we added as our performance decelerated in the second half of the quarter did not have the intended effect in -- particularly in our store channel. Promos, generally though, our tent pole events, I mentioned our big summer Beauty sale. Tomorrow, we launch 21 Days of Beauty. Our big promotional events are working, are attracting new guests, are demonstrating the behaviors. And we continue to amplify and elevate those, and you'll see that come to market with our next one, again, starting tomorrow with 21 Days of Beauty. But we'll take our learnings and promotional impact that we had in the second quarter as we navigate this challenging competitive environment through the second half of the year and continue to focus on the highest return, highest impact promos. So promos are working but we did have some experiences that -- and last thing, I'd just say, if you just step back, Michael, and just think about our business, we feel very confident that we're well positioned to recover. We've got a differentiated business model. And while some elements have been pressured, our model continues to be connected to our guests. And the experiences we offer are unique, enduring. Nobody does what Ulta Beauty does, our guest value, the assortment, the loyalty, the unique services offer, our omnichannel offerings. And I'd say most importantly, the unique experience we deliver to our guests in our stores and online. We allow our guests to discover beauty on their own terms, and we continue to deliver that every day in our stores, and I'm very proud of what our teams are doing. So we're sharpening our differentiated model. We're focused on leaning in on what's working, addressing the dynamics that -- where we have opportunity. And while, as I said, it's going to take a little time to turn back to our custom position of being a share gainer, we are confident we'll get there and our actions are designed to do just that.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Rupesh Parikh with Oppenheimer. Please proceed with your question.
Rupesh Parikh: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. So just going back to unit growth and also target rollout. Just given the more difficult environment right now, like any thoughts on salon unit growth? And as you look at Target, I believe that continues to roll out. Just curious how that's playing out in the current backdrop.
Dave Kimbell: Yes. We -- as far as our own stores, we're pleased with our new store openings. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, our new stores, despite some of the other dynamics going on, continue to perform well. And we are -- we have opportunities across the country in a variety of different types of markets to continue to fill in, to reach new markets, to reach new consumers. I've shared before in previous calls, the work we're doing with our small format store, that's performing well. So we're going to lean in more there. And so we're confident that again, we will work through these competitive pressures, and we want to make sure we're reaching as many beauty enthusiast in all parts of the country as possible with our new stores. And then our Target partnership is working. I'll let Kecia give a little bit of color, but we're pleased with that partnership, the strategic role that it plays in our member engagement program is still very strong. And we're positive and optimistic about that path.
Kecia Steelman: Yes. In the last quarter, we opened four Ulta Beauty at Target stores. We have 541 total locations through the quarter. We're still on track to hit our 800 stores through our commitment. It's about deepening that guest engagement. It's about driving growth of the new member and the conversion and the reengagement of lapsed members, and we're seeing that. And then I think it's also really key that nearly 4 million guests have linked their Ulta Beauty and their Target circle loyalty programs together. We do see this as another way to just continue to connect with that guest and engage them back into the Ulta Beauty home store.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kelly Crago with Citi. Please proceed with your question.
Kelly Crago: Hi. Thanks for taking our question. I just wanted to follow up on the promotional levels that you're kind of assuming this year. What gives you the confidence that promo levels can sustain at this lower rate relative to pre-COVID just given the category slowing, the consumers seeking value? And there's been a big step up in the competitive environment. And then just secondly, just curious your thoughts on just the makeup of the product assortment. Any rethinking of how maybe big you are in some of these brands that are distributed -- not over distributed, but have seen the distribution points increase quite a bit, some of these more established brands. Just any thoughts on how you see the brand assortment evolving over the next couple of years. Thanks.
Dave Kimbell: Thanks, Kelly. Yes. On the promotional levers, when we look out over the -- well, when we look through this year and what's ahead of us, promotional activity has increased, as I highlighted. And that does reflect both the normalization of the category and increased competition. And as I shared, we were more promotional in the first half of the year. As we turn to the second half, promotion will play an important role. The second half, driven by holiday is always a more promotional period. Holiday is a different dynamic and is intensely promotional to begin with, has been for years, regardless of the competitive environment. As we're competing not just in beauty, but we're competing for gifting occasions across consumers' baskets. And so we're prepared for that. And we'll -- we continue to take our learnings. As we look back pre-COVID, we continue to believe that the environment, while intense, will remain rational. Our guidance assumes that while higher than last year, we will be below 2019 levels for the year, driven by smart execution, CRM capabilities that we have built aggressively over the years, driving efficiency, leaning into our tent pole events and maximizing those. And so while promotional has played a bigger role, we feel we've got it rightsized as we look into the second half of the year, knowing it's a higher promotional period. As far as assortment and what's ahead, Ulta Beauty has a very unique assortment. All price points across mass and prestige, strength in makeup, haircare, skincare, fragrance, bath, wellness services as well, and we're really proud of that. It's one of the things our guests continue to tell us that they really love about us. And the fact that we deliver that in an omnichannel way, in-store and online. So to your specific question around legacy brands, they play an important role. We're really pleased and proud of our partnership with some of the biggest brands in the world. And we're focused on driving growth with those brands. We have a very unique experience in store with many of these brands that brings education, entertainment, events to our guests. We drive exclusivity with our guests through some of these brands. An example is Black Honey with Clinique that we've launched that's in market right now. And so we'll continue to partner with these brands to bring in new experiences. These brands play an important role because of the trust and engagement that they have, the opportunity to bring new guests in and delight our existing guests. But at the same time, we are focused on finding what's new. It's one of the greatest things about this category is the level of entrepreneurship, newness, innovation, and we will continue to drive that. I've highlighted a few already, a few in the fragrance category, as an example, Orebella, Kylie, NOYZ, all new, all exclusive, all exciting, all performing well. Brands in makeup like WYN and Polite Society, both new, both exclusive and we have many others. So we'll lean into the broad mix. For us, it's all things beauty. And to do that, we need to be winning and leading across all types of brands, and that's what we're focused on going into the future.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Korinne Wolfmeyer with Piper Sandler. Please proceed with your question.
Korinne Wolfmeyer: Hey, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. I'd like to hear a little bit more about the operational disruption you referenced with the ERP transition. Can you provide a little bit more color on what exactly happened, how the business was impacted? And what gives you confidence that the issue is cleared out going forward? Thank you.
Kecia Steelman: Yes, Korinne. As Dave mentioned in his earlier comments that we executed by far the most complex element of our multiyear ERP implementation during this quarter, and that was the rollout to our stores. Our teams had to manage dual systems as we phase through the 1,400-plus stores that we have. So that just really added a lot of complexity. It created challenges to our purchasing, our store allocation and our planning processes and systems. And we do see this as a short-term headwind. The great news is that we've completed this challenging phase, so we're through it now. And what I would say what we're doing is that we're really fine-tuning and optimizing the system. And while there's still some investments for continued optimization, we've really built that already into an ERP budget plan, and it's reflected in the current guidance. A change of this magnitude when you're going through DCs and stores, it's really not easy. And adapting takes some time. But we're really grateful to our teams for embracing these transformative changes. And we feel like we're really making progress. And we're confident that we're positioned and ready to have a great holiday season.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ike Boruchow with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.
Juliana Duque: Hi. Thank you for taking my question. This is Juliana on for Ike. As we head into your Analyst Day in a few weeks, I was just wondering if there's any preliminary update on the long-term algo or the long-term margin target that you can give us? Thank you.
Kecia Steelman: Hi, Juliana. Thank you for the question. And I certainly understand and appreciate the reason for the question, but we are not providing an update on our long-term expectations on the call today. But as you mentioned, we do plan to do so at our Investor Day in October. And at that time, we are very much looking forward to sharing how we're thinking about our future growth, including kind of the growth opportunities ahead in the category, opportunities specifically for us, what investments, if any, it will take to support those. And how that translates into our long-term financial expectations. And so looking forward to that in just about a month or so.
Juliana Duque: Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Baker with D.A. Davidson. Please proceed with your question.
Michael Baker: Okay. Hi. Thanks. I wanted to ask about the pace of the share losses in prestige. So your business seems to have gotten worse based on your comps, but some industry data and competitive data are also seeing a deceleration. So I wonder if you can give us any color on the gap between what you're seeing in your own business and competitors. Are you seeing the share losses actually get worse here, I guess, is the question. Thanks.
Dave Kimbell: Yeah, Michael. Thanks for the question. As you said, yes, the category has, as I highlighted, moderated, really is anticipated through the year after multi-years of growth. As far as our performance, as I said, we maintained mass -- share in mass, but continue to be pressured in prestige. And that's driven in particular by hair and makeup, which are the categories that I've talked about in the past. No, we wouldn't say that it's getting any worse. The dynamics are as they've been for much of the year as it relates to share, it's a reflection of both the monitoring category, continued competitive pressures and then some of the other dynamics that we've highlighted and discussed here today are what contributed to the performance we delivered in the second quarter.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ashley Helgans with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.
Ashley Helgans: Hey. Thanks for taking the question. So a question around kind of the increasing competitive environment. Has that changed the ability to get new brands at all? And then when you're adding new brands like ILIA, do you factor in where they're currently distributed? Thanks.
Dave Kimbell: Yeah. No. Great question, Ashley, and thanks for sharing. I'd say big picture, no. I mean, our brand partners are so key to our success and something that I have been so proud of how our team manages our relationships and works as true partners to building our brands. Brands continue to see Ulta Beauty as a leading destination to expand their business, whether they're an existing brand like ILIA or a new brand that's just been created that's looking to reach $44 million of the best beauty enthusiasts across the country. And we're demonstrating that right now. Our brands continue to lean into us. So I've highlighted a few things, rolling established brands through innovation, exclusives on those brands, expansion of those brands and finding new ways. I mentioned expanding Kiehl's, a brand that we've had for a while and finding new ways to reach our guests, expanding that into stores. Brands are excited about that because they see growth. Launching big established brands like ILIA and discovering new and exclusive brands. So we are focused every day on creating an environment that our brands see value with us, and they do. 44 million members, 1,400 stores, a strong and dynamic digital environment and an experience that's unique. Despite the competitive environment nobody does what Ulta Beauty does. And our brands, probably understand that better than others. And that's why we've had such success creating deep relationships and continuing to attract both existing and brand-new to the world brands. And that's something that I see will continue to drive our business going forward.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Olivia Tong with Raymond James. Please proceed with your question.
Olivia Tong: Great. Thank you. A few questions left. First, how much of the miss relative to your expectations this quarter do you think was a function of the category decelerating versus your own share loss? And then second, why do you think the promos that you did this quarter didn't quite work? And then as you think about the rest of the year, is it you have to deploy more promo or different promo because it looks like from your full year outlook revision that you expect comps to potentially fall another 100 basis points in the second half versus Q2. And just lastly, if you could talk about what you saw towards the end of the quarter into this quarter that influences your guidance. Thank you.
Dave Kimbell: Great. Thanks, Olivia. Let's see. First, on the mix of the drivers. We highlighted four primary elements that we believe impacted our business in the second quarter. And we think each played a role in our sales performance with the competitive pressures continuing to be the largest driver. So as we've talked about here today, continue to focus on the competitive pressure, recognizing the category, while still healthy, has moderated some. So it requires us to continue to elevate our efforts and then addressing some of the internal dynamics around our operational efforts as well as promotional. So all contributed, and we're focused on driving them. For promo specifically, we -- as I've mentioned, what has not -- maybe what did not work as much was not our tent pole events, our core strategic elements, our loyalty events, the key connections that we have. But as I said, we -- our sales moderated throughout the quarter. And as we saw that, call it, in mid-June and into July, on top of some of the efforts we already had, like our big summer Beauty sale and other programs, we layered in incremental promotions. And historically, we've done some of that, and it's worked in different ways. But this time, what we saw was that layering helped in the e-com business, as we highlighted, and did drive traffic and sales on e-com. But added some complexity in store in how that came to life and did not resonate as well. And so when we saw our consumers engaging with them, we created an environment that was not as clear and crisp as we needed it to be. And so we're addressing that going forward. As far as our outlook into the rest of the year and the role of promo as well as other things, we have assessed the impact of the new and existing challenges that we've been talking about here today, and we evaluated a number of scenarios that anticipate a variety of macro consumer changes, competitive category performance, holiday shifts, and a more promotional environment. We've taken all that into account, and that's reflected in our outlook. But I'd say last thing I'd say to all that is, I hope it's clear, we're not standing still. I've highlighted many of the things that we're doing. We're taking action. We're building off successes with newness and other efforts that we have across the business. We do not anticipate having to lean only on promo. That's never what we've had to do. And all of the actions across loyalty, innovation, newness, services, guest experience, digital will come together to drive us and give us confidence in our comp guidance for the second half of the year.
Kiley Rawlins: Operator, I think we have time for one more question.
Operator: All right. Great. Our last question comes from the line of Susan Anderson with Canaccord Genuity. Please proceed with your question.
Susan Anderson: Hi. Good evening. Thanks for fitting me in here. I guess, I was curious, it sounds like most of the competitive pressure is on the prestige side, and it did sound like you maintained that mass share. But are you also seeing any increased competition on the mass side maybe being some of the mass retailers getting more competitive from a promotional standpoint? And then also just really quick on the hair care, was that decline or change there primarily driven by prestige or did you see anything else on the mass side as well? Thanks.
Dave Kimbell: Great. Yes. This is a very competitive category. And so while we're pleased that we maintained share of mass, we know there's competition happening both on the mass and the prestige side. But we haven't seen -- what we haven't seen in mass is the dramatic increase in points of distribution or expanded presence both with physical stores and online. And that's allowed us to continue to drive our experience. And an important aspect is while we talk about our business in mass and prestige, our guest really looks at the whole thing and comes in for both together and buy both together in the same basic from entry-level mass up through masstige, prestige, and luxury. And so we need all things to be clicking to driving traffic and engagement and basket. And so when there's pressure on one part of the business, it impacts our whole store. But our mass business is performing well, and we're confident in our outlook there. As far as the hair dynamics, I mentioned in the remarks, the primary driver. We're pleased with our hair business. It's a critical part of our business. I mentioned our salon is performing well. The hair business primary driver of the performance there was a shift in one of our strategic tent pole events in hair from the second quarter into the first quarter. And that was the primary driver of the lower results in that. But our hair business is important, and we continue to find ways to drive that business going forward.
Susan Anderson: Great. Thanks so much.
Dave Kimbell: Yeah. Thank you. Thank you, Susan, and thank you all again for joining us today. We very much appreciate your interest in Ulta Beauty. And I wanted to take this last moment to thank our more than 55,000 Ulta Beauty associates for their continued focus and commitment to serving our guests. Our teams have managed through significant change over these last three years, and I so appreciate how quickly they've embraced new technology, new processes, new ways of working, always while keeping our guests and each other at the center of everything that we do. So we look forward to speaking to you all again a little sooner than normal after one of our quarterly calls and at our investor event in October. I hope to see you there, and I hope you all have a good evening, and thanks again for joining.
Operator: Thank you. This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.

===== 2024 Q1  (2024-05-30 16:30:00) =====
Operator: Good afternoon and welcome to Ulta Beauty's Conference Call to discuss Results for the Ulta Beauty's First Quarter 2024 Earnings Results. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce Ms. Kiley Rawlins, Vice President of Investor Relations. Ms. Rawlins, please proceed.

Dave Kimbell: Thank you, Kylie, and good afternoon, everyone. We appreciate your interest in Ulta Beauty. For the first quarter, net sales increased 3.5% to $2.7 billion and comp sales grew 1.6%. Operating profit was 14.7% of sales and diluted EPS was $6.47 per share. We expected comp growth this quarter would be in the low single-digit range as we lapped strong performance last year. I am proud of how our teams adjusted our go-to-market activity to adapt to a rapidly evolving marketplace, thoughtfully managed expenses across the enterprise and importantly, continued to execute our transformational agenda with excellence. As we look forward to the rest of the year, we believe it is prudent to anticipate a continuation of the dynamic environment we experienced in the first quarter and therefore have adjusted our expectations for the remainder of the year. Paula will give more detail on these revisions later in her prepared comments. Before we talk about the quarter, I want to emphasize a few important points. First, we are confident in our model and our ability to gain share and drive significant sustainable value over the long-term. The actions we have taken and investments we have made over the past few years have fortified our operating foundation and we are a stronger, more profitable company today than we were just a few years ago. And we have an outstanding team that knows how to execute and deliver profitably and they are doing so every day with focus, passion and determination. However, we are not satisfied with our market share trends and we are taking actions to reinforce our leadership position and accelerate growth. For more than 30 years, Ulta Beauty has disrupted the beauty industry by bringing mass brands, prestige brands, luxury brands and services together in an accessible, fun shopping environment. This differentiated strategy, combined with welcoming an inclusive guest experiences, has enabled us to shape consumer expectations and drive profitable growth. Today, we operate nearly 1,400 stores and manage a multibillion dollar digital business, providing guests with unique opportunities to play, discover and try beauty. With warm and authentic experiences, our passionate associates are creating strong emotional connections with our guests and helping them discover beauty on their own terms. We've created a world-class loyalty program that engages with more than 43 million active members and provides us with valuable customer and transaction data, and we've expanded our differentiated assortment and built strong strategic partnership with large and emerging brands around the world. We operate in a healthy, growing category. While growth is moderating as expected after three years of unprecedented expansion and competitive intensity is increasing, we have a powerful operating model, excellent brand partnerships and I believe the impact of our winning culture and outstanding teams will enable us to protect and expand our leadership position. In the first quarter, we've strengthened our market position in several areas. Consumer awareness and brand love for Ulta Beauty continues to increase. Our marketing amplification of key brand launches, elevation of our tentpole events and culturally relevant social activation delivered 4 points of improvement in unaided brand awareness this quarter, driven primarily by key growth cohorts. Trust for our expertise, welcoming guest experiences, a diverse assortment and efforts to increase convenience through multiple touch points drove our brand love metric to record levels with strong gains among both Gen Z and baby boomers, which demonstrates the broad appeal of our model. Newness is resonating with our guests. Recent brand launches, including Sol de Janeiro, Charlotte Tilbury and exclusive brands win by Serena Williams and Kylie Jenner Fragrance, are driving sales, new member acquisition and member reengagement. We delivered traffic growth in both our store and digital channels. We increased marketing investments across TV, audio and social platforms to maximize our brand launches, support our semiannual beauty and Spring Haul tentpole events, and amplify our brand equity with the Joy Project. These strategic media investments drove higher traffic across our web and app platforms and increased traffic growth per store, even as we lapped strong double-digit growth last year. Our world-class loyalty program expanded again this quarter with the retention of our most valuable members remains very strong. We ended the quarter with 43.6 million Ulta Beauty rewards members, 6% higher than last year, primarily driven by member retention. Additionally, we continued to acquire new members and reengage lapsed members. Targeted marketing efforts are elevating more members to our platinum and diamond tiers, and exclusive promotions, point accelerators and personalized contents are driving engagement and retention of these valuable members. Our new store portfolio continues to perform well. During the quarter, we opened 12 stores, seven more than last year, and their performance exceeded our expectations. Our associate retention has improved across stores, distribution centers and our corporate teams, and we are on track to complete critical elements of our transformational agenda this year, giving us a stronger foundation for future growth. Our teams are operating at a high level as we execute these transitions, and it is worth noting that they delivered several significant operational milestones this quarter. First, we successfully completed the final phase of our digital store transition and are on track to decommission the legacy platform in the second quarter. Second, we completed an important phase of Project SOAR with a successful transition of our Dallas, Greenwood and Fresno distribution centers to our new ERP system. Now, all of our primary distribution centers are operating on the same platform. Third, we began the process of migrating stores to our new ERP system and I am pleased to share that we have completed the transition in 30% of our fleet. The benefits include an upgrade of a key digital application to provide our store teams with a guided user experience, enhanced reporting to support inventory management, and increased visibility to product information to elevate the guest experience. Beauty is a competitive category and our success reflects the differentiation we provide in the market and our effectiveness in creating meaningful and enduring guest connections. These strengths have enabled us to outperform the market, especially through the pandemic recovery. According to Circana data, between 2019 and 2023, Ulta Beauty expanded its share of both prestige and mass beauty significantly. More recently, the strength of the beauty category, combined with an attractive margin profile, has drawn significant and diverse competition to the category. Today, there are significantly more places to buy beauty, especially prestige beauty, with more than 1,000 new points of distribution opened in the last two years. Additionally, prestige brands are expanding their online availability as digital penetration grows in the category. As a result, our market share has been more challenged for the last few quarters, particularly within the prestige beauty category. Using the consumer lens of how guests experience Ulta Beauty through all of our touch points, we estimate we maintained our share of the total U.S. beauty product industry this quarter. Based on Circana data for the 13 weeks ended May 5, 2024, we outpaced the growth of the mass market but lost share in prestige beauty, primarily driven by pressure in makeup and hair. This prestige share pressure was concentrated in stores as we increased share in e-com for the quarter. Given our proven ability to engage our guests and lead the industry, I am confident we can reinvigorate market share gains. At our Analyst Day in October, we will share longer term plans to drive share growth, but today I want to highlight actions we are taking now to leverage our traffic growth, increase conversion and accelerate top line growth. Our plans are focused on five key areas; strengthening our assortment, accelerating our social relevance, enhancing our digital experience, leveraging our world class loyalty program and evolving our promotional levers. Starting with our assortment, we are enhancing our assortment with the addition of highly recognized brands as well as emerging and exclusive brands. This year, our brand pipeline includes more than 25 new brands, including many exclusive to Ulta Beauty. Importantly, this year's pipeline includes a balanced mix of category growth driving brands like Sol de Janeiro and Charlotte Tilbury and Naturium and emerging exclusive brands like Wyn, a makeup brand developed by Serena Williams and Orebella, a fragrance brand developed by Bella Hadid. To support stronger growth of our core assortment, we plan to accelerate growth with key exclusive brands including Polite Society, Live Tinted and LolaVie, among others. We plan to expand key growth driving brands into more stores and we are excited to relaunch the Ulta Beauty collection this summer. Additionally, we intend to leverage our marketing and social capabilities to lean into emerging trends, amplify key growth brands and drive relevance and engagement and activate new trend focused events across all our channels. Social media is amplifying and accelerating beauty. Social relevance is the gateway to customer reach, connection and engagement, and relevance drives sales and loyalty. While we have increased our EMV and share voice across key platforms including TikTok and Instagram, we see further opportunity to ensure we are at the heart of the social and cultural conversation for beauty. To accelerate our social relevance, we will scale our creator network, amplify brand networks and collaborations, and use our platforms to showcase our unique assortment. With the completion of our digital store transition, we are increasing our focus on leveraging new capabilities and optimizing the guest experience to accelerate traffic, drive conversion and increase average ticket. We recently expanded our partnership with DoorDash with our launch on DoorDash Marketplace, which extends our unique assortment to the more than 70 million active users of the DoorDash app. We will introduce new digital buying guides that amplify search engine optimization while providing guests with educational content, beauty tips and product recommendations. We will improve the path to purchase through guided navigation and leverage new innovative search capabilities to facilitate discovery and we will accelerate app adoption through targeted communication and offers as app users spend nearly two times more. In the first quarter, our app accounted for 57% of our e-commerce sales, up more than 450 basis points compared to last year. Our loyalty program is a powerful strategic asset and we will lean into this platform to drive greater engagement and support top line growth. Earlier this year, we rebranded the program to Ulta Beauty rewards, enhanced the birthday experience, and launched a refreshed look in stores online and across social. These improvements are driving greater awareness and deepen connections with our members. We have also introduced new mobile POS capabilities to engage existing members and drive new member acquisition, and we are testing new ways for guests to engage with loyalty benefits in store transactions. At the same time, we are leaning in to amplify the value of the program through member love events and social engagement and we are also testing new gamification platforms, creating new ways to engage with our program and Ulta Beauty. And later this year, we will activate new marketing technology that will advance our personalization efforts with our guests. Finally, we continue to enhance our promotional events and strategies. We will evolve our unique tentpole events to drive basket and new member acquisition, increase our use of effective targeted offers while eliminating or shifting less productive offers, and to create new platforms and offers to excite and engage our guests. In closing, we continue to expect the beauty category will grow in the mid-single-digit range this year barring a major economic event. We are confident we have identified the right actions to deliver stronger revenue growth, and our associates are working together as one unified Ulta Beauty team to expand our leadership position and deliver engaging guest experiences across all our touch points. I look forward to sharing our progress with you throughout the year. And now, I will turn the call over to Paula for a discussion of the financial results. Paula?
Paula Oyibo: Thanks Dave and good afternoon everyone. As Dave shared, our team responded to the dynamic operating environment with focus and financial discipline. As a result, we delivered net income and diluted EPS in line with our internal expectations. We are focused on reinforcing our leadership position and driving stronger performance, and while we believe our efforts will deliver results, we think it is prudent to expect many of the pressures we identified and faced throughout the first quarter may continue for the balance of the year and therefore have revised our annual guidance. I'll begin with a discussion of our first quarter results, followed by comments about our updated full year outlook. Net sales for the quarter increased 3.5%, driven by 1.6% growth in comp sales. The contribution from 36 net new stores opened since the first quarter last year and a $9 million increase in other revenue, primarily due to an increase in credit card income and growth in royalty income from our Target partnership. Comp transactions for the quarter increased 1.3%, driven by traffic growth in stores and on our digital platforms. Average ticket increased 0.3%. Looking at the cadence of sales throughout the quarter, comp sales in February decreased slightly as we lapped strong double digit comps last year. Comp growth accelerated in March, reflecting the impact of our semiannual beauty events and the benefit of the Easter shift. April trends were positive but softened compared to march, primarily reflecting the adverse impact of the Easter shift. From a channel perspective, e-commerce sales increased in the high-single-digit range. Sales from comp stores were flat compared to last year, reflecting the expansion of brick and mortar distribution points and the lapping of strong comp growth last year. Turning to comp sales performance by category, fragrance delivered double digit growth, driven by newness from existing brands and exciting brand launches, including Cosmic from Kylie Jenner, which is exclusive to Ulta Beauty. Additionally, Valentine's Day drove strong growth across both men and women's fragrances. The skincare category delivered mid-single-digit comp growth this quarter, primarily driven by double digit growth in body care and mask skin care, which was partially offset by a decline in prestige skincare. The strong performance of body care was driven primarily by the launch of Sol de Janeiro and the expansion of key emerging brands into additional Ulta Beauty stores. The growth of mass skincare was primarily due to strong engagement with our dermatologist recommended platform as well as the expansion of in-store presentation of select emerging brands. Our prestige business was challenged this quarter, reflecting the impact of increased distribution for key brands, timing shifts of product newness, and the lapping of the impact of strong social media engagement with certain brands last year. Hair care comp sales increased to low single digit range, primarily due to newness in hair tools. The inclusion of prestige hair care in our semiannual beauty event and high engagement with mass hair care products during our Spring Haul event. Makeup comp sales decreased to mid-single-digit range, while new brands and guest engagements with our luxury platform was strong, this growth was more than offset by sales decreases from brands that experienced extraordinary growth last year, units from existing brands that did not meet expectations, and increased points of distribution. In addition, sales of the Ulta Beauty collection were impacted by planned markdowns as we prepared to re-launch the brand this summer. Finally, the strength of our services business continued with high-single-digit comp growth in the quarter, driven by increases in hair treatment, specialty services including ear piercing, brow and makeup, and core salon cut and color services. For the quarter, gross margin decreased 80 basis points to 39.2% compared to 40% last year. This decrease was primarily due to lower merchandise margins and higher inventory shrink, which were partially offset by growth in other revenue. Merchandise margin declined during the quarter primarily due to increased promotions, adverse impact from brand mix and the lapping of benefits from price increases last year. Promotional activity in the quarter was higher than last year reflecting the expansion of our semiannual beauty event and incremental offers to drive traffic. Inventory shrink was higher in the quarter. Our investments in new fixtures and operating processes are reducing shrink in the fragrance category, but this improvement is being offset by higher shrink in other prestige categories. Moving to expenses, SG&A increased 8.8% to $666 million. Overall SG&A spend was better than planned due to disciplined expense management. As a percentage of sales, SG&A increased 120 basis points to 24.4% compared to 23.2% last year. In addition to the impact of lower top line growth, higher corporate overhead, store payroll and benefits and store expenses contributed to the deleverage in the quarter. Corporate overhead expense increased in the quarter primarily due to technology related strategic investments. The increase in store payroll and benefits was driven primarily by higher average wage rates, and the increase in store expenses was primarily due to IT investments and increased testers. Operating margin was 14.7% of sales compared to 16.8% of sales last year. Net interest income for the quarter was $6.9 million compared to $7.3 million last year. Lower average cash balances were partially offset by the benefit of higher average interest rates. The company's tax rate increased to 23.2% compared to 22.8% in the first quarter last year. The higher effective tax rate is primarily due to less benefit from income tax accounting for stock based compensation. For the quarter diluted GAAP earnings per share was $6.47 compared to $6.88 last year. Now moving to the balance sheet and capital allocation, we ended the quarter with $524.6 million in cash and cash equivalents. Total inventory increased 8.8% to $1.9 billion compared to $1.8 billion last year. In addition to the impact of 36 net new stores, the increase was primarily due to the inventory needed to support new brands in our new market fulfillment center in Greer, South Carolina. Capital expenditures were $91 million for the quarter, reflecting investments in merchandise, fixtures, new and existing stores and IT investments. Depreciation was $64.7 million compared to $57.9 million last year, primarily due to higher depreciation related to new stores and IT investments. In the first quarter, we returned $285.1 million of capital to our shareholders through the repurchase of 588,000 shares. At the end of the quarter, we had $1.8 billion remaining under our current $2 billion repurchase authorization. Now, turning to our outlook, we have updated our expectations for the full year to reflect our first quarter performance, the dynamic operating environment and the actions we are taking to draw to drive stronger top line growth. With this in mind, we currently expect net sales to be between $11.5 billion to $11.6 billion, with comp sales growth in the range of 2% to 3%. We continue to expect comp growth to be in the low single digit range in the first half of the year. We expect comp growth to accelerate in the second half of the year to be between 2% and 4%, reflecting the impact of our sales driving initiatives, our newness pipeline and decelerating growth in the second half of last year. We currently expect operating margin to be between 13.7% and 14% of net sales, primarily driven by SG&A deleverage as we protect sales driving investments, including marketing and store labor, complete many of the elements of our transformational agenda and operationalize investments made in 2023. We will also continue to maintain our financial discipline. For the full year we now expect SG&A growth to be in the mid-to-high single digit range, with growth in the low double digit range in the first half of the year and in the low-to-mid-single digit range in the second half of the year. We expect gross margin for the year to be down modestly as lower merchandise margin and deleverage of fixed costs are mostly offset by lower supply chain costs and other revenue growth. For modeling purposes, we anticipate growth margin will deleverage in the first half of the year, primarily driven by lower merchandise margin, deleverage of fixed costs due to lower sales and higher shrink partially offset by growth of other revenue. In the second half of the year we expect growth margin to be flat to up modestly as higher merchandise margin and lower supply chain costs offset deleverage of fixed costs. As a result, we now anticipate diluted EPS to be in the range of $25.20 to $26 per share. We expect diluted EPS to decline in the first half of the year and be flat to up modestly in the second half of the year, including the impact of the extra week in fiscal 2023, which was $181.9 million of net sales and $0.46 of diluted EPS. Finally, we continue to expect to repurchase $1 billion of Ultra Beauty stock this year, reflecting the strength of our cash flow and the confidence we have in our future. And now I'll turn the call back over to Dave. Dave?
Dave Kimbell: Before we begin the Q&A session, I'd like to recap our perspective on the first quarter and reiterate our confidence in our plans. Love for the Ulta Beauty brand is growing. Our member retention is strong and our teams are laser focused on delivering great guest experiences, while managing through an evolving environment. We are pleased with the progress we are making across key areas of our business and we are taking steps to drive stronger performance through strengthening our assortment, expanding our relevance, enhancing our digital experience, leveraging our world class loyalty program and evolving our promotional levers. We have a strong plan in place to navigate near-term pressures while continuing to invest in support of the long-term opportunity. I am confident in the power of our differentiated business model and our team's ability to execute with excellence against our priorities and deliver value for our shareholders. Ulta Beauty is a force in the beauty industry as we captured a large share of this dynamic category and I am as optimistic as ever about the future of our business. And now I'll turn the call over to our operator to moderate the Q&A session.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Simeon Siegel with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed.
Simeon Siegel: Thanks. Hey everyone, good afternoon. Dave, I guess maybe following up on that, I was just hoping you could elaborate a little bit more on the guidance change, perhaps to oversimplify it. And I apologize if this is an annoying question, but I guess are you comfortable that you're lowering it deep enough and now work towards the long-term margin rate? Just any help in terms of thinking how you're thinking about your margin target and the underlying opportunity would probably be helpful. Thank you, guys.
Dave Kimbell: Well, thanks, Simeon, for the question. I'll start with some overarching thoughts and then maybe, Paula, you can give some specifics on the operating margin outlook. I'd say broadly, we are confident in our outlook for the year. As we've assessed the landscape in which we're operating, we see the opportunities ahead of us. As I mentioned in the prepared remarks, there are a lot of positives across our business right now as we see strong engagement in our brand growth and brand love and awareness, strength in key parts and aspects of our business traffic continuing to be healthy in stores and online, newness working, new stores performing well. So we are confident in many of the key metrics of our business and then clear about our opportunity to address some of the areas that we've been more pressured. When we look at the comp outlook that we've updated for the year, which is obviously a key part of our overall model, we feel very clear and confident about that revised outlook here. We do see over the -- particularly in the second half of the year, our lap becomes a bit easier and so as we look at on a two-year stack, we feel very comfortable and confident in that. But I'd say more important, we are taking actions, as I described in the prepared remarks, to address where we have some potential to drive our business even more with more newness, strong marketing, enhanced digital capabilities as we take advantage of the new platform that we put in, and of course, leaning heavily on our loyalty program to take full advantage of our relaunch there. So we feel clear about what's ahead of us, confident in our comp. And then as that relates specifically to the margin outlook, Paula, do you want to give some more color on that?
Paula Oyibo: Sure. Thank you, Dave. Good afternoon, Simeon. What I would say is, as we think about our operating margin guide of 37 to 40 on the comp of 2% to 3%, we've shared that top line performance plays an important role in driving fixed cost leverage for us. And with the comps now below our long-term algo of 3% to 5% comps, we expect less leverage and have adjusted our operating margin expectations accordingly. One thing that I will also share is that in addition to the fixed cost deleverage on lower sales, we've embedded flexibility in our guidance to invest in sales levers like promo, marketing and store labor to strengthen our top line and defend share and so that also gives us confidence in the adjusted comp guide that Dave spoke about.
Simeon Siegel: Great. Thanks a lot. Guys, best of luck for the rest of the year.
Dave Kimbell: Thanks, Simeon.
Operator: Our next question is from Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.
Simeon Gutman: All right, that was a setup. Hi, everyone. So my question, Dave, talking about prestige and the increased shifting to channels, can you share if that's brands that are deciding to sell on different channels or you're just seeing the customer, I guess, moving over themselves and have we absorbed the worst of that? That's the first part. And then this is connected to the question, is it fair to think that merchandise -- is merchandise margins about 200 basis points above where we were around the pre-COVID time, and it feels like you have an appropriate mix now? You kind of see where the business is going in terms of the tradeoff between sales and gross margin, such that we're not going to retest those pre-COVID lows. Thank you.
Dave Kimbell: All right. Well yes, I'll talk about the overall competitive environment and what we're seeing in there, and then Paula can give you some more color on the merch margin and our outlook related to that. So to reiterate, as we look at the competitive environment, what we, as I mentioned in the remarks, this category has always been an attractive, and it's always been very competitive, given the growth potential, the connection it has with consumers, its margin profile. So we've long, for the entire 33-year history of this company, we've been competing in a very competitive environment. What's unique about what’s going on today, is the cumulative impact of the competitive intensity really driven by significant increase in distribution of prestige, both in store and online. And as consumers navigate that broader choice, they're making choices. We're confident in our ability to continue to engage, and that shows up in some of the results I highlighted, but it certainly is an impact. When we look at stores opening near our stores, we talked about this in the past, historically. We do see a short-term hit to a nearby store when a competitor opens up and we're able to recover and those stores comp at our enterprise level. What's unique about right now is the scale of it to have over 1,000 new locations within a short-term period. It's unprecedented in our history and probably in retail more broadly. So it means that we're navigating that and understanding consumer behavior as we go forward. But even with that, to highlight again some of the things that we see, our strengths even in this elevated competitive environment, holding share in total beauty for the quarter is a real positive as we gained in mass and we gained in prestige e-com, in our brand love, our brand awareness, our total loyalty members, our member retention, our traffic all up, all positive, all healthy, as we see strength with our consumer connection. So your question about our consumer, the fact that we gained 6% in total members, our retention is healthy, we're moving more members up into platinum and diamond and retention of those guests is very high and our brand love reached an all-time high. The connection to Ulta Beauty is strong and we're managing through this really again, unprecedented competitive environment. And all the things I talked about, our confidence in our model, our confidence in the health of this category, and our ability to adapt and adjust our strategies and initiatives, as I discussed, give us confidence both in delivering the updated guidance, but I'd say even more importantly, the future continues to be very bright for Ulta Beauty because we're well positioned with a strong share of the category, strong connection to consumers, and the ability to navigate and adjust our plans as necessary as we've been doing throughout the history of this company. Paula, do you want to talk then about merch margin?
Paula Oyibo: Sure, Dave. Simeon, I'll give a little color on merch margin. When we think about merch margin from a guidance perspective, we currently expect lower merchandise margin for the year due to the lower sales, increased promotional activity and category mix. We saw merchandise margin decline in Q1 generally for these similar reasons, increase in promo, adverse impacts from brand mix, and then we had a bit of lapping price increases from 2023. When we think about 2020 versus 2019, you are correct. As of last year, we were about 200 basis points of merch margin above 2019 levels. And really, what I would say is a lot of that benefit that we saw was coming from ongoing category performance improvement efforts by our merchandise team, category mix and promo efficiency. Now we are seeing that some of that merch margin is getting a bit pressured as we're seeing in Q1 and as reflected in our current guide.
Simeon Gutman: Okay, thank you. Good luck.
Operator: Our next question is from Kate McShane with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.
Kate McShane: Hi, good afternoon. Thanks for taking our question. We wanted to drill down a little bit more on the marketing spend that you're planning to increase for the year. We're just wondering, how much of an increase are we talking about? What are some of the tactics here? And are you building in a corresponding sales lift with the marketing spend? And then finally, just within that, did you elevate the marketing in the midst of Q1 and did that have any impact on the comp?
Dave Kimbell: Well, what I'd say is, as we look forward throughout the year to clarify, Paula mentioned in her remarks that we are protecting our investment in marketing, in store labor and other aspects that we know drive our business and that's reflected in our updated operating margin outlook and we'll continue to invest appropriately as we see opportunities to support growth, so all of that is reflected. The types of things we're doing are continuing to strengthen our connection with our guests. As I said, our unaided awareness and our brand love both increased meaningfully in Q1 after strong growth throughout 2023, we are on a good trajectory as it relates to connecting our guests. The fact that we're driving traffic in both to our stores and online, we're growing our connection to our app, our loyalty, engagement and retention is strong. Our marketing efforts are working. The point in my comments about us finding even better ways and stronger ways to connect is an always on focus for us and we see continued opportunity to drive greater connection through social, so that will be a big focus for us. I highlighted our growth in EMV, which is which we're pleased with, but we know we can do even more. It is the key driver of this category, the way so many consumers are learning and discovering and engaging in the category. So we will continue to have a focus there. And importantly, we're partnering with our brands to find ways to connect as their brands drive growth within our environment. So we're pleased with the efficiency of our spend. It is driving our results and we'll continue to optimize our spend and add appropriately throughout the year as we see opportunities and all of that is reflected both in our top line and our operating margin outlook.
Kate McShane: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from Chris Horvers with JPMorgan. Please proceed.
Chris Horvers: Thanks and good morning. So I'll also do a two pronged question here. So it seems like the 1.6% comp wasn't really different from your internal plan. And you had mentioned and you had expected improvement over the year on all the factors that you mentioned. So at the same time you lowered the back half. So can you just share with us, was it just you're being preemptive to maybe a hockey stick that you set up? And then can you also talk about, April ex-Easter, was that better than the 1.6% for the quarter ex-Easter shift and any commentary on how May is doing so far?
Dave Kimbell: All right, thanks Chris. Yes, let me take the first part, and again, I'll ask Paula to talk about most recent trends. Yes, 1.6% comp is and we talked about delivering comps in the first half of the year in the low single digits. The reason that we see the need to adjust our outlook for the year is the 1.6% is clearly, and we talked about this earlier in the quarter Chris, at the low end of that range of low single digits. We anticipate the pressures and dynamics that I've been talking about to continue into Q2. And so as we looked at the second half of the year, while we see upside potential through the activities that I mentioned in driving elevated efforts across many parts of our business, strong newness platform and an easier overlap, we do anticipate an increase in the second half of the year, but because of the first half landing at the low end of that range, we see, we felt it was appropriate to update our outlook for the whole year, anticipating some of the pressures, even with growth in the second half of the year, elevated growth in the second half of the year, those pressures continuing through throughout the year, so that all lands us in that updated outlook of 2% to 3%. As far as April and more recent outlook Paula, do you want to talk about that?
Paula Oyibo: Yes. Thank you. So, Chris, as it relates to the cadence for the quarter and our April exit rate for the quarter, March was the strongest period for a quarter. And it's for all the reasons you mentioned benefiting from the Easter timing as well as our expansion of our Q1 beauty event. Comps in April were positive, but did moderate from March as we expected, negatively impacted from the timing of the Easter shift. With regards to May and what we're seeing quarter-to-date, I won't comment on that specifically, but what I will share is that we expect Q2 comps to look very similar to the first quarter comp.
Chris Horvers: Got it. And then just one quick follow up. You did mention that you expect merchandise margin, I believe up in the back half of the year, but lower in the first half. So what drives the change in the merchandise margin dynamic? Thank you.
Paula Oyibo: Yes. Well, so we expect more pressure in the first half due to the promo and brand mix and that lapping effect of those price increases. And so when we think about the second half, we're not lapping the price increase benefits and we will be largely past the inventory markdowns associated with our rebranding of Ulta Beauty collection. We'll still have the brand mix and promo impact, but net-net, we're expecting the second half to be flat.
Operator: Our next question is from Mark Altschwager with Baird. Please proceed.
Mark Altschwager: Good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. I wanted to follow-up on the competitive backdrop, but maybe slightly different angles. So you've talked about the increased points of distribution, but at the same time, Ulta has been investing a lot in its loyalty program and its data analytics capabilities for years that I suspect can drive a lot of value for brand partners. So how is your value proposition for these brands evolving? And what gives you the confidence that you can remain a premier distribution point for established and emerging brands even as this competitive environment continues to evolve?
Dave Kimbell: Mark, that's a great question and we're very confident in that. We have worked hard over many years to build very strong relationships with our brand partners, both the largest brands in the category and a real dedicated effort in supporting emerging new smaller brands. And that is an area of high confidence that we'll continue to be connected and partnering with our brands. We are a very large part of the category across all segments; mass and prestige, makeup, hair care, skincare, fragrance, bath, wellness. We play a significant role. We have a unique proposition. Nobody does what Ulta Beauty does. Our stores and the experience we deliver is special and differentiated and our brands recognize that. They value the opportunity that they have in our stores and on our online to connect with now nearly 44 million loyalty members and the activation and capabilities we have to activate their strategies directly with the largest pool of beauty enthusiasts in the country. And we have long been a destination for growth and so many of our brands are driving growth and taking full advantage of that experience. So I am confident in our brand relationships as we work through some of the changes in the category. In my direct discussion with brands and our overall relationships, we are working together to continue to drive growth and strengthen our partnership, add new brands, as many of which I've highlighted, and drive our business forward in partnership with our brands and that will continue for sure.
Mark Altschwager: Thank you, Dave. Quick follow-up for Paula on inventory. As we look at the inventory growth versus the sales growth, the spread is, I think, wider there than we've seen in a bit and obviously you're adjusting your demand outlook for the back half of the year. Any pockets of aging inventory that could weigh on margins and anything incorporated there from a clearance markdown perspective in the second quarter? Thank you.
Paula Oyibo: No, real concern with regards to inventory. I guess for perspective, approximately 75% of that inventory growth in the quarter was attributable to our new brands and our new stores that were mainly due to opening at DC. We do expect that growth to normalize as we progress during the year. And I know we've shared this previously, but as you think about inventory, keep in mind that most of our inventory is current and largely what we consider core product, which means very little seasonal or at risk inventory. And as you mentioned, we do look for opportunities to invest in inventory to best position ourselves to capture future demand and so we are also doing that as well.
Operator: Our next question is from Oliver Chen with TD Cowen. Please proceed.
Oliver Chen: Hi, David and Paula. Regarding makeup being down mid-single digits and also thinking about the newness opportunity there, what's embedded with guidance for how that meaningful category may proceed? And we continue to see a lot of innovation at competitors such as Amazon, which is leveraging a lot of personalization as well as affiliates and community members. What are your thoughts in terms of how you'll remain competitive? And I know there has always been a lot of overlap with product that they sell and you sell as well. Thank you.
Dave Kimbell: Well, so first on makeup, it's the largest part. It continues to be the largest part of our business, about 44% of our business and we have a very large share of that category. And when we look at our business right now, we talked about some pressure on the prestige side. Many of the things that I've highlighted and the mass, the category slowed some as we were lapping a very strong Q1 and first half of last year. When I look out and embedded in our guidance is confidence on many parts of our makeup business and the ability to strengthen our performance in that. On the mass side, we see continued opportunities with several brands, including Elf has performed very well and has been an important partner for us. Exclusive partnership with Morphe. We've got key partnership with NYX, early lead on some of their innovation. We've got brands like Juvia's Place and about base that have demonstrated strong partnership and growth in our business. So we're confident in our ability to continue to evolve that. And on the prestige side, the newness that I've highlighted has contributed and while we've got more work to do there, Charlotte Tilbury is now in 600 stores and online and has contributed meaningfully to our business. We highlighted the continued expansion and performance of our luxury business. Brands like Wyn, the launch with Serena and we're expanding MAC into more doors. That is just rolling out really as we speak into more doors. And we've got a number of really exciting exclusive brands, brands like Live Tinted, Polite Society, Rabanne, Wyn, and others in the makeup space that are just an outstanding portfolio of emerging brands that we are confident will drive growth over time. So we will continue to drive makeup connection. We've got a very big makeup business and we've got clear plans to drive that going forward as far as other competitive environment in the digital space. The efforts that I talked about across our business apply both to in-store and online. One of the great things about our business is when we get our in-store guests shopping online, they increase their brand, love their brain connection, our share of wallet, their spend goes up two and a half times. And our efforts there and we gained share in the prestige e-com business in Q1, despite some of the other pressures that I talked about. So we see opportunity to continue to drive programs like communities and affiliates. We're doing a lot of that, drive more influencers, expand our assortment, and drive newness across the business. So competing both in-store and online is what we do, and we're focused on that and makeup as we are with all of our categories looking forward.
Oliver Chen: Thank you. Best regards.
Dave Kimbell: Thanks, Oliver.
Operator: Our next question is from Michael Binetti with Evercore ISI. Please proceed.
Michael Binetti: Hey guys, thanks for taking our question here. So Paula, I think the math for the rest of the year puts operating margin below 14%, just the rest of year on a comp range 2% to 4%. Not far from your long term guide. Can you speak to how we rebuild to the level back to the long-term 14% to 15% margin if the comp trend continues at the 2% to 4% type rate in the second half or the comment that you think you can hold share in a category that grows mid-single digits, is that supportive of 14% to 15% margins? And then I guess secondly, as you look at the higher markdowns in the marketplace today and think about the backdrop of some of the key brands and the expanding distribution you pointed to, are you seeing promotions more pronounced in the products and brands that have expanded their distribution the most? I'm curious if there's any link there.
Paula Oyibo: Okay, let me, I'll take the first question and then Dave will talk about what we're seeing from the social environment with the bank [ph]. So Michael, what we've shared is that the top line performance plays a really important role in our ability to drive fixed cost leverage and comps below our long-term algorithm really causes a challenge for us to be able to drive margins at that range above the 14% and 15%. You see that with how we've adjusted our guidance. So on a 2% or 3%, our low end has come down because of the effect of that difficulty of leveraging occupancy costs. What I would say is, from a long-term perspective, we're not sharing long term guidance on the call today, but we do have an Investor Day in October and we plan to share more about the opportunities ahead, how we're thinking about the next phase of growth, and of course how that impacts our financials.
Dave Kimbell: Yes. As far as promotional environment Michael, we came into the year with the assumption that the promotional environment would increase, but remain rational and we built in expectations that we would be able to continue to invest in core parts of our business going forward. What we're seeing now is largely that's holding true. We continue to plan for promotional levels to increase in 2023 because of the competitive nature of this business right now. But as we saw in the first quarter, and we anticipate through the rest of the year, we're not looking to an irrational level, I guess I'd say, of promotional. And we expect our promotional levels to be below 2019 levels for the year. And that's in large part due to our CRM capabilities, promotional efficiencies. As far as specifically about brands, I don't, we haven't really witnessed any specific trends, brands that are in this competitor or in a certain marketplace. It's a broad dynamic going on across the industry again, elevated but still below historical highs.
Kiley Rawlins: So, operator, I think we have time for one more question.
Operator: Our next question is from Krisztina Katai with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.
Krisztina Katai: Hi, good afternoon. Thanks for squeezing me in. So Dave, I wanted to follow-up on the call to action items. Maybe if you could talk a bit more about how these are helping with just the increased member retention you're seeing. What you can share on the promotional efficiencies of your different and point multiplier events that you have been working on to spend market share. And then secondly, just how do you view the composition of your brand portfolio currently? And I'm asking this in particular, just your legacy brands with some of them getting their own storefront at a competitor's website. Thank you.
Dave Kimbell: Well, let's see the actions that we're taking to drive our business. I've highlighted them and all of them come in. We came in into the year with a number of initiatives that we're continuing to drive and then we're finding ways to do even more newness being a big part of that. We're excited about our program. I highlighted many of the activities we talked about social and marketing efforts specifically around promotional program. And a few things I'd highlight is we're continuing to amplify and elevate our key tentpole events like our semiannual beauty event we held in Q1, our Spring Haul event. We've got an event coming up in the summer of this year and more throughout the rest of the year and certainly going into holiday. That is an effort that every year we continue to find ways to improve, elevate the connection and the relationship that we build with our guests through the power of these tentpole events. We complement that through a steady effort in promotional connection that's more targeted through the power of our loyalty program and the strength in the personalization efforts and we see that right now we're in the midst of a program. If you've seen in the market what we call member love, it's a three week program, each week highlighting a different category, this week focused on skin care. And what we see with that is a really differentiated way to connect with our guests again, add more value to our guests in a way that only Ulta Beauty can to leverage our personalization and differentiation capabilities, the strength of our loyalty program, and we're pleased with the results. So we'll continue to amplify the big efforts that we have throughout the year and complement that with targeted, efficient promotions that we have a lot of data to continue to optimize. As far as our brand portfolio, I'm really proud and pleased with the portfolio that we have. We've got the very best of beauty. We've got brands across all major categories, all price points from the biggest, most established, longest term brands in this category that continue to provide great performance and outlook for us. Brands like MAC and Clinique and Lancome, the Estee Lauder brand, newer brands like Cosmic from Kylie and Wyn from Serena. We've got the portfolio of emerging brands, large brands and strength in all key segments of the category. So I highlighted that the competitive environment continues to evolve and brands will adapt to that and take advantage of growth prospects where they see them. But to reiterate something I mentioned in a previous question, our brand relationships are incredibly strong. It's something that we value immensely and work hard to continue to develop. And so our brand CS as a place for growth they're experiencing, so many of them are experiencing that growth right now. And that's one of the many reasons that I am very confident in the future of Ulta Beauty. And we're very clear on our, what's ahead of us throughout 2024 and ready to continue to lead the category for the long-term.
Krisztina Katai: Okay, great. Thank you very much.
Dave Kimbell: Okay. So with that, let me wrap up today with just a couple of quick remarks. Our teams are working hard to deliver against our short-term objectives while also taking necessary steps to position Ulta Beauty for longer term profitable growth. And I want to thank our more than 50,000 Ulta Beauty associates across the country for all that they are doing. Again, I appreciate your interest in Ulta Beauty, and we look forward to speaking to you all again when we report, our results for the second quarter on August 29. I hope you all have a great evening. Thanks again for joining.
Operator: Thank you. This will conclude today’s conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time and thank you for your participation.

===== 2023 Q4  (2024-03-14 16:30:00) =====
Operator: Good afternoon, and welcome to Ulta Beauty's conference call to discuss results for the fourth quarter 2023 earnings results. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. 
 It is now my pleasure to introduce Ms. Kiley Rawlins, Vice President of Investor Relations. Ms. Rawlins, please proceed.

 Now I'll turn the call over to Dave. Dave? 
David Kimbell: Thank you, Kiley, and good afternoon, everyone. We appreciate your interest in Ulta Beauty. The Ulta Beauty team delivered strong performance again this quarter with sales, operating margin and EPS all exceeding our internal expectations. Our traffic trends remained healthy. Our brand awareness reached all-time highs, and we drove strong member growth and retention. 
 For the quarter, net sales increased 10.2% to $3.6 billion. Operating profit was 14.5% of sales, and diluted EPS was $8.08 per share. Comparable sales increased 2.5%, driven by high single-digit growth from digital channels. Store comp sales increased slightly as we lapped high-teen growth last year. 
 A thoughtfully curated assortment, engaging marketing strategies and new fulfillment and technology capabilities, enabled our teams to deliver mid-single-digit comp growth for the holiday period. Our holiday campaign this year centered around the gift is just the beginning, which underscored our belief in the power of beauty and Ulta Beauty. To support the campaign, we created relevant storytelling, which inspired authentic connection, leading to record breaking impressions, significant growth in share of voice and strong social engagement. 
 These successful marketing efforts complemented our engaging in-store messaging and events, which focused on bringing beautytainment to guests and building the basket. Compelling content, combined with successful promotional strategies, drove strong new member acquisition and reactivation while increasing shopper -- shopping frequency and retention. 
 From a market share perspective, we continue to outpace the growth of the mass market for the 14 weeks ended February 3, 2024, according to Circana data. Our marketing share -- our market share of prestige beauty was more challenged as we lapped strong share growth in 2022 and continue to face pressure from the expansion of beauty -- distribution points in prestige. While competitive intensity has increased, we remain confident our differentiated model and sales-driving strategies will support our ability to capture additional market share over the long term. 
 Turning to performance by category. Skincare was our fastest-growing category, delivering double-digit comp growth. Brands leading into relevant trends like BIOMA, Bubble and Good Molecules, which is exclusive to Ulta Beauty, delivered strong growth. Dermatologist-recommended brands also continue to appeal to consumers looking for efficacious products from trusted brands, fueling growth for La Roche-Posay, Dermalogica and Cetaphil. 
 The fragrance and bath category also delivered low double-digit comp growth again this quarter. Newness from Valentino, Burberry and Tree Hut and holiday gift sets from consumer favorites, YSL, Gucci and Billie Eilish contributed to strong performance. In addition, in January, we welcomed Sol de Janeiro, a Brazilian-inspired body care brand, to the Ulta Beauty family. Available in 700 stores and online, Sol de Janeiro has quickly become a guest favorite, driving growth in the category. 
 Comp sales for the makeup category decreased in the low single-digit range. Softness in prestige cosmetics was partially offset by growth in mass makeup. Lip layering and blush proliferation continue to resonate with beauty enthusiasts. And brands leaning into these trends, including e.l.f., NYX and exclusive brand Juvia's Place, delivered strong growth. While prestige makeup was challenged in totality as we lapped strong growth last year, luxury brands, Dior, NATASHA DENONA and Pat McGrath continue to engage guests. And HOURGLASS, Tarte and Lancôme saw success with compelling holiday offerings. 
 Finally, comp sales for the hair care category decreased in the mid-single-digit range, primarily due to a decline in hair tools and the lapping of strong brand launches in 2022. Products focused on silane and foundational routines drove growth for professional brands Redken, Kenra and Biolage, and interest in hair health and treatments drove increased guest engagement with OUAI, Mielle and Divi. Newer brands, including Shark Beauty and LolaVie also resonated with guests. 
 Our services businesses delivered high single-digit growth for this quarter, driven by an increase in transactions. In addition to core styling services, specialty offerings, including extensions, hair treatments, texture services and ear piercing, drove strong engagement with guests. 
 Turning now to the full year. Net sales for the year increased 9.8% to $11.2 billion. Comp sales increased 5.7%. Operating profit was 15% of sales. And diluted EPS increased 8.4% to a record $26.03 per share. 
 In addition to delivering strong financial results, we also made meaningful progress against our strategic priorities. Let me share highlights of advances made this year. Reflecting our efforts to drive growth through all things beauty, we strengthened our assortment with compelling newness and the expansion of strategic cross-category platforms. Using the consumer lens of how guests experience Ulta Beauty through all of our touch points, we estimate we maintained our share of the total U.S. beauty product industry. 
 We launched customer favorite brands, including Dior, Beautycounter and Sol de Janeiro, and introduced emerging and exclusive brands, including Half Magic and Polite Society. We launched Luxury at Ulta Beauty, a strategically curated luxury beauty experience, and we expanded our cross-category platforms. We ended the year with more than half of our brand portfolio certified in at least one Conscious Beauty pillar and continue to drive greater awareness and discovery through unique sample kits and greater marketing support. 
 We expanded our Black-owned or founded brands to 50 brands, and welcomed to the second cohort of BIPOC brands to our MUSE Accelerator program, a program designed to help early-stage BIPOC brands prepare for retail readiness. Additionally, we expanded the wellness shop to nearly all stores and refreshed the presentation to inspire and educate guests how to integrate wellness into their everyday lives. 
 Turning to our second strategic pillar, All In Your World, we improved the guest experience across all of our touch points. We enhanced our physical footprint, opening 33 new stores and renovating or relocating 25 stores. Our services business delivered double-digit comp growth for the year, increasing frequency with members who already engaged in services while also introducing new members to our offering. And we drove greater experiential shopping through more in-store events focused on engaging and educating the guest about new products, new techniques and the latest beauty trends. 
 We also delivered significant improvements in our digital store experience. We successfully transitioned key guest-facing and commerce elements to a new modern architecture, delivering a fresh guest experience across both ulta.com and our app and providing our teams with new tools to optimize the guest experience. These enhancements, combined with our efforts to drive omnichannel member penetration, resulted in high single-digit growth in e-commerce sales and a 30% increase in member utilization of our app. 
 To support stronger omnichannel experiences, we continue to improve our buy anywhere fill anywhere capabilities. We expanded same-day delivery to all stores and increased our ship-from-store capabilities to 450 stores. Between BOPIS, same-day delivery and ship-from-store, 37% of our digital orders this year were fulfilled by stores, up from 31% last year. 
 Finally, we strengthened our partnership with Target with the introduction of new brands and the opening of 155 additional Ulta Beauty at Target locations, ending the year with 510 shops. And we deepened guest engagement as reflected in growth of new member conversions, reengagement of labs guests and greater loyalty account linkage as well as increased bounce back to Ulta Beauty stores. 
 Moving to our third strategic pillar, expanding and deepening guest engagement and loyalty by operating at the heart of the beauty community. Our marketing strategies, media investments and brand-building efforts resulted in record level unaided awareness, brand love and loyalty. To drive awareness and spark deeper connection engagement, we launched the Joy Project, a multiyear brand equity initiative to make beauty and the world a more joyful place. 
 We expanded our social media engagement across multiple platforms with new trendsetting series and compelling content, which drove strong engagement, positive social sentiment and share of voice. And we achieved an important milestone. In December, we surpassed 1 million followers on TikTok, reinforcing our position as a social brand leader in beauty. 
 With improved member retention, strong new member acquisition and healthy reactivation of lapsed members, we expanded our loyalty program by 8%, ending the year with 43.3 million loyalty members who shopped more frequently and spent more with us on average. Leading into the power of our best-in-class loyalty program in January, we rebranded the program to Ulta Beauty Rewards, featuring a stronger birthday experience and a refreshed look in stores and online and across social to drive greater awareness and deepen connection with our members. We are excited to reward our members with even more of what they love and showcase how much we appreciate them. 
 Finally, UB Media, our retail media network, continued to deliver value. This year, we expanded the team, introduced new on-site products and launched an innovative omnichannel solution, which supports the measurement of campaigns across both digital and physical stores. 
 Our fourth strategic pillar is to drive operational excellence and optimization to enable us to capture additional market share, fund guest experience enhancements and deliver future profitable growth. 
 I am very proud of what our teams accomplished in fiscal 2023, which was an ambitious year of foundational transformation for Ulta Beauty. We completed the retrofit of our Greenwood distribution center, began the retrofit of our Dallas distribution center, opened our Greer market fulfillment center and began work on our Bolingbrook market fulfillment center. We successfully transitioned our Jacksonville, Greer and Chambersburg distribution facilities and key merchandising processes to our new enterprise resource planning platform. And we converted key merchandising and commerce elements of our digital store to a new architecture while maintaining digital operations. 
 We built a new enterprise data platform on Google Cloud infrastructure, establishing a modern ecosystem for future analytics and data-driven decision capabilities. And we completed our rollout of new POS systems, including mobile checkout in all stores. 
 Our teams enable our success, and we continue to invest and protect and cultivate our world-class culture and talent. This year, we introduced a new leadership competency model, redesigned our succession planning and talent review processes, expanded our associate development offering and completed enterprise-wide training to reinforce inclusivity and address unconscious bias. Associate retention improved across stores, distribution centers and our corporate team. And our 2023 culture survey results reinforce that our overall associate engagement remains strong. 
 Finally, we made progress against our sixth strategic pillar to expand our environmental and social impact. We continue to improve the energy efficiency of stores through LED lighting retrofits, HVAC retrofits and energy management system upgrades and established 2030 emissions reduction goals approved by the Science Based Targets initiative. 
 I am incredibly proud of what our teams accomplished in 2023. Our teams worked through unexpected challenges with agility and grace, and I'm grateful for their steadfast commitment to deliver value for all stakeholders while also enabling new capabilities for future growth. 
 As we look forward, we remain optimistic about the strength and resiliency of the beauty category. Over the last 3 years, the beauty category has experienced unprecedented growth. In 2024, we expect the category will remain healthy, but the growth will moderate to the mid-single-digit range, barring a major economic event. 
 Beauty is an attractive category, and competitive intensity continues to increase as channels blur and distribution expands. To protect and expand our leadership position, this year, we expect to advance our transformational agenda with the completion of key projects while also investing in core traffic and experienced drivers to strengthen engagement and enhance the guest experience. 
 Starting with our go-to-market strategic pillars, we will innovate, evolve and expand All Things Beauty to excite and engage the beauty enthusiast. To strengthen our differentiated position, we will continue to expand our assortment with compelling and relevant brand launches like Sol de Janeiro and Charlotte Tilbury while also building exclusive emerging brands in our pipeline yet to be announced. 
 In addition, this year, we will refresh Ulta Beauty Collection and position the brand as the cornerstone of our conscious beauty platform. And we will continue to enhance and amplify Luxury at Ulta Beauty and across category platforms. 
 Reflecting the importance of omnichannel engagement, we will invest in the guest experience across all of our touch points. We will further expand and enhance our physical footprint through additional new stores, remodels and relocations. In all stores, we will focus on enhancing the guest experience through friendly and helpful associates, fast and frictionless fulfillment and engaging services and events while also improving operational excellence through simplification, prioritization and optimizing our store teams. 
 We also plan to drive growth across digital platforms as we leverage new capabilities to amplify brand launches and events, drive greater digital discovery and conversion and expand personalization across our digital platforms. And we will expand and enhance our partnership with Target as we support new Ulta Beauty at Target shops, evolve the assortment and deepen member engagement through targeted loyalty strategies. 
 Operating at the heart of the beauty community, we intend to expand and deepen guest loyalty and engagement. To support long-term brand equity and drive deeper emotional connection with consumers, we will amplify the Joy Project with a continuous rhythm of engaging activations and drive community through an expanded creator network and affiliate program. We will support brand activations and events to drive new member acquisition while also leveraging our unique data insights to expand our targeting and member engagement. We will evolve our strategic promotional events to inspire and engage our beauty community, drive trips and encourage omnichannel engagement. And we plan to expand the impact and value of UB Media. 
 Turning now to our operational excellence and optimization efforts. In fiscal 2024, we plan to complete many of the foundational elements of our transformational agenda, including Project SOAR, Digital Store and the upgrade of our data management capabilities. We also plan to invest in a new martech stack to support our personalization, retail media and overall e-commerce efforts. 
 Our supply chain optimization journey will continue as our Bolingbrook market fulfillment center is completed, we continue to retrofit our Dallas distribution center, and we began the retrofit of our remaining full-service DCs in Chambersburg and Fresno. In addition, we intend to leverage our established continuous improvement capabilities to drive additional cost efficiencies with a priority on improving processes to reduce shrink. 
 To protect our culture and cultivate our talent while also enabling future business performance, we will continue to invest in our associates and team. We intend to focus on enrichments to the frontline associate experience, enhanced associate learning and development and deepen our DEI impact. 
 Turning to our final strategic pillar. We intend to stay focused on our environmental and social impact. Building on progress made in 2023, we plan to implement our road map to achieve our emission reduction goals. 
 Finally, I want to share an update on how we are approaching expansion opportunities outside the U.S. International expansion represents an incremental long-term opportunity for Ulta Beauty to extend our reach and leverage our differentiated value proposition. Today, we are excited to announce our planned market entry into Mexico. 
 The Mexican beauty market is sizable, growing and has significant beauty opportunity. Our research suggests there is a healthy awareness of the Ulta Beauty brand with local beauty enthusiasts, and we also see strong engagement in stores located in geographically adjacent markets. After extensive evaluation, we prioritized an asset-light partnership approach to enable us to move quickly. And I am excited to announce we have formed a joint venture with Axo, a highly experienced operator of global brands, to launch and operate Ulta Beauty in Mexico in 2025. 
 As a result of this partnership approach, we do not expect this venture to be material to our financials in fiscal 2024. For competitive reasons, we're not sharing more details today, but we'll provide updates as appropriate. 
 In closing, the Ulta Beauty team delivered strong financial performance in fiscal 2023 while also achieving meaningful progress against our strategic priorities. As we look to 2024, I remain excited about the opportunity to enhance our market leadership and drive profitable growth. We operate in a growing category with strong consumer engagement, and I am confident that our proven differentiated business model, strategic priorities and outstanding, passionate team will enable us to move beauty forward in ways that create values for our shareholders and have a positive impact on our guests, associates and the communities we serve. 
 Now as many of you know, this will be Scott's last earnings call. And I want to recognize and thank Scott for his many contributions to Ulta Beauty. He has been an exceptional partner to me and an inspirational leader for our entire team. 
 Now today, you will also hear from Paula Oyibo, who will become our CFO on April 1. Paula joined Ulta Beauty in 2019 and is a dynamic finance executive with broad industry experience. She understands our business and our guests, and I know she will have a strong impact on our business going forward. 
 And now I will turn the call over to Scott for a discussion of our financial results. Scott? 
Scott Settersten: Thanks, Dave, and good afternoon, everyone. I will review our fourth quarter financial results before turning it over to Paula Oyibo, who will walk through the outlook for fiscal 2024. 
 Financial results for the fourth quarter came in ahead of our expectations across the top and bottom line, reflecting strong holiday performance, growth in other revenue and healthy traffic trends as well as strong execution and focused expense management. Net sales for the quarter increased 10.2%, driven by 2.5% growth in comp sales, strong new store performance, a $25 million increase in other revenue as well as the impact of the 53rd week in fiscal 2023. Net sales for the 53rd week were $181.9 million. The growth in comp sales was driven by a 4.5% increase in transactions. 
 Average ticket declined 1.9%, driven by lower units per transaction, which were partially offset by higher average selling price. Reflecting a more normalized pricing environment, we estimate that product price increases contributed about 100 basis points to the overall comp increase. 
 Looking at the cadence of sales through the quarter, comp sales were solid in November and December, reflecting strong holiday performance. As expected, sales were more challenged in January as we lap the exceptional results from our strongest month in fiscal 2022. 
 During the quarter, we opened 13 new stores, relocated 2, remodeled 2 stores and closed 2 stores. For the quarter, gross margin increased 10 basis points to 37.7% of sales. The increase was driven by strong growth in other revenue, lower shipping rates and leverage of supply chain costs, which were largely offset by lower merchandise margin. Our efforts to grow other revenue continue to yield benefits with performance driven by increased credit card income, greater loyalty point redemptions and royalties earned through our Target partnership. 
 At the same time, we realized benefits from our supply chain optimization efforts as our carrier diversification strategy drove improved profitability. As anticipated, merchandise margin was pressured during the quarter, reflecting the lapping of benefits from price increases, increased promotionality as well as the impact from brand mix. These pressures were partially offset by ongoing category management efforts. The impact of promotional activity was above last year but continues to be well below 2019 levels. 
 Notably, shrink was flat during the quarter, slightly better than our expectations, reflecting the impact of our investments this year in training, labor and new fragrance fixtures. For the full year, shrink as a percentage of sales increased 40 basis points. 
 Moving to expenses. SG&A increased 7.6% to $820 million. Overall, SG&A spend was better than planned due to focused expense management and a shift in timing of certain strategic investments. As a percentage of sales, SG&A decreased 50 basis points to 23.1% compared to 23.6% last year, primarily due to lower incentive compensation and leverage of marketing expenses and store payroll and benefits, which was partially offset by deleverage of corporate overhead and store expenses. 
 Incentive compensation drove 40 basis points of leverage in the quarter, reflecting operational performance that was more in line with our internal targets compared to last year's significant outperformance. In addition to the impact of higher sales, marketing expense leverage was driven by the timing of advertising expenses, while store payroll and benefits leverage reflected fewer payroll hours per store, which more than offset ongoing wage rate pressures. 
 Offsetting these benefits, corporate overhead expense deleveraged during the quarter, primarily reflecting investments related to our strategic priorities, including Project SOAR, Digital Store and other IT capabilities and UB Media. For the full year, we invested $62 million of incremental spend to support our strategic initiatives, which was at the lower end of our expectations, reflecting the shift in timing of certain projects into 2024. 
 Finally, store expenses also deleveraged, driven by investments to support merchandising initiatives as well as ongoing inflationary pressures across the business. Operating margin was 14.5% of sales compared to 13.9% last year. The company's tax rate decreased to 24.2% compared to 24.6% in the fourth quarter last year. The lower effective tax rate is primarily due to benefits from a decrease in state income taxes. Diluted GAAP earnings per share increased 21% to $8.08 compared to $6.68 last year. The EPS impact of the 53rd week was $0.46. 
 To recap the full year, net sales increased 9.8% to $11.2 billion. Comp sales increased 5.7%, driven by a 7.4% increase in transactions and a 1.5% decrease in average ticket. We estimate that product price increases contributed about 200 basis points to the overall comp increase for the year. Operating profit was 15% of sales, with deleverage coming evenly from gross margin and SG&A. And diluted EPS increased 8.4% to a record $26.03 per share. 
 Moving on to the balance sheet and cash flow statement. Total inventory increased 8.6% to $1.7 billion compared to $1.6 billion last year. In addition to the impact of 30 net new stores, the increase reflects inventory to support new brand launches, the new market fulfillment center in Greer, South Carolina as well as the impact of product cost increases. 
 Our well-established business model continues to generate significant cash from operations, including nearly $1.5 billion in fiscal 2023. Our capital allocation approach remains consistent. Our first priority is to reinvest in our business to drive future growth, followed by returning excess cash to our shareholders. 
 In fiscal 2023, we invested $435 million in capital expenditures, including approximately $178 million for new stores, remodels and merchandise fixtures; $124 million for IT; $73 million for supply chain; and $60 million for store maintenance and other. Depreciation for the year was $244 million compared to $241 million last year and primarily reflects the ongoing shift of IT investments from capital to cloud expense. 
 During the fourth quarter, we repurchased 352,000 shares at a cost of $159 million, bringing total share repurchase to 1 billion for the full year. Since launching our stock buyback program in 2014, we've purchased more than 18 million shares at a weighted average price of $313, effectively returning $5.8 billion to shareholders while continuing to invest in strategic growth drivers. 
 Before I turn the call over to Paula, I want to take a moment to express my sincere gratitude to our teams for delivering these strong results for our shareholders this year and throughout my tenure with Ulta Beauty. It has been an honor to serve as the company's CFO and a privilege to lead and serve alongside such talented associates. I'm excited to pass the baton to Paula, who I know will be an excellent leader and steward of Ulta Beauty's business going forward. 
Paula Oyibo: Thank you, Scott. I am honored and humbled to be assuming the position of Chief Financial Officer at Ulta Beauty, and I am excited to lead our talented finance organization and to drive Ulta Beauty's next phase of growth. I want to thank Scott for his mentorship over the years and wish him all the best in his well-deserved retirement. I look forward to working with those on the call today and meeting those of you I have not yet met. 
 Before we talk about our expectations for fiscal 2024, I want to share 2 capital allocation update. First, yesterday, we amended our revolver agreement to $800 million and extended the term to 2029. Reflecting the current rate environment, we reduced the size of the revolver to lower the impact of higher fees but retain flexibility to upsize the capacity if needed. Second, having essentially completed the authorization announced in March 2022, today, we announced a new share repurchase authorization for $2 billion. 
 Now turning to our outlook for fiscal 2024. We expect net sales will be in the range of $11.7 billion to $11.8 billion with comp sales growth expected to be between 4% and 5%. We anticipate comp growth will be in the low single-digit range in the first half and then increase to mid-single-digit growth in the second half of the year. We expect operating margin will be between 14% and 14.3% of sales, primarily driven by SG&A deleverage as we complete many of the foundational elements of our transformational agenda and move to investments to enable growth, operationalize the investments made in 2023, manage ongoing wage pressures and support core traffic and experienced drivers. 
 In total, we expect SG&A growth for the year will moderate into the high single-digit range from 12.5% growth in fiscal 2023. We expect SG&A growth in the first half will be in the low double-digit range as we annualize investment spend in 2023 and complete key milestones of our transformational agenda and then slow to mid-single-digit growth in the second half. We expect gross margin for the year will be down modestly as lower merchandise margin and deleverage of supply chain costs are partially offset by other revenue. 
 Our assumptions result in a diluted earnings guidance in the range of $26.20 to $27 per share. We are planning EPS to decline in the first half and then accelerate to high single-digit growth in the second half of the year. For modeling purposes, we expect operating margin to be the most challenged in the first quarter with meaningful deleverage across SG&A and gross margins. 
 Finally, we plan to spend between $415 million and $490 million in CapEx, including approximately $270 million to $282 million for new stores, remodels and merchandise fixtures; $120 million to $155 million for supply chain and IT; and $45 million to $53 million for store maintenance and other. We expect depreciation for the year will be between $275 million and $280 million. 
 We believe the outlook for the beauty category is bright, and we are confident our strategic framework and strong financial foundation will enable us to drive long-term growth and shareholder returns. 
 Before we take your questions, I want to announce that we plan to host an investor event here in Chicago this fall to share our longer-term plans and outlook. We will share more of the logistical details later this summer. 
 And now I'll turn the call back over to our operator to moderate the Q&A. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Rupesh Parikh with Oppenheimer. 
Rupesh Parikh: Also, Scott, best wishes on retirement. So I wanted to start out just with the prestige cosmetics category. As you look towards this fiscal year, we're seeing a lot of newness in stores. You're moving past, I think, pretty difficult comparisons. So just curious if you guys expect to return to share gains within the prestige cosmetics category. 
David Kimbell: Rupesh, thanks for your question, and thanks for calling out, Scott, well deserved. Yes. I'll say on makeup, and I'll even speak a little bit more broadly across all our categories, we are focused on driving growth in every part of our business. Our makeup business in 2023, particularly in the second half, we saw healthy growth on the mass side and more challenges on the prestige side. So we have a strategy to drive performance within all parts of our makeup business. It is our largest segment and obviously important in the beauty category. 
 Our efforts are holistic. We've got a number of new brands that we believe will either already are or will add value to the category, including the launch of Charlotte Tilbury, which just rolled out recently, also exclusive brands like Half Magic and Polite Society, Rabanne, innovation from our existing big brands that we'll continue to see that have been so important to our business like Tarte and Benefit and Clinique and Lancôme on the prestige side. 
 Our luxury proposition really launched last year to -- with a lot of success. And as we continue to grow and build our presence in that space, we see that as a contributor. And then through our holistic efforts, we're going to try to find ways to lean into the important trends. Makeup is -- of course, has a key trend component. So whether it's blush, shade, proliferation, lip layering, matte makeup, nail is an important opportunity, we're going to continue to drive that. 
 And the last thing I'd say is we continue to revamp and elevate our events that play an important role in mass migration, the number of mass consumers that we've acquired over the years, continuing to introduce them to prestige for the first time. So we're focused on driving that business. We are confident over time that we'll be able to deliver the growth that we expect, and we're working hard to deliver across all parts of that business. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Korinne Wolfmeyer with Piper Sandler. 
Korinne Wolfmeyer: Congrats on the quarter. I'd like to touch a little bit on the decision to enter into Mexico. I mean previously, we've been talking about potentially going into Canada. Just would like to understand your thought process of going or doing Mexico versus Canada. And what kind of opportunity do you really see there over the longer term? 
David Kimbell: I'm just going to say we're really excited about this announcement and really, as I said in the prepared remarks, see Mexico as a great opportunity that's tailor-made for the Ulta Beauty experience. Kecia is leading this effort among many things that she does. So I'm going to ask Kecia to give some more color on it. 
Kecia Steelman: Yes, absolutely. Well, after careful evaluation of many market opportunities, we really felt like the Mexican market is the next step for Ulta Beauty for us to have this partnership with Axo. And we're really excited about this. I know that the future is going to be really bright in this partnership. We've spent a lot of time with their teams from a cultural perspective, also just even from the best-in-class performance with global partners that they've brought to the Mexico consumer -- the Mexican consumer. 
 Our border stores are performing really, really well. And I just think it's the next natural step for us as we continue to expand internationally. So we are really excited about this. Again, we are planning to be operational in 2025. The cost of this is built into the guidance in '24. So we don't feel like it's very material. But we're super excited and feel that Axo is the right partner for us to launch in this next new territory for us. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Ike Boruchow with Wells Fargo. 
Juliana Duque: This is Juliana on for Ike. I just wanted to ask in regards to thoughts on the beauty categories moving forward, particularly the balance of prestige and mass, and maybe in addition, how we can see that driving merchandise margin given the benefit that we've seen. 
David Kimbell: Well, for the overall category, as I mentioned in the remarks, we're fortunate to be in a category that continues to be healthy, that is highly connected to our consumers, a high level of engagement, that there's an emotional connection that's driving the category and has been for a very long time, and then certainly coming out of COVID, has been exceptionally strong. 
 All indicators, as we look at the consumer landscape, is a continued level of engagement. When we look into this year, though, of course, we are evaluating and anticipating and preparing for consumer behavior to continue to evolve. We know there's external pressures on the consumer. We know we're entering into a dynamic time with an election year. 
 And what we've seen in this category is strong growth, but as expected, some moderation in that growth. Still above historical trends but some moderation. Simply put, we think consumers, highly engaged in the category but still -- and still passionate about the category but will continue to be thoughtful in all of their spending. But fortunately, we know that beauty is an important one. 
 And as a reminder, Ulta Beauty is well positioned to manage through really any kind of economic disruption or challenge given our unique portfolio, all price points, all categories that allow us to meet our consumers' needs if there is a time that they feel more pressure or have other changes. But overall, category healthy. Paula, as it relates to any potential margin changes? 
Paula Oyibo: Yes. What I would say is our merchandise margin, I would remind, we are meaningfully higher and better, our merchandise margin since 2019. And really that has a lot to do with we are a much healthier business now, and we have -- our mix in our business between our categories as well as prestige and mass through category performance efforts over the years has really helped us be able to be flexible as the consumer shifts between various categories as well as between mass and prestige. And so we believe that our -- we're able to manage that dynamic. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Susan Anderson with Canaccord Genuity. 
Susan Anderson: I wanted to maybe ask about the store expansion. It looks like it picks up this year. I guess how should we think about timing throughout the year? And then also, should we expect these to be the full-size stores? Or are you going to roll out any of the smaller test stores that you've been looking at? And then also, just how do you think this helps to maybe win back some of the share from other competition? 
Paula Oyibo: Thanks, Susan. We are planning to open between 60 and 65 net new stores in fiscal 2024. That puts our growth between the 2-year period at 90 to 95, which is generally in line with the 100 that we had communicated. And so our thinking hasn't materially changed there. 
 We remain confident in our ability to open and operate between 1,500 and 1,700 traditional Ulta Beauty freestanding locations in the U.S. And we're optimistic the small format store prototype could give us an opportunity for additional growth, as does the partnership with Target and then similarly as we're excited about the additional opportunity with our international expansion into Mexico. Related to the small geographies, we are planning to open 10 small store formats in 2024. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Ashley Helgans with Jefferies. 
Ashley Helgans: So we just wanted to ask for an update on UB Media. Anything you can share about the number of brands that are currently on the platform, maybe demand for the platform? And then any color to help us model as UB starts to scale? 
David Kimbell: Yes. We're really pleased with the progress that we've made. As a reminder for those on the call, this really does represent a way for us to generate positive impact on our business by leveraging the first-party data and insights that we have in partnering with our brands. We're not sharing, we haven't shared and we don't plan to share specific on a number of brands or even specific financial impact at this time. 
 But what I will say is we're really pleased with the progress that we've made in 2023 and are confident that we'll continue to grow this part of the business. The network that we have offers advertising access via off-site display, video, social influencers as well as on-site sponsored products. Our on-site display inventory is one of the actually new core offerings that we activated just in 2023. 
 So we've got a full suite of ad inventory experiences, value-added services. And as I said, we're confident in its impact going forward. And the support, engagement, reaction from brands has been very positive. As you know, the advertising world continues to evolve. So the value that we can bring through first-party data with 43 million beauty enthusiasts is very meaningful. And we continue to work with our brand partners, and they have demonstrated to us that they see a positive return. And we're continuing to grow that business. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Olivia Tong with Raymond James. 
Olivia Tong Cheang: Congrats, Scott, and looking forward to working with you, Paula. I wanted to ask you a little bit about your thoughts on new product contribution this year because it does seem like certainly starting off with the momentum with Charlotte Tilbury and Sol de Janeiro. We did some store tours in New York recently, and the team is very energized around these brands. So was wondering if you could talk about contribution this year versus previous years and then helping us understand sort of -- I think you mentioned Sol de Janeiro that -- a portion of the doors. Maybe can you give the same statistics for Charlotte Tilbury? 
 And then on the margin, I would just love a little bit more detail in terms of what's driving the margin outlook to the 14% to 14.3% end of the longer-term range, whether there's anything, sort of higher investment or what have you that's sort of dragging that to that end of the range? 
David Kimbell: Okay. Thanks, Olivia. Yes, I'll talk about new product at our newness pipeline, and then Paula can pick up on your question around margins. So we're -- well, first, I'll say newness is always a critical part of our business and historically has been between 20% to 30% of our sales. And that's an important part of the category and one of the best things about the category. There is a large desire from our beauty enthusiast guests from our members to discover what's new and exciting across all of our categories. 
 And so we do have what I believe is a well-balanced portfolio of new brands between big, recognized brands like Charlotte Tilbury as well as a steady stream of emerging brands that are unique or exciting within the Ulta Beauty environment. And so we don't -- we're not going to give any specific numbers about newness this year versus last year. But I will give you a couple of highlights. 
 First, you mentioned Charlotte Tilbury. And just to reiterate, that is in 600 stores and online, and we're excited about that. It was one of the top requested brands from our members, and we're pleased to be partnering with them to bring a unique and powerful experience to life. Sol de Janeiro is in 700 stores and also online and also was highly requested and brings just a terrific experience in-store and online and has been very well received since we launched that in January. 
 But there's a whole range of products that we're going to continue to launch and bring to life. We do focus, as I said, on emerging brands. And while I'm not going to, for competitive reasons, share some in the pipeline that are ahead of us, I'd highlight some of the brands that we launched last year like LolaVie, Polite Society, Half Magic, a brand like Live Tinted, which has been with us for a little bit, important brands playing an exciting role in driving growth in various categories that we're excited about. And our luxury business that I talked about, we continue to add brands to that throughout the year and see growth. 
 So newness is important. We see -- we like the balance that we have. We're excited about the brands that we've launched so far, and I look forward to rolling out more partnerships and bringing newness across our portfolio throughout 2024. Paula, on the margin question? 
Paula Oyibo: Yes. So from an operating margin perspective, we shared 14% to 14.3% of sales. And that is mostly deleverage coming from SG&A as we complete many of our foundational elements of our transformation agenda and move to investments to enable growth as well as we operationalize the investments that we made to date and those go into one state. We also are managing ongoing wage pressures, which is assumed in the guidance. And we also will continue to support core traffic and experienced drivers. 
 And so as you think about SG&A growth for the year, it will moderate into the high single-digit range from the 12.5% growth we saw in fiscal 2023. And then we do expect gross margin to be down modestly as lower merchandise margin and deleverage from supply chain costs are partially offset by the growth we see and expect in other revenue. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Baker with D.A. Davidson. 
Michael Baker: Really just a follow-up on what you just said. The -- can you tell us where you are in this investment -- these foundational investments? I think you said $62 million in 2023, which was below plan, and shift some into 2024. So what should it be in 2024? And even working backwards, can you remind us what it was in '21 and 2022? It was sort of supposed to have a 3-year investment plan that is rolling off. It sounds like it's still rolling off and -- although there will be some lingering costs in 2024. So just trying to conceptualize what 2024 investments will look like versus 2023. 
Paula Oyibo: Yes, Michael, I'll start with some of the numbers and then turn it over to Kecia so she can give a little bit more flavor for where we are. So we had an incremental $55 million in 2022 related to our transformational strategic investments. We communicated $62 million incremental in 2023. As you think about 2024, we expect limited incremental investment as we complete the foundational elements of our transformational agenda. Think about Project SOAR, Digital Store and other IT projects. 
 But as I communicated, once we complete those particular systems, these upgraded systems roll into our core operations and become a part of our base, and there's run costs associated to that. So there is run cost associated with those foundational investments. We will continue to invest to enable growth as well as the other items that I mentioned regarding wage pressures and investing in traffic and experienced drivers. Kecia? 
Kecia Steelman: Yes. So in regards to like where we are on the investments and where we are in the projects for our ERP upgrade or what we're internally calling as Project SOAR, just this week, we completed our Dallas DC. And we have plans to wrap up Greenwood and Fresno and open up our new MFC in Bolingbrook, which is a relocation of the existing FFC in Romeoville before peak this year. Part of the ERP upgrade, we're also transitioning our store systems and our merchandising systems. And we have those plans to be completed before the second half, again prior to peak. 
 For supply chain in '24, we are continuing to invest in our automation capabilities. And I mentioned already the MFC in Bolingbrook hits on our supply chain lines and then also finishing out that retrofit in Dallas -- the Dallas DC. And then for the Digital Store of the Future, so our Digital Store platform, we expect that to be completed in the first half of 2024. And we're wrapping up all of our upgrades around our analytical tools and reporting capabilities. So bottom line, we continue to be on track and on our budget, and we are all in on wrapping these foundational enabling systems up this year. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Anthony Chukumba with Loop Capital Markets. 
Anthony Chukumba: Let me add my congratulations to Scott as well. It's been a pleasure working with you all these years. So my question was on the luxury brands. I guess just 2 parts to the same question, both pretty quick. First off, how did they perform relative to your expectations in 2024? And what are your expectations in terms of additional brand rollouts -- luxury brand rollouts in 20 -- sorry, in 2023? And then what are your expectations for additional luxury brand rollouts in 2024? 
David Kimbell: Great. Well, thanks for the question. And yes, luxury, as I said, was one of our -- one of many initiatives last year to drive engagement. And we're really pleased with establishing that more firmly with some of our existing partners, including Chanel, but Dior, NATASHA DENONA, Pat McGrath. And so we see strong performance, and we're really pleased with how our guests are engaging in that part of the business. 
 We had a lot of confidence going in because of existing relationships with brands like Chanel. And then by elevating and expanding it, it has really, we believe, met our guests' needs. And they're excited about it. And it further demonstrates our ability to deliver all things beauty from all price points, including luxury. 
 We're not sharing any specific launches of anything beyond what I've already shared today. More broadly, as I said, with newness, we have a steady stream of newness throughout the year, and we'll continue to innovate. Specifically within luxury, our focus is continuing to grow in partnership with the brands that we've launched and find new ways to expand those businesses and delight our guests with them. And we're really pleased and proud to have that experience in our stores. 
Kiley Rawlins: Operator, can we have the last question, please? 
Operator: Our final question comes from the line of Adrienne Yih with Barclays. 
Adrienne Yih-Tennant: Scott, congratulations. It's been great, and thanks for all the help over the years. This question is maybe for Dave or Kecia. Can you talk about the promotional environment that your guidance is under for 2024? Is it expected to sort of remain in maybe the first half and then abate or kind of preexist all year long and whether it was more from prestige? Are you concerned that there perhaps is a longer-term shift to mass or masstige from younger or more price-sensitive consumers? 
 And then Scott and Paula, just a quick one. In your 4% to 5% comp, what are you expecting in terms of any ASP increases this year? And what's the rationale behind the low single-digit to mid-single-digit comp in the back half? What's going to drive the acceleration? 
David Kimbell: So yes, just on the promotional environment, what -- I probably won't answer every one of your detailed questions because we're not going to break it out that way exactly. What I'll say more broadly is we're not expecting that the promotional environment is going to significantly intensify or become irrational. We are in a competitive environment. That's for sure. And we are focused on ensuring that we're delivering on our leadership position. 
 So as we look forward, we would anticipate and we have in our plans the ability to drive our business, which includes marketing, store labor, digital experiences and promotional activity as appropriate. But not an expectation more broadly for a significant step. And we do anticipate, as we saw in 2023, that it will still remain well below 2019 levels. 
 The mass to mass prestige question, we see opportunity across both parts of the business. Yes, consumers are engaged, and young consumers are engaged in mass, but they're also engaged in prestige. They're loving our luxury experience. So it's really not so much about price or promotion necessarily as what brand is really delivering great innovation, great marketing, engaging with them in social media. Those brands will win and -- regardless of the price points. Paula, do you want to give a little color on some of the 4% to 5%? 
Paula Oyibo: Sure. Adrienne, on your question with regards to expectation around ASP, what I would share is that we are planning for a more normalized pricing environment in 2024. 
David Kimbell: Great. Thank you, and thanks, everyone, for joining today. I'd like to close by thanking our 55,000 associates for delivering a strong 2023. Together, I know we will continue to unleash the unique power of beauty and keep moving our business forward in exciting ways. I'm optimistic about the future of Ulta Beauty and confident we will continue to create significant shareholder value. 
 I do want to take 1 second to thank Scott again. Scott, as I said, has been an amazing partner to all of us, and I so appreciate his impact and his leadership. And I want to thank those on the call that have the chance to thank him yourself. I know he loved spending time in all of our meetings and all of our earnings calls. It was -- I know he appreciated partnership with all of you, and I do want to thank Scott for everything you've done for our company. Thank you, Scott. 
 We look forward to speaking to all of you again when we report results for the first quarter of fiscal 2024 on May 30. Thank you again, and have a great night. 
Operator: This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.

===== 2023 Q3  (2023-11-30 16:30:00) =====
Operator: Good afternoon, and welcome to Ulta Beauty's Conference Call to discuss results for the third quarter of fiscal 2023. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.
 It is now my pleasure to introduce Ms. Kiley Rawlins, Vice President of Investor Relations. Ms. Rawlins, please proceed. 
Kiley Rawlins: Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us for a discussion of Ulta Beauty's results for the third quarter of fiscal 2023. Hosting our call today are Dave Kimbell, Chief Executive Officer; and Scott Settersten, Chief Financial Officer; Kecia Steelman, President and Chief Operating Officer, will join us for the Q&A session; Paula Oyibo, Senior Vice President of Finance, is also on the call with us today.

[Operator Instructions] As always, the IR team will be available for any follow-up questions after the call. 
 Now I'll turn the call over to Dave. Dave? 
David Kimbell: Thank you, Kiley, and good afternoon, everyone. We appreciate your interest in Ulta Beauty. I'll start today with comments about our CFO transition plans and then discuss our third quarter performance. Then Scott will review the financial results and our outlook. 
 Starting with the succession plans we announced this afternoon. After nearly 20 years with Ulta Beauty and more than a decade as CFO, Scott Settersten has shared with us his decision to retire, effective April 1, 2024. From his early days helping take Ulta Beauty public and throughout the last 10 years as CFO, Scott's impact on Ulta Beauty has been tremendous. He's been a passionate steward of our business, and the strong and constant shareholder returns achieved during his tenure are a testament to his leadership and disciplined approach to driving profitable growth. 
 I want to express my sincere gratitude to Scott for his partnership and his remarkable contributions to our business. He has been an exceptional partner to me and an inspirational leader for our team across the company. 
 With Scott's retirement, I'm very pleased to announce that Paula Oyibo will be our next Chief Financial Officer. Paula is a dynamic finance executive with broad industry experience, and I am confident she is the right leader for this next chapter of Ulta Beauty's growth. Since joining the company in 2019, she has established herself as a trusted partner and visionary leader. Her deep understanding of our business, experience leading large finance organizations and strong commitment to nurturing talent with an inclusive culture make her the ideal person to serve as Ulta Beauty's next CFO. Paula will be a great addition to our dynamic executive team, and I look forward to partnering with her as we continue our growth journey. 
 This announcement represents another great succession story for Ulta Beauty. I am grateful to Scott for being intentional and thoughtful in ensuring we have a seamless plan for this critical leadership role. And I am excited that Paula will bring her business-first mindset, influence and energy to the executive team. 
 Okay. Now let's talk about our third quarter performance. The Ulta Beauty team delivered strong performance again this quarter, with sales, gross profit and EPS all exceeding our internal expectations. Our traffic trends remain healthy. Our brand awareness and loyalty program reached all-time highs, and our transformational initiatives are on track. I want to thank all Ulta Beauty associates for maintaining their focus on creating great guest experiences and delivering these results while executing against our transformational agenda. 
 For the quarter, net sales increased 6.4% to $2.5 billion. Operating profit was 13.1% of sales and diluted EPS was $5.07 per share. Comparable sales increased 4.5%. 
 As discussed on prior calls, we expected the sales growth to moderate from the first half as we lapped 2 years of strong double-digit comp growth. Comp sales growth for the quarter was driven by approximately 10% growth from our digital channels. Stores delivered low single-digit comps as we lapped high-teen growth last year. Store traffic remained healthy, increasing in the high single-digit range. 
 Turning to performance by category. Skincare was again our fastest-growing category, driven by double-digit growth in mass and prestige segments. Beauty enthusiasts have maintained their skincare routines while also experimenting with new regimens. Consumer interest in moisturizers, serums and cleansers is driving growth, and brands leaning into these trends like Drunk Elephant, Good Molecules and COSRX contributed to our strong results. Dermatologist-recommended brands also continued to resonate, driving growth for brands like La Roche-Posay, Cetaphil and Dermalogica.
 The fragrance and bath category delivered low double-digit growth. Newness from Ariana Grande, Burberry and YSL contributed to the category's performance. Prestige brands Valentino and Carolina Herrera, and luxury brands CHANEL and Dior also drove meaningful growth.  
 Sales in the makeup category were flat, with mid-single-digit growth in mass makeup offsetting a modest decline in prestige makeup. New brands like Dior and Natasha Denona and Beautycounter, and existing brands with compelling newness and innovation, including e.l.f., Juvia's Place, MAC and OPI, all delivered growth during the quarter. While many mass brands continue to benefit from engaging newness and social engagement, our prestige makeup business was more challenged as we continue to lap the strong impact of last year's Fenty launch. 
 Finally, comp sales for the hair care category decreased in the low single-digit range, primarily driven by a decline in hair tools. Newer brands, including exclusive brand LolaVie and Shark Beauty and Donna's Recipe as well as newness from Not Your Mother's and [ Way ] delivered growth for the category. Trend-relevant products from Redken and Biolage resonated strongly with guests while social virality drove growth for IGK and Mielle. 
 Comparing to mass beauty dollar sales for the 13 weeks ended October 28, 2023, we continued to outpace the growth of the mass market according to Circana data. In prestige beauty, our share gains in skin care and fragrance were offset by softness in makeup and hair according to Circana. 
 From a channel perspective, we gained prestige beauty share across digital channels, but were more challenged in brick-and-mortar channels, reflecting the impact of increased distribution for prestige beauty. While these dynamics increased competitive intensity in the short term, we are confident our sales-driving strategies will support our ability to capture more market share over the long term.
 Our services business delivered high single-digit comp growth, primarily driven by engagement in core services, including haircuts, blowouts and makeup services. Ear piercing, one of our newer services, also performed well, and salon backbar takeovers, which give our stylists an opportunity to introduce brands to guests, continued to drive product attachment and new guest acquisition for participating brands. 
 Unlike other discretionary retail categories, the U.S. beauty category has consistently driven growth over time. Based on data from Euromonitor, in the 15 years prior to the pandemic, the U.S. beauty category grew in the low to mid-single-digit range every year except during the Great Recession, when the category experienced low single-digit declines, and in 2020, when the category declined 6%. In 2021 and 2022, the category experienced unprecedented double-digit growth as consumers recovered from the pandemic. And as we lap the strong growth this year, consumer spend has remained healthy. While we expect growth will continue to normalize to historic ranges, we remain confident the category will continue to grow, barring a macroeconomic event. 
 In addition to factors that have driven the category historically, including a strong emotional connection with consumers, newness and innovation, and societal changes, today, consumers are thinking differently about the role beauty can play in their wellness routine, which we believe will drive increased usage for the category. 
 As we think about the opportunity to expand our market leadership and drive long-term profitable growth, our strategic framework guides our priorities and focus. Let me share some highlights on the progress made this quarter. 
 Starting with our efforts to drive growth with an expanded definition of All Things Beauty. During the quarter, we enhanced our assortment with trend relevant brands in every category. In makeup, we introduced a luxury brand, Pat McGrath Labs, expanded our presence with MAC to nearly all stores, launched several exclusive and innovative brands, including Half Magic, Polite Society and Rabanne.
 In skin care, we launched PanOxyl, a dermatologist-recommended brand popular with Gen Z. In haircare, we launched Shark Beauty, an innovative brand of hair styling tools at accessible price points. And in fragrance, we launched Snif, an emerging brand offering gender-neutral scents available only at Ulta Beauty.
 Building on our long-term partnership with CHANEL and other luxury fragrance brands, we see an opportunity to expand our luxury offering into makeup and skincare. In Q1, we launched luxury at Ulta Beauty, and our member analytics confirms that our new luxury assortment is driving incrementality and increased spend per member. 
 In addition to strengthening our core assortment, we are leaning into broader trends in beauty through our cross-category platforms. We continue to expand our Conscious Beauty platform. At the end of the quarter, more than half of our brand portfolio was certified in at least one pillar, with 260 brands certified in more than one pillar. Newly-certified brands include COSRX, Loving Tan and Polite Society. 
 We also increased our portfolio of BIPOC brands, welcoming Pat McGrath Labs, CurlMix, Better World Fragrance House by Drake and Pound Cake to the portfolio. And we expanded our wellness assortment with the launch of at-home spa tools from LUV SCRUB, Solawave and Skin Gym. 
 In addition, we expanded the wellness shop to an additional 500 stores and refreshed the presentation with elevated aesthetics, improved navigation and more storytelling graphics to inspire and educate our guests how to connect to wellness in their everyday lives. Guests are moving effortlessly between physical and digital channels, and we are investing to enhance the guest experience across all touch points. 
 We have been on a multiyear digital transformation journey to upgrade our infrastructure and deliver a more engaging and seamless digital guest experience while also positioning future growth. In August, we completed a significant step in this process with the transition of our digital commerce experience, including cart [ emotions ], checkout and member account data to our new architecture.
 Overall, our team successfully executed these changes, and I am pleased to report our new digital experience performed very well over the high demand Thanksgiving weekend, including Cyber Monday. The modernization of our digital technology ecosystem is nearly complete, enabling us to elevate and optimize our existing guest experience while driving digital innovation, utilizing a modern, agile approach. 
 In addition to our digital platforms, we are also enhancing our in-store experiences. Our member data demonstrates that an excellent guest experience drives spend, increased frequency and creates lasting loyalty. This quarter, we launched a refreshed guest engagement model, which elevates the guest experience through authentic engagement, helpful experiences and friendly interactions to create a genuine human connection. While still early, we are encouraged by the improving trends in guest satisfaction scores.
 We continue to expand and enhance the Ulta Beauty at Target experience. We opened 89 Ulta Beauty at Target shops during the quarter, ending the quarter with 510 shops. This quarter, we were excited to launch Fenty Beauty, delighting our guests with a new way to shop this fan favorite brand.  Created exclusively for Ulta Beauty at Target, the Fenty Snackz assortment features a curated lineup of best-selling must-haves, minis, and unique sets. And just in time for holiday, we launched a curated assortment of Dyson hair tools in select stores and exclusive holiday sampler kits in all Ulta Beauty at Target shops. 
 Beauty is an emotionally-driven category, and we are investing to drive greater love, loyalty and connection with Ulta Beauty. We continue to strengthen the Ulta Beauty brand. Unaided brand awareness increased to a record level this quarter, with meaningful gains among Gen Z and millennial beauty consumers. We also expanded the connection guest field for Ulta Beauty as measured by significant growth in brand love. These gains reflect the impact of our strategic brand building efforts as well as our marketing actions to support key promotional events and brand launches. 
 At Ulta Beauty, our mission is to use the power of beauty to bring to light the possibilities that lie within each of us. Building on our commitment to make beauty a force for good, we've created The Joy Project, a multiyear initiative to make beauty and the world a more joyful place. We launched The Joy Project in September with an integrated campaign across national TV, PR, social media and our owned channels.  In addition, we created a training curriculum for transforming the way our associates think about self-confidence, and to give them tools to empower our guests to do the same. 
 In October, we expanded The Joy Project while reinforcing our role at the intersection of beauty and culture as the exclusive beauty partner for TikTok's first ever beauty month. Grounded in TikTok's theme of reclaimed joy, this month-long activation leveraged creator content and events, premium platform advertising placements and custom filters that allowed users to see their inner joy. 
 We continue to adjust our promotional strategies as the category normalizes and consumers navigate rising cost pressures. Responding to consumer needs and competitive shifts, we continue to evolve our key tentpole events like 21 Days of Beauty, while also deploying new offers with more relevant storytelling to drive sales and traffic. While our promotional activity increased this quarter, our targeting capabilities and promo optimization efforts enabled us to manage the financial impact. Notably, overall promotional levels remained meaningfully below 2019 levels. 
 Turning to our loyalty program. We ended the quarter with 42.2 million active members, 8% higher than last year, driven primarily by improving member retention and new member acquisition. Spend per member remains healthy, driven by greater shopper frequency. As we engage members with exclusive promotions, point accelerators and personalized content and recommendations, we are driving engagement spend and frequency. These targeted efforts are also enabling us to elevate more members to our Platinum and Diamond tiers. Compared to last year, the number of Platinum and Diamond members has increased more than 20%. 
 Turning now to our efforts to drive operational excellence and optimization. We are executing a multiyear transformation agenda intended to unlock new capabilities and efficiencies to fuel our growth. In addition to the digital store progress achieved this quarter, we continued to advance our road map in other key areas. We completed the retrofit of our Greenwood distribution center, began shipping to stores and fulfilling e-commerce orders from our new Greer market fulfillment center, and transitioned our Chambersburg distribution center to our new ERP platform.
 Our teams have delivered several major milestones this year, and we are on track to complete many of our transformational projects next year. We plan to complete the transition of our digital store in the first half of 2024, and we expect to complete the upgrade of our ERP platform and the expansion of our data management systems in the second half of 2024. 
 We will advance our supply chain optimization efforts next year with the continuation of our Dallas DC retrofit, as well as the conversion of our Romeoville, Illinois fast fulfillment center to a new market fulfillment center. 
 Finally, as the nation's leading specialty beauty retailer, we strive to be good stewards of our environment. Reflecting our commitment to leave a positive legacy, I am excited to share we have established emission reduction goals approved by the Science Based Targets initiative. Details of our commitments are available in the ESG section of our investor website. 
 Shifting now to our plans and expectations for holiday. The holiday is off to a good start, but we know the biggest selling weeks are still ahead of us. Our insights suggest that consumers are ready to celebrate even as they navigate in an uncertain economic environment. With our diverse assortments and convenient omnichannel touch points, we are well positioned to help our guests celebrate this season. 
 Our holiday campaign this year is "The gift is just the beginning," which underscores our belief in the power of beauty and Ulta Beauty. While a gift can be a signature fragrance or an innovative hair tool, beauty can also be the gift of self-care, fun and joy. Through this campaign, we're celebrating the moments that make the holiday special: family, friends, connections, joy and pairing them with the perfect gifts.
 Our merchants have thoughtfully created a holiday assortment of exclusive first-to-market items along with iconic classics. With products across mass, prestige and luxury, we offer guests both value-first and splurge-worthy items to help them find perfect budget-friendly gifts for others or themselves. 
 Our store teams are ready to bring the holiday to life for our guests. Our new POS system enables associates to easily order items not currently available in their store, and our new mobile POS tools provide guests with an elevated and faster checkout process. And with BOPIS and same-day delivery options in every store, it's never been easier or more convenient to shop at Ulta Beauty. Our teams have been working hard all year to ensure Ulta Beauty is ready to bring joy to our guests this holiday season, and I am proud of how well they are executing for our guests. 
 While the beauty category will likely be a bit more promotional this holiday season, I'm confident our marketing and assortment strategies combined with new capabilities will position us to deliver another successful holiday.
 In closing, the beauty category remains healthy and consumer engagement remains high. We remain confident in the resilience and power of beauty and in our ability to drive market share and profitable growth. 
 And now I will turn the call over to Scott for a discussion of the financial results. Scott? 
Scott Settersten: Thanks, Dave. Good afternoon, everyone. I want to echo Dave's sentiments and thank the Ulta Beauty team for delivering third quarter financial results that were ahead of our internal expectations. 
 Solid sales growth supported by strong guest traffic and new store sales performance helped to mitigate some of the unique margin pressures we faced in the third quarter and enabled us to deliver gross margin modestly ahead of plan. SG&A spend was in line with expectations, resulting in operating margin of 13.1%. 
 Turning to the P&L. Net sales for the quarter increased 6.4%, driven by 4.5% growth in comp sales, strong new store performance and solid growth in other revenue. Transactions for the quarter increased 5.9%, driven by healthy traffic across both channels. Average ticket decreased 1.4% as the decline in average units per transaction more than offset the impact of a higher average selling price. 
 While retail price increases remain a benefit to our comp performance, the overall environment continues to normalize, and we are seeing the extraordinary pricing benefits from last year continue to roll off. We estimate price increases contributed less than 200 basis points to the overall comp in the third quarter. 
 During the quarter, we opened 12 new stores and relocated 2 stores. In addition, we remodeled 11 stores. 
 Q3 gross margin decreased 130 basis points to 39.9% compared to 41.2% last year. The decrease was primarily driven by lower merchandise margin, higher inventory shrink and higher supply chain costs, which were partially offset by strong growth in other revenue. Overall merchandise margin was lower, primarily due to lapping the timing benefit of retail price changes last year as well as increased promotional activity this year. While promotional activity continues to normalize, the overall financial impact remains meaningfully below 2019 levels.
 Inventory shrink continued to be a headwind. Our efforts to address shrink appear to be stabilizing the impact, but the overall environment remains challenging. In addition to new fragrance fixtures, which have been installed in nearly 3/4 of the store fleet, we continue to invest in associate training, staffing and operational improvements to mitigate the impact of shrink. And we continue to work with our retail industry partners to influence macro changes aimed at improving the overall environment. 
 Supply chain costs were higher during the quarter, reflecting depreciation related to investments in our supply chain transformation, as well as the recent opening of our new market fulfillment center in South Carolina. These gross margin pressures were partially offset by strong growth in other revenue, primarily due to growth in both credit card income and royalty income from our Target partnership. 
 SG&A increased 10.8% to $661.4 million. As a percentage of sales, SG&A increased 110 basis points to 26.6% compared to 25.5% last year, primarily due to higher corporate overhead, greater store expenses, investments in store payroll and benefits as well as higher marketing expense, which more than offset lower incentive compensation. Corporate overhead expenses were higher in the quarter primarily due to investments related to our strategic priorities, including Project SOAR, Digital Store, other IT capabilities and UB Media. Year-to-date through the third quarter, we have invested about 75% of our planned $60 million to $70 million of incremental spend to support our strategic initiatives. 
 Store expenses were higher in the quarter, reflecting ongoing inflationary pressures across the business. The increase in store payroll and benefits was primarily due to the impact of planned investments in average wage rates. Higher marketing expenses in the quarter were largely driven by increased investments to drive member acquisition, loyalty and brand awareness across key channels, including social, video and streaming. 
 Lower incentive compensation was a benefit in the quarter, reflecting operational performance that is more in line with our internal targets compared to last year's significant outperformance. Operating income for the quarter declined 9.6% to $327.2 million. As a percentage of sales, operating margin decreased 240 basis points to 13.1% compared to 15.5% last year. Diluted earnings per share decreased 5.1% to $5.07 per share compared to $5.34 per share last year. 
 Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow statements. Total inventory increased 9.8% to $2.3 billion, compared to $2.1 billion last year. In addition to the impact of 31 additional stores, the increase reflects inventory to support higher demand and the stocking of our new market fulfillment center in South Carolina, as well as new brand launches and product cost increases. 
 Capital expenditures were $106 million for the quarter, reflecting investments in new and existing stores as well as supply chain and IT investments to support our transformational agenda. Depreciation was $61.4 million in the quarter compared to $58.5 million last year. We repurchased approximately 687,000 shares at a cost of $281.5 million. Year-to-date, we have repurchased 1.8 million shares at a cost of $840.5 million. 
 During the quarter, we drew on our revolving credit facility to support our ongoing capital allocation priorities, including share repurchases and capital expenditures during a period in the year when our working capital needs peak as we build inventory for holiday. I would note our recent activity does not reflect a change in our capital allocation philosophy, rather a lever to short -- support short-term cash needs. We ended the quarter with $195.4 million in short-term debt and $121.8 million in cash and cash equivalents. 
 Moving to our outlook. We are narrowing our sales and EPS guidance for fiscal 2023 to reflect our actual performance through the first 3 quarters of the year and our expectations for Q4. We expect net sales for the year will be between $11.1 billion and $11.15 billion, with comp sales growth between 5% and 5.5%. For the year, we continue to plan to open approximately 25 to 30 net new stores and remodel or relocate 20 to 30 stores. Our expectations for operating margin for the year remains unchanged at between 14.6% and 14.8% of sales, with deleverage to come from both gross margin and SG&A, with slightly more deleverage coming from SG&A. Reflecting these assumptions, we now expect diluted EPS for the year will be between $25.20 and $25.60. 
 We have refined our expectations for Q4 to reflect the expected resilience of the beauty category as well as potential risks from cautious consumer spending, increased points of distribution for prestige beauty and higher promotional activity. We continue to expect comp sales will be flat to up modestly for the fourth quarter. We still have several important weeks left in the holiday season and the operating environment continues to be dynamic. 
 In addition, we are lapping the exceptional results last year, including an incredibly strong January, which was our strongest monthly comp sales performance of fiscal 2022. For modeling purposes, we now expect gross margin to deleverage modestly and operating margin to be flat to down compared to last year. 
 One final update. We now expect to spend between $400 million and $425 million in CapEx in fiscal 2023, including approximately $180 million for supply chain and IT, $170 million for new stores, remodels and merchandise fixtures, and about $60 million for store maintenance and other. We expect depreciation for the year will be around $245 million. We now expect share repurchases to be approximately $950 million.
 Our teams delivered another solid quarter amidst a dynamic operating environment. As we look ahead, we are focused on delivering our plans for the holiday season and finalizing our plans for next year. We will share more about our expectations for fiscal 2024 when we report our year-end results. But we remain confident. We are well positioned to deliver performance in line with our financial targets of 3% to 5% comp sales growth and 14% to 15% operating margin, with EPS growth next year reflecting the lapping of an extra week in fiscal 2023. 
 Before I turn it over to our operator to moderate the Q&A, I want to take a moment to say thank you. It has been an honor and a privilege to serve as CFO for this special company for more than a decade. I look forward to passing the baton to Paula Oyibo, who I've worked with closely over the last several years. We will continue to work together over the coming months to ensure a smooth transition. Thank you again. 
 And now I'll turn the call back over to our operator to moderate the Q&A session. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Dana Telsey with Telsey Advisory Group. 
Dana Telsey: Congratulations on the nice results. And Scott, congratulations on such a wonderful tenure at Ulta, and looking forward to your next chapter. And Paula, congratulations on the new role.
 As all of you think about the beauty category, which obviously has such resiliency and your sales up around 6%, how do you feel on the category trends with makeup and what we see there as that evolves going into next year, product newness, pricing? How do you parse it together?
 And looking at the gross margin and SG&A levers, the lower merchandise margin that you had and the higher shrink, how do you see that evolving going forward? And what's changing in the promotional and pricing area? 
David Kimbell: Great. Well, thanks for those nice comments about Scott and Paula, and I appreciate that. And I'll start with some thoughts about the beauty category and makeup specifically, to answer your question there, and then maybe Scott can pick up on the gross margin. 
 As I mentioned in my comments, we remain very confident about the long-term future of the beauty category for all the reasons I highlighted, a steady stream of compelling newness, high level of engagement, emotional connection. The connection between wellness and beauty that's stronger than ever coming out of the pandemic give us confidence more broadly in beauty.
 And then makeup specifically is an important part of that. And while the makeup category for us was essentially flat for the quarter, we are confident in the future of that important part of our business. We see strong positive trends, a high level of engagement across all demographic groups. And as we get into both completing this fourth quarter and moving into next year, we're confident in what we'll drive driving our makeup business. 
 Some of the actions that we've taken specifically in make up to drive this business forward, continuing to launch several new exclusive makeup brands, brands like Half Magic, which was created by the Euphoria makeup artist; Polite Society, a prestige brand, exclusive again to Ulta, from the creators of Too Faced; Rabanne, which is a contemporary Spanish fashion brand, launching into cosmetics exclusively at Ulta. We're just getting started with those 3 exclusive brands at Ulta Beauty. We continue to see strength with MAC, and we've expanded that into nearly all doors. Strong growth on key mass brands like e.l.f. and with great compelling innovation within that segment of the makeup business.
 I talked in my remarks about luxury and we're -- while we've expanded that throughout the year, we feel like we're just getting started there. We launched -- expanded CHANEL, launched Dior and Natasha Denona this year, and then added Pat McGrath in the third quarter. 
 In new items with existing brands continue to make a difference in the category, and we're confident in what's ahead. A couple of recent examples: Tarte's Shape Tape Radiant Concealer, exclusive at Ulta Beauty; Juvia's Place blush liquid -- blushes, exclusive at Ulta; and newness from other existing brands like Clinique, Benefit, Anastasia, NYX, Maybelline, go down the list. 
 So we're confident. We're lapping the biggest launch we had, with Fenty from 2022. But as we look forward, we see as both the items that we've launched and more newness coming as we enter into 2024, we're confident and optimistic both in the consumer engagement in makeup and beauty in general and our specific strategies to drive growth. 
 Scott, do you want to talk about margins? 
Scott Settersten: Sure. Thanks, Dana. So I'll give you a little bit more maybe than you were thinking about when you initially put this question together because I'm sure it's on other investors' minds as well. 
 So thinking about '24 and beyond. And again, this is directional, in no particular order, but I kind of start with the headwinds. So supply chain transformation will continue to be a tougher compare for us as we think about next year as we continue to build out in and work through our distribution centers across the country.
 E-commerce mix, we've talked about. Again, it's been a bit of a benefit for us the last couple of years. We expect e-commerce to grow at a higher rate than brick-and-mortar next year and the years to come, and so that will be a headwind for us in gross margin. Again, we've got ways to mitigate that now that we didn't have back in 2019, namely BOPIS, ship from store and same-day delivery. 
 So those would be the headwinds. I'd say promotionality is something I call kind of a TBD. So again, 2023 has been a bit of a deleverage point for us because we're getting back into a more normal environment. It's yet to be seen on how 2024 will shake out. So that's something we'll have to navigate. 
 On the plus side, you mentioned a couple. Well, other revenue, #1 again. 2023, it's been a big tailwind for us. We would expect that to continue, although moderating a bit in '24. Cycling over price increases this year has been a major headwind to the business in the gross margin line. That will moderate as we get into -- deeper into 2024 and cycle through some of that.
 Shrink, we called out third quarter. We're gaining on it a little bit. Again, it's not mission accomplished by any stretch of the imagination, but we do feel like we've got tactics in place now that will help us get that better managed. UB Media, [ it's and ] as that business continues to scale up, we expect that to be a margin benefit for us. And then, of course, fixed cost, again, in the third quarter a bit of an anomaly with some of the repair and maintenance expenses that we absorb, but over the long term, we expect to be able to kind of leverage fixed store cost on a 3% to 5% comp. 
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Lorraine Hutchinson with Bank of America. 
Lorraine Maikis: You mentioned some brick-and-mortar share loss in prestige in the quarter. Can you talk about strategies, brand launches, marketing that you're working on to defend the share and return to growth? 
David Kimbell: Yes. Thanks for the question, Lorraine. Yes, yes, we -- it is our objective to gain share across all parts of our business, and we did -- we feel positive about that in many parts, including our mass business, our prestige skin care, our prestige fragrance business, our prestige e-commerce business. But brick-and-mortar was pressured, and we think that's largely due to expanded points of distribution. There are hundreds more brick-and-mortar locations in the market now than there were even just a couple of years ago. 
 And -- but what we see is more of a short-term impact from this competitive -- kind of the competitive pressure. Historically, as we've seen new locations open near our existing locations, there's a short-term modest impact. But relatively quickly, our stores are able to rebound and recover and to drive growth, share growth over time. 
 So largely, what we're seeing, and we're confident in the path ahead that our strategies, our holistic strategies and everything that we're doing across our assortment, across our brand engagement, our loyalty program, and then certainly, the human experience that we uniquely deliver in our stores give us a lot of confidence that while there's some short-term pressure year-over-year, we're still stronger in share than we were pre-pandemic, and we're confident in growth behind our strategies going forward. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Mark Altschwager with Baird. 
Mark Altschwager: Scott and Paula, congratulations to each of you. So for the Q4, you mentioned that you refined your outlook given some of the risk to consumer spending and endpoints of distribution. I guess but overall, you are raising the low end of your guide Q3 a bit better than your internal expectations. So maybe just give us a little bit more detail on how your views on category spending and the promotional backdrop have changed versus 3 months ago? 
David Kimbell: Yes. I would -- yes, so I'll start and let Scott give a little insight here. When we look at the promotional environment, maybe I'll start there, Mark. The -- as we highlighted in the third quarter, the promotional environment was higher in Q3 than a year ago, but still meaningfully below 2019 levels. So while we're seeing some increase, it's -- we don't see an irrational promotional market. We're definitely not back to 2019 levels. And we've been able to leverage our capabilities behind CRM and overall personalization to manage more effectively within our promotional intensity. 
 So with that backdrop, as we look into the fourth quarter, again, we're not expecting anything radically different than what we saw, a bit more promotional, not irrational to what we've essentially seen so far, not back to 2019 levels. 
 And when we look at our outlook, and I'll let Scott give a little bit more color, we really haven't changed our fourth quarter comp sales. As we've been talking for a while, we've seen -- we expected in the second half of this year for comp to moderate to low single digits. We were a bit ahead of that in the third quarter, and we're still confident in our outlook for the fourth quarter, and that gave us -- really our third quarter performance gave us the confidence to move up the bottom end of that range. 
 So as we look out, we're not anticipating any major disruptions from promotion. But Scott mentioned the biggest weeks of holiday are still ahead. So we're staying close to that. The consumer engagement, we're positive about, and that's reflected in our updated refined outlook going forward. 
Scott Settersten: And I would just reiterate what Dave said, our fourth quarter comp sales expectations have not changed, all right? We are giving ourselves a little bit wider range, I would say, on operating margin than you would probably expect to see at this stage of the year. But it is $1 billion above the last couple of quarters. So small changes in consumer reaction could have a bigger impact on our business. 
 So we're just being prudent, giving ourselves room to maneuver, I guess I would say, thinking about how we deliver overall great experience for the guests, both in the store and online. And again, we feel like we're really well positioned. We're off to a good start, but there's still a long way to go. 
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Michael Binetti with Evercore ISI. 
Michael Binetti: Scott, may I add my congrats. It's been great, the conversations over the years has been wonderful, and Paula, cannot wait to work with you.
 Dave, you reminded us how resilient the category is in the low to mid-single-digit growth over time. The comp [ you have ] for the fourth quarter allows comps to go as low as flat, so below the algo, below the industry rate. I know there's some unique hurdles that you pointed to. Is that really the only impediment to a normal return to normal comp? Is the hurdles a January effect that you pointed to?
 And then I'm also curious with SG&A growing double digits this quarter, Scott, you mentioned algo comp next year. Can you just kind of walk us through how to get to leverage on SG&A given the recent growth rate in the SG&A line? 
David Kimbell: Yes, I'll start with comp. But yes, I think you've said it well. We're again, when we look long term, very confident in the total growth of the category and our ability to gain share. That's certainly our objective all the time. As we look in the fourth quarter, it's a -- we are lapping a very strong fourth quarter last year. We anticipated this. We've been talking about a moderation in our comp trends all year long. And so far, it's played out essentially as we thought with some modest improvement, a little bit ahead of that, but that's how we anticipated.
 So when we look into the fourth quarter, what's reflected in our outlook is continued strong engagement, a successful holiday and healthy comps certainly on a 2-, 3-year basis, but we're lapping some strong performance last year as we get through this fourth quarter. 
Scott Settersten: And Michael, we're in the midst of a multiyear transformation on many fronts across the business that, again, we expect to deliver significant efficiencies and optimization opportunities for our business for many years to come. And so 2023 is an extraordinary investment year. A lot of it is coming through the SG&A line, again, the $60 million to $70 million on top of $50 million last year, again, we believe we're at or near the peak of that. Third quarter bore a large brunt of the burden for 2023. So we would expect SG&A growth to moderate in '24 and beyond.
 And -- but I would remind folks, again, when you're just calling out the SG&A line, we have said consistently we're willing to invest in SG&A as long as we can deliver operating margin leverage. So again, UB Media is a good example of that. It costs money, people cost, tool cost and things to ramp up there over time, but we get back in the gross margin line over the long term. So we're well positioned for the future and believe we're on the right track. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Oliver Chen with TD Cowen. 
Oliver Chen: David, Paula and Scott, it's been awesome to work with you. Congrats on everything you've done and the years ahead.
 As you think about stores and the store maximum potential, you've had really nice new store productivity and also pretty extraordinary e-commerce growth. What are you thinking about for smaller format and also as you continue to modernize the experience, how the stores should be laid out?
 And then second, on UB Media, a big part of the future is digital advertising. What's the path there in terms of what you're doing? It feels -- we believe that a lot of the brands do appreciate the data that you have and the cross-section you can offer them as well. 
David Kimbell: Yes. Thanks, Oliver. I'll start with stores. We continue to reiterate our outlook of 1,500 to 1,700 stores, and towards -- and we've said that we believe we'll be towards the high end of that range. That hasn't changed and we're confident in that. And that does not include our expansion in partnership with Target. And as I mentioned in the call, we're up to 510 of those locations.
 Our store-level earnings, our store profitability remains very healthy. We're very positive about the new store opening performance, and we're confident in the opportunity to continue to expand our presence.
 We have a couple of things that you highlighted. We've been testing and I'd say, expanding really a smaller format, which is a 5,000 square foot store that's really targeted towards smaller markets, more remote markets, and we're having good success there. We've updated our full store layout that we've expanded into -- I think it's maybe 80 stores now or so that all new stores and some remodels that have a new format that makes it more intuitive to shop the whole store. The categories are bundled together. The services are highlighted more. The brands are easier to engage in. And so we continue to invest in the experience and elevate how we're engaging with our guests. And we're very bullish on the stores, the performance and the outlook.
 On UB Media, we're pleased with our advancements. We've invested in that this year. We've had hundreds of brands participate, thousands of campaigns over the course of the year. We've expanded our team. And it's exactly what you said, the power of our data, the unique insights that we can bring because we have 42 million members and we have an assortment that spans all price points in all categories and all geographies and demographics, we've got a really powerful tool with our brands. We can bring value to our brands through that.
 And so I'd say we'll continue to see good results from that. And -- but I'd also say we're just getting started with a lot of opportunity, more to come as we look into the future. So we're putting -- we're accelerating that effort as well. 
Oliver Chen: Okay, David. Last on AI. You have QM Scientific and creative deals you've done, and you've also been active in augmented reality. Are there any highlights about how you see AI impacting the pre- and post-shopping experience and/or how you're utilizing it across the organization? 
David Kimbell: Yes. You're sneaking another question in, Oliver. On Scott's announcement day, too, right? So -- but yes, AI is an important part of our business. You mentioned QM Scientific, which we bought a few years ago, really is one step among many to increase the power of advanced analytics to more personalize our guest experience.
 And I'd say across the board, we're bringing that to life, more opportunity to go for sure, but with an ultimate objective of being able to better anticipate and understand our guest needs and desires and behaviors so we can better service them in store, online and through all of our touch points.
 And then we're using generative AI, we're really just getting started, but we see opportunities within Gen AI to streamline, accelerate and advance some of the experiences, things like our product descriptions, to automate some of that to make it more real time to speed up our innovation to leverage some of our creative processes. And behind the scenes with some data management and supply chain and other places. So we're excited about both what it's contributed so far, and it's a big focus for our organization to take full advantage and be a leader in that space as well. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Krisztina Katai with Deutsche Bank. 
Krisztina Katai: I'll add my congratulations to both Scott and Paula. But my question is to you, Dave. I was wondering if you could talk about member engagement. You said that Diamond and Platinum members increased 20%. So what are you seeing with some of these newer members versus your more mature cohorts? And what are some of the early reads that you can share from a personalization effort perspective, how those are helping the maturation of wallet share or member spending that essentially gives you confidence that you can continue to deliver on your compound goals? 
David Kimbell: Yes. Great question, Krisztina, because our loyalty program is so key to our business and to our success. And I tell you, I can't -- couldn't be more pleased and proud of the team's efforts to evolve and advance this program. 
 And what I say internally to our 53,000 associates is, every single one of us own and contribute to loyalty, both the acquisition of new members, but importantly, the engagement and delighting our members every single day, in-store, online and our guest services through our assortment, our advertising, our social media, every touch point we have. And so it is an always-on activity for us, it's top of mind every day for us to make sure that we are delighting our guests because we know that's the secret to our success and our long-term future.
 The big picture result of 8% growth of our loyalty program is evidence that that's working because the things that come together to drive that type of growth on a big number, a big number to start with is, first and foremost, retention. We wouldn't be growing it if we weren't retaining at a very high, very healthy, we believe, industry-leading level, and we continue to work to improve that every day with every member through our personalization.
 So the personalization efforts, I'd say, first and foremost, are ultimately about retention because if I can use personalization to provide more value to our guests, then they will be more likely to stay with us, to buy more with us and to be a long-term guest and move up into the Platinum and Diamond levels and all of that.
 We also saw nice results in new member, have never been a member of Ulta Beauty, and we continue to expand that, and that's through our new stores, our advertising, our partnership with Target, our digital presence, our social media. And we feel like while we've had a lot of scale, there are tens of millions of beauty enthusiasts that are not currently part of our program.
 And the third area is reactivation, where while we have very strong, healthy retention, we don't retain everybody. So there is a pool of guests that -- most of the time, it isn't because they had a bad experience. They just fell out of the habit of shopping at Ulta. And so we have a very personalized direct program to reengage and reactivate those lost guests, and that's been contributing to our growth.
 So across the board, we're pleased with the engagement. We're pleased with the spend per member. All metrics in that program continue to be encouraging to us and we see a long runway, and we're focused on it every day through innovation, hard work and just a commitment to guest experience to drive that for the long term. 
Kiley Rawlins: Operator, I think we have time for one more question. 
Operator: Sure. Our last question comes from the line of Michael Lasser with UBS. 
Michael Lasser: Best wishes to Scott and Paula. My question is, how long are you willing to absorb market share losses in the prestige beauty category before responding with an increase in promotional activity? And if we assume that those market share losses extend into 2024, how is that going to impact Ulta Beauty's ability to achieve its earnings algorithm next year? 
David Kimbell: Yes, Michael, I'd say that, first, I'd start by answering that question is, yes, our goal and our long-term history is to gain share. And our entire strategy across our assortment, our marketing, the loyalty program, our stores, our e-com, our digital tools, everything we do is designed to be a leader and to gain share and to drive our business forward. And in many parts of our business, we have been and continue to be doing that.
 Our prestige makeup and hair business have been more challenged. And that's really a reflection of expanded points of distribution, which I talked about hundreds of points of distribution in -- largely in those that are impacting disproportionately those categories and some other competitive pressures.
 In mass makeup, in mass skincare, in mass hair care, in prestige skincare, prestige fragrance, we are gaining share and have continued to do so. So our focus is to continue to do that, to take the healthy, strong share growing parts of our business and accelerate that, and to return the ones that have been a bit more challenged to growth, and we have got plans to do that. 
 I talked about makeup on an earlier question. And we, both through the newness that we've launched and more to come as we turn the calendar to 2024, the execution that we have in store, our focus online, we're confident that we will be able to drive that back. Same holds true in hair care. 
 Specifically around promo, honestly, we see it, Michael, as a balance. Where we feel good about our overall position, our overall growth, as I said, we're gaining share in many parts of our business, and so we're pinpointed in how we want to leverage our promotional intensity. We don't want to wildly swing back when we have confidence that it's not just promo that will return to share growth, it's the collective strategies and actions, the long-term efforts around assortment and execution that will drive share growth over time.
 And so we'll leverage promo in the short term. We have been, but as we've said earlier, we in no way have turned back to 2019, which is one indicator. We're not just going to swing wildly. We'll be thoughtful, strategic, and have clear actions and long-term actions that get us to sustained share growth. And I say that from a position of confidence given our track record of gaining share consistently for many years, and we're confident we'll be able to do that well into the future.
 All right. So thank you for that question, Michael, and thanks for all of you for your engagement. I want to close by thanking our more than 53,000 Ulta Beauty associates for delivering another strong quarter for our shareholders while also successfully executing against our strategic priority.
 And once again, I want to thank Scott for his partnership and tremendous impact on Ulta Beauty, and I want to congratulate Paula as I know she is going to be an outstanding CFO for our company.
 We wish you all a happy and healthy holiday season. I hope you get out and shop at Ulta Beauty often. And we look forward to speaking to you again when we report results for fiscal 2023 on March 14. Hope you have a good evening. 
Operator: And this concludes today's conference, and you may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.

===== 2023 Q2  (2023-08-24 16:30:00) =====
Operator: Good afternoon, and welcome to Ulta Beauty's conference call to discuss results for the second quarter of fiscal 2023.
 [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.
 It is now my pleasure to introduce Ms. Kiley Rawlins, Vice President of Investor Relations. Ms. Rawlins, you may proceed.

 [Operator Instructions] As always, the IR team will be available for any follow-up questions after the call.
 Now I'll turn the call over to Dave. Dave? 
David Kimbell: Thank you, Kiley, and good afternoon. We appreciate your interest in Ulta Beauty. The Ulta Beauty team delivered strong performance again this quarter with sales, gross profit and SG&A expenses all better than planned.
 Net sales increased 10.1% to $2.5 billion, and comparable sales increased 8%. Operating profit was 15.5% of sales and diluted EPS increased 5.6% to $6.02 per share. In  addition to delivering great financial results, our teams executed against our operational priorities. During the quarter, we drove growth across all major categories, increased the number of loyalty program members, strengthened our brand engagement and achieved important milestones within our multiyear transformation initiatives.
 Through the first half, our financial results are ahead of our internal expectations, and I remain confident we can deliver against our updated guidance for fiscal 2023. I want to express my sincere appreciation to all Ulta Beauty associates for their continued commitment to delivering great guest experiences while working collaboratively to execute our ambitious transformational agenda.
 Starting with the discussion of our operational results, we saw strong sales -- solid sales performance across both our store and digital channels, driven by double-digit traffic growth. All major categories delivered comp growth for the quarter, supported by strong engagement with the overall beauty category, compelling product newness and innovation and successful execution of cross-category promotional events, including our reimagined Big Summer Beauty Sale.
 Building on last year's promotional events, we consolidated key summer events like our popular Jumbo Love and Mix & Match Minis into a broader, more cohesive event with holistic storytelling and impactful messaging. The 3-week long Big Summer Beauty Sale drove market disruption, member conversion and strong sales across our hair care, makeup and skin care categories.
 Turning to performance by category. Skin care continues to be 1 of our strongest categories, even as we lap unprecedented growth during the pandemic. For the quarter, both Prestige and mass skin care delivered double-digit growth. Newer brands, including Bubble, BIOMA and Beautycounter and innovation from existing brands like The Ordinary, Drunk Elephant and Supergoop! contributed to the strong sales results. Reflecting consumer interest in dermatologist recommended brands, La Roche-Posay and CeraVe continued to perform well, and brands like Good Molecules, Hero Cosmetics and Peach Slices continue to benefit from social virality.
 The fragrance and bath category delivered double-digit comp growth again this quarter. Layering and wardrobing scents as a form of self-expression, especially among Gen Z consumers, continues to drive category engagement. Newness from Ariana Grande, Valentino and Burberry contributed to the category's performance, and key gift-giving events like Mother's Day and Father's Day drove growth for luxury brands like Carolina Herrera, Chanel and YSL.
 The hair care category delivered mid-single-digit comp growth driven by newness and guest engagement with our strategic events. Hair care focused on bonding, scalp treatments and other repair solutions as well as products that offer healthy heat styling options continue to drive consumer engagement. Trend-relevant products from professional brands, Redken, Biolage and Matrix as well as newness from prestige brands, [indiscernible] and IGK resonated strongly. New brands, including exclusive brands LolaVie, created by Jennifer Anderson, and Donna's Recipe also contributed to growth this quarter. While still challenged as we lap several years of strong growth, sales trends in hair tools improved from the first quarter, driven by compelling newness from Dyson and innovation from Bio Ionic.
 Finally, makeup delivered low single-digit comp growth, driven by strong performance in mass cosmetics. New brands like Dior, NATASHA DENONA and Beautycounter drove growth during the quarter, while new and exclusive products from a wide range of brands, including e.l.f, NYX and OPI also contributed positively. Compelling events, including our Big Summer Beauty Sale, National Lipstick Week and our foundation event as well as successful Barbie and Little Mermaid collaborations drove guest engagement. While the performance of mass cosmetics benefited from engaging newness in social content, our prestige makeup business was challenged as we lapped the significant impact of the Fenty launch last year.
 Our services business delivered double-digit comp growth again this quarter, primarily driven by increased appointments. Guests are engaging in core cut, color and blowout services as well as newer services, including extensions and scalp and hair treatments. We continue to enhance our service offering, and this quarter, we launched ear piercings chain-wide and introduced a new Keratin Express treatment.
 The beauty category growth remains healthy across both prestige and mass price tiers as consumers maintain their post-pandemic routines and expand their definition of beauty. When we look at the total beauty market, our analysis demonstrates we continue to gain market share. In mass beauty, we gained share this quarter across all major categories. In prestige, we continue to drive solid gains in skin and fragrance but saw pressure in makeup and hair based on Circana's beauty sales data.
 Our proprietary insights suggest consumers are becoming less focused on product pricing tiers and are trading around, choosing to engage with brands that offer on-trend newness and compelling social media content. As the only beauty retailer to offer a curated assortment of products from entry-level mass to luxury and everything in between, we are uniquely positioned to capture share of the total beauty market as consumers shift. We remain confident in the resilience of beauty. Our strategic framework guides our priorities and positions us to expand our market leadership and drive long-term profitable growth.
 Let me share some highlights of the progress we made against this framework in the second quarter. Starting with our efforts to drive growth with an expanded definition of All Things Beauty. Newness and innovation are critical growth drivers for beauty. Newness comes to life in the form of new brands, products and product lines, shade extensions and reformulations, and fuels discovery and drive trips and engagement. As we seek to continuously delight guests with all Things Beauty, we continue to expand our assortment and innovate -- with innovative and emerging brands.
 Building on newness introduced in the first half, we have several exciting launches planned for the third quarter, including Half Magic, a vegan and cruelty-free makeup brand created by Euphoria makeup artist Donni Davy, exclusive to Ulta Beauty. Polite Society, a prestige makeup brand exclusive to Ulta Beauty curated -- created by the founders of Too Faced Cosmetics. Rabanne, a contemporary and relevant Spanish fashion brand launching cosmetics exclusively at Ulta Beauty. Hair styling tools at accessible price points from Shark Beauty; PanOxyl, a dermatologist recommended brand popular with Gen Z; and Sniff, an emerging fragrance band offering gender neutral sense available only at Ulta Beauty.
 Reflecting the growth and popularity of luxury products with younger generations, last quarter, we launched Luxury at Ulta Beauty in 200 stores and on ulta.com. The program has exceeded our expectations, and we continue to see strong guest engagement with our offerings across all categories. Building on this success, we are excited to launch Pat McGrath Labs, a BIPOC luxe artistry makeup brand. Pat McGrath is a trusted expert who has shaped and disrupted the cosmetic category.
 Now, let me share an update on our key cross-category platforms, which lean into broader emerging trends in beauty, products that are good for the world, inclusivity and wellness. As we seek to provide guests with a diverse assortment that reflects their personal values and individual needs, we continue to expand our assortment of brands featuring clean, cruelty-free and vegan ingredients, leveraging sustainable packaging and driving positive impact through our Conscious Beauty platform.
 At the end of the quarter, 314 brands were certified in at least 1 pillar, with more than 270 brands certified in multiple pillars. To ensure all guests feel connected and reflected at Ulta Beauty, we continue our important efforts to drive inclusivity. In addition to amplifying our portfolio of BIPOC brands through informative marketing and in-store presentations, this quarter, we hosted a summit for our BIPOC brands, providing them with opportunities to network with peers while learning more about the beauty industry and operational best practices.
 Lastly, as the importance of beauty as a form of self-care and wellness continues to build, we enhanced the wellness shop assortment with the launch of 2 exciting supplements: Lemme Gummies created by Kourtney Kardashian, and the introduction of Big Brain Probiotics from Love Wellness.
 Turning now to our second strategic pillar, All In Your World, we are enhancing guest experiences across all of our touch points. Guests continue to shift effortlessly between physical and digital channels, depending on their individual needs, and we are committed to meeting them wherever they are in their beauty journey. Reflecting our efforts to enhance our buy anywhere fill anywhere capabilities, we have expanded our same-day delivery option to essentially every store and improved our store fulfillment process to drive greater efficiency and speed.
 Between BOPIS, same-day delivery and ship from store capabilities, 31% of our e-commerce sales and 39% of our digital orders were fulfilled by our store teams this quarter. Our consumer insights and member data confirm the importance of physical shopping in beauty. More than 75% of our members choose to transact with us only in stores, and yet we know many of these members use our digital platforms for discovery, try-on and inspiration. Converting these members to omnichannel members is a meaningful opportunity to increase engagement and spend per member as omnichannel shoppers spend 2.5x to 3x more than single channel shoppers.
 Importantly, the increase in spend is largely incremental.
 Expanded engagement with our mobile app is 1 way we are driving omnichannel conversion. Through our digital store refresh, we enhanced the user search and discovery experience, seamlessly blending commerce and content for a more personalized experience. We also continue to expand and enhance our digital try-on capabilities. This quarter, we launched a virtual try-on tool that enables guests to try multiple nail looks simultaneously, and we upgraded our virtual hair try-on experience with expanded color options and enhanced transfer quality and speed. These enhancements, combined with awareness campaigns, unique offers to drive utilization and increased associate education have delivered meaningful growth.
 Over the last 12 months, 9 million active members have engaged with our mobile app, double the number of members who engaged with the app before the pandemic. And we're seeing stronger engagement, with more than 55% of e-commerce sales coming through our mobile app.
 Turning to our partnership with Target. We opened 62 Ulta Beauty at Target shops during the quarter, ending the quarter with 421 shops. Our marketing teams work closely with our target partners to build awareness for newer brands, including Billie Eilish and Ariana Grande Fragrances, Glamnetic, and Living Proof, while also amplifying Summer prestige Must-Haves and minis. As the partnership scales, we are learning more about the Ulta Beauty at Target guests and the role this touchpoint plays in their beauty journey, and we will continue to leverage our expertise to develop unique assortments that reflect the preferences of the Ulta Beauty at Target guests.
 Moving to our third strategic pillar, operating at the Heart of the Beauty community, we are focused on driving greater love, loyalty and emotional connection with Ulta Beauty. We began this quarter with a Mother's Day campaign that highlighted exclusive cross-category gifts, including our luxury assortment and hero fragrances. Moving into June, we positioned Ulta Beauty as the destination for Summer Beauty, driving top-of-mind awareness and traffic with compelling points offers and special deals across the assortment to celebrate our members.
 Finally, we closed the quarter with our Big Summer Beauty Sale, a bold and disruptive event that offered opportunities to save on fan favorite beauty items across all categories and price points from a variety of established and emerging brands. These key events, paired with our culturally-relevant content amplifications drove record-level highs in unaided awareness with our greatest gains among Gen Z consumers.
 Turning to our loyalty program. We ended the quarter with 41.7 million active members, 9% higher than last year, driven by strong member acquisition and reactivation, combined with healthy retention of existing members. Spend per member also increased, driven by greater shopper frequency. The strength of our loyalty program continues to be a powerful and differentiated strategic asset for Ulta Beauty, and we are pleased with its elevated growth and performance.
 Our continued efforts to nurture the member life cycle is driving results. We accelerated new member acquisition and continue to engage and retain members with meaningful events, compelling points offers, personalized content and special guests. These strategies also delivered growth in our Diamond and Platinum tiers, which increased nearly 30% compared to the same period last year, reflecting strong loyalty and engagement with all Ulta Beauty offers.
 Turning now to our efforts to drive operational excellence and optimization. We are executing an ambitious multiyear road map of transformation initiatives intended to unlock new capabilities and efficiencies to fuel our future growth. As we have discussed on previous calls, we are expanding and optimizing our supply chain, upgrading our enterprise resource planning platform, transitioning our digital store to a new platform, enhancing our data management systems and upgrading store POS systems.
 I am pleased to share that our teams have delivered several key milestones. Our new Greer, South Carolina market fulfillment center began receiving inventory last month, and we expect to start shipping to stores next week. We completed the installation of a new automated storage and retrieval system in our Greenwood distribution center, which will increase capacity and enable greater productivity. We expanded our ship from store capabilities to an additional 276 stores. Today, we fulfill e-commerce orders from 400 strategically-located stores, enabling faster, more cost-effective delivery to the guest. We successfully transitioned 2 distribution centers, Jacksonville and Greer, to our new ERP platform.
 As part of our digital store transformation, we successfully completed a large-scale upgrade of our end-to-end e-commerce platform and migrated to a new modernized platform that includes a new promotion engine, guest account, cart and checkout. This is a significant milestone in our multiyear effort to elevate our digital experience in a way that positions us for long-term growth in this critical channel.
 Finally, we completed the POS upgrade in all stores. While our transformation agenda is not finished, we have made significant progress, and I am proud of how our teams have worked to execute our plans while limiting disruption to guests and associates.
 Looking forward, we continue to operate in a dynamic environment. While consumer confidence has strengthened, there are signs pointing to moderating growth going forward. Many consumers have begun to reduce overall spending, credit card debt remains high and the restart of student loan repayments is approaching. It is unclear how these factors will impact consumer behavior in the near term, but despite these factors, beauty has remained a bright spot.  
 Based on Circana beauty sales data, total U.S. beauty sales for the first half of 2023 increased double digits compared to the same period last year, with prestige beauty channels delivering higher growth than mass beauty channels. Looking to the rest of the year, we believe growth for the U.S. beauty market will remain healthy but normalize into the mid-single digits as we lap 2 years of strong growth, experienced less impact from pricing and face more economic uncertainty.
 As category growth normalizes, we continue to expect promotional activity within the category will also normalize. Over the last 2 years, unprecedented category growth and strong demand limited promotional activity. As a result, the promotional environment in 2021 and 2022 was unsustainably low. Reflecting these factors, we planned for higher promotional activity this year but continue to expect promotions will remain well below 2019 levels.
 In closing, we operate in an attractive and growing category. We have a strong, proven business model and a winning culture and outstanding teams. Through the first half of fiscal 2023, we have exceeded our internal financial expectations, and we remain confident we can deliver our updated expectations for the rest of the year.
 And now, I will turn the call over to Scott for a discussion of the financial results. Scott? 
Scott Settersten: Thanks, Dave, and good afternoon, everyone. As Dave shared, we delivered second quarter financial results that were ahead of our expectations. Strong sales growth supported by healthy guest engagement and strong in-store sales performance drove better-than-expected gross margin. SG&A spend was also lower than planned, resulting in an operating margin of 15.5%. 
 Turning to the P&L. Net sales for the quarter increased 10.1%, driven by 8% growth in comp sales, strong new store performance and solid growth in other revenues. Transactions for the quarter increased 9%, primarily, driven by healthy traffic on both channels. Average ticket decreased 1% as the decline in average units per transaction more than offset the impact of higher average selling price. The increase in average selling price was primarily driven by the impact of retail price increases, many of which were executed last year. We estimate price increases contributed about 300 basis points to the overall comp.
 During the quarter, we opened 3 new stores and relocated 2 stores. In addition, we remodeled 3 stores. Second quarter gross margin decreased 110 basis points to 39.3% compared to 40.4% last year. The decrease was driven by lower merchandise margin, an increase in inventory shrink and higher supply chain costs. Overall merchandise margin was lower due primarily to increased promotional activity, unfavorable category mix and less benefit from the timing of retail price changes. While promotional activity continues to normalize, it is important to note that overall promotions remain well below 2019 levels.
 Inventory shrink continued to be a headwind this quarter. Our efforts to address shrink are having an impact, but the overall environment remains challenging. Today, we have the new fragrance fixtures in more than 50% of our stores and expect to have these installed in 70% of the fleet by year-end. We remain focused on taking action in areas we can control, including continued investment in fixtures, associate training, staffing as well as operational improvements, and leveraging our influence to enact broader changes that will disincentivize unlawful behavior.
 Supply chain costs were higher, primarily driven by ongoing investments in our supply chain transformation as we made progress on the retrofit of our Dallas and Greenwood distribution centers and prepared to open our new market fulfillment center in Greer, South Carolina. These gross margin pressures were partially offset by strong growth in other revenue and leverage of store fixed costs due to top line sales growth.
 SG&A increased 12.4% to $600.7 million. SG&A increased 40 basis points to 23.7% compared to 23.3% last year. The increase in SG&A as a percentage of sales was driven by deleverage of corporate overhead due to strategic investments, planned increases in store payroll and benefits and higher store expenses, which more than offset lower incentive compensation. Corporate overhead expense deleveraged in the quarter primarily due to investments related to our strategic priorities, including Project SOAR, other IT capabilities and UB Media.
 Year-to-date through the second quarter, we have invested a little less than half of our planned $60 million to $70 million of incremental spend to support our strategic initiatives. The increase in store payroll and benefits was primarily due to the impact of planned growth in average wage rates and increased staffing levels compared to the same period last year. Incentive compensation was a tailwind in the quarter, reflecting operational performance that is more in line with our internal targets compared to last year's significant outperformance.
 Operating income for the quarter was $391.6 million, flat to last year. As a percentage of sales, operating margin decreased 150 basis points to 15.5% compared to 17% last year. Diluted GAAP earnings per share increased 5.6% to $6.02 per share compared to $5.70 per share last year.
 Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow statement. Total inventory increased 9% to $1.82 billion compared to $1.67 billion last year, in addition to the impact of 37 additional stores, the increase reflects inventory to support higher demand, increases in product costs and new brand launches.
 Capital expenditures were $95 million for the quarter compared to $49.4 million last year. The increase in capital expenditures was primarily related to investments in IT and supply chain to support our transformational agenda as well as merchandising investments to support the rollout of our luxury assortment and brand expansions.
 Depreciation was $61.9 million in the quarter compared to $60.9 million last year. We ended the quarter with $388.6 million in cash and cash equivalents.
 During the quarter, we repurchased approximately 594,000 shares at a cost of $275.5 million. Year-to-date, we have repurchased 1.1 million shares at a cost of $559 million. At the end of the second quarter, we had $541 million remaining under our current $2 billion repurchase authorization.
 Moving to our outlook. We are updating our guidance for fiscal 2023 to reflect our better-than-expected second quarter performance. We have raised our top line expectations and now project net sales will be between $11.05 million and $11.15 billion, with comp sales growth between 4.5% and 5.5%. 
 Our updated outlook reflects our strong first half performance while continuing to consider risks and uncertainties that could impact demand in the second half of the year, including rising consumer debt levels and the expected resumption of student loan repayments. We continue to expect comps will moderate to the low single digits in the second half of the year, and we remain on track to open 25 to 30 new stores and renovate or relocate 20 to 30 stores this year.
 Reflecting our year-to-date performance, we've raised the low end of the range of operating margin and now expect operating margins for the year will be between 14.6% and 14.8% of sales, with deleverage to come fairly evenly from both gross margin and SG&A. Our expectations reflect the continuation of the trends we experienced through the first half of the year around shrink, promotional activity and supply chain costs as well as greater headwind from lapping the merchandise margin benefits from the timing of retail price increases last year.
 For modeling purposes, we expect third quarter operating margin will be meaningfully more pressured than what we saw in the second quarter as we lap greater pricing benefits in the third quarter last year as well as a shift of investment spending from Q2 to Q3. As a result, we expect earnings per share for the third quarter will be lower than last year.
 Reflecting these updated assumptions, we now expect diluted earnings per share for the year will be between $25.10 and $25.60. As a reminder, fiscal 2023 is a 53-week year. We anticipate the additional week will add between $165 million to $175 million in sales and approximately $0.40 of earnings per share. In closing, our results through the first 6 months of fiscal 2023 highlights the ongoing power and resilience of our business model.
 I'd like to thank our associates for their dedication and commitment to keeping our guests at the center of all we do and giving them more reasons to shop Ulta Beauty. As we look to the future, we are focused on capitalizing on the growth opportunities in the beauty category and executing our strategic framework to deliver long-term sustainable growth for all our stakeholders.
 And now, I'll turn the call back over to our operator to moderate the Q&A session. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Ashley Helgans with Jefferies. 
Ashley Helgans: To start, maybe any details you can share on how traffic progressed throughout the quarter and what you're seeing now in August? And then also on the fragrances being locked up, have you seen any adverse effects on sales? 
David Kimbell: Yes. Ashley, for the quarter, we saw strong traffic throughout the quarter with double-digit traffic. And we continue to be pleased with the engagement that we're seeing, and we saw actual comp performance sequentially accelerate through the quarter as well. And all of those trends are reflected into our updated and elevated guidance for the full year. 
 On fragrance, the -- I'll let Kecia kind of discuss what we're doing in fragrance and how that's impacting our business. 
Kecia Steelman: Yes. Actually, we've locked up about 50% of our stores right now. And what we're seeing is in the initial stores that we rolled out the locked fragrance cases for, we actually saw sales improvement because we were in stock with the product and we had it available to the guests. So we're staying very close to that. We're also investing in labor because we don't want to be sales preventative from the guests being able to purchase. So that's a little bit of the investment in labor that you heard earlier from Scott, is that in these stores, we are upping our labor a bit because we want to make sure that we're able to take care of the guests. 
 So we're staying close to it. The bottom line is that we're pleased that we're able to maintain our in-stock for our guests, and quite frankly, keep the bad actors [ out ] from coming into our stores. 
Operator: Our next question is from Michael Baker with D.A. Davidson. 
Michael Baker: I'm just curious, you said you expect the beauty industry to grow mid-single digits, yet you're only expecting comps to be up low single digits. And even if you add in store growth, you're still expecting to grow maybe up, but seemingly below the industry. I don't suppose you guys think you're losing share, so I'm just wondering if you can help flesh that out a little bit? 
David Kimbell: Yes, I'd say, yes, we do anticipate continuing to gain share. We've done so through the first half of the year, and that is our outlook. The commentary is really as we look into the second half of the year, we see some strength. Engagement continues to be high. Certainly, our business is performing very well. We're attracting new members. We're growing across all key categories, both -- and then in both e-com and stores. But we also see some uncertainty as we get in later into the year.
 So while we're confident in the category, we're just incorporating into our outlook some full -- some of that. And for the full year, we're looking at revenue in the plus 8% to 9% range, so we anticipate gaining share for the year being ahead of the total category growth. That's -- that will be our plan. 
Operator: Our next question is from Olivia Tong with Raymond James. 
Olivia Tong Cheang: My first question is around prestige versus mass breakout, because you mentioned in skin that you're still seeing strong growth in both prestige and mass. But only in mass for makeup, but you mentioned that the launch of Fenty a year ago was a big contributor. So if you exclude that, are you seeing anything different there? And then going forward, as you think about your expectations on growth in mass versus prestige, what implications may that have on comp, in your view? 
David Kimbell: What was the last part of that question? What was -- could you repeat the last... 
Olivia Tong Cheang: Yes. Just the implication on comp, if -- what you're thinking in terms of growth of mass versus prestige across  your stores? And what implications that might have in terms of comp if mass becomes a bigger piece of the driver of growth? 
David Kimbell: Well, yes, we -- as I discussed, we've seen strong performance really across our entire assortment as we look at it, but mass has been a bit stronger for a couple of quarters now in -- across our business. And that's driven largely by strong consumer engagement across some key brands in makeup, health, NYX and some others are really hitting the market with great innovation, great marketing, great consumer engagement. And the fact that we offer the full assortment from mass to prestige is a real benefit. We're able to capitalize on strong trends and strong engagements across all aspects of that. 
 In skin care, we're seeing brands, particularly in the dermatologist recommended area driving strong growth, and that's great, we -- strong player for us. As we look forward, it's always our intent to continue to adapt and adjust and lean into the areas that are driving growth, find ways to strengthen those that may be more challenged, but we're confident in the outlook going forward. And the fact that we have both is unique. Of course you know that, but the fact that we're the only ones that offer mass, masstige, prestige and a growing, established now, business in luxury.
 We're seeing strong points across all. We'll continue to flex and adapt and incorporate it into our comp guidance is our ability to continue to drive growth. But through the first half of the year, we're really pleased with the Mass performance and several brands driving strong growth, and continue to lean in and bring innovation into the prestige side of the business. And collectively, it's working to allow us to gain share across Ulta Beauty. 
Operator: Our next question is from Kate McShane with Goldman Sachs.
 Kate is your line on mute?
 Our next question is from Anthony Chukumba with Loop Capital Markets. 
Anthony Chukumba: Congrats on the solid results. So just a real quick one. You mentioned luxury, and in fact, it's exceeding your expectations. You mentioned launching Pat McGrath Labs. Just -- it's all one related question in just 2 parts. 
 First off, what -- is luxury -- what percentage of your assortment, I guess, is luxury in the stores that it's in? And is it big enough at this point to be a comp driver? 
David Kimbell: Yes. Won't break out exact percentages. Again, to reiterate, it's in 200 stores. We're really pleased with it, a strong assortment across a number of the very best brands in luxury. Chanel, Dior, NATASHA DENONA, HOURGLASS, an extension of Chanel with Chanel Número Uno, Lancôme, Absolute, now Pat McGrath. A luxury fragrance business with brands like YSL and TOM FORD and Viktor&Rolf.
 So we won't get into exact percentages, but it is an important part of our overall strategy. We know there's growth in the luxury side of the business. We've been in luxury for a while, but now with this expanded presence, it is a contributor to our total comp. We're excited about the addition of Pat McGrath, and we'll continue to innovate and evolve and find ways to drive further growth down the road. 
 So yes, we think it's -- we know it's contributing to our growth, and we're excited about our guest response to an expanded luxury experience. 
Operator: Our next question is from Christopher Horvers with JPMorgan. 
Christopher Horvers: Layered gross margin question. So how did shrink in the promotional environment play out in the second quarter relative to your expectations? Have you changed any of your expectations around those line items in the back half? And do you expect any improvement perhaps in the shrink line?
 And then Scott, could you remind us of the price cost headwind that we faced in the third quarter? Because I know that was pretty significant last year. 
Scott Settersten: Sure, Chris. So yes, versus -- we did say, again, versus our expectations for the quarter, we're very happy with the overall financial results we were able to deliver. So breaking it down a little bit more, I'd say merchandise margin was better than what we expected, and so that speaks partially to the promotional lever that people are focused on here. So again, generally better than what we expected, so we can lean in and lean out. That's 1 of the great strengths of our business, being able to have real-time information and be able to take quick action and be agile.
 I'd say shrink generally directionally about the same as what we saw in the first quarter. As we look out to the rest of the year, we don't really -- we're not anticipating a significant turn and expectations there. We expect it to be tough the rest of the way. And we'll say maybe the fourth quarter may be slightly less negative than it was early part of the year because remember, last year in the fourth quarter was the first time we really called out and quantified what the shrink impact was, so we did have a little bit of a catch-up there. Over -- and then fixed -- store fixed costs we talked about, that was stronger than what we -- going in expectation because sales were a bit stronger than what we thought. And then channel mix overall helped us as well. 
 As we look to think about gross margin the second half of the year, I'd say the drivers, the headwinds are consistent with what we've seen in the first half of 2023. Again, we're taking a prudent approach as we always do with our guidance, and we'll work hard to do better than that. 
Christopher Horvers: And then the price cost in 3Q? 
Scott Settersten: Yes. So there was -- we -- third quarter last year is where we saw a significant step-up in the pricing increases across the portfolio, and really, the margin benefit started really rolling through in the second quarter and into the back half of the year. So this is really the toughest anniversary point in the year is ahead of us right now, and that's why we're calling out third quarter. Third quarter is kind of peak on a number of different fronts. Again, every year is a little unique, but the third quarter now, we've got a little bit of delays in some of our project work, which is shifting back some of our IT expense into the third quarter. And a lot of that flows through SG&A.
 So we'll see more pressure there than we saw earlier in the year, and then likewise, with gross margin. And a little -- and more moderate sales growth expectations, coupled with cycling over the margin benefits last year from the price increases step up in the back half of the year, putting more pressure on third quarter than maybe some would expect. But again, by the time we get in the fourth quarter and get back to focusing on sales in the holiday, we expect that to bounce back in a healthy manner. 
Operator: Our next question is from Adrienne Yih with Barclays. 
Adrienne Yih-Tennant: Scott, I'm going to stay on that topic with the third quarter. If I'm not mistaken, it seems like about $10 million to $12 million of the SG&A spend perhaps is moving into the third quarter. And if we have a little bit more gross margin pressure, does that imply that EPS could be down sort of high single-digit range? Just wondering if I'm in the right ballpark. 
Scott Settersten: Yes. We don't want to get into quantifying it specifically, Adrienne. But I'd say directionally, you're in the right zip code. So yes, on the SG&A side, that's roughly kind of the shift back into the third quarter on some of the IT spend. And yes, operating margin is going to be down meaningfully versus what we saw earlier this year, and that's going to result in negative EPS growth year-over-year for the third quarter. 
Adrienne Yih-Tennant: Super helpful. And then to just follow through with the SG&A. So can you help us walk through the phases? I know there's 4 phases of Project SOAR and all of the other investments. It seems like you're running sort of dual structures perhaps on some of the DCs and then the website or, let's call it, 1/3 or half of the year. How should we think about that rolling off? Because a lot of this kind of redundancy will go away next year. I know you're not giving guidance, but just to help us shape sort of what SG&A growth looks like last -- next year? Because it seems like it comes down a lot on the consensus. I just want to make sure we have that correct in our mind. 
Kecia Steelman: Adrienne, I'll start, and then I'll kick it over to Scott. So yes, we're in the middle of an ambitious transformational agenda. That's for sure. And part of this is really positioning all parts of the organization for our future efforts, and overall we're really pleased with how our progress is working. But anyone who's taken on this large scale of a project, we definitely have timing shifts that happen because we want to make sure that while we're staying forward, progressing and moving, we are really limited in our distraction and our disruption for our guests and also for our associates. 
 So we've adopted a few of our time lines and have shifted a couple of the projects from Q2 into Q3, and we might even see some shifting from Q3 into Q4, but we're still on track to spend the $60 million to $70 million incremental to the prior year. And while we've got some of those shifts, we still are very confident that we're going to stay with our overall time line and how things wrapped up by the right time line for next year, which is more mid-2024. 
 I'll turn it over to Scott. 
Scott Settersten: Yes, and you're exactly right. We're not providing guidance for 2024 here today, but yes, investors should expect that we will cultivate, recoup benefits from the significant investments that we're making in our core systems year 20 -- '22 into '23 and that we're going to see benefits materialized in 2024 and beyond. Again, you've heard us talk about, these are major initiatives here that we expect to see dividends for a number of years into the future, but I would also caution investors just to be prepared. I mean there's -- we are in the business of growing Ulta Beauty for the long term, and so there's plenty of other great growth initiatives out there that we've got in the queue that we're ready to go tackle. As soon as we get through some of more of this, I'd call core transformation work here in '23 and early 2024. 
Operator: Our next question is from Kelly Crago with Citi. 
Kelly Crago: I just have a couple of quick ones on categories. Just on makeup, it looks like makeup's growth decelerated from high singles in 1Q to mid-single to 2Q. Was that driven by a slowdown -- a subsequent slowdown in prestige? Did both decelerate? And how should we think about makeup growing in 2H? 
 And then just secondly on skin, we've heard from some of the brands that maybe there's slowing growth in that category, but you do under index versus the category overall. So just curious whether that dynamic can help offset maybe some weaknesses that we're seeing or starting to see in skin? And any thoughts on the growth there would be great. 
David Kimbell: Yes. I'd say on makeup, the main driver is while our -- we're bringing a lot of innovation and newness across that prestige portfolio, lapping -- really, one of the biggest launches in the history of Ulta Beauty with Fenty, lapping that fully in the second quarter is probably the biggest driver. We're excited though as we look forward. I mentioned a few launches that we that we have coming out, Rabanne, Pat McGrath, Polite Society, among others that many of which are exclusive to Ulta Beauty and are coming into our business in the second half of the year.
 But we anticipate as we lap that launch. We'll continue to see pressure on prestige. Mass continues to drive growth behind great innovation, great engagement. And so we're pleased with the total makeup side of the business even as we address some of the pressure in lapping previous launches.
 In the skin care side, yes, we are -- we have somewhat lower share than we do in makeup, but our -- we have established over time a meaningful share position and the fact that we're able to continue to drive growth is, again, a testament to our model, our ability, the strength we have across price points. We're seeing strong healthy growth in both mass and prestige, really leaning into dermatologist recommended space, and believe that we can continue to drive growth going forward and continue to drive share.
 The category, we think, is healthy. As I said, with the total beauty category, we do anticipate some moderation. It's unlikely to see double-digit growth forever, but we're leaning in. We've got a great skin business. Our merchants continue to bring strong innovation. Our store teams are doing a great job educating our guests, and we're delivering a lot of growth and we see more coming. 
Operator: Our next question is from Kate McShane with Goldman Sachs. 
Katharine McShane: Thanks for giving me another chance here to ask our question. I wondered if you could talk a little bit about the strategy behind combining your promotional events like you did this past quarter? And did you see a bigger lift as a result of that change versus last year? And will there be any similar approaches to some of your promotional events being taken in the second half? 
David Kimbell: Great. Yes, I almost used your silence to answer any question that I wanted to [indiscernible] the earlier Kate, but glad you got back in the queue. We're excited. We -- I think what we did in the second quarter, what our teams did, our merchant marketing, digital, store teams, our go-to-market teams, really, we -- they are continually evaluating how we can get better and how we can elevate the impact, and the summer sale is an example of that. We had strong events, solid events that were delivering for years, but the team, through great consumer insights, continued understanding of guest behavior and full understanding of what unique strengths we bring to the table, reevaluated that.
 And we're pleased with the results of that event, the Big Summer Sale as well as, really, our entire promotional strategy. It was not a huge acceleration in promotional intensity as much as a smarter strategy, and it worked. Our guests engaged, we attracted new members, it delivered strong comp growth. We saw strength in both stores and on our e-commerce business traffic was healthy. So it's -- frankly, didn't surprise me because I know how the team continues to look for ways to elevate, and it's another example of great strategy leading to a strong execution. 
 As we look into the second half of the year, we're evaluating, as we always do, every aspect of our go-to-market strategy. We continue to evolve our efforts. We'll adapt competitive changes, consumer insights and make sure we're delivering at a high level. Sunday, Kate, starts 21 Days of Beauty, 1 of our biggest events of the year. And I think you'll see as that rolls out, a program that's been around for a while, continued innovation and ways to engage our guests in new ways, so we're excited to get that going. 
Operator: Our next question is from Oliver Chen with TD Cowen. 
Unknown Analyst: This is [ Neil ] here on for Oliver. I would love to hear more about your thoughts on the broader beauty consumer. Someone made a comment about consumers are being less focused on pricing and kind of trading around different price points, so just curious how that behavior holds against the different macro headwinds you mentioned, particularly student loans? What's your exposure to that? Or how do you quantify that impact as we get closer to the October time frame when that becomes more material? 
David Kimbell: Yes. Well, I'd say first of all, we're just pleased overall with the continued engagement that beauty enthusiasts are showing for this category. Coming out of the pandemic for these last a couple of years now, just a high level of engagement. You know how over the long term, last 50 years, this has been a strong growth -- consistently growing category because of the emotional connection that it plays in our guest lives, the importance it has and how they express themselves to the world, and that is more true now than ever. And some of the behaviors and engagement tools that emerge coming out of the pandemic continue to fuel the category. Strong innovation, strong connection through marketing and consumer tools and an increased understanding of the role of beauty to wellness and self-care. 
 So when we look at the consumer going forward, we remain confident in the long-term outlook for this category and the strength of the beauty enthusiast to fuel it going forward. As I mentioned in the -- in my comments, there's a lot of uncertainty, and there has been, frankly, for the last couple of years. But we look into the remainder of this year, we know we're lapping. We continue to lap strong growth. We've been on this strong category growth for a while now. We have more changes coming, including student loans. So we're cautious and certainly watching carefully how that evolves.
 Historically, it's been difficult to tease out any kind of economic or stimulus shift and how directly that impacts the category or our business, and our business and the category itself has been largely resilient. Not immune, but largely resilient. So when we look out, I guess I'd say we're optimistic but watching closely and carefully. Staying really close to our guests, understanding what's happening in their lives and what's influencing their decisions and making sure we're adapting. 
 Last thing I'd say, and I know I've said this many times, but our position, our unique model of having all price points and a really accessible experience, both in-store and online positions us well. So even if there's shifts, even if there are pressures on consumers, history says we are able to adapt, and I know that's the strategy that we're implementing to make sure we're here for our guests to deliver regardless of what goes on in the broader environment around them. 
Kiley Rawlins: Paul, I think we have time for maybe one more question. 
Operator: Our final question is from Steven Forbes with Guggenheim Securities. 
Steven Forbes: Dave, Scott, you both mentioned in your prepared remarks the expectation for promotions to remain well below 2019 levels. And I was hoping you could just maybe clarify that statement? Is it isolated in 2023? Or is it meant to be a longer-term comment? And as we think about merchandise margin risk in the model, any way to frame what the sort of structural change in promotional activity in the category means for the margin profile in and of itself? 
Scott Settersten: Yes. So when we're talking -- again, this has been an evergreen topic, I think, with investors now for quite a while, pointing back to 2019. So the business is in a much different position today than it was back in 2019. Again, for those that have been following 2019, we had some major disruption in the middle of the year in the makeup category, unexpected deceleration there. There were channel mix headwinds that we were dealing with as a business. There was some investment in some international expansion that was causing some significant deleverage on the business. And so during the course of the pandemic some initiatives that have been started pre-pandemic but during the pandemic, we were able to take advantage of making sure that we fully leverage some of our cost optimization initiatives by way of EFG, and now continuous improvement initiatives layered on top of that.
 I would say the scale of the business, much larger today than it was back in 2019. So we're going to get the benefit of the fixed store cost leverage in the base business far and above what we were looking at pre-pandemic. Things around our capabilities like ship from store and BOPIS capabilities that really did not exist in any meaningful way back in 2019 that now you heard us say again today. 30% of those digital sales are being serviced out of our store fleet, so a much more efficient delivery to the consumer and a much better overall margin profile of those sales. Things like our credit card program, our Ulta Beauty and Target relationship, UB Media, new business for us, just really out of the starting gate here over the course of the last year, puts us in a much better position overall than we were back in those days. 
 So again, that's not promotion directly, but those -- all those elements play a role in gross margin and operating margin and expanding that over the course of time. So we feel confident that the promotion levels, again, they are going to moderate. We've been talking over the last couple of years that extraordinary environment that we saw in '21 and '22 was not sustainable for the long term. And that -- as people got back in the business and people were back in malls and other retail outlets that the promotion level was probably going to come back to us a little bit, and that's kind of how -- what we're seeing play out today. 
 So again, there's nothing unexpected here. It was in our forecast, our plans for the year. We're moderating and navigating our way through that in an effective manner, and again, nothing -- I don't think anything that should be overly concerning to investors. Again, we're confident that we're going to be able to manage our way through that with new capabilities, new lines of business, our loyalty program and CRM capabilities being much more mature today than they were back in the pre-pandemic days.
 So we're confident, we're going to be able to deliver healthy operating margins in that 14% to 15% range and a very moderate growth expectation of 3% to 5%. So feeling good about our position and where we're headed for the future. 
David Kimbell: Great. Well, thank you all for joining us today. I appreciate your interest and engagement in Ulta Beauty. I want to close by thanking all of our Ulta Beauty associates for their continued care for our guests while delivering another quarter of strong financial results. We look forward to speaking to all of you again when we report results for the third quarter on November 30. 
 Thanks again, and have a good evening. 
Operator: This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.

===== 2023 Q1  (2023-05-25 16:30:00) =====
Operator: Good afternoon, and welcome to Ulta Beauty's conference call to discuss results for the first quarter of fiscal 2023. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. 
 It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Ms. Kiley Rawlins, Vice President of Investor Relations. Ms. Rawlins, please proceed.

 Now I'd like to turn the call over to Dave. Dave? 
David Kimbell: Thank you, Kiley, and good afternoon, everyone. We appreciate your interest in Ulta Beauty. Fiscal 2023 is off to a good start. For the first quarter, we delivered net sales, operating margin and diluted EPS that were consistent with our internal expectations.
 Net sales increased 12.3% to $2.6 billion, and comparable sales increased 9.3%. Operating margin was 16.8% of sales and diluted EPS increased 9.2% to $6.88 per share. Our store traffic remained healthy and member growth continued to be strong. We delivered growth across key categories, and we strengthened engagement with the Ulta Beauty brand. I want to thank our Ulta Beauty associates for their focus on creating great guest experiences while continuing to adapt to a dynamic environment and executing our transformational agenda. 
 The operating environment continues to evolve and consumers are exploring how best to navigate the economic uncertainty. Inflation concerns remain high and consumers are spending more selectively while also showing a continued willingness to splurge and treat themselves. Engagement with beauty remains strong, reflecting the prioritization of self-care. Category growth is healthy but moderating as we lap 2 years of unprecedented growth. And as category growth normalizes, promotional activity is increasing. While we do not intend to lead promotional intensity, we will respond as appropriate to protect and expand our share using a variety of tools we have developed and invested in over the last several years. 
 Using the consumer lens of how guests experience Ulta Beauty through our multiple touch points to include our physical stores, our e-commerce business and Ulta Beauty at Target, the Ulta Beauty experience is resonating with our guests and gaining share. As we have seen in previous quarters, sales in our mass category grew faster than prestige categories. It is difficult to know with certainty if the robust growth of mass products is due to strong engagement with innovative mass brands such as e.l.f. and La Roche-Posay or due to increased consumer price sensitivity. Importantly, Ulta Beauty is the only beauty retailer that offers a wide variety of price points, from entry level mass to luxury and everything in between. And as such, we are uniquely positioned to capture any consumer shifts within price points in the beauty category. 
 Skincare was our best performing category again this quarter with both prestige and mass delivering double-digit comp growth, driven primarily by newness, engaging social media content and strong performance through 21 Days of Beauty and Spring Hall. Newness from innovative brands like The Ordinary, Drunk Elephant and Hero Cosmetics, as well as new brands, including Bubble, Beautycounter and BYOMA, contributed to growth during the quarter. In addition, social media platforms continue driving content category engagement, resulting in robust growth for dermatologist-recommended brands like La Roche-Posay and trend forward brands like COSRX. 
 The fragrance and bath categories delivered low double-digit percent growth this quarter, lapping 2 consecutive years of strong double-digit growth. Newness from Ariana Grande, Carolina Herrera and Valentino contributed meaningfully, and our monthly Fragrance Crush program fueled strong engagement with newer brand Billie Eilish as well as established brands Lancome and Dior. In addition, Valentine's stay gift-giving was healthy across both men's and women's fragrances. 
 Makeup delivered high single-digit growth for the quarter, driven by newness and guest engagement with 21 Days of Beauty and Spring Hall. Soft bronzing, glossy lips and expressive eyes and nails are trends driving growth for the category. New brands like Dior, about-face and NATASHA DENONA drove sales during the quarter, while new products from a wide range of brands including e.l.f., Fenty and NYX also contributed to growth. In addition, the expansion of MAC into more stores, combined with compelling newness, continued to drive sales. 
 Finally, the hair category was flat for the quarter, with growth in hair care products and color offset by lower demand for tools as we lapped strong newness last year. Products focused on hair health, including bonding, scalp treatments and hydration, as well as those focused on styling, are resonating strongly. Newer brands like Donna's Recipe, Odele and Divi as well as new products from masstige brands Eva Nyc, Batiste and Andrew Fitzsimons were notable drivers for the category. Trend-relevant products from OUIA, Redken and Kenra resonated with guests, while engaging social media content drove healthy growth for Mielle and IGK. 
 Our services business delivered double-digit comp growth again this quarter, driven by growth in cut and style, blowout and makeup services. As we have expanded our service offerings and enhanced our stylist talent, more members are using services. And our Salon Backbar Takeovers, which give our stylists a unique opportunity to introduce new brands and products to guests, drove sales growth and new member acquisition for participating brands. 
 Now similar to what other retailers have shared, we continue to see pressure from inventory shrink this quarter and we have updated our full year guidance to reflect the persistence of this trend. While shrink is the result of various factors, theft, specifically organized retail crime, or ORC, is an increasingly concerning challenge, especially as we've seen a rise in violence and aggression during these incidents. 
 Our first priority is the safety and well-being of our associates and our guests. We are committed to ensuring a safe work environment and are investing in fixtures, training, support structures and increased staffing and security to aggressively address this concerning trend. ORC impacts all of our stakeholders, guests, associates, brand partners, investors and communities, and it will not be solved by retailers alone. Given the complexity, it will take collaboration across retail, manufacturing, law enforcement and legislative levels to solve these problems. Now working together, I am optimistic we can create meaningful impact and bring forward creative, sustainable solutions to restore safe shopping experiences for everyone. 
 As we have previously discussed, beauty is not immune to macroeconomic challenges, but has historically been more resilient compared to other discretionary categories due to its deep emotional connection with consumers. We believe this connection is even greater today given the importance of beauty as a form of self-care and wellness. As we navigate this dynamic operating environment, our strategic framework guides our priorities and positions us to build on our market leadership and drive long-term profitable growth. 
 Let me give you an update on the progress we've made against this framework in the first quarter. Starting with our efforts to drive growth with an expanded definition of All Things Beauty, our strategy is to delight beauty enthusiasts with our thoughtfully curated assortment focused on inclusivity and leading trends. During the first quarter, we further enhanced our assortment with the launch of several exciting brands, including: NATASHA DENONA, a luxury artistry brand known for high-quality makeup pallets across eye, face and cheek; Beautycounter, a clean beauty pioneer, offering high-performing skincare and makeup with unmatched ingredient safety standards; and Odele, a haircare brand focused on clean, accessible products for the whole family. To drive engagement and capture additional market share this quarter, we launched Luxury at Ulta Beauty in 200 stores and on ulta.com. Driven by social platforms and strong Gen Z interest, luxury brands are fueling beauty category growth. 
 Our vision for Luxury at Ulta Beauty is to provide guests with a uniquely modern luxury beauty experience, strategically curated to reflect what guests are engaging most in, including iconic luxury with brands like Dior and Lancome Absolue; clean luxury with brands like Hourglass CHANEL N°1; and luxe artistry brands like NATASHA DENONA. In addition to strengthening our core assortment, we continue to expand, evolve and amplify our cross-category platforms. 
 Let me share some first quarter highlights. We ended the quarter with 306 brands certified and at least one conscious beauty pillar, including newly certified brands Nutritious Estee Lauder, Winky Lux and Mielle. In celebration of Earth Day, to promote sustainability and to drive discovery, we launched a collectible Ulta Beauty reusable tote and a Conscious Beauty essential sample kit with Hero products from 14 certified brands, including boscia, Beekman 1802 and ACURE. We continue to support black-owned and founded brands with the launch of new brands, hanahana beauty and GOLDE. We created a black-owned and founded brands discovery kit featuring 11 brands, and 100% of the purchase price of this kit was donated to Big Brothers Big Sisters of America. 
 In recognition of Black History Month, we celebrated and supported the Black community through [ rich ] Ode to Black Beauty storytelling and used our digital and social platforms to highlight innovative brands like Nude Sugar, Beauty Bakerie and Sunday II Sunday. 
 As we meet beauty enthusiasts wherever they are on their beauty journey, all in your world, we are investing to enhance guest experiences across all of our touch points. This quarter, we completed the 2-year phased rollout of the guest-facing element of our digital store, delivering a fresh, innovative front-end guest experience across both ulta.com and our app. Today, guests enjoy more seamless navigation and checkout experiences; can discover and browse new experiences, including buy more save more, Luxury at Ulta Beauty and our new foundation finder; and also benefit from enhanced search and recommendation capabilities. 
 Later this year, we will finish the transition by converting our back-end infrastructure to support enhanced checkout, order and inventory management and pricing and promotion capabilities. The completion of the front end of our digital store is a major milestone in our journey to enhance our omnichannel experiences. And it is worth noting, our teams executed these changes while maintaining an active digital platform and delivering our e-commerce growth goals. 
 While we experienced some minor disruption during the transition, I am proud of how our digital, IT and guest services teams have worked together while minimizing the guest impact. To support omnichannel guest experience is -- we continued to expand our buy anywhere fill anywhere capabilities. This quarter, we introduced same-day delivery in 6 new markets, bringing the number of stores with this convenient option to 540 stores across 18 markets. In addition, we're making it easier for store associates to assist guests in ordering products online when not available in store through our upgraded POS system. We have refreshed store POS systems in 1,100 stores and are on track to complete this transition before holiday. 
 Turning to our partnership with Target. We opened 4 Ulta Beauty shops in the quarter, ending with 359 locations. This touch point introduces new guests to Ulta Beauty and enables reengagement of lapsed guests, and we are leveraging our CRM capabilities to ensure bounce back to Ulta Beauty. Our dedicated field team continues to support this important partnership with training and field engagement, and we are working together with our Target partners to deliver an outstanding guest experience. 
 Beauty is a personal emotionally connected category. To increase consideration, loyalty and engagement, we are creating authentic connections with our guests with work that sits at the heart of the beauty community. In the first quarter, we executed impactful activations around key cultural moments, including Black History Month, prom and Earth Day, and delivered improved brand health metrics with significant increases in awareness across Gen Z, Black and Hispanic consumers. These trends confirm that the Ulta Beauty brand is continually becoming stronger, more relevant and more meaningful to guests. We ended the first quarter with 41 million active members, 9% higher than the first quarter last year, driven by new member acquisition, lapsed member reactivation and healthy retention rates. Spend per member also increased, driven primarily by trip frequency and growth of Elite members. Increased visibility, personalized reminders and incentives are driving growth of Diamond and Platinum members. 
 At the end of the first quarter, the number of members in these higher tiers increased more than 30% compared to the same period last year, which is a strong indicator of high loyalty and elevated engagement in all that Ulta Beauty has to offer. Our multifaceted go-to-market plan to drive member growth and nurture the member lifecycle is delivering results. 
 To drive new member acquisition and reactivate lapsed members, we refreshed store associate training and created new tools to help associates communicate the program's benefits. We enhanced the integration of our loyalty program across our refreshed digital experiences and introduced guest-facing signage in stores to drive awareness. And we executed targeted reactivation campaigns and tested new personalized digital communications to improve retention and contactability. 
 Turning to UB Media, our retail media network, we are harnessing the power of our exclusive first-party data to transform the way our brands connect with beauty enthusiasts. With dedicated resources and new tools in place, this quarter, we engaged with more brands, managed more digital campaigns and expanded our product portfolio to include advertising opportunities on Ulta-owned digital properties. As UB Media continues to scale, we are confident it will add meaningful value to our company over time. 
 Reflecting our priority to drive operational excellence and optimization, we are executing an ambitious multiyear road map of transformation initiatives, which will unlock new capabilities and operation -- operating efficiencies to fuel our future growth. We are upgrading our enterprise resource planning platform, expanding and optimizing our supply chain with new facilities, systems and processes; transitioning our digital store to modern technology and architecture while upgrading our order management system; expanding our data management systems to enable further analytical capabilities; and upgrading POS systems in all stores. 
 We have made good progress against our road map and expect to deliver major milestones over the next several months. While change of this magnitude can be disruptive, our teams have consistently moved quickly and collaboratively to limit impact to guests and associates. Our success is enabled by our people and we are investing purposely in our teams to protect and cultivate our world-class culture and talent. 
 In the first quarter, we launched a refreshed and modernized Ulta Beauty competency model across the enterprise to drive further consistency in talent management processes, establish clear measures of success and enhance culture with common language. We also launched a new service award recognition program to elevate the associate experience and reward associates in meaningful ways. And we hosted our annual field leadership meeting, bringing together our general managers, district managers, field support teams and brand partners for several days of recognition, leadership development and product education. I walked away from this event inspired by our talented associates and their passion for serving our guests and driving Ulta Beauty's growth. 
 Finally, we continue to expand our environmental and social impact. This quarter, we partnered with Pact Collective to test the packaging recycling program in select locations with the goal of collecting the beauty industry's hard to recycle packaging so that it is diverted from landfills and put to its highest and best use. We also published our 2022 ESG report, which describes our approach to priorities in these areas and provide key updates on our ESG initiatives, their connectedness to our business and the positive impact of beauty as a force for good. 
 In closing, fiscal 2023 is off to a good start. Our teams are executing well against an ambitious transformational agenda while navigating a dynamic environment. While we expect the operating environment will continue to evolve, we are confident the resilience of the category, combined with the power of our proven business model and world-class team, position Ulta Beauty for continued profitable growth. 
 And now I will turn the call over to Scott for a discussion of the financial results. Scott? 
Scott Settersten: Thanks, Dave, and good afternoon, everyone. As Dave said earlier, today, we reported results for the first quarter that were generally in line with our expectations. We entered 2023 anticipating that the unprecedented growth in the beauty category would moderate and that the promotional environment would increase. These trends materialized in the first quarter and are reflected in our results.
 Starting with the income statement. Net sales for the quarter increased 12.3%, driven by 9.3% growth in comp sales and strong new store performance. In addition, other revenue increased $19 million, primarily due to growth in both credit card income and royalty income from our Target partnership. The comp sales growth for the quarter was driven by an 11% increase in transactions, primarily due to double-digit growth in store traffic, which more than offset a 1.5% decline in average ticket. The decline in average ticket reflected lower units per transaction, which more than offset higher average selling price. We estimate that product price increases, most of which were executed last year, contributed about 400 basis points to the overall comp increase. 
 Looking at the cadence of sales through the quarter, momentum from post-holiday tailwinds continued into February, which also benefited from lapping COVID headwinds last year. Comp sales subsequently moderated to mid-single digits as we move through the quarter. During the quarter, we opened 5 new stores and closed one store. In addition, we relocated one store and remodeled 2 stores. 
 For the quarter, gross margin was down 10 basis points compared to the same period last year at 40% of sales. Higher inventory shrink, lower merchandise margin, higher supply chain costs, and deleverage of salon expenses were partially offset by strong growth in other revenue and leverage of store fixed costs. As Dave shared earlier, we continue to experience a worsening trend of theft and organized retail crime. We are actively working to stabilize and mitigate these trends through investments in staffing, training and fixtures, and we are working collaboratively with law enforcement and third-party organizations to address these challenges. 
 In addition to greater pressure from shrink, gross margin was impacted by lower merchandise margin, primarily due to increased promotional activity and category mix shifts, which more than offset benefit from price increases. We also incurred additional costs in the quarter related to our supply chain optimization efforts. 
 SG&A increased 22.2% to $612 million, which was slightly better than our plan. As a percentage of sales, SG&A increased 180 basis points to 23.2% compared to 21.4% last year, primarily due to deleverage of store payroll and benefits, corporate overhead and marketing expense, partially offset by leverage of incentive compensation and store expenses due to higher sales. 
 Store payroll and benefits expense increased, driven primarily by higher average wage rates and increased staffing levels compared to the same period last year. Corporate overhead expense deleveraged in the quarter, primarily due to investments related to our strategic priorities, including Project SOAR, other IT capabilities and UB Media. Marketing expense increased, reflecting investment in strategies to drive member acquisition and retention, increase brand awareness, and expand omni member penetration. 
 Operating margin was 16.8% of sales compared to 18.7% of sales in the first quarter of 2022. As expected, the decline in operating margin primarily reflects the impact of SG&A deleverage and lapping our extraordinary results in the first quarter of fiscal 2022. Net interest income for the quarter increased to $7.3 million, driven by higher average interest rates and higher average cash balances during the quarter. The company's tax rate decreased to 22.8% compared to 24.2% in the first quarter last year. The lower effective tax rate is primarily due to greater benefit from income tax accounting for stock-based compensation. Diluted GAAP earnings per share increased 9.2% to $6.88 compared to $6.30 last year. 
 Moving on to the balance sheet and cash flow statement. Total inventory increased 11.5% to $1.8 billion compared to $1.6 billion last year. In addition to the impact of 41 net new stores, the increase reflects the impact of higher purchases to support demand, product cost increases and inventory to support new brand launches and expansion of existing brands. 
 Capital expenditures were $109.8 million for the quarter compared to $71.1 million last year. The increase in capital expenditures was primarily related to investments in IT and supply chain, as well as new, remodeled and relocated stores. 
 Depreciation decreased to $57.9 million compared to $62.8 million last year, primarily due to lower store depreciation and a shift of IT investments from capital to cloud expense. We ended the quarter with $636.4 million in cash and cash equivalents. In the first quarter, we repurchased 541,000 shares at a cost of $285.8 million. At the end of the quarter, we had $816 million remaining under our current $2 billion repurchase authorization. 
 Turning now to our outlook. We have refined our expectations for the full year to reflect our first quarter actual performance and recent trends. We are maintaining our expectations for annual comp sales growth and diluted earnings per share, but are updating our outlook for operating margin. We continue to expect comp sales growth for the year will be between 4% and 5%, with growth moderating as we move through the year. As we shared on our last call, we expect comp growth for the first half to be in the upper single-digit range and then moderate to low single-digit growth in the second half. 
 We now expect operating margin for the full year will be between 14.5% and 14.8% of sales, primarily reflecting an updated view of gross margin. We have increased our expectations for gross margin deleverage from our original outlook to include the impact of higher shrink and a more competitive and promotional environment. We continue to expect SG&A deleverage, driven primarily by $60 million to $70 million of incremental spend to support strategic investments as well as the impact of ongoing inflationary pressures. 
 We have updated our assumptions for interest income to reflect the current interest rate environment and are now planning for about $17 million of interest income for the year. We have also incorporated our first quarter tax rate into our full year forecast and now expect the effective tax rate for the year will be approximately 23.8%. These assumptions result in guidance for diluted earnings per share in the range of $24.70 to $25.40 per share. 
 In closing, fiscal 2023 is off to a solid start. We remain optimistic about the health of the beauty category, confident in our team and our growth strategies and steadfast in our belief that our proven business model uniquely positions us to deliver for our guests, associates and shareholders. 
 And now I'll turn the call back over to our operator to moderate the Q&A session. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Simeon Siegel with BMO Capital Markets. 
Simeon Siegel: Dave, I know you talked about the mass versus prestige dynamic within the Ulta offering. Do you have any view as to whether you're seeing any signs of external trade down, I guess, either customers trading into or out of Ulta from somewhere else? And then Dave or Scott, I was hoping you could speak a little bit more about the decline in ticket. Any opinions on the lower UPT despite the higher ASP and transactions? I don't know if you think this is because of a purse tightening or if it's a mix dynamic or compare. Just any further color there would be helpful. 
David Kimbell: Yes. Thanks, Simeon. What we are seeing, as we said in the call, is mass and our business is growing faster than preceding -- we saw that in some previous quarters right now. And so a little bit of detail about that as we look underneath. As we look across income levels, there's actually good -- there's growth across all income levels, across all income cohorts, roughly equivalent across all cohorts, although the growth rate did moderate from Q4 pretty consistently. .
 As we said, traffic remains strong. Double-digit traffic average spend per member increased. Average ticket did decline as we have fewer units per transaction. When we look at the mass category, it's -- we have some exceptional newness going on and some really high-performing brands in our mass category, brands like e.l.f., NYX, The Ordinary, La Roche-Posay. So we know that is certainly contributing to that. And it's -- so the fact that mass is growing higher than prestige, it's difficult for us to exactly parse apart the core driver of that. But we know for sure, there's a high level of engagement in those brands because they are culturally relevant and driving great engagement. 
 At the same time, we have strong growth and some strong newness on our prestige side of the business as well. Prestige skincare comping double digit as an example of that. So we're watching closely. What we feel is the total category remains strong. Engagement is high. As we've talked in previous quarters, this is an emotionally connected category that's important, and coming out of the pandemic, even more important in overall self-care and wellness and we expect that to continue. But the high level of growth that we've seen in these last 2 years, as we've talked about in several quarters, will moderate. We think ultimately getting back to more the high end of historical average, but we know engagement's high, and we continue to be encouraged by overall consumer engagement. 
Scott Settersten: Yes. So overall, I would just remind you, Simeon, that we did state, so total units are up across the enterprise, right, for the period year-over-year, and total spend per member is up year-over-year as well. So again, great evidence of a healthy, strong business model at play. Very strong traffic trends in both channels, but especially in our brick-and-mortar channel that we're pleased to see. 
 When we look at the specific units per transaction, again, it was down. It's been decelerating a bit over the course of the last 3 or 4 quarters, I guess, I would say. So again, not totally surprising to us to see that. And again, we would take away from that what most people, just looking at the trends and looking at how consumers, are just being a little bit more selective now than maybe they were at this time last year. But we're trying not to read too much into that at this point in time. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Rupesh Parikh with Oppenheimer. 
Rupesh Parikh: So I wanted to go back to your commentary on the promotional environment. So clearly, it's gotten more competitive out there. I was just hoping to get more color in terms of what you guys are seeing. And if you look at some of the promotions out there, how is the gap compared to maybe what we've seen maybe pre-pandemic 2019 earlier? 
David Kimbell: Yes. Well, as I mentioned on the call, we anticipated and planned for it to be more promotional this year coming out of all the trends that we've talked about over the couple of years. And what we saw as the quarter progressed that actually promotional activity did increase and was even a little bit more than we had anticipated through that quarter. So when we look at broader competitive activity, we know this is a strong category. It's an important category for all of our competitors. And our long-term approach to this has been to not to lead the promotional intensity, but to make sure that we are competitive and continue to be the leader and gain share in the environment. And so that's what's driving some of the competitive activity and the increase in promotional. 
 As versus 2019, we're still below 2019, and we've planned and anticipate that, that will be the case through this year. As you know well, Rupesh, the 2019 and leading up to that was a highly promotional period. We're not anticipating getting back to those levels. But as we've talked about really throughout the last several quarters, we anticipated it getting more promotional, and we're certainly seeing that in the environment. As a reminder, we worked hard for the last several years and certainly through the last 2 years to expand our CRM capabilities to grow our loyalty program. 9% growth in our loyalty program, 41 million members now, gives us some new tools, some new capabilities to be more strategic, more pinpointed in our promotional activities targeted with those efforts, and we've employed those and we'll continue to be strategic and thoughtful as we look ahead in the environment as the year unfolds. 
Operator: Our next question is from Steve Forbes with Guggenheim Securities. 
Anders Myhre: This is Anders Myhre, on for Steve Forbes. I wanted to start with services. So maybe a two-part question. One, outside of the details in the prepared remarks, can you comment further on the trends you were seeing broadly within services and possibly measured by member utilization rate? And two, can you provide an update on the percentage of consumers that make an in-store purchase after receiving a service? I believe in the past, there is approximately 50%. So I wanted to see if there's any moderation there. 
Kecia Steelman: Yes. Well, thank you for the question. Yes. So again, our salon service business was really strong again in the quarter. We -- what we like that we've seen is we -- in the prepared remarks, we talked about these backbar events. So not that we specifically ever break out purchase by service guests, but what I can share with you is that our backbar events, what we've seen is 90% of guests that are purchasing through those activations are new to those brands. So the guest experience and services is really resonating when we get them in the chair. 
 [ Hot ] and color is the main driver of our overall services business. And then the trends that we're seeing really are around health care -- hair care around loss of hair treatments, and that also helps with our average ticket. So the business is really strong. Our stylists are really critical to our overall business. We hired over 950 stylists in this last quarter. So the business is strong. We've got capacity, and it's a unique proposition that we have here at Ulta Beauty. 
Operator: Our next question is from Krisztina Katai with Deutsche Bank. 
Krisztina Katai: I had a question on the Ultamate Rewards program, right, which continues to set records, both with membership and spend per member, has your share of wallet increased with your members, given some of the successful high-profile brand launches and also the luxury assortment that you're creating? And I also wanted to ask what type of return do you see on some of the more personalized or tailored promos that you offer whenever needed as you leverage the vast amount of data that you have? 
David Kimbell: Great. Well, yes, our loyalty program, Ultamate Rewards, is one of our greatest assets, and I'm really excited that the investments that we've made, the work that the team does, the commitment that our store teams have driving that experience continue to pay off. We're really proud of 9% growth in members in Q1, spend per member growth. Our strategies, our plans are  working. 
 We do -- separately, we do believe we continue to improve share of wallet of our best guests. I talked about Platinum and Diamond members being -- showing strong growth. We believe we continue to add new experiences, add new brands, engage them in more touch points. Everything that we do really is designed to increase share of wallet. If we have a store-only guest, to get them to shop, to use our salon, to shop online, to download our app, to get our credit card, to shop at Target. All these experiences collectively add to share of wallet. And we have continued evidence that when we do that, it works to increase share of wallet. 
 And one example, a store-only guest that starts shopping us in an omnichannel online way. Their spend with us increases over 2.5x. So we know we're improving share of wallet across our engaged guests. And as we add new members, which we continue to do as we grow, we're on the journey of getting them more engaged with all of our touch points. So we are committed to that. We're finding a lot of success. 
 As far as some of the personalization, that's another aspect of our experience that we've been working hard on for several years, and it is working and paying off. The return of our programs around things like replenishment or engaging in new categories are working. We see strong return. And in fact, the return is strong enough that we're going to continue to invest more in data capabilities, bringing in new tools, leveraging innovation across all ways of experimenting and engaging with our guests. So we're seeing good returns, and we see there's a lot more opportunity for us ahead. In the world of personalization, you will buy our data. 
Operator: Our next question is from Ike Boruchow with Wells Fargo. 
Irwin Boruchow: Scott, I was just wondering if you could give more color on the shrink theft component of what's impacting you guys in the P&L. And I'm just asking, it does sound like it's a fairly meaningful dynamic that's taking place. And if there's any way you can kind of quantify that so we kind of know what the impact was in Q1 or what you're now pricing in for the remainder of the year? Anything there would just be a little bit more helpful so we understand just how impactful it is to your gross margin. 
Scott Settersten: Yes. So it was -- when I think about the financial results and totality, and really shrink was the thing that surprised us in the quarter, and that's really the driver when we think about the operating margin adjustment for the year. So we knew sales were going to moderate a little bit after 2 spectacularly strong years. We knew the promotional environment was going to ramp up some. And maybe it's slightly richer than we were expecting, but that's not the driver. 
 The driver is shrink, by far. And so that's what put a pretty meaningful drag on our first quarter, and we're expecting those trends to continue the rest of the year. Again, coming into 2023, we thought the shrink trends were going to moderate a little bit because of some of the investments we were putting behind mitigation tactics. But they haven't resonated yet. We're still hopeful. We're still -- our teams are doing a great job. A lot of effort is going into this. But from a financial standpoint, we're not banking on any improvement the rest of the way. So kind of remain a challenge for the rest of the year. 
David Kimbell: Ike, I'm glad you asked. I just -- I'd add the -- as I mentioned in the script, this is a really important and critical topic. There's certainly the financial impact that Scott described. But this is impacting our associates. It's impacting our guests. And unfortunately, despite our efforts, and investments, it's getting worse, not better, and we need to -- we're working hard. 
 And I mentioned this, but what it's going to take is our efforts, and I'm going to ask Kecia to describe in a bit more detail some of the steps we're taking. But we're working hard within what we directly control, but we need support from other -- partnership with other retailers, support from local leaders, from law enforcement, from DAs, from national governmental leaders. This is a macro problem that needs a macro answer, and I'm personally heavily involved in it to help try to find solutions, both for our business and hopefully contribute to some answers across retail. But it's an important topic and one that I'm focused on. But we are doing a lot. Kecia, do you want to highlight a few of those things? 
Kecia Steelman: Sure. Yes. We'll be in 70% of the chain by the end of this year, with locked fragrance cabinets as fragrance is one of the base target areas that we see them going after. And we're also increasing labor in those specific locations. We're training and educating our associates how best to handle these types of situations. It's upsetting. If you're shopping in a store, and you see this activity happening, it's pretty shocking. 
 I'm sure you've seen some of the reports that have come out there, the camera systems catching these groups coming in. So we've invested in security guards, armed security guards in some locations, partnering with our landlords at what can we do to help police the parking lots and throw them from even coming in. So it's a full court press out there, and we're keeping the communication lines open with our associates when this happens. Like I said, very disturbing and deciding to course-correct as an entire retail group. 
Scott Settersten: Just one final note, Ike, on that one. So for quantification purposes, as a reference point in the first quarter, the shrink deleveraged above expectations, totally offset all fixed store cost. 
Operator: Our next question is from Korinne Wolfmeyer with Piper Sandler. 
Korinne Wolfmeyer: I'd just like to touch on -- a little bit on your customer retention efforts. I know you've talked a bit on the loyalty program and how that's been doing. But as we think about maybe consumers doing a little bit more pressure in their wallet and maybe seeking out more, say, mass retailers or lower-cost items. How are you ensuring customers stick with Ulta and keeping that retention rate strong? 
David Kimbell: Well, Korinne, this is, as you would imagine, a huge focus for our entire team. And everybody in the company really participates in loyalty and retention. And that fundamentally starts with delivering a great experience. We have 50,000 associates in our stores that are committed to delighting our guests every time they walk in, and that's key to retention that every guest experience is a positive uplifting fun, engaging experience. And I'm proud that, that is so consistently the experience that our guests receive and what they love about. 
 Our retention remains strong, and we -- and that was an important driver of our 9% growth in loyalty in Q1. And we've got a number of activities from, as I said, the in-store experience with all of our digital touch points, our experience and connection that we have with our guests through -- through Target, our Ulta Beauty at Target, and all of our personalization and communication efforts really engage and excite and delight our guests. So we are pleased with retention and feel that we have a very strong, probably best-in-class retention rate that we do. 
 And as things -- as the environment shifts, and I talked about some of that in the script and an earlier question about shifts between mass and prestige. And as that changes, again, that is one of the unique aspects of Ulta Beauty. Nobody does what Ulta Beauty does. We're the only ones that offer from entry-level price, the masstige, to prestige, to luxury, all price points, all categories. So as long as we keep delighting and exciting our guests, if they choose to adjust their spending or maybe decide to buy different price points, they can do that within Ulta across all aspects, and that's been a key aspect -- a key part of our business and one that we'll continue to lean on and leverage going forward. 
Operator: Our next question is from Olivia Tong with Raymond James. 
Olivia Tong Cheang: I want to see if you could talk a little bit about the incremental promotions coming from, whether it's certain categories, certain channels that are pushing it harder as they try to expand or whether it's fairly broad-based. And then you said you -- I know you said you won't leave the promos, but of course, you have to be competitive. Can you talk about how your promo levels compare to your peers? And is there more you can do to leverage your loyalty members and the data that you have that you could potentially promote less [ versus previous ] years and still stay at the same level of competitiveness? 
David Kimbell: Yes. First, I'd say the incremental promotion we see it happening. We see really an intense competitive environment across all parts of the beauty category. And again, because of our model, mass to prestige, to luxury, we are directly competing with everybody that sells beauty. And so we watch and track and we're seeing promotional activity across mass, across prestige, across luxury. And so that's all part of it. And so I wouldn't say it's any one part of the category. 
 As far as exactly, we don't have perfect insight. So we don't know exactly what each of our competitors are doing and understand all of their kind of internal measurements. But we watch very closely, track year-to-year, observe what's happening and then we do get some industry data that gives us a macro picture. So for us, it is just about making sure that we're delivering a great experience to our guests and delivering the right value at the right time. 
 And you touched on it, but we have invested heavily in our capabilities to personalize and be more targeted. And that's what's allowed us to reduce our promotion from the levels that we saw in 2018 and 2019. And even as we plan for a more elevated level this year, as I mentioned earlier, we believe it will be below those levels, in part because of the tools that we have, the fact that now we have 41 million people. We have new personalization capabilities. We've got better CRM experience that allows us to be more pinpointed. That doesn't mean we won't do some broad scale offers here and there as they make sense for us. But under the covers, we're doing a whole lot more value add at a more personalized level, and that's paying off in an important way. 
Operator: Our next question is from Michael Lasser with UBS. 
Michael Lasser: One of the narratives from the skeptics that's going to come out of this report is that their hypothesis is coming true, trends are going to slow, promotional activity is going to increase and that's going to put pressure on Ulta Beauty's margins, and it's probably going to now feature some element of shrink as well. So if you look at where your margins are on pace to be this year, somewhere in the mid-14% range, you add the increase in shrink and the dilution that that's going to have on your margins. And if promotional activity were to go back to 2019 levels, what would that mean for your margins in that scenario? 
David Kimbell: Let me start, and I'm going to ask Scott to give a bit more color, but -- or definitely more color on specifically around your question. What I'd say is we're really confident in our business. We guided for this year that we'd be delivering 4% to 5% comp growth, and we're committed to doing that. That's what we set out to do, and we are on track to do that. .
 We've made an adjustment to our operating margins. Scott will give more detail on that, but that's a reflection of some very specific things. But we remain confident in our long-term operating margin and our profitability over time. And we will go address some of the shrink issues. We do not believe promo is going to get back to historic highs, and in part because of what I just talked about, the impact -- our ability, our capabilities around personalization and others. So I understand that some of those questions might be out there. But I'll tell you, we are committed to delivering what we set out to do. 
 We are off to a good start to doing that in Q1: 9.3% comp, strong operating margin, strong EPS growth. And we believe our model is uniquely positioned to navigate whatever comes our way, and we've got the right team and the right strategies in place. So that's kind of how I feel about it at a macro level. But Scott, any color specifically about Michael's question? 
Scott Settersten: No, I would just add that, again, shrink and slightly richer promotional mix, temporary headwinds, we are very ready and able to be able to react to those kinds of things. So again, to Dave's point, with the toolbox that we have and the levers that we have to optimize this business, we're still very confident the 14% to 15% is the right range to be in. Things like UB Media, that's just kind of really getting off the ground, is a long-term margin accretive part of our business model. Project SOAR, digital store of the future, all these other large strategic initiatives we have underway right now are going to provide meaningful benefits for our stakeholders over a long period of time. So very confident in our [indiscernible]. 
Operator: Our next question is from Susan Anderson with Canaccord. 
Susan Anderson: I was wondering if you could talk about the health and wellness business and how that's been trending relative to the rest of the store? Are you seeing a pretty good response from the consumer in terms of adding that to their basket? And then also, where do you see that going longer term? 
David Kimbell: Yes, I'm glad you asked as wellness is it's an important growth opportunity. I'd start -- before I talk specifically about the wellness shop and the assortment we have there, I'd say this overall idea of wellness and self-care and the connection it has to beauty, I talked about this for a little while. So you may have heard this before, but it is an important trend coming out over the last couple of years that we think will drive continued growth and engagement. 
 The fact that more and more consumers understand the importance of beauty as part of their overall wellness routine is a very strong positive. It's one that's driving so much innovation, both in products specifically designed for wellness but also across makeup and fragrance and just bringing in more the idea of wellness into all forms of innovation. We did launch our wellness shop in May of 2021. We're currently in about 800 doors. We'll be adding more doors this year to continue to expand that presence. 
 We have a strong presence online. We have 140 brands, 700 SKUs across category focus, and it's a great experience. It's working really well. A number of really engaging brands like Love Wellness, Truly, Kitsch, megababe, GOLDE that we just added, Lemme by Kourtney Kardashian, there's a strong experience, high level of engagement across all 6 of our segments and pillars. And we're really pleased with its impact in connection. But we're also just getting started in that assortment. And so we see good growth in that area over time, and we're excited about the potential of that business for the long term. 
Operator: Our final question is from Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. 
Simeon Gutman: Everyone, I think you had the wrong Simeon to start the call, but it's okay. My question is two parts. The first part is actually related to his earlier question, thinking about the AUR and some of the innovation that's driven some of the inflation, whether or not the customer is reaching some resistant point and the number of items they put in the basket. And second, how to think about shrink and just what level of accrual given we're seeing it still ramping across other retailers, how much you've accrued for and how much could work to get. 
Scott Settersten: Maybe I'll start with shrink. So I addressed here just a few minutes earlier, just directional in the first quarter, shrink basically offset fixed store cost leverage entirely. So again, remember, that's been trending upward over the last couple of years with a huge peer step on the top line, Simeon. And so we would expect that trend to continue through the rest of the year. We're not -- we were expecting some moderation in 2023, but at this stage, it doesn't seem like we're going to be able to deliver that. So not optimistic about how that plays out in gross margin the rest of the way. 
David Kimbell: Yes. And Simeon, it's good to book end our Q&A by Simeon, so we're glad to do that. And I'd just say, yes, on the point, I mean, I think we covered some of the thoughts there about how we're seeing both spend per member, AUR, the units. I mean there's a lot of positive indicators on our business, and we're still working hard to get a read on how our consumer is navigating. We know there's pressures out there, but we also see a high level of engagement in beauty. 
 And so our focus now is to continue to drive great engagement across all aspects, newness, innovation, our core business, to get them engaged in all of our touch points and make sure that we're delivering a great Ulta Beauty guest experience because we know when we do that, they respond. So we're tracking all that carefully. We'll continue to report out in future earnings calls and make sure that we are leading the category appropriately.
 So with that, let me just say I'd like to close by, again, thanking all of our Ulta Beauty associates across our stores, distribution centers and our corporate office offices for delivering another strong quarter for our stakeholders. We know the environment will continue to evolve. But as I've said, we remain committed to our long-term growth strategies, and we are very confident in our team as we look forward to build -- continue to build the foundation that we set here in the first quarter. So we look forward to speaking to you all again when we report results for the second quarter on August 24. Thanks. I hope everybody has a nice Memorial Day weekend, and we'll talk to you all again soon. 
Operator: Thank you. This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.

===== 2022 Q4  (2023-03-09 16:30:00) =====

As always, the IR team will be available for any follow-up questions after the call.
 Now I'd like to turn the call over to Dave. Dave? 
David Kimbell: Thank you, Kiley, and good afternoon, everyone. We appreciate your interest in Ulta Beauty. Our fourth quarter was a strong end to a record-setting year. For the first time in our 33-year history, our annual revenue surpassed $10 billion, and our annual net income exceeded $1 billion. In addition, we expanded our loyalty program to more than 40 million members. Achieving such meaningful milestones reflects healthy consumer engagement with the beauty category, the power of Ulta Beauty's highly differentiated model and the impact of our winning culture and outstanding teams.
 The Ulta Beauty team continues to execute with excellence and inspire me daily with their passion and leadership. I want to thank all of our associates for their commitment to delivering great guest experiences and for working together as one team to move our business forward. I am honored to lead such a great company of talented associates who bring our mission, vision and values to life for all of our stakeholders.
 Now to the results. Starting with the fourth quarter, net sales increased 18.2% to $3.2 billion. Operating profit increased to 13.9% of sales, and diluted EPS increased 23.5% to $6.68 per share. Sales of all major categories exceeded our expectations, and we saw solid sales momentum across both our store and digital channels.
 Additionally, we continued to see healthy growth in spend per member across all income demographics. This broad-based strength reflects successful execution of our key fourth quarter events, including holiday, Jumbo Love and Love Your Skin. Our holiday marketing plan, which included new television advertising, engaging storytelling and robust digital and social support, delivered strong guest engagement and drove significant increases in top-of-mind awareness. Our holiday gifting assortment, which was thoughtfully curated across every category and budget, resonated with guests, and our innovative and inclusive gift card program delivered strong double-digit growth across Ulta Beauty-owned and third-party channels.
 Turning to performance by category. All major categories delivered double-digit growth again this quarter, and we increased our market share in prestige beauty versus the fourth quarter last year based on data from the NPD Group.
 Skin care delivered the strongest growth this quarter with double-digit growth in both prestige and mass. Growth in the quarter was primarily driven by serums, moisturizers, acne treatments and holiday gift sets. Guests engaged with newness from brands like Drunk Elephant, The Ordinary and Hero cosmetics. While dermatology-based brands like La Roche-Posay and CeraVe also resonated strongly with guests. Our successful Love Your Skin event also contributed to the category's strong growth.  
 In addition to converting members to the skin care category with prestige skin care offers, we also introduced guests to our wellness assortment with new beauty steals from a variety of brands, including Truly, Love Wellness and Sugarbear.
 The fragrance and bath category delivered another quarter of double-digit growth on top of strong double-digit growth last year. Compelling newness from luxury brands like Burberry, YSL and Dior as well as exclusive newness from Billie Eilish and Ariana Grande including her latest fragrance, MOD, contributed to the positive growth. In addition, the category benefited from strong engagement with our exclusive holiday fragrance gift sets and monthly Fragrance Crush programs.  
 Growth of the makeup category accelerated from the third quarter with double-digit growth in both prestige and mass makeup. Top subcategories were base and lip driven by newness in foundation, concealers and lip balms and glosses. New brands like Fenty Beauty, r.e.m. beauty and recently launched Dior contributed to growth during the quarter, while new products from a wide range of brands, including Tarte, e.l.f., NYX and Clinique also continued to engage guests.
 Finally, hair care delivered double-digit growth driven by newness and innovation focused on hair health. Newer brands like OLAPLEX, MAËLYS and recently launched Donna's Recipe contributed to the quarter's growth. Our Jumbo Love event drove healthy growth for key professional brands like Pureology, Redken and Biolage as well as masstige brands, KRISTIN ESS and Batiste.
 Hair tools continued to experience broad softness as we lapped strong newness last year. Our services business also delivered strong double-digit growth again this quarter, driven by an increase in transactions. Leveraging our CRM capabilities, we continue to welcome new members to services while increasing frequency with members who already engaged in our service offering. And the salon back bar takeovers which give our stylists a unique opportunity to introduce new brands and products to guests, help drive growth and new member acquisition for OUAI and Bumble and bumble.
 Now turning to the full year. Strong consumer demand and outstanding execution by our teams fueled broad-based strength across our business. Net sales for the year increased 18.3% to $10.2 billion. Operating profit increased to 16.1% of sales, and diluted EPS increased 33.5% to a record $24.01 per share.
 In 2021, we introduced a new strategic framework designed to guide our priorities and enable Ulta Beauty to expand our market leadership and drive profitable growth. Let me share a few highlights of the progress we made against this framework in fiscal 2022.
 Our first strategic pillar is to drive growth through an expanded definition of All Things Beauty. And this year, we continued to enhance our offerings to engage and excite beauty enthusiasts. All major categories delivered double-digit comp growth, and we increased our market share in prestige beauty versus fiscal 2021 based on data from the NPD Group.
 We strengthened our assortment with the addition of leading brands in every major category, including Fenty Beauty, Dior, BYOMA and MAËLYS and expanded MAC and Chanel  Beauté into more doors. We also introduced guests to exciting emerging brands, including about-face, Divi, sk*p and Vacation through our Sparked platform.
 We enhanced conscious beauty at Ulta Beauty, ending the year with 300 brands certified in at least 1 conscious beauty pillar and made it easier for guests to identify brands and products that reflect their values in this important space. We added 12 black-owned and founded brands to our assortment and launched our Muse Accelerator program to help early-stage BIPOC brands prepare for retail readiness. And we expanded The Wellness Shop to an additional 330 stores and enhanced our online offering to include intimate wellness.
 Turning now to our second strategic pillar, All In Your World. We're focused on evolving guest experiences through a personalized connected omni-channel ecosystem. In fiscal 2022, we continued to enhance the guest experience across all our touch points. We expanded our physical footprint, opening 47 new stores and renovating or relocating 32 stores. We relaunched makeup services and introduced new salon services, including curl-specific treatments and extensions. These enhancements, combined with record-setting stylist productivity and increased transactions, resulted in strong double-digit growth for our services business.
 Reflecting our efforts to enhance our buy anywhere, fill anywhere capabilities, we expanded our same-day delivery offering to 6 new markets and delivered significant improvement in guest satisfaction with the BOPIS experience. Between BOPIS, same-day delivery and ship from store capabilities, 31% of our digital orders this year were fulfilled by stores, up from 28% last year.
 We also created new digital experiences through the phased refresh of our digital store and the expansion of virtual try-on capabilities, including GLAMlab Skin Advisor 2.0 and the hair style try-on.
 Finally, our successful partnership with Target continued to grow with the opening of 254 additional Ulta Beauty at Target shop-in-shop locations. We also created a dedicated field team to help unlock greater opportunity with the partnership, and through engaging store visits and communications, this team had a positive impact on staffing, training and loyalty.
 Moving to our third strategic pillar, expanding and deepening our engagement with guests by ensuring Ulta Beauty operates at the heart of the beauty community. During the year, we continued to drive guest love, loyalty and share of wallet, and our efforts created stronger, more emotional connections with our guests. Overall, unaided awareness grew significantly with meaningful gains among key audiences including Gen Z, Hispanic and Black beauty consumers.
 Importantly, we increased the number of active members in our loyalty program by more than 3 million members, ending fiscal 2022 with a record-breaking 40.2 million Ultamate Reward members, who shopped more frequently and spent more with us on average. And we launched our retail media network, UB Media, with a dedicated sales team and supported by new processes and tools.
 Our fourth strategic pillar is to drive operational excellence and optimization to enable us to capture additional market share on guest experience enhancements and deliver future profitable growth.  In fiscal 2022, we made progress on a number of initiatives that will enable us to scale more easily, including successfully executing Phase 1 of Project SOAR, our 3-year effort to upgrade our enterprise resource planning platform on time and on budget.
 In addition to successfully navigating inflationary pressures in wages and fuel, we initiated a multiyear supply chain optimization effort, breaking ground on our first market fulfillment center and beginning the planned retrofit of our Greenwood distribution center. Both facilities are on track to be fully operational in fiscal 2023.  
 Our winning culture is key to driving our success, so our fifth strategic pillar is focused on protecting and cultivating our world-class culture and talent. Our vision is to create a highly aligned, engaged workforce and an inclusive workplace that creates opportunities for our people and our business, and I am proud of the progress we made last year.
 With strong participation rates in our annual company-wide engagement survey, our overall engagement remains high and continued to exceed retail benchmarks. And our investments in our team and culture enabled us to promote more than 11,000 associates into new roles and improve associate retention across the enterprise.
 Finally, our sixth strategic pillar is to expand our environmental and social impact. As the largest U.S. beauty retailer, we can influence how the world sees beauty while driving positive impact. In fiscal 2022, we delivered on our DEI commitments by investing $50 million across our major areas of focus, including multicultural media to amplify underrepresented voices, dedicated support for BIPOC brands, and associate training to reinforce inclusivity and address unconscious bias.
 On the environmental side, we continue to reduce our energy usage through the expansion of our LED lighting retrofit program to an additional 100 stores and our Chambersburg DC as well as additional energy efficiency project in select stores. We also enhanced our ESG disclosures in our second ESG report and submitted emissions targets to The Science Based Target Initiative, a globally recognized organization that validates these targets.
 Fiscal 2022 was an outstanding year, and I am incredibly proud of our associates' dedication to delivering value for all stakeholders while building the foundation for the future. As we move into fiscal 2023, we remain optimistic about the strength and resiliency of the beauty category and the opportunities for Ulta Beauty. Over the last 2 years, the U.S. beauty category experienced unprecedented growth, reflecting various factors such as product innovation, expanding regimens, new social media platforms, return to work and resumed social activities, and the elevated connection between beauty and overall self-care.
 In addition to these consumer drivers, an elevated level of price increases also contributed to growth for the category. While some are unique to the post-pandemic recovery, we believe other factors will continue driving growth for the category. Importantly, consumer engagement with beauty is stronger than ever and is more connected with wellness. These factors give us confidence that the growth of the U.S. beauty category will remain healthy but moderate to the higher end of the category's historical annual growth rate of between 2% and 5%, barring a major economic event.
 Building on the progress made in fiscal 2022, we intend to continue executing against our strategic framework to further expand our market leadership, drive profitable growth and transform our business for the future in fiscal 2023. Starting with our consumer-centric strategic pillars, we will continue to innovate, evolve and expand All Things Beauty to excite and engage the beauty enthusiast. Today, Ulta Beauty is the preferred destination for mass and prestige beauty. To maintain this leadership and capture additional market share, we will continue to add relevant brands to our assortment across categories and price points.
 Additionally, building on customer insights and strong engagement with our current portfolio of luxury brands, we see luxury beauty as an emerging opportunity. In fiscal 2023, we will expand our luxury beauty offering with an engaging experience in select stores and an elevated presence on ulta.com. In addition to strengthening our core assortment, we will continue to expand, evolve and amplify our cross-category platforms, including Conscious Beauty, our BIPOC-founded brands, The Wellness Shop and Sparked, our emerging brands platform.
 As we meet beauty enthusiasts, wherever they are in their beauty journey, All In Your World, we will continue to invest in our omni-channel experiences. Our physical footprint is a strategic advantage, and we plan to open 25 to 30 net new stores and remodel or relocate 20 to 30 stores throughout the year. As we expand our physical footprint, we will also accelerate growth across digital platforms, supported by the completed transition of our digital store to a modern technology and architecture as well as the expansion of our buy anywhere, fill anywhere capabilities.
 Our partnership with Target will continue to expand as we support additional Ulta Beauty at Target shops, evolve the assortment and leverage our dedicated field team to deliver elevated guest experiences. This newest touch point is introducing new guests to Ulta Beauty, and we intend to leverage our customer insights and CRM capabilities to continue driving additional member acquisition and bounce back to Ulta Beauty.
 To operate at the heart of the beauty community, we will continue to create and nurture authentic meaningful connections with our guests to drive stronger relevance and brand consideration, especially with key constituents. We plan to expand the power of our loyalty program by enhancing our media mix to acquire new members and elevate the loyalty program throughout our digital shopping experience.
 We plan to leverage our analytics and data insights further to reactivate lapsed guests, increased retention and shift share of wallet. And we intend to leverage our digital and physical assets to drive greater omni-channel member penetration. Finally, we plan to accelerate UB Media to capture greater demand from our brand partners. Building on the foundation established in 2022, we will offer new opportunities on Ulta-owned properties and enhanced existing products with advanced reporting and optimized audience selection.
 Turning now to our operational excellence and optimization efforts. In fiscal 2023, we plan to implement the next phase of Project SOAR, transitioning key supply chain and merchandising processes to the new platform. We will continue our supply chain optimization efforts as we complete the retrofit of our Greenwood DC and the opening of our first market fulfillment center. In addition, we will begin the retrofit of our Dallas DC and construction of our second market fulfillment center here in Bolingbrook, Illinois. This new facility will replace our existing Romeoville facility and transition our experienced team to a new state-of-the-art facility. In addition to these transformation initiatives, we will leverage our established continuous improvement capabilities to drive additional cost efficiencies.
 Our success is enabled by our world-class culture. Values-based and anchored in caring for each other, the Ulta Beauty culture attracts and retains top talent who deliver great guest experiences across multiple channels every day. To protect and cultivate our culture and enable future business performance, we will invest purposefully in our associates and teams. This year, we plan to modernize our talent strategy and planning practices, enrich our learning and development offerings, and enable a leading DEI ecosystem.
 Finally, in 2023, we will stay focused on our environmental and social impact. Being good stewards of resources, taking care of each other and creating a positive impact on the world is part of our DNA, and our ESG priorities are integrated into our guest-facing, operational excellence and culture strategies.
 Building on progress made to date, we expect The Science Based Targets Initiative to take action on our submission in the first quarter, and based on their feedback, we plan to develop a road map to achieve our emission reduction targets. We also plan to launch packaging, recycling and reusable bag pilots as we explore ways to support a more sustainable beauty industry. We will continue working to expand our DEI efforts to amplify underrepresented voices, support Black entrepreneurs in the business industry, ensure inclusivity remains a top priority in every guest engagement, and foster an inclusive bias-free and equitable workplace for all associates.
 And we will continue to strengthen our corporate governance practices. Over the last several years, our Board has updated our governance guidelines to better express our commitment to diversity, implemented an age limit for directors to encourage Board refreshment and updated committee charters to address oversight of ESG risks. This year, our Board will propose, for stockholder approval, changes to our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, which, among other things, will declassify the Board and provide for the annual election of each director for 1-year terms.
 If approved, the Board will be fully declassified by our 2025 annual stockholder meeting. These proactive measures reflect our commitment to operating with best-in-class governance practices. More detail about these proposed changes will be provided in our 2023 proxy statements.
 In closing, the Ulta Beauty team delivered an outstanding performance in fiscal 2022, on top of a very strong performance in fiscal '21. As we look to 2023, I am optimistic about our opportunities to expand our market leadership and drive profitable growth. We are leaders in a culturally relevant growing category with a strong proven business model and a winning culture with outstanding associates who are passionate about caring for our guests and each other.
 I remain confident we will continue to lead the category and move beauty forward in ways that have a positive impact on our guests, our associates and the communities we serve.
 And now I will turn the call over to Scott for a discussion of the financial results. Scott? 
Scott Settersten: Thanks, Dave, and good afternoon, everyone. Before I review our financial results, I want to take a moment to express my sincere gratitude to our teams for delivering these exceptional results for our shareholders. We have long known our associates are our competitive advantage, and this year's results are an ongoing reflection of their relentless commitment to our guests and to executing with excellence.
 Now to our fourth quarter results beginning with the income statement. Results for the quarter were well ahead of our expectations, primarily driven by strong holiday sales and robust guest demand, which accelerated post holiday.
 Sales growth across both physical and digital channels were stronger than expected, resulting in less gross margin deleverage than planned and greater SG&A leverage. As a result, operating margin increased to 13.9% for the quarter. Net sales for the quarter increased 18.2%, driven by 15.6% growth in comp sales and strong new store performance.
 In addition, other revenue increased $18 million, primarily due to credit card income growth and an increase in royalty income from our partnership with Target. The growth in comp sales was primarily a result of a 13.6% increase in transactions driven by double-digit growth in store traffic. Average ticket increased 1.8% driven by higher average selling price, which more than offset lower units per transaction. Similar to last quarter, we estimate that product price increases contributed about 500 basis points to the overall comp increase. 
 Looking at the cadence of sales through the quarter, sales moderated in November from the third quarter trend as we lapped more challenging comparisons, but well-executed holiday plans drove strong results and momentum that accelerated in January. Post-holiday results benefited from robust guest traffic in stores and the lapping of weather and impacts from COVID-19 variants during the same period last year. During the quarter, we opened 12 new stores, relocated 1 and remodeled 12 stores.
 For the quarter, gross margin was flat compared to the same period last year at 37.6%. Leverage of fixed costs, favorable channel mix shifts and strong growth in other revenue were offset by higher inventory shrink. The impact of promotional activity was flat compared to last year.
 Consistent with trends we experienced in the first 3 quarters of the year, in the fourth quarter, robust top line growth delivered significant fixed cost leverage. Channel mix was favorable as the penetration of e-commerce sales was about 270 basis points lower than last year, and solid growth in other revenue was primarily driven by increased credit card income and royalties earned through our Target partnership.
 SG&A increased 17% to $763 million. As a percentage of sales, SG&A decreased 20 basis points to 23.6% compared to 23.8% last year, primarily due to leverage in marketing expenses and incentive compensation due to higher sales, partially offset by deleverage of store payroll and benefits and corporate overhead.
 Marketing expenses during the quarter were lower as a percentage of sales compared to the same period last year. As we have discussed on previous calls, this year, we offset the incremental marketing expense of digital campaigns we manage for our brand partners with vendor income that is a direct reimbursement for these specific costs within total marketing expense. We will begin to cycle this change in the first quarter of fiscal 2023.
 Incentive compensation drove 50 basis points of leverage in the quarter, primarily driven by higher sales and a shift in the timing of bonus accruals for store associates. Offsetting these benefits, corporate overhead expense was higher than the same period last year, primarily reflecting investments related to our strategic priorities, including Project SOAR and other IT capabilities, UB Media and Ulta Beauty at Target.
 Store payroll and benefits spend in the quarter was higher than last year driven by an increase in the number of store associates and higher average wage rates. Operating margin was 13.9% compared to 13.8% last year. Healthy top line growth driven primarily by stores combined with the impact of our ongoing cost optimization efforts supported better operating margin performance.
 The company's tax rate increased to 24.6% compared to 22.9% in the fourth quarter last year. A higher effective tax rate is primarily due to less benefit from income tax accounting for share-based compensation and state tax credits.
 Diluted GAAP earnings per share increased 23.5% to $6.68 compared to $5.41 last year.
 To recap the full year, net sales increased 18.3% to $10.2 billion. Comp sales increased 15.6% driven by a 10.8% increase in transactions and a 4.3% increase in average ticket. We estimate that product price increases contributed about 400 basis points to the overall comp increase for the year. Operating profit increased to 16.1% of sales primarily driven by strong revenue growth, and diluted EPS increased 33.5% to a record $24.01 per share.
 Moving on to the balance sheet and cash flow statement. Total inventory increased 7% to $1.6 billion compared to $1.5 billion last year. In addition to the impact of 47 new stores, the increase reflects inventory purchases to support new brand launches and brand expansions as well as the impact of inventory cost increases.
 Our well-established business model continues to generate significant cash from operations, including more than $1.4 billion in fiscal 2022. Our capital allocation philosophy remains consistent. Our first priority is to reinvest in our business to drive future growth followed by returning excess cash to our shareholders.
 In fiscal 2022, we invested $312 million in capital expenditures, including approximately $136 million for new stores, remodels and merchandise fixtures, $74 million for IT, $70 million for supply chain, and $32 million for store maintenance and other. Depreciation for the year was $241 million compared to $268 million last year primarily due to a shift of IT investments from capital to cloud expense.
 During the fourth quarter, we repurchased 722,000 shares at a cost of $328 million, bringing total share repurchases to $900 million for the year. Since launching our stock buyback program in 2014, we purchased more than 16 million shares at a weighted average price of $293, effectively returning $4.8 billion to shareholders while continuing to invest in strategic growth drivers.
 Turning to our outlook for fiscal 2023. We ended fiscal 2022 with strong momentum and are confident the U.S. beauty category will remain healthy. Our financial expectations reflect this optimism but are risk adjusted to reflect an uncertain macro environment, increasing competitive pressures and the reality that we will lap 2 years of stronger-than-expected performance.
 Specifically for fiscal 2023, we plan to open between 25 and 30 net new stores and remodel or relocate 20 to 30 existing stores. As we shared on our last earnings call, we are seeing project delays resulting from external real estate and construction issues as well as supply chain disruption for key equipment. We continue to expect to open about 100 stores over the next 2 years, but the timing of openings are expected to shift between fiscal 2023 and 2024 as we navigate these external challenges.
 We expect net sales will increase 7% to 8% with comp sales growth between 4% and 5%. We anticipate comp growth in the first half will be in the upper single-digit range driven by stronger growth in the first quarter and then moderate to low single-digit growth in the second half of the year. We expect operating margin for the year will be between 14.7% and 15% of sales driven primarily by SG&A deleverage, reflecting investments to support our strategic priorities and higher store expenses as well as ongoing wage pressures.
 We expect gross margin will deleverage modestly as we lap benefits from the timing of retail price changes in 2022 and plan for a more normalized promotional environment in 2023. We expect to invest an incremental $60 million to $70 million to support our strategic priorities, including Project SOAR, our digital store and other IT capabilities and UB Media. In fiscal 2022, we invested $52 million to support our strategic agenda.
 These assumptions result in guidance for diluted earnings per share in the range of $24.70 to $25.40 per share, including the impact of approximately $900 million in share repurchases. As a reminder, fiscal 2023 will be a 53-week year. We anticipate the additional week will add between $165 million to $175 million in sales and approximately $0.40 of earnings per share.
 Finally, we plan to spend between $400 million to $475 million in CapEx, including approximately $200 million to $220 million for supply chain and IT; $155 million to $205 million for new stores, remodels and merchandise fixtures; and $45 million to $50 million for store maintenance and other. We expect depreciation for the year will be between $245 million to $250 million.
 In closing, our business has recovered from the pandemic faster than initially expected. Our annual net sales this year exceeded $10 billion, which is 2 years earlier than planned and when combined with our ongoing efforts to optimize our model, has enabled record profitability. In fiscal 2022, operating margin was a record 16.1% of sales as compared to 12.1% in fiscal 2019 driven primarily by fixed cost leverage, higher merchandise margin and other revenue growth, partially offset by shrink and channel mix.
 While stronger revenue growth has resulted in a meaningful improvement compared to pre-pandemic levels, our efforts to optimize our model through this period of disruption are delivering sustainable benefits. As a result, we are updating our expectations for operating margins. We remain confident we can deliver comp sales growth between 3% to 5% but now believe we can maintain operating margins between 14% to 15% of sales over the next few years. We believe the outlook for the beauty category is bright, and we are confident our strategic framework and strong financial foundation will enable us to drive long-term growth and shareholder returns.
 And now I'll turn the call back over to our operator to moderate the Q&A session. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Kate McShane with Goldman Sachs. 
Katharine McShane: I think you mentioned there were 5 points of pricing that you got in the comp for Q4. How should we think about the role of higher prices in the 2023 comp guide? 
David Kimbell: Kate, yes, thanks for the question. Yes, we -- 500 basis points in Q4 similar to Q3. The pricing, what we anticipate for pricing going forward into 2023 is a more normalized level. 2022 is really unprecedented across the category. We believe that, that will return to kind of more steady state level of price increases going forward or at least into 2023.
 So that is included in our comp guidance and is, in part, driving the stronger first half versus second half. As Scott mentioned, high single digits in the first half, lower single digits in the second half. One contributor to that is lapping price increases. Many of them happened through the second quarter into the third quarter last year. So as we lap those, the comparables get a little tougher. So it's incorporated in our guidance, and we anticipate it being at a more moderate normalized rate going forward. 
Operator: Our next question is from Anthony Chukumba with Loop Capital Markets. 
Anthony Chukumba: Congrats on an incredibly strong year. I was intrigued by your comments about, I guess, this luxury department is -- or expanding the luxury beauty offering in select stores and online. What exactly does that look like? Because when I think about Ulta, particularly where you are now versus where you were, let's say, 10 years ago, you have a ton of luxury brands. So if you can just help me sort of dimensionalize that. 
David Kimbell: Absolutely. Thanks for the question. We are excited about the luxury opportunity, and we have been participating in luxury for a while. We've had a long-term relationship with Chanel, among many other brands. But what's evolving and changing is an expanded presence of luxury in select stores and online. We recently launched Dior in makeup and skin care. We had the Dior fragrance business. So Dior is another along with Chanel, key anchors of our expanded luxury business.
 NATASHA DENONA, which is a beautiful and elevated color brand; HOURGLASS, Chanel N°1, Lancôme Absolue, we believe other luxury brands over time, now that complements a portfolio of luxury fragrance brands that we have, including YSL, TOM FORD, Gucci and others. And so the effort here is to make a stronger statement in luxury that further reinforces our All Things Beauty all in one place.
 The idea that you can shop across all price points, all categories and luxury, while we had a presence, we felt there was an opportunity to expand and solidify. And that's the actions we've been taking so far this year, and we're really encouraged by the results of the launch of several of these brands including Dior and excited about the opportunity ahead. 
Operator: Our next question is from Christopher Horvers with JPMorgan. 
Christopher Horvers: So a couple of related questions about the business momentum. You talked about the acceleration in January. If you teased out the Omicron lap and weather, was there an underlying acceleration? You also lapped the launch of Fenty and OLAPLEX into the first quarter. How did that play out relative to your expectations? Did it sort of -- did the business slow in line with the lift that you saw last year? Or did it do better? And then last related question is, as you think about the high single-digit comp guide in the first quarter, are you essentially assuming that from today forward to the balance of the year the business comps in line with the annual guide? 
David Kimbell: Let's see. So a few things in that. First of all, yes, January was elevated, as Scott said there. And there were multiple factors. It's hard to nail down exact drivers, exact -- the exact elements of the contribution, but you mentioned a few, Omicron, lapping Omicron being one of those. And -- but we -- the underlying consumer engagement was strong as we emerged out of holiday. There's no doubt about that. The importance of the category, the elevated connection between beauty and wellness is showing up in January and gives us confidence as we go into the year.
 We are lapping some major launches, OLAPLEX in January. Fenty, actually, the launch happened in Q1 of last year, so that launch was not lapped in January but will be lapped here in the first quarter. And as we look into the year, again, the outlook that we have is 4% to 5% comp growth, stronger in the first half -- higher in the first half, a double digit -- I'm sorry, high single digits -- excuse me, high single digit in the first half of the year, lower single digit in the second half of the year leading to the 4% to 5% comp guidance for the full year. The drivers, again, of that are import pricing, some continued momentum coming out of the strength we saw in January and other factors that lead to a bit stronger in the first half of the year. 
Operator: Our next question is from Adrienne Yih with Barclays. 
Adrienne Yih-Tennant: Congratulations on the quarter and the year and the great start to the new year. David, I guess -- well, actually -- so I'll start with kind of a question about the model itself. So pre-COVID, sales per gross square foot was kind of averaging in the $500 a square foot and at that time, sort of the potential margin at 15%. We're now kind of post COVID in that $800 a square foot range. And it looks like these are new TAM bolt-on services, BIPOC, Conscious Beauty. It doesn't look skin care -- it doesn't seem like there's kind of a replacement or a shift going on. So I'm just wondering if you can kind of talk about the 15% sustainable margin and how we should think about sort of that on a longer-term basis after you get through the investment phase. 
Scott Settersten: Yes, Adrienne. Maybe I'll just give that a slightly different spin. So again, as we said, we're confident that we can deliver now adjusted 14% to 15% operating margin on a 3% to 5% comp for the next few years. Again, we came -- at our Analyst Day back in late fall 2021, we were giving our point of view on the financial model through the end of 2024. So since then, a lot of things have changed. I think less so on the sales drivers because there's a lot -- again, this category provides a lot of opportunities for us to drive the top line through various means.
 Really, the change is versus 2019, a lot are in the infrastructure, the cost infrastructure of the business overall. So you've probably heard us refer to some of this in the past. So we -- of course, we benefited here over the last couple of years from double-digit sales growth, driving a lot of fixed cost leverage across the business. There's also been a more rational promotional environment the last couple of years. And so -- and these elevated sales levels have also mitigated some of the other inflationary cost pressures that we are experiencing across the business.
 So as we look to 2023, we expect sales growth to moderate from where it's been the last couple of years. And so that will -- that's going to drive some deleverage. That's our year-over-year tougher comparisons. We've described that. I mean, as we think about, again, stronger and sustainable operating margins, we just feel like the business is in a much healthier position today than it was back in 2019.
 Again, we've described improved capabilities across the business, like ship from store and BOPIS helping to do that. Our ESG initiative that we started years ago now are continuing to drive significant benefits to the business overall. And we believe that, coupled with some of the new initiatives that we have along the lines of continuous improvement and some of the other long-term strategic investments we're making for the business, help give us comfort that we can hold on to those stronger margins with a 3% to 5% comp over the next few years. 
Operator: Our next question is from Kelly Crago with Citi. 
Kelly Crago: I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about category growth and break down how you're looking at growth by category in F '23. And then just talk about some of the opportunities you have in skin. I think at 17% of sales, you indexed lower than the beauty category overall. So just curious if you have any initiatives in place to expand. I think you talked about maybe eyeing some square footage in stores dedicated to skin care. So anything else from like a brand perspective? Any partnerships there? Would be helpful. 
David Kimbell: Great. Yes. Of course, our assortment is key to our success. One of the things that's really encouraging to us and again, gives us confidence moving forward is our performance has been broad-based. We're seeing double-digit growth across all major categories. And as we look forward into 2023, we see good healthy momentum in each of the categories. So we feel confident.
 And fundamentally, it's driven by a overarching beauty trend and understanding of the power and importance of beauty and how it connects to overall wellness and self-care. That elevated connection, the increased emotional connection and the importance that beauty plays is fueling the entire category. And that's what's helping drive each element in each individual subcategory within the total beauty space.
 So we feel clearly good about what 2022 looked like and have good optimism going forward. A lot of newness, a lot of activity across each of our major categories. We've got newness in makeup and in hair care and fragrance. We'll continue to drive innovation in things we're excited about.
 Skin care is -- as we mentioned in the script, was our fastest-growing category. We had double-digit growth in each category, but skin care led the way. And we feel like there's even more opportunity. We've launched new products like Drunk Elephant. We've had great growth with The Ordinary, Hero Cosmetics. We have in our newest store design that we started rolling out last year. We brought skin care together, and our other categories, makeup with skin care and a more prominent front-of-store location that allows our guests to engage across all price points in a really elevated, beautiful way.
 We're bringing new brands in. We just launched a partnership, an exclusive partnership with Beautycounter, which spans both color and skin care but has a very strong skin care presence. So we'll bring innovation across all parts of the business, and we see strong trends, most of which are rooted in wellness and overall health and self-care, which we think will drive each of the categories in a positive way going into 2023. 
Operator: Our next question is from Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. 
Simeon Gutman: I hope you can hear me, and well done on 2022. Scott, I may have missed this, but I heard modest deleverage on gross margin. I don't know if you gave any framework for that. But if this math is right, down 50 or so, it means SG&A dollars would be up around 8%. And if those are roughly right numbers, can you get us the building blocks to why SG&A is up that much? And then obviously, if gross is down even less, then the dollars are greater. It just seems like a big amount. I'm curious what the building blocks are. 
Scott Settersten: Sure, Simeon. So yes, we expect operating margin is going to be leveraged in fiscal 2023 compared to last year driven by slight deleverage in gross margin, but the primary lever is going to be SG&A. That's where most of the pressure will come from during the year. We expect gross margin, again, modest deleverage there as we lap benefits and the timing of retail price increases during 2022, and we plan for a more normalized promotional environment overall. Those headwinds will probably be offset by growth in other revenue and continued fixed cost leverage.
 So on the SG&A side, it really comes down to continuing our efforts with our strategic investments, our strategic initiatives across the business. So again, last year, we got out of the gates on most all of those things, Project SOAR being the largest by far but Digital Store of the Future, UB Media. There are a number of other digital investments across the business, so really getting into the thick of it, I guess, I would say, during 2023, so that's the primary driver of it.
 But there's also inflationary pressures in store expenses. And of course, we referenced the wage pressure as well, and most of that falls through to our field teams, which is recognized in our SG&A line. So that's it by far.
 I'd say overall, we feel good about where we are. We've got a good plan. We think it's balanced in all ways and takes recognition of both the opportunities we have but also the risks that we see in 2023. 
Operator: Our next question is from Oliver Chen with TD Cowen. 
Jungwon Kim: This is Jonna on for Oliver. Just curious what you're seeing in terms of the promotional environment broader in the industry and you talked about normalizing promo levels. But what are your strategies as you think about 2023? 
David Kimbell: Yes. We -- in the fourth quarter, we saw, we'd call it, rational promotional intensity. It was relatively flat to the previous year, still down versus 2019. And of course, as we -- I guess, we probably have said several times, Q4 is an elevated promotional quarter because of the role of holiday and the gifting and the competition that we have with all gifting, not just within beauty. So -- but nothing extraordinary in Q4.
 As we look into this fiscal year, we do see that continue to normalize. The step down of the improvements that we've made versus 2019 over the last couple of years will moderate somewhat. We won't continue the pace of improvement. We'll see a more normalized level of promotion, not back to previous pre-pandemic levels, but it is a competitive environment. There are added points of distribution, brands, bringing newness and innovation and competing. So we would anticipate, as I said, a somewhat normalized level of promotion but not in a rational level of promotion as we look going forward. 
Operator: Our next question is from Dana Telsey with the Telsey Group. 
Dana Telsey: Making sure you can hear me okay. As you think about the levels of strength that are out there and obviously was incorporated into the results, how are you looking at that for 2023? And what are you baking in? And then just on pricing, where the expectation to go to a more normalized pricing cadence, what do you see in that more normalized pricing cadence of increases? And does it differ by category? 
Kecia Steelman: Maybe I'll start, Dana. Like you're hearing from the broader retail industry, organized retail crime and shrink is a real issue out there, and we're not immune to what's happening. The concern is really twofold. Firstly, it's about safety and well-being of our associates and our guests. The news groups are coming in to the stores. It's really upsetting and can take an emotional toll on everyone that's involved. And secondly, as you mentioned, it's clearly a financial impact to our bottom line. 
 We're continuing to invest in measures to not only deter but catch those who are conducting these activities. So the investments are around increasing our talent level, targeting our payroll in both our store and our loss prevention team, testing new technology, and then also installing new fixtures that can protect some of our key categories. Fragrance is the one we're really leaning into right now.
 What we're seeing is when we're investing in these locked cases in fragrance, we're seeing sales go up and shrink goes down. And our associates are very, very thankful for this because it's really deterring these bad actors from coming into our stores. We're going to be at 75% of the chain by the end of the year with these new fixtures. 
 And then in regards to what the shrink impact is, it's about 70 basis points of headwinds that we had in 2022 to gross margin, and we're proactively taking these steps, as I mentioned before, to make sure that we understand these macro factors are going to continue to persist, but we're looking at only a modest benefit and shrink improvement in 2023. 
David Kimbell: And on the pricing side, we don't see any real differences by category. What we saw in 2022 was really broad-based across categories because the inflationary pressures for brands was -- really impacted all segments. So as we look forward, by normalize, we mean every year in beauty over time, there's a percentage of brands that go through just more standard price increases, and we anticipate kind of going back into that. And we think it will be across categories. 
Operator: Our next question would be from Mark Altschwager with Baird. 
Mark Altschwager: So it sounds like things are going great with Target. Just any color you can provide on the incrementality of that new Target customer that may be returning to Ulta? And then separately, I know there's been some supply chain delays impacting your store openings, but just wondering if you could provide a broader update on how you view the store runway and perhaps how any of the learnings from the Target relationship are impacting the pace of openings over the next few years. 
Kecia Steelman: I'll go ahead and start. And what I would say is that we've got 3 areas of really concentrated efforts in our partnership with the Ulta Beauty and Target partnership. First is about deepening the guest engagement. It's really focusing on new guest acquisition, increasing the spend of the existing linked Circle and Ulta Beauty reward members in engaging that lapsed member. When we see the Ulta Beauty at Target member coming in and engaging with Ulta Beauty itself, what we're seeing is we like what their spend patterns look like. They're at our average spend, if not, even higher. So we like what we're seeing from the ecosystem.
 In regards to new store growth, I mean, listen, we've got competition out there always on in regards to where we're opening up new stores. So we are looking at this as part of the ecosystem where we actually would even have, in some locations, Ulta Beauty at Target in the same center as an Ulta Beauty store. And what we're seeing is that's really -- it's performing very nicely that the customer is shopping in both.
 So while there's competition out there, it's not necessarily playing into what our new store opening guidelines looks like. Maybe you want to weigh in on the supply chain with supplies for new stores. 
Scott Settersten: Yes. So for our new store outlook, our long-term outlook, still 1,500 to 1,700 stores with roughly 800 Ulta Beauty at Target locations on top of that. So again, we're still very comfortable from everything we've seen, the interaction between, as Kecia just described, between the shop in shops and what we're doing in our stand-alone stores, are happy with the overall performance.
 Again, this year, there's just a shift or just smart business, we think, not chasing a number with new store openings and trying to be wise about how we plan that to make sure we keep good disciplines on site selection and the cost ramifications because these are long-term investments. 
David Kimbell: All right. Great. Well, thank you all for your interest and engagement today. And I want to close by thanking all 53,000 Ulta Beauty associates for delivering just excellent financial results in 2022 while executing against our strategic priorities. I am excited about the future of Ulta Beauty and believe firmly in our differentiated business model, strategic framework and talented and committed teams will continue to drive success and create significant shareholder value.
 We look forward to speaking to all of you again when we report results for the first quarter of fiscal 2023 on May 25. Have a good evening and talk to you all soon. Thanks. 
Operator: Thank you. This will conclude today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and thank you for your participation.

===== 2022 Q3  (2022-12-01 16:30:00) =====
Operator: Good afternoon, and welcome to Ulta Beauty's conference call to discuss results for the third quarter of fiscal '22. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. And it is now my pleasure to introduce Ms. Kiley Rawlins, Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you, Ms. Rawlins, please proceed. 
Kiley Rawlins: Thank you, John. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today for our discussion of Ulta Beauty's results for the third quarter of fiscal 2022.

 Now I'll turn the call over to Dave. Dave? 
David Kimbell: Thank you, Kiley, and good afternoon, everyone. We appreciate your interest in Ulta Beauty. The Ulta Beauty team delivered outstanding performance this quarter with strong revenue growth driving operating margin expansion and double-digit earnings growth. We accomplished these results because the Ulta Beauty teams continue to execute at a high level, and I want to thank all of our associates for their commitment to delivering great guest experiences, ensuring operational excellence, strengthening our culture and working together as one team to move our business forward as the leader in beauty.
 For the third quarter, net sales increased 17.2% to $2.3 billion, and comp sales increased 14.6%. Operating margin increased to 15.5% of sales and diluted EPS increased 35.5% to $5.34 per share. Reflecting these results and our updated fourth quarter expectations, we have increased our outlook for the full year. Scott will share more details about our expectations later in the call.
 Our third quarter results are a testament to the resilience of the beauty category and our team's ability to drive strong guest engagement that fueled broad-based growth across our business. All major categories exceeded our expectations, and we increased our market share in Prestige Beauty versus the fiscal third quarter last year based on dollar sales according to point-of-sale data from the NPD Group.
 We delivered growth across our store and digital channels and achieved record loyalty membership of 39 million members. Additionally, we continue to see growth in spend per member across all income demographics.
 Our strategic framework, anchored by the power of our differentiated model, continues to drive our ambitions and successes as we work to expand our market leadership and drive profitable growth. This afternoon, I'll share an update on our progress against several of our strategic pillars.
 Starting with our efforts to drive disruptive growth through an expanded definition of All Things Beauty, our strategy to engage and delight beauty enthusiasts with a thoughtfully curated assortment focused on inclusivity and leading trends is delivering results. Our double-digit comp this quarter was a result of growth from our core assortment, price increases executed this year and compelling newness.
 Although pricing contributed more to our comp than last quarter, the majority of our third quarter comp was fueled by growth from our core assortment and newness. Historically, sales of new products have averaged 20% to 30% of our sales, and the overall mix of newness this year has been in line with our historical experience.
 Turning to performance by category. Skincare, fragrance and bath, haircare and makeup all delivered double-digit comp growth against the third quarter last year. From a segment perspective, we saw double-digit sales growth across both prestige and mass, with mass generally outperforming prestige. While it's hard to know with certainty if we are starting to see consumers trade down, as the only beauty retailer that offers a wide variety of price points from entry level mass to high-end luxury and everything in between, Ulta Beauty is uniquely positioned to capture any consumer shifts within price points in the beauty category.
 Turning to the performance of our core categories, starting with our fastest-growing category, skincare. Beauty enthusiasts are maintaining their skincare routines with a focus on science-backed and dermatologist-recommended products. Guests are engaging with newer brands, like Drunk Elephant, Supergoop! and Good Molecules, while new products from established brands like The Ordinary, Hero Cosmetics and La Roche-Posay also contributed to sales growth.
 To drive discovery and support guest education, this quarter, we introduced our skincare we love wall in all stores. This curated presentation highlights exciting brands and best-selling items across key categories. The fragrance and bath category delivered another impressive quarter as Gen Z guests engaged with the category, leveraging multiple fragrances to express themselves. Recently launched Ulta Beauty exclusive Billie Eilish as well as new scents from Burberry, Gucci and Victor and Ralph drove meaningful sales growth. While our monthly fragrance crush program drove engagement with established brands, including Versace and Jimmy Choo.
 In addition, the category benefited from strong guest engagement with our holiday fragrance gift sets, which were available earlier this year.
 Haircare, our second largest category, delivered solid growth, primarily driven by newness and innovation. Key category trends include hair health, damage repair and targeted treatments. Prestige brands, including [ Vie ] and Briogeo, saw strength in treatments and core assortments, while masstige brands, including Eva Nyc, Batiste and KRISTIN ESS, and professional brands such as Pureology, Redken and Kenra, continued to resonate with guests.
 Within the category, strong hair product growth was offset by softer performance in hair tools as we lapped strong performance last year.
 Finally, our largest category, makeup, delivered double-digit comp growth driven by newness and the strength of our key events, including 21 Days of Beauty and Fall Haul. Growth in foundation, concealers, blush and lip continue to lead the category. New brands like Fenty, r.e.m. beauty and N°1 DE CHANEL drove sales during the quarter, while new products from a wide range of brands, including Clinique, e.l.f. and NYX also contributed to growth. In addition, the expansion of MAC, Chanel Beauté and Bobby Brown into more stores has continued to drive prestige sales.
 Now let me give you an update on our key cross-category platforms. Conscious Beauty, Black-Owned and BIPOC brands and Wellness. With 290 certified brands, Conscious Beauty continues to resonate strongly with beauty enthusiasts, reflecting growing interest in products that are good for the world. This quarter, we certified 15 new brands, including 8 cosmetics, Morphe and DIME Beauty, and introduced the Conscious Beauty essentials kit, featuring minis for more than 15 brands, such as Dermalogica, COOLA and our own Ulta Beauty Collection.
 During the quarter, we expanded our BIPOC brand assortment with 4 new BIPOC brands: [indiscernible], BREAD BEAUTY SUPPLY, sugardoh and Undefined Beauty. As another way we look to create foundational industry change, we proudly launched our MUSE Accelerator program to support early-stage BIPOC brands as they prepare for retail readiness. Our inaugural class included 8 BIPOC founders, with innovative brands across skin care, makeup, fragrance, haircare and wellness.
 In addition to financial support, each MUSE Accelerator participant took part in an intensive 10-week training program, learning from Ulta Beauty leaders, industry subject matter experts and leading BIPOC brand owners. We are honored and excited to be a part of their journey as they build their business and expand their reach.
 Finally, we continue to increase our presence in wellness. During the quarter, we further enhanced our assortment to reflect our guest evolving needs. And in September, we expanded our offering to include intimate wellness as the sixth online-only pillar of the wellness shop.
 While wellness represents a small part of our overall business today, we believe it is a significant longer-term growth opportunity given the incrementality of the purchase and the strong emotional connection consumers have with self-care.
 Turning now to our efforts to evolve the omnichannel experience through a connected physical and digital ecosystem, all in your world. Store traffic trends accelerated this quarter and exceeded pre-pandemic levels for the first time, representing an important milestone in our COVID recovery. In addition to strong sales growth from stores, we continue to deliver growth in e-commerce, further reinforcing the incrementality of this important channel. The convenience of BOPIS for e-commerce orders continues to resonate with guests. During the quarter, BOPIS increased 18% to 23% of e-commerce sales, compared to 20% last year. Our services business accelerated and delivered another quarter of double-digit comp growth, primarily due to higher stylist retention, increased stylist productivity and increased capacity in our salons as we lap capacity constraints due to the pandemic.
 Our targeted CRM efforts to drive awareness, trial and frequency are working, delivering increases in salon appointments from both existing and new members. Additionally, our in-store back bar events continue to drive product attachment and new guest acquisition for participating brands.
 As industry leaders, we're always working to enhance guest experiences across all of our platforms. During the quarter, we introduced a new layout in about a dozen stores to showcase our categories better, improve navigation, enhance the services experience and create more opportunities for discovery. The most noticeable changes include the repositioning of skincare, an important growth category. To the front of the store. All products grew by category with delineated fixtures and visuals and a flow from prestige to masstige to mass. 
 Elevated gondolas that showcase key iconic and service brands, new beauty bars that offer our brow and makeup services as well as supporting in-store events, dedicated space in the front of the store to feature brand and product launches across categories and a relocated checkout closer to the salon. We are excited to introduce this new store layout to guest. And as we've done in the past, we intend to introduce this new experience in new stores, remodels and relocations. At this time, we have no plans to retrofit existing stores.
 Stores are a critical part of our ecosystem. And while most Ulta Beauty's transactions occur in-stores, we know the guest journey often begins online. To assist guests along their journey, we offer a suite of virtual digital tools, including GLAMlab, Skin Advisor and our hairstyle tool, among others. 
 The latest addition is a fragrance finder designed to help guests explore fragrances by favorite brand or ingredient, launched just in time for the holiday season. Finally, we continue to be excited about the long-term opportunity with our strategic Target partnership. This touch point enables us to connect and reconnect with members. And while the partnership isn't material yet to our overall member growth, it has contributed positively. Importantly, we are seeing members bounce back to Ulta Beauty after becoming an active member while at the Ulta Beauty at Target shop.
 Now let me give you an update on some of the steps we're taking to drive love, loyalty and emotional connection with Ulta Beauty. Recognizing the beauty is personal, we are on a multiyear journey to create stronger, more emotional connections with our guests and bring our brand purpose to life. Launched in September, our latest brand building campaign Beauty And is rooted in insights from cultural leaders and beauty enthusiasts. The creative content on owned and paid channels has driven broad improvement in top-of-mind awareness and is resonating with our guests, particularly Black and Latinx beauty enthusiasts.
 Turning to our loyalty program. Our efforts to nurture loyalty in personalized ways is driving member growth and delivering incremental value. We ended the quarter with 39 million active members, 9% higher than the third quarter last year. Overall spend per member increased driven by increased frequency and higher average ticket. While price increases are having an impact, we are encouraged to see unit growth per member. Our loyalty program is a strategic asset and an important driver of our long-term growth. We prioritize member engagement, loyalty and retention across every Ulta Beauty touch point. The growth and strength of our loyalty program starts with ensuring that our existing guests stay engaged. Nurturing our existing members through our Member Love events and life cycle marketing strategies has enabled us to maintain healthy retention rates, which have contributed to member growth and higher spend per member.
 Member reactivation remains a priority, and we are leveraging CRM tools to personalize offers and reengage members in more targeted ways. And, of course, conversion of new members also contributes to overall member growth, and we continue to acquire new members in our stores, digital platforms and through our partnership with Target.
 Shifting now to our plans and expectations for holiday. The holiday season is in full flow, and our teams are executing well. While predicting holiday shopping patterns this year is challenging, I am optimistic about the opportunity for Ulta Beauty this holiday season. Our engaging holiday messaging, one-of-a-kind assortment, with exceptional seasonal options and diverse touch points, all paired with our team's unrelenting passion for delivering great guest experiences, position us well to deliver another successful holiday season.
 Grounded and robust consumer insights, our holiday marketing strategy positions Ulta Beauty as the place for gifting, glamming and self-care this season. Our intent is to empower guests to celebrate the season however they want. And our integrated media plan for the holiday aims to build broad awareness of Ulta Beauty as a holiday destination, spark connection with key audiences, leverage our beauty expertise and drive consideration and purchase.
 Our merchandising team has built an outstanding holiday gifting assortment, whether guests want to gift others or treat themselves, we have thoughtfully curated options across every category and budget, with a balanced approach to the mix of seasonal holiday items and core items that make great gifts. We entered the holiday season with well-staffed stores and DCs, and our teams are excited, engaged and ready.
 For the first time since 2019, our store teams gathered in person to review our holiday strategies. And I know their excitement and enthusiasm for our plans will be felt in every guest interaction. And our corporate and DC teams have worked cross-functionally to ensure Ulta Beauty is positioned to deliver for our store teams and our guests.
 In closing, I am incredibly proud of our year-to-date results, and I'm excited about our holiday plans. Even as consumers continue to navigate economic headwinds, we believe the beauty category will remain resilient, and we are confident that our differentiated model and growth strategy, combined with our outstanding associates, will continue to position Ulta Beauty as the preferred beauty destination.
 And now I will turn the call over to Scott for a discussion of the financial results. Scott? 
Scott Settersten: Thanks, Dave, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, we reported results that were better than our initial expectations. Strong double-digit revenue growth resulted in record-setting third quarter operating margin performance. These excellent results reflect the continued focus and hard work of our store, DC and corporate teams. And I want to thank all of our Ulta Beauty associates for working together to deliver another outstanding quarter for our shareholders.
 Now to the financial results, starting with the income statement. Net sales for the quarter increased 17.2% driven by comp sales growth of 14.6% and strong new store performance. In addition, other revenue increased $20 million, primarily due to credit card income growth, higher loyalty point redemptions and an increase in royalty income from our partnership with Target.
 Breaking down the comp performance further, comp transactions for the quarter increased 10.7%, primarily driven by strong growth from in-store transactions. Average ticket increased 3.5% due to an increase in average selling price partially offset by slightly lower average units per transaction. The increase in average selling price primarily reflects the impact of retail price increases executed this year. We estimate that price increases contributed about 500 basis points to the overall comp increase. While average units per transaction was slightly lower than last year, the total number of units sold increased about 10% on a comp basis.
 During the quarter, we opened 18 new stores, relocated one store and remodeled 8 stores. For the quarter, gross margin increased 160 basis points to 41.2% of sales compared to 39.6% last year. The increase was primarily due to the leverage of store fixed costs, other revenue growth and higher merchandise margin partially offset by higher inventory shrink. Robust top line growth and benefits from our ongoing occupancy cost optimization efforts resulted in healthy leverage of store fixed costs.
 The improvement in merchandise margin was primarily due to benefits resulting from the timing of retail price changes partially offset by brand mix. As we have discussed, we have executed a number of price increases from our brand partners this year. Generally, when the new price is effective at the shelf, we are still selling the inventory purchased at the lower cost. As a result, there's a short-term benefit to cost of goods as we move through the lower cost inventory.
 As expected, our promotional activity increased from the second quarter, but the impact to margin was not meaningful compared to last year. SG&A increased 18.6% to $597.2 million. As a percentage of sales, SG&A increased 30 basis points to 25.5% compared to 25.2% last year, primarily due to increases in store payroll and benefits and corporate overhead partially offset by lower marketing expenses.
 Store payroll and benefits deleverage this quarter primarily due to increased labor hours to maintain service standards, higher average wage rates to support recruitment and retention and a timing shift of incentive compensation accruals.
 Corporate overhead expense deleveraged in the quarter, primarily reflecting investments related to our strategic priorities including Project SOAR and other IT capabilities, UB Media and Ulta Beauty at Target. These headwinds were partially offset by lower marketing expense. As we have discussed on previous calls, this year, we are offsetting the incremental marketing expense of digital campaigns we manage for our brand partners, with vendor income that is a direct reimbursement for these specific costs within total marketing expense.
 Similar to what we saw in the first half, this resulted in about 70 basis points of favorable impact to SG&A in the quarter. Operating income for the quarter increased 27.3% to $361.9 million. As a percentage of sales, operating margin increased 130 basis points to 15.5% of sales compared to 14.2% last year. Diluted GAAP earnings per share increased 35.5% to $5.34 per share, compared to $3.94 per share last year.
 Moving to the balance sheet and cash flow. Total inventory increased 10.3%. In addition to the impact of 41 additional stores, the increase reflects purchases to support key brand launches and increases in inventory costs as well as ongoing efforts to maintain strong in-stock to support expected demand.
 Capital expenditures in the quarter were $83.5 million compared to $51.1 million last year. The increase was primarily related to investments in new remodeled and relocated stores, IT projects and merchandising improvements.
 Depreciation was $58.5 million compared to $65.2 million last year, primarily due to a shift of IT investments from capital to cloud expense. We ended the quarter with $250.6 million in cash and cash equivalents. During the quarter, we repurchased 340,000 shares at a cost of $137.5 million. At the end of the third quarter, we had $1.4 billion remaining under our current $2 billion repurchase authorization.
 Turning now to our outlook. We have raised our financial guidance for fiscal 2022 to reflect our strong third quarter performance and increased expectations for the fourth quarter. We now expect net sales for the year will be between $9.95 billion and $10 billion, with comp sales growth between 12.6% and 13.2%. This guidance reflects our expectation that fourth quarter comp growth will be between 6% and 8%, up from our previous expectation for low single-digit increase.
 Sales growth moderated in November as we lapped last year's strong performance, but we are pleased with the sales trends we saw through the Thanksgiving holiday shopping weekend, including Cyber Monday. We still have several important weeks left in the holiday season, and the operating environment continues to be dynamic. Our Q4 comp outlook, reflects both the expected resilience of the beauty category as well as potential risks from shifts in consumer spending, increased points of distribution for Prestige Beauty and higher promotional activity.
 For the year, we plan to open approximately 47 net new stores and remodel or relocate 33 stores. Our new store performance continues to be strong. But like many other major retailers, we are seeing project delays resulting from external real estate and construction issues as well as supply chain disruption for key equipment. These external factors have impacted our fiscal 2022 plans and will likely shift new stores originally planned for fiscal 2023 into 2024. We continue to expect to open about 100 stores over the next 2 years, but the timing of opening between fiscal 2023 and 2024 may shift as we navigate these external challenges.
 The operating environment is fluid, and we will provide specific targets for fiscal 2023 when we report in March. We now expect operating margins for the year will be between 15.5% and 15.6% of sales. We expect gross margin for the year will increase with leverage of fixed costs and growth in other revenue partially offset by lower merchandise margin, higher shrink and higher supply chain costs. We continue to expect SG&A expense for the year will increase between 15% and 16% or approximately flat as a percentage of sales, driven primarily by $60 million to $65 million of expenses related to our strategic priorities as well as higher wage rate growth across the enterprise, partially offset by lower marketing expense. Reflecting these assumptions, we now expect diluted earnings per share for the year will be between $22.60 and $22.90.
 One final update. We now expect to spend between $300 million and $350 million in CapEx in fiscal 2022, including approximately $160 million for supply chain and IT; $140 million for new stores, remodels and merchandise fixtures; and about $30 million for store maintenance and other. We expect depreciation for the year will be around $250 million.
 While we are not providing guidance for next year on this call, we want to share some high-level thoughts for your consideration as you model fiscal 2023. The beauty category has been stronger this year than expected. Barring a major economic event, we would expect category growth to continue in 2023, albeit at lower rates, reflecting strong consumer engagement with the category, and we remain confident we can deliver comp sales growth in fiscal 2023 within our longer-term targeted range of 3% to 5%.
 In this sales scenario, we would expect operating margin deleverage versus our fiscal 2022 guidance. In addition to inflationary pressures on wage rates and other operational expenses, we expect to increase investment spending related to our strategic priorities, reflecting timing shifts from fiscal 2022 and the planned ramp-up of key IT and supply chain investments.
 Finally, fiscal 2023 will be a 53-week year for Ulta Beauty. We are still finalizing our budget for fiscal 2023 and plan to provide specific financial guidance and update our longer-term growth targets, if appropriate, on our March earnings call.
 And now I'll turn the call back over to our operator to moderate the Q&A session. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Steven Forbes with Guggenheim Securities. 
Steven Forbes: Dave, Scott, I wanted to focus and start with member engagement. But Dave, curious if you can expand on how member engagement trends within the recent member cohorts differ or I guess, are similar from the more mature cohorts in terms of retention, repeat behavior, the maturation of wallet share, channel preferences, really just any color that helps maybe underpin your conviction for a positive comp outlook next year. 
David Kimbell: Great. Thanks, Steve. Yes, as I said in the remarks, our loyalty program, our membership is vital and critical to our long-term success and one that we're extremely proud of what we've built the relationship that we have with our guests. Yes, I guess, a few things that I'd call out. Naturally, our longer tenured. You get -- if you're tenured 3-plus years, we see kind of a higher level of retention, higher level of engagement that tends to grow over time. Greater percentage of our guests, the longer they're here, move into our higher levels, platinum and diamond levels. So naturally, with that tenure comes greater engagement.
 And as I mentioned, one of the drivers of our third quarter growth, 9% growth in our total membership was healthy retention and it's been a big focus for our entire team. Our loyalty team, our store teams, our digital, everybody that participates into delivering a great experience. So that's key and really job one is engaging and retaining our existing guests.
 Our newer members that we acquire in stores, online and increasingly with our partnership with Target play an important role. Their spend per member makes sense. It's on average lower, and we work hard to get them into the full Ulta Beauty experience. Often they enter into one category or one experience. They might come in store, we try to move them online. They might come in to makeup, we try to move them into skincare, get them into services. We have a full suite of activities and experiences designed to engage our new members through -- and including their what we call their sophomore year, their second year with us, which is important pivot year into long-term retention.
 So we look across all spectrum, what we're excited about now and encouraged by is we're seeing strength across all sectors, all income demographics, all geographies. We have a healthy member base. That's what's driving the 9% growth in our loyalty and of course that, in turn, played a big role in the sales performance we had in the third quarter. 
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Ike Boruchow with Wells Fargo. 
Irwin Boruchow: Congrats, great quarter. I guess, Scott, I was going to focus on the margins with you. Merch margin is better in 3Q. It sounds like you're off to a good start on the promotional side in 4Q as well. You're going to end the -- I mean, it's a good problem to have, you're going to end the year closer to 16% margins. Your long-term target is 13% to 14%.
 I guess, just with merch margins as elevated as they are and as healthy as they are, are you guys starting to think more longer term about the AUR dynamics in the business and maybe that this elevated level of merch margin that you're at might be more sustainable than maybe what you had originally thought and maybe that 13% to 14% actually can move a bit higher? I mean it more is a high-level question, not necessarily 2023, but that's kind of where I was coming from. 
Scott Settersten: Yes. Thanks, Ike. I think probably gets to a larger picture versus the AUR piece of your question there. So let me start it, because I know this is at the top of the list for all investors right now as we're thinking about next year. So let me start by saying we are very proud of what the Ulta Beauty team has been able to deliver over the last several years with respect to our operating margin profile overall.
 We continue to lead the beauty category, capture market share gains and deliver some of the strongest operating margins in all of retail, while also absorbing significant cost pressures driven by an e-commerce business that we doubled the size of since 2019, along with wage pressures, supply chain disruptions, fuel costs and other inflationary pressures across the business. And also continuing to make significant investments to innovate and build a healthy and vibrant business for the long term.
 Having said that, we've been very transparent with investors all year when discussing the continued beauty rebound in 2022, and that sales trends have been much stronger than what we expected back in the fall of 2021 when we provided our long-term financial outlook. And that sales performance is driving stronger-than-expected operating margins driven primarily by fixed cost leverage, price increase benefits and gross margin that are extraordinary this year and more moderate promotion levels and that the sales increases have been outpacing the inflationary cost pressures that we've seen in our business.
 So again, big picture, let me just lay out a couple of the bigger variables here as we're thinking about modeling for next year. So again, back to what we referenced in the script, we do expect we can grow sales next year in line with our longer-term 3% to 5% comp target.
 So on the top line, merchants have done an outstanding job. We feel good about the queue for newness next year. We've got some great things lined up. But we're going to be lapping over some extraordinary newness this year, right, with these leading brands in each of our key categories, Fenty in makeup, Drunk Elephant in skincare and OLAPLEX in haircare, all right?
 Price increase is another major lever. So we're kind of in uncharted territory right now, right? The percentage of our assortment where we've seen increases and the depth of those increases is something we've never experienced in all the years here at Ulta Beauty. So we're going to be cycling over some of that next year, and it's kind of yet to be seen how the consumer is going to react to that over the longer period of time.
 So elasticity and resilient, while it's been resilient so far, there's a question of how far we're able to push this without seeing some kind of impact.
 Lastly, on the top line, I'd say we're going to lean into our very powerful loyalty program, the benefits of our credit card. And of course, we're going to look to continue to see benefit from our Ulta Beauty at Target relationship next year.
 Thinking about the rest of the P&L then on the gross margin piece of it, promotion levels, we think, will likely be higher next year than they have been the last couple of years. Channel mix been kind of a benefit this year because stores, the big bounce back and traffic we've seen in stores has helped, right, some of the margin headwinds that we see from our digital business. Pricing benefits, we -- again, this gross margin benefit from the timing between price versus the inventory change has contributed meaningful benefits this year. And again, some of that will recur next year, but the question is to what significance?
 Wage pressure will continue. Fuel will probably moderate, right? We've seen that here more recently. Supply chain investments will ramp up next year. And of course, UB Media will accelerate, it will step up there. So ramp-up will contribute on the margin line, gross margin line.
 In SG&A, we got store payroll upward pressure on wages, which we expect to continue, maybe not to the same rate we've seen here this year, but certainly will continue upward. Variable cost, inflationary pressures, again, credit card fees, I mean we're seeing it in every part of our business right now. We've been able to mitigate a lot of that. And super high sales increases help camouflage that a bit as well.
 And then, of course, our strategic investments, as we mentioned in the script, we plan to ramp those up, and that's coming in 2023. So other digital investments UB Media and UB at Target as well.
 So we've got mitigating strategies in place, right? You've heard us talk about some of these over the years, and we've demonstrated the company we are able to deliver, we've delivered hundreds of millions of dollars in benefits from our EFG efforts, and we've got plenty of margin enhancement and cost optimization opportunities in front of us, and we're building out new continuous improvement capabilities, which, again, you've heard us talk about are building for the long-term cost optimization of the business.
 So I'll close it up by saying, even in what we see as a more uncertain environment, being with us here into next year, we are well positioned. We've got a strong business model. We are in a great category that's growing and we've got a very -- a business that delivers very healthy margins. And we expect to be able to grow the top line next year even off extraordinary performance in 2021 and '22. So we feel good about where we are. 
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Lorraine Hutchinson with Bank of America. 
Lorraine Maikis: Your sales guidance continues to include pressure from increased points of distribution for prestige. Can you talk about what you're seeing in the fleet when one of these new stores open and how meaningful it is? 
David Kimbell: Yes. We're certainly watching, monitoring, tracking all competitive activity across the landscape. And as I've said before, our focus continues to really be on offense for us to really leverage what we do best, the unique differentiated model we have. Nobody does what Ulta Beauty does. So our competitive strategy is to lead and to drive our business forward. Having said that, we are watching, there are changes. When stores, competitive stores open, depending on the circumstances, the situation, we can see a relatively minor impact. Typically, over time, our business sustains and recovers any short-term impact. So we're confident.
 And again, our focus is on delivering what our experience is. What we found over time is doing that allows us to continue to find growth and deliver an experience that our guest continues to want to find at Ulta Beauty. 
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Ashley Helgans with Jefferies. 
Ashley Helgans: Congrats on the quarter. So we just wanted to ask about the promotional landscape that you've seen heading into holiday. And if you feel discounting at other retailers has been as heavy as initially expected? 
David Kimbell: Yes. I guess we'd say for holiday, a little early to know exactly. I mean we're right in the middle of the battle here, I guess, with our biggest weeks of the holiday period still ahead of us. And we know we've been -- I think we shared this at our last call and really any time we're talking about holiday. Holiday is a more promotional period. The November, December period is different than the other 10 months of the year because the gifting aspects, the idea that we're not just competing with beauty, we're competing with other gift categories across retail.
 The landscape, it's hard for us to judge midstream exactly. What we've been delivering is an aggressive promotional, but not wildly different than what we've done in the past. So we've seen consistency there. So far, we're really encouraged by what we're seeing, feeling like Ulta Beauty is well positioned and competing effectively, but we're also monitoring, tracking and ensuring that we close out this next, I guess, 24, 25 days with excellence as we complete the holiday and that's our focus going forward. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Mike Baker with D.A. Davidson. 
Michael Baker: I just wanted to ask a little bit about cadence, the month throughout the third quarter. And then November, you said it slowed. I guess I'm just wondering, within your 6% to 8% guidance for the fourth quarter, we know the comparisons get easier in December relative to November. Is that contemplated within the guidance? Or maybe another way to ask it is, is November slow? Did it slow below 6% to 8% and you need to pick up to get there? Or is it within that range? 
David Kimbell: Well, what I will say is, first on the third quarter, we saw a strong growth throughout the quarter, although October was modestly -- decelerated modestly, but still double-digit growth in each period of the quarter. As is suggested in our 6% to 8% guidance for the fourth quarter, we're anticipating deceleration from what we saw in the third quarter and really throughout the year. And we've been kind of anticipating this all year as we -- our comps are strong.
 And again, we're in a different type of period in holiday. We're not going to get into specific week-by-week replay yet. We'll -- as I said, we're right in the middle of it. We've got big weeks ahead of us. We'll obviously share, when we share our fourth quarter results, all the details. But what I will say is, again, reflected in the 6% to 8% is an anticipated healthy growth, but not to the level of what we saw in the third quarter, and we're encouraged by what we're seeing so far in the holiday period, knowing that there's a lot of ground still to cover as we complete holiday. And January is a big important period for us as well. So still a lot ahead of us, but encouraged by what we're seeing so far. 
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Adrienne Yih with Barclays. 
Adrienne Yih-Tennant: Great. Scott, I was wondering if you can talk about -- you had mentioned sort of the vendor contribution that was offsetting some of the lower marketing spend. So does that mean that they want to present their brands more aggressively, and therefore, are taking more space either on the 21 Days of Beauty or gift with purchase that type of thing.
 And then I also wanted to know, Dave, at the beginning of the pandemic, you pulled out of the international Canada opening. Now that the domestic business seems to be on pretty good footing, how are you thinking about kind of reentry into that market? 
Scott Settersten: Yes. So I'll start. So the first part of your question, yes, it's an accounting recognition of how the debits and credits flow through the P&L, Adrienne. So there's really nothing related to the vendor choices or how we work or execute any of those kinds of things. It's just accounting convention, matching up expense with income when it's incremental expenses related to these marketing activities and then the rest of it kind of rolls through the gross margin through our inventory accounting. 
David Kimbell: And on your question about Canada and international, as you stated, we obviously stopped that early in the pandemic. Right now, we have no plans, consistent with what we shared at our Analyst Day. No plans to expand internationally at this time, although we are always looking for opportunities to find new growth potential. And so in our future at some point, that's possible, but nothing in our immediate plans for sure. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Korinne Wolfmeyer with Piper Sandler. 
Korinne Wolfmeyer: Congrats on the quarter. So I'd like to expand a little bit on what you're seeing within the specific product categories. I mean you did note pretty strong growth for all categories. But as we head into the early parts here of Q4 and the holiday season, can you talk about kind of specific trends you're seeing for cosmetics, skincare, fragrance? What categories are maybe requiring a little bit heavier promotional activity for holiday? Just any color you can provide there would be helpful. 
David Kimbell: Well, I'll start with saying, yes, we're really encouraged by what we saw in the third quarter. And really, we've seen this trend for the first 3 quarters, a strong growth across all categories, which is obviously a great place to be. The strength we're seeing in our business is not outweighted by one specific category. It's balanced across our portfolio. And it's because we've -- our team across both merchandising, marketing, our stores have done a great job engaging our guests in our entire assortment.
 And so we're excited and encouraged to see strength across -- double-digit growth across all key categories. Each one has unique stories, makeup driven by this increased engagement in social activities, plus strong product trends that are highlighted through social media and new product growth that a spectrum of newness that's really working. So a collection of activity that's coming together, both product newness, marketing newness and engagement opportunities. Skincare continued strength by both science-backed, clinically proven dermatologists recommended solutions. So that engagement that many people elevated through the pandemic has sustained.
 It's actually our fastest-growing category in the third quarter. Haircare, we've been driving that growth as a leader in haircare and strong trends, a healthy portfolio of newness that continues to drive great engagement. And then really all year, pleased with fragrance and bath.
 As I look in the innovation and engagement, I mentioned Gen Z being a part of that and really the whole portfolio working quite well across that important category. As we look in the fourth quarter, again, not getting in -- we won't get into any specifics right now. We're in the middle of holiday. And so there's a lot to cover. I wouldn't say there's anything jumping out uniquely for any category from a promotional standpoint. And we come in really with a focus in the fourth quarter of what we call gifting and glamming. And the gifting component is a mix of holiday-specific, but core items that serve all year long, and the team has done a nice job with a balance there.
 So we feel great about our assortment. It's -- again, we're encouraged by what we're seeing to this point in the holiday and confident that we'll be able to deliver a strong holiday across all of our categories. 
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Olivia Tong with Raymond James. 
Olivia Tong Cheang: I have two questions. First one on newness. Because you had a few brands that really anchored newness, and I would imagine contributed towards the upper end of your average ranges this year, so could you talk about your view on innovation, the level of innovation as you think about the next 12 months versus the prior 12?
 And then you also mentioned in your prepared comments that mass is outperforming for stage, but in your view, wasn't definitively trade down. So could we dig into that a little? Is there more newness in one versus the other? Or any other reason that you think that mass is starting to outperform prestige if it wasn't related to a [ stretched ] consumer? 
David Kimbell: Yes. So just on the broader idea of newness, it's important to our business and the beauty category always. And as I mentioned in our remarks, typically 20% to 30% of sales are new items, and that's the range that we will land this year and anticipate we'll be able to continue to be in that range going forward. As I -- we did -- Scott mentioned, we had some really important new brands in 2022. But we're excited and encouraged by the outlook. This category, both big brands like some mentioned, but also new and emerging brands that take off and connect. I mentioned a couple of those like Good Molecules, among others.
 So we've got a portfolio of brands as we look forward into next year and confident about newness, both new brands and newness from our existing brands. That plays a big role. And as we work with all of them and see their pipeline, we're encouraged by what we're seeing. The trends are strong across each of the categories. And we're seeing healthy growth. And we think newness will play an important part in that going forward, knowing that we've got some of these big brands that Scott mentioned earlier to launch or to lap.
 As it relates to the mass and prestige, we did see mass growing somewhat faster than prestige. But both sides were strong and healthy. So I wouldn't say the strength in mass or the somewhat higher growth in mass as we look at it and do -- and analyze our members didn't come at the expense of prestige. It just a came because mass is strong and there's good newness brands like e.l.f., NYX, Ordinary, La Roche-Posay [indiscernible] strong newness and engagement. And so they're just capturing and growing. But prestige is doing really well, too. So I don't look at them being a little bit higher than prestige as coming at the expense of just their -- several of these brands and some of our bigger brands are hitting the mark and that's working.
 All of our analysis suggests that we have not seen clear	 signs of trade down. But I'd reinforce, if there is that, we are uniquely positioned to deliver and support our guests regardless of what choices they make from a price point. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Lasser with UBS. 
Michael Lasser: Scott, can you help stress test a couple of the key variables that are going to impact Ulta's gross overall operating margin in 2023 between the expense spending that you slated for this year and the step-up that you had originally planned for 2023. Is it reasonable that we think around about that as like a $50 million, 5-0, increase in the next year? And then the second part of the question, you're on pace to have a 15.5% to 15.6% operating margin this year.
 If you were to take the level of promotional activity from 2019 and apply it, all else being equal, to this year, is it reasonable that you would have like a 14.5% operating margin. So a worst case, if promotions go back to 2019 levels, that would be like 100 basis points to the operating margin. 
Scott Settersten: Is this the Michael Lasser that I know? I mean... 
Michael Lasser: I'm trying. 
Scott Settersten: I appreciate your question, Michael. Yes, and I understand. But we can't -- we're not going to piecemeal out the bits and pieces of the variables and the formula for our EBIT margin for next year. It's just -- it's too hard, and that's why we said we would -- we'll update in March if it's appropriate, okay? And we kind of see how 2022 shakes out here in totality. And then look at our '23 plan, which we're in the heat of battle on right now, finalizing here, which the final step of that is as we get finalized through the holiday season, so to see what the numbers look like.
 So we either -- as I've laid out for Ike here a little bit earlier in the call, all the different variables and of course, they're all on wide continuums, right? And so we're doing our best to assess each one of those. And coming up with our best idea of how we think it's going to shake out for next year. Again, we're very optimistic about the long-term options for our business. I mean we're in a great position. We've got lots of levers to push and pull, to deliver healthy operating margins over the long term. 
Kiley Rawlins: John, I think we have time for one more question, please. 
Operator: And the final question comes from the line of Michael Binetti with Credit Suisse. 
Michael Binetti: Congrats on the nice quarter. Maybe since you mentioned it a few times now, how much is shrink versus 2019 as a percent of sales? I'm wondering if that's becoming a meaningful number? And maybe you could just help us orient how much incentive comp influences the margin this year. I don't know if I heard that.
 And I guess, just maybe touching on Ike and Michael's question, you seem to be getting the higher margins the right way here with all the extra sales and gross profit dollars from driving the business and leveraging the fixed costs. You'll be at a revenue level this year we didn't expect to see until 2024, and you're still seeing the algo next year. I know you gave the long list to Ike in the middle of the P&L, but it feels like you earn some upside to the framework at that 13% to 14%. I'm just wondering if you can give us color on what you think relative to the framework you laid out remain structurally higher or what you think needs more investment than what you thought at the Analyst Day framework to bring all those extra dollars down to that 13% and 14%. 
Scott Settersten: Yes, Michael. So working backwards. So the shrink part of your question, I mean, shrink when you think about our category, we are especially susceptible to some of the trends that you see across retail. But that's not new to us. We've been dealing with this since the very early days because of the category we operate in.
 So I want to make sure I say thank you to our teams, to our LP teams, our store operations teams and all the support personnel that have been working hard to try to mitigate the losses that we've seen step up here, accelerate over the last couple of years. Again, when times get tough, shrink goes up. We've seen that in retail over a long period of time.
 On the incentive compensation, I would say, we -- for the year, it's going to be flattish versus 2021. Again, our performance has been super strong this year. And then back to the operating margin question, which everyone has, again, we really can't provide any more quantitative detail at this point in time. I would just point back to the long laundry list of different variables that I described earlier in the call.
 And just that we're a pragmatic team. We're trying to optimize with all the things that we have, the challenges and the opportunities, we're going to do our best to lean in where we can and try to optimize and deliver the best overall financial performance that we're capable of, whether it's the fourth quarter or 2023. You can rely on us for that. 
David Kimbell: All right. With that, I'm going to wrap it up. And I want to first thank you. Thank you for your interest and engagement in Ulta Beauty. And I want to close by thanking our more than 40,000 Ulta Beauty associates for delivering another excellent quarter while also executing against our strategic priorities. Our teams have been working hard to get our stores, digital channels and DCs ready for this holiday season, and I sincerely appreciate their focus and commitment to delivering meaningful guest experiences across every single touch point.
 We hope you all have a happy and healthy holiday season, and we look forward to speaking to all of you again in early March when we report results for fiscal 2022 and share our plans for fiscal 2023. Have a great evening, everybody. Thanks again. 
Operator: This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation, and have a great day.

===== 2022 Q2  (2022-08-25 16:30:00) =====
Operator: Good afternoon, and welcome to Ulta Beauty's conference call to discuss results for the second quarter of fiscal 2022. [Operator Instructions] And as a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. And it is now my pleasure to introduce Ms. Kiley Rawlins, Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you, Ms. Rawlins, please proceed. 
Kiley Rawlins: Thanks, John. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today for our discussion of Ulta Beauty's results for the second quarter of fiscal 2022. Hosting our call are Dave Kimbell, Chief Executive Officer; and Scott Settersten, Chief Financial Officer; Kecia Steelman, Chief Operating Officer, will join us for the Q&A session.
 This afternoon, we announced our financial results for the second quarter. A copy of the press release is available in the Investor Relations section of our website. Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that the statements contained in this conference call, which are not historical facts, may be deemed to constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
 Actual future results may differ materially from those projected in such statements due to a number of risks and uncertainties, all of which are described in the company's filings with the SEC.

 We'll begin this afternoon with prepared remarks from Dave and Scott. Following our prepared comments, we'll open the call for questions. [Operator Instructions] As always, the IR team will be available for any follow-up questions after the call. Now I'll turn the call over to Dave. Dave? 
David Kimbell: Thank you, Kiley, and good afternoon. We appreciate your continued interest in Ulta Beauty. The Ulta Beauty team delivered outstanding performance again this quarter. For the second quarter, net sales increased 16.8% to $2.3 billion. Operating profit increased to 17% of sales and diluted EPS increased 25% to $5.70 per share.
 We continue to be very pleased with the broad-based strength of our business. For the quarter, all major categories exceeded our expectations, and we increased our market share in prestige beauty versus last year based on point-of-sale data from the NPD Group. Sales in stores and digital channels also increased -- exceeded our expectations with both channels delivering solid comp growth in the quarter. And we saw healthy sales gain from members across all income demographics.
 Consumer engagement with beauty remains strong, reflecting a deep emotional connection with the category as well as the continued importance of self-care and wellness. This healthy engagement paired with solid operational execution from our teams, fueled our results. Before we talk about the results, I want to recognize and thank our Ulta Beauty associates. Their collaborative commitment to serving our guests, caring for each other and executing our plans with absolute excellence has enabled us to continue navigating a dynamic environment and deliver outstanding results.
 The strength in our business, despite a turbulent environment reflects the power of our differentiated model and our ability to capitalize on the strength of the overall beauty category. Our unique enduring value proposition continues to drive our success and our strategic framework anchors our focus as we look forward.
 This afternoon, I want to share an update on our strategic progress. Our first strategic priority is to drive disruptive growth through an expanded definition of all things beauty. We engage into light beauty enthusiasts with a curated differentiated assortment focused on inclusivity and leading trends, and this approach continues to deliver results.
 From a category perspective, fragrance and bath, skincare, haircare and makeup all exceeded expectations, delivering double-digit comp growth against the second quarter last year. We are encouraged that the vast majority of our comparable sales growth was fueled by growth from both core and newness with a modest benefit from recently executed price increases.
 As we have discussed on previous calls, we have received a large number of price increases from our brand partners in the first half of this year. Given ongoing cost pressures facing our brand partners, we expect to receive additional increases as we move throughout the rest of the year.
 Turning to the performance of our core categories, starting with our largest category, makeup. Compared to the second quarter of 2021, both prestige and mass makeup delivered double-digit comp growth. As consumers participated in more in-person activities, traveled and increasingly used makeup as a form of self-expression. Guests continue to engage with new brands like Fenty Beauty, R.E.M. Beauty and recently launched About-Face by Halsey, while new products from established brands like Clinique, NYX, e.l.f. and ColourPop also contributed to the sales growth. In addition, the ongoing expansion of MAC and Chanel Beauté into more stores contributed to the strong prestige performance.
 Haircare, our second largest category, delivered another quarter of double-digit growth driven by newness and strong engagement in our semiannual Gorgeous Hair Event, a strategic event designed to acquire new guests, increase existing member spend and drive salon penetration. New brands like OLAPLEX as well as new product launches from [indiscernible] and Living Proof contributed to the category growth in the quarter and the initial launch of Dyson's latest Airwrap styling tool with new features and attachment sold out quickly.
 Guests continue to engage with core professional brands like Redken and Pureology and our salon [ Back Bird ] takeovers drove strong growth with Joico and recently launched Andrew Fitzsimons.
 Skin care was one of our best-performing categories this quarter with both prestige and mass delivering double-digit comp growth, driven by new brands and product innovation. Newness continued to appeal to guests with newer brands such as Drunk Elephant, Fresh, Supergoop! and recently launched Vacation as well as new products from Peach & Lily, OSEA and Hero cosmetics contributing to category growth during the quarter. And Skinfatuation, our monthly skincare program, which works to demystify skin care with educational content and focused themes delivered nice growth for established brands like Tula, Sun Bum, COOLA and Good Molecules.
 The fragrance category again delivered strong double-digit comp growth on top of extraordinary growth last year. Compelling newness and strong engagement with our Mother's Day and Father's Day events contributed to this performance. Recently launched Ulta Beauty exclusive Billie Eilish and Charli D'Amelio Born Dreamer as well as [indiscernible] from Gucci, YSL and Dior drove meaningful sales growth. While our monthly Fragrance Crush program drove greater engagement with established brands like Valentino and [ Armada ].
 In addition, in core category growth, we are investing in 3 cross-category platforms to increase guest engagement and expand our market share. We know consumers seek beauty brands that are good for the world and align with their values. And Conscious Beauty at Ulta Beauty continues to resonate with guests as it addresses these interests.
 At the end of the second quarter, 290 brands offered certified products in at least 1 Conscious Beauty pillar, including newly certified brands, Born Dreamer, About-Face, [indiscernible] and Good Light. To increase the visibility of Conscious Beauty and to make it easier for guests to identify products that align with what is important to them, this quarter we refreshed the landing page on ulta.com and added digital badging to all product pages. Now guests can quickly identify certified brands and products across our Conscious Beauty pillars, whether shopping in stores or on our digital channels.
 Moving to our efforts to expand and support our assortment of BIPOC brands, we are committed to diversifying our assortments, so all guests can see themselves reflected at Ulta Beauty. In addition to continuing to expand our portfolio of BIPOC brands and enhance our marketing support for these brands, we are focused on driving structural change within the beauty industry.
 As the leader in beauty, we believe we have a responsibility to take tangible steps to create foundational industry change through the investment of capital and resources. As such, next month, we will officially launch our MUSE Accelerator program focused on early-stage BIPOC brands. Through this program, we will provide 8 diverse leaders, founders and entrepreneurs with resources, mentorship and support to prepare them for retail readiness. I look forward to sharing more about our inaugural class on future calls.
 Finally, we continue to enhance our wellness shop to support guests as they prioritize self-care. This quarter, we expanded the shop to additional stores and now roughly 750 stores offer guests an elevated cohesive presentation of wellness products to help them easily navigate their personal journey. Today, we offer a curated omni assortment of more than 140 brands, including newly launched brands, Womeness and Olay and more than 700 SKUs to help our guests feel their best inside and out.
 Moving now to our ongoing efforts to evolve the omnichannel experience through a connected physical and digital ecosystem, all in your world. Store traffic trends were strong again this quarter as guests return to in-store shopping and services. While store traffic remained slightly below pre-pandemic levels, the trend continues to improve. Our services business delivered another quarter of double-digit comp growth, primarily due to increased capacity and new service offerings. In addition, we implemented modest price increases for core services in May.
 Notably, member engagement with services accelerated from the first quarter, reflecting our ongoing efforts to amplify our salon services and encourage first-time trial through our Member Love offers. As guests return to stores, they are also engaging in our digital channels. After lapping the tremendous digital acceleration prompted by COVID, our e-commerce channel returned to more normalized growth, delivering mid-single-digit comp growth for the quarter.
 We continue to incentivize guests to try alternative delivery options for e-commerce orders while also investing to improve the guest experience. During the quarter, BOPIS increased 32% to 25% of e-commerce sales compared to 20% last year. Importantly, we saw a significant improvement in guest satisfaction with the BOPIS experience, reflecting the engagement and focus of our store associates. While limited to 12 markets, guests are also increasing their use of our same-day delivery options, and we continue to be pleased with the AOV and profitability metrics of this fulfillment capability. Between BOPIS, same-day delivery and ship from store, more than 1/3 of our digital orders were fulfilled by stores.
 We continue to expand and enhance our guest experience across all channels. In our digital channels, our teams continue to deliver a more seamless experience through what we call our digital store of the future. This quarter, we introduced new, more engaging products on both ulta.com and our mobile app.
 We are also improving our physical store experience. Next month, we plan to introduce a new front of store presentation that will allow us to enhance our ability to support more editorial storytelling around newness, events and trends. And later this fall, we will introduce a new layout in select stores to elevate key growth categories, unify the presentation of skincare and makeup and enhance the store -- the services experience.
 Longer term, we are exploring innovative ways to connect our digital and physical stores and deliver forward-thinking guest experiences. This quarter, we officially launched Prisma Ventures, a $20 million fund focused on investing in early-stage start-ups and emerging tech entrepreneurs who will shape the future of retail and beauty.
 To date, the fund has partnered and invested in a variety of startups to enable greater personalization, including Haut.AI, Adeptmind, Revea and ReStyle. And we recently announced an investment in LUUM, a startup that provides robotic lash extensions, opening new intersections between beauty and robotics.
 Finally, we continue to enhance and expand our partnership with Target. During the second quarter, we opened 59 Ulta Beauty at Target shops, ending the quarter with 186 locations. During the quarter, we refreshed the assortment, expanding the fragrance offering, launched 2 Black-owned brands, Sunday to Sunday and Melanin Haircare and introduce newness from existing brand partners, including Benefit, Morphe and Tula.
 As we anniversary the initial launch of this innovative partnership and reflect on the progress made, we continue to be pleased with overall guest engagement and we are encouraged by the behavior of new members who enter our ecosystem through this new channel. The foundation of our partnership is strong, and we are focused on driving further loyalty conversion to unlock even greater value as we scale.
 Now let me give you an update on some of the steps we're taking to drive love, loyalty and emotional connection with Ulta Beauty. We have been on a multiyear journey to create a stronger, more emotional connection with our guests and bring our brand purpose to life. Beauty is inherently inclusive. Every individual is unique and beauty can help celebrate this uniqueness. As the leader in the category, we want to move beauty forward, making it a force for good for all and inspiring everyone to discover their own possibilities through the power of beauty.
 Building on our previous brand equity work, we are launching a new brand equity campaign, beauty and to celebrate the expansive nature of beauty and empower people to embrace their endless possibilities. The campaign will launch with content across paid, owned and earned media with unique elements that we believe will prompt new culturally relevant conversations about beauty and inspire greater inclusivity and positivity in our industry and the world. This campaign has performed extraordinarily well in consumer testing, and I'm proud of the efforts Ulta Beauty is making to change the way the world sees beauty.
 Turning to our loyalty program. We ended the quarter with 38.2 million active members in our Ultimate Rewards loyalty program, 10% above the second quarter last year. In addition to converting new members and reengaging lapsed members, we are maintaining healthy retention rates, especially among our Diamond and Platinum members. Overall spend per member increased again this quarter, driven by both increased trip frequency and higher average ticket. And our channel metrics remain steady with in-store-only members totaling 76% of members and omnichannel-only members totaling 17%.
 Over the last several years, we have expanded our CRM capabilities and developed stronger life cycle marketing strategies that will allow us to drive loyal shopping behaviors more precisely through promotional activity. Today, we are leveraging predictive decisioning to target strategic member segments with personalized communications and offers to increase frequency and drive higher lifetime value. We are seeing encouraging engagement in these offers, resulting in increases in spend per member. As promotional intensity increases in beauty and across retail, these capabilities enable us to rely less on mass market promotions and leverage more targeted and profitable offers.
 In May, we launched UB Media, our new retail media network and the response from brand partners has been tremendous. Our brand partners are excited about the opportunity to leverage the power of our exclusive first-party data to transform the way they connect with beauty enthusiasts. Our team is ramping up well, and we remain excited about the opportunity to unlock a new income stream and drive sales as we enable our brand partners to engage consumers more effectively.
 In closing, I am incredibly pleased with the strength we have seen across our business so far this year. Our operational and financial performance is a testament to the power of our values-based culture, our business model and the important role beauty plays in our customers' lives. We recognize beauty is not immune to macroeconomic challenges, but the category's deep emotional connection has historically resulted in stronger resilience compared to other discretionary categories. And as our results illustrate, we believe this is even more true today given the importance of self-care and wellness.
 As we look to the future, we know there will be challenges, particularly with the wide-ranging impact of rising inflation, both on our business and our guests. But we remain confident in the resilience of the beauty category and our ability to lead the beauty category and drive long-term profitable growth.
 And now I will turn the call over to Scott for a discussion of the financial results. Scott? 
Scott Settersten: Thanks, Dave, and good afternoon, everyone. As Dave indicated, our second quarter results were better than we expected. Strong sales growth due to several factors, including the resilience of the beauty category, stronger-than-expected sales growth from stores and the impact of new brands, drove better-than-expected performance in gross margin and SG&A leverage, resulting in an operating margin of 17%. These results reflect the hard work and commitment of our associates, and I want to thank all of our teams for staying focused on serving our guests and managing our business through this dynamic operating environment.
 Now to the financial results, starting with the income statement. Net sales for the quarter increased 16.8%, driven by 14.4% growth in comp sales, a $19 million increase in other revenue and strong new store performance. Transactions for the quarter increased 8.3%, primarily driven by growth from stores. Average ticket increased 5.6%, resulting primarily from an increase in average selling price. Average units per transaction were down slightly. The increase in average selling price primarily reflects the impact of product mix and retail price increases executed this year. We estimate that price increases contributed about 300 basis points to the overall comp.
 During the quarter, we opened 7 new stores and relocated 4 stores. For the quarter, gross margin decreased 20 basis points to 40.4% of sales compared to 40.6% last year. Although we had less total promotional activity during the quarter, overall merchandise margin was lower than last year, primarily due to the impact of brand mix and lapping benefits from favorable inventory reserve adjustments in the second quarter last year.
 Gross margin was also negatively impacted by higher inventory shrink primarily due to increased theft across the retail landscape, theft and organized retail crime are increasing, and we are seeing similar trends in our business. We are working diligently to keep our associates and guests safe and to reduce the risk of impact through investment in new fixtures, additional associate training, innovative technology solutions and increased staffing levels.
 We are also working with and supporting retail industry organizations and the Buy Safe Coalition to address opportunities at the legislative level. These gross margin headwinds were partially offset by leverage of fixed costs due to the strong top line growth and an increase in other revenue. Double-digit growth in supply chain costs persisted into the second quarter, driven by increased freight costs and higher wage rates in our distribution centers. Strong top line growth enabled us to mitigate the gross margin impact this quarter but as sales growth moderates, we continue to expect that higher supply chain costs, including fuel costs, which are expected to remain above last year, will be a larger headwind to gross margin in the second half of the year.
 SG&A increased 15.1% to $534.5 million. As a percentage of sales, SG&A decreased 30 basis points to 23.3% compared to 23.6% last year. Lower marketing expense and leverage of store payroll and benefits due to higher sales were partially offset by the leverage of corporate overhead primarily reflecting strategic investments as well as higher incentive compensation, reflecting our strong performance. Year-to-date through the second quarter, we have invested about 1/3 of our plan in support of our strategic initiatives.
 As we discussed last quarter, this year, we are offsetting the incremental marketing expense of the digital campaigns we manage for our brand partners with the vendor income that is a direct reimbursement for these specific costs within total marketing expense. Similar to the first quarter, this resulted in about 70 basis points of favorable impact to SG&A in the second quarter. Operating income increased 17.8% to $391.4 million compared to $332.3 million last year. As a percentage of sales, operating margin increased 10 basis points to 17% compared to 16.9% last year. Diluted GAAP earnings per share increased 25% to $5.70 per share compared to $4.56 per share last year.
 Moving to the balance sheet and cash flow statement. Total inventory increased 15.4% to $1.67 billion compared to $1.44 billion last year. In addition to the impact of 29 additional stores, the increase reflects inventory purchases to support key brand launches and increases in inventory costs as well as ongoing efforts to maintain strong in-stocks of key items to support expected demand.
 Capital expenditures were $49.4 million for the quarter compared to $22.7 million last year. The increase in capital expenditures was primarily related to investments in new, remodeled and relocated stores, supply chain investments and merchandising improvements. Depreciation was $60.9 million compared to $69 million last year, primarily due to a shift of IT investments from capital to cloud expense.
 We ended the quarter with $434.2 million in cash and cash equivalents. During the quarter, we repurchased 798,000 shares at a cost of $301.6 million. At the end of the second quarter, we had $1.6 billion remaining under our current $2 billion repurchase authorization.
 Turning now to our outlook. Reflecting our second quarter performance and sales trends we've experienced so far in August, we are increasing our outlook for fiscal 2022. We now expect net sales to be between $9.65 billion and $9.75 billion, with comp sales growth between 9.5% and 10.5%. Our updated outlook reflects year-to-date trends while continuing to consider uncertainties that could impact the second half of the year, particularly during the holiday season.
 Embedded in our forecast is an expectation for mid-single-digit comp growth in the second half, reflecting the risk of potential shifts in consumer spending due to inflationary pressures, the impact of increased points of distribution for prestige beauty and the likelihood of a more promotional holiday season. We now expect operating margin for the year will be between 14.6% and 14.8% of sales. We expect operating margin will deleverage in the second half as sales growth moderates and cost pressures and planned investments have a greater impact. We expect gross margin expansion for the year with leverage of fixed costs and growth in other revenue, partially offset by lower merchandise margin, higher shrink and higher supply chain costs.
 We continue to expect SG&A expense will deleverage for the year, driven primarily by $60 million to $65 million of expenses related to our strategic priorities, as well as higher wage rate growth across the enterprise, partially offset by lower marketing expense. In addition, we expect inflationary pressure in operating expenses will continue. These assumptions result in updated full year guidance for diluted EPS growth between $20.70 and $21.20.
 One final update. We now expect to spend between $350 million and $400 million in CapEx in fiscal 2022, including approximately $195 million for supply chain and IT, $180 million for new stores, remodels and merchandise fixtures, and about $20 million for store maintenance and other. We expect depreciation for the year will be around $250 million.
 In closing, we are very pleased with our performance year-to-date. While we continue to face uncertainties in the current macro environment, we are focused on delivering great guest experiences and driving sustained profitable growth. Longer term, we believe the beauty category will continue to be resilient, and we are confident that we are differentiated and proven model and growth strategy, combined with our outstanding associates will continue to position Ulta Beauty as the preferred beauty destination.
 And now I'll turn the call back over to our operator to moderate the Q&A session. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Rupesh Parikh with Oppenheimer. 
Rupesh Parikh: Also congrats on a really strong quarter. So I guess I start -- I want to start out with the consumer. So I was curious if you guys are seeing any behavior changes of note and whether you're seeing any side of the trade down or even resistance to price increases? And then just given some concerns out there about volatility and trends, I'm just curious if you're seeing more volatility in the business than what you've seen in the prior months. 
David Kimbell: Rupesh, thanks for the question. Yes, the short answer on trade down is no. We're not experiencing that or seeing that at this time, similar to what we talked about last quarter. We're seeing strong growth across all aspects of our business. As I mentioned, every category performed in double digits, strength across channels, stores, e-comm services. And as we look at income levels of our guests, we're seeing healthy growth at all income levels.
 So no real signs or signals of trade down within the marketplace yet. And again, I think that's a reflection of the importance that this category plays in our guest lives, the increasing connection that beauty has, wellness, the desire to express them -- our guests to express themselves to the world in this -- as the world reopens. So the importance of this category is demonstrating itself. And so, so far, we're not seeing it, but we're prepared as we look forward to continue to make any adjustments if and when that behavior starts to show up, as you know, within our model, we're uniquely prepared to adjust. If any of that does show up with our mass to prestige offering, all price points, all different categories. But as of now, we're seeing strong growth.
 As far as throughout the quarter, the quarter started very strong. We did see a slight moderation towards the end of June and early July as you may have seen with other retailers, but the trends picked up towards the end of the quarter, and we're pleased with what we're seeing so far this quarter. So no big concerns or down trends is across any part of our business right now. 
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Omar Saad with Evercore ISI. 
Omar Saad: So I just want to confirm, a lot of retailers are saying they thought some deceleration beginning around June. It doesn't sound like you guys are seeing that. And then also on the profitability of the business, gross margin sounds like there's a little bit of pressure there versus last year, but last year was so clean. It seems like it's still -- the promotional levels are still well below pre-COVID. Is that a sustainable phenomenon in your opinion? 
David Kimbell: Let me just -- I'll start with the deceleration and Scott can pick up on the gross margin and some of the things we're seeing there. So again, yes, we did -- our quarter in total was strong. We were pleased with the results throughout the quarter. There was a modest slowdown in the trends right at the end of June, early July as a number of things, both, I guess, within retail and in the world around us, we're showing up.
 But again, nothing alarming on our business. And we did see trends return to early in the quarter rates as we got to the end of July and then certainly, as I said, into this quarter. So a modest impact. But again, the category itself, the importance it plays in our guest lives, allowed us to kind of ride through any macro disruption and short-term impacts that we saw throughout the quarter. 
Scott Settersten: And as far as gross margin is concerned, again, we're very happy with the results that the business is generating year-to-date. Our longer-term guidance assumes gross margin is going to moderate somewhat from what we saw last year, again, when we started out with our longer-term algorithm. And again, this year, the sales performance has just been extraordinary.
 So if you're looking at it year-over-year, I'd say product mix has something to do with the variability, UB Media mix and how we're accounting for that in the geography and the P&L has something to do with that. As we look out towards the remainder of 2022, we've been clear about we expect the promotional environment is probably going to get a little bit tougher, especially what we've seen here across the retail universe here most recently.
 So moderation as we look to the future. It's still a lot of great levers we have in the business. When we talk about Project SOAR delivering benefits over the longer term. Our continuous improvement in EFG efforts still with a lot of benefit to generate for the company over the long term.
 So I think operating margin, we feel good about opportunities to continue to leverage there, but we think gross margin will certainly moderate as we look ahead. 
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Dana Telsey with the Telsey Advisory Group. 
Dana Telsey: Congratulations on the nice performance. You had mentioned the services business and the improvement there. Can you talk a little bit about what you're seeing there? What that impact could be? And last -- and then next, just on the price increases that you had put in place. Where are we in the scale of price increases by category? And how do you see it blending out for the year? 
Kecia Steelman: Thanks, Dana. I'll start and then turn it over to Scott. Our salon team delivered strong quarter growth of double-digit comps during the quarter, and really what we saw with some strength in our hair coloring services. We have strength across all geographies and regions, which was great. And the sales were really fairly consistent throughout the quarter.
 What we like what we see is these partnerships with the [ Back Bird Saloon ] takeover event, as Dave was mentioning in his spoken notes that Joico, Andrew Fitzsimons [indiscernible] are examples of where you can have a salon expert and really engage with the consumer to try a new brand that they've never made tried before.
 We're also really driving trial through our personalized offers. So we're getting people to come in and try our services, which is really important. From a staffing perspective, we continue to really invest in our education, in our training for our stylists, particularly focusing on textured hair sales. And then from a pricing perspective, Dave was mentioning, that's not really playing into the comp. This is the first time that we've increased our price in the last 3 years. It was really modest. So really, it's through the growth of the core business and services that's driving that comparable off. So I'm really pleased with how the guest is refining coming out of COVID. Scott? 
Scott Settersten: And price increases as far as product is concerned throughout the channels. Again, where a number of increases in the second quarter, slightly higher than what we saw in the first quarter. We estimate it's about 300 basis points to total comp for the second quarter.
 Again, the number of SKUs that have been impacted and the total all impact to our assortment is higher than we expected early in the year and we expect there to be in the back half of the year. We've already been alerted by some of our vendor partners that there's some in the queue now, and we expect there to be more as we get deeper into the year. So we'll continue to update quantitatively on how that impacts our business and how we're thinking about it maybe for 2023 when we get further down the road. 
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Mark Altschwager with Baird. 
Mark Altschwager: With respect to the recovery you're seeing in the makeup category, what are your current views on whether we're seeing with whether what we are seeing is pent-up replenishment post COVID versus perhaps the early innings of a new innovation-driven cycle that could have some legs to it? And then bigger picture, just based on the trends you're seeing in your business year-to-date and the projections for the year, calling for low teens sales growth at the high end, is the 5% to 7% 3-year CAGR still the right way to be thinking about the medium-term growth outlook? 
David Kimbell: Great, Mark. Yes, on makeup, yes, we're really, really pleased and encouraged with what we're seeing as I mentioned, double-digit growth across mass and prestige. And you know well. You've been following us for a while. That category has had its ups and downs and been struggling for a little bit. And so we're really pleased with the results and we think it's well rounded. There's no doubt there's some elements of maybe pent-up demand, although as we get further into the reopening, we think that's probably a smaller and smaller part of what's driving the business.
 What we do see happening is just strong innovation across  both mass and prestige, really good performance by new brands that we brought in, Fenty, R.E.M., new brand About-Face, great innovation. On the mass side with NYX and ColourPop and e.l.f. and others, but also on the prestige with Benefit, MAC, Clinique and many others. So we're seeing strong innovation that's really connecting.
 And it's being fueled by some core trends that we think are here to stay for a while that are driving engagement. And it's kind of an interesting time within makeup right now that we're seeing a combination of very bold, playful looks, kind of retro looks, euphoria type engagement driven engagement that are reminiscent of some of the things we saw back in 2016 that are encouraging. But at the same time, there's an equally strong trend around a clean look, glowy, glazed, that are driven by higher usage of foundation and highlighters, which are really important to the category and frankly, have been struggling for a little bit.
 So we are pleased with the innovation, the -- as people get out and want to express themselves to the world and there are more occasions that's driving more usage and there's some core underlying trends and innovation that are supporting the category. So we're optimistic about the path ahead, and we'll continue to be investing in our makeup business and partnering with our brands to drive this trend for the foreseeable future.
 As far as our long-term targets, no -- we're not updating or changing that. So yes, the outlook that we shared with you last fall is still on our horizon, and so I'd keep that as our long-term guidance. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Krisztina Katai with Deutsche Bank. 
Krisztina Katai: Congratulations on a very nice quarter. I just wanted to follow up on innovation, especially on the skin care and haircare side of the business, which has been really strong. Can you talk about some of the areas of the business that you are seeing this newness that is driving very strong sequential performance? How we should think about some of the product innovation and just potential launch time for any big launches that are coming up?
 And then secondly, if you could just touch on your expectations and member growth going forward. You're bringing back a lot of lab consumers, are they all back now? Is there still room there to get them back? And then maybe layer in the opportunity that you see from the target partnership? 
David Kimbell: Okay. There's a lot of great stuff to talk about in that. Let me just hit a few of that. First, on innovation. So yes, I talked about makeup, let's hit on skin care and haircare. And it's that kind of highlights one of the aspects of our business that we're really excited about right now is the strength we're seeing across all of our categories, double-digit growth in every category, which, again, I think is a reflection of the strength of our model and the power of beauty right now.
 Within skin care, we're seeing the strong growth that's driven by a combination of new behaviors that were strengthened or developed during COVID around skin health and skincare, new brands that we've launched that continue to drive our business, Drunk Elephant, Fresh, Supergoop!, Vacation, new innovation, great innovation across moisturizers, serums, eye creams, acne by brands like Peach & Lily, OSEA, Hero, so many others, Clinique across the entire assortment.
 The trends that we're seeing in skincare again, we think will help -- will sustain for a while. We continue to see skinification that consumers, including young Gen Z consumers seen the importance of skincare and how that lays the foundation for their overall skin health and their overall look. There is a growth in science or clinically backed or dermatological improvements. So savvy consumers are looking for these active ingredients, and that's been driving a lot of growth. And there's been a lot of innovation around just core hydration as a recognition that, that's healthy skin is driven by that. So many things coming together to drive that double-digit comp in both mass and prestige on skincare.
 Haircare, similarly strong growth we think, in strong engagement, both by newness but also the execution of our programs like Gorgeous Hair Events. We benefited from a number of new brands, including OLAPLEX. We're seeing strong innovation across a number of brands like [indiscernible] and Living Proof. I mentioned Dyson as being a key to our overall haircare and the innovation that they continue to bring. So in that area, it's hair health, much like skin health, continues to resonate and be important and take a priority. There's a growing trend around shine and the treatments and accessories that help drive that. And of course, texture has been a growing and increasingly important part of the category and Ulta Beauty's expression for the last couple of years, and that continues to be strong.
 So we're seeing strong growth, and we think innovation, consumer behaviors, the connection and the importance of these categories much like makeup will help sustain growth as we look into the future. On members, we're really pleased, 10% growth on members for the quarter, a new record high in our member performance driven by guest acquisition, reactivation, retention. Yes, we've reactivated a number of members, but there are more to get. And as high as retention is, there's always some guests that are dropping out for a number of reasons. So there's an always on activity to reactivate members, and we have quite a few a large pool to continue to activate.
 And there's quite a few beauty enthusiasts as big as we've grown, there's a huge pool of beauty enthusiasts that are not yet members of our program, and we think they should be and we're going after them. One of the ways to do that, Kecia through our target program and what we're doing, so do you want to talk a little bit about that? 
Kecia Steelman: Yes, we're really pleased with how our partnership is progressing and the future opportunities that really provide our guests, brand partners Target in Ulta Beauty. We're leaning in. In fact, one of the nuances that we're introducing this next quarter is that we're creating a dedicated field team that as we scale this partnership, they're going to be really focused on training and education with an emphasis really on loyalty and unlocking that loyalty opportunity with not only our existing members, but with new members as they come into the Ulta Beauty at Target.
 So we're excited as we continue to expand and grow, and we feel Ulta Media and Target is another way to drive loyalty members into our ecosystem. 
Operator: And the next question comes from the line of Oliver Chen with Cowen. 
Oliver Chen: Great quarter. As we think in terms of the guidance, what's embedded with respect to pricing? And how would you speak to that against the promotional needs that you'll have fourth quarter is always a very promotional time and you do a lot of great personalization to drive promotions as well?
 And a follow-up on the new layout. There can be disruption and customers don't necessarily like new layouts sometimes and your inventory needs to change. So I would love your thoughts on timing and execution risk and rationale. It sounds like it's a prudent move to focus on categories, but it comes with different risk factors. 
Scott Settersten: Yes. So I'll start that one. So pricing, we said about 300 basis points of price increases reflected in our 2Q results. And all the price increases that we're aware of through our vendor partnerships are embedded in our guidance, right, for the back half of the year. So we feel like we have that framed up well.
 When we think about, again, the second quarter spectacular performance above our expectations. Our updated guidance includes, right, the beat on the second quarter and the trends we've seen so far, early stages of the third quarter.
 When I think about the top line trends, and again, back half of the year, we're going to be lapping some stronger performance last year. We've referenced the competitive environment. We expect that to be tougher as we get into the back half of the year, the promotional environment, again, you know this well, Oliver, in the fourth quarter holiday. We compete with all of retail for gift giving, right? So it's a whole totally different kind of game for a relatively short period of time. So we expect it to be more competitive, more promotional this year than it was a year ago. You've heard us talk about distribution points, additional points of distribution on prestige beauty coming as we get deeper into the year. That's another consideration.
 Then on the operating income side, we referenced the strategic initiative expenses kind of pushing back later into the year. Some of that's due to just shortages of manpower and delay sometimes in shifting some of the hardware that we need to get some of these projects finalized. So again, nothing to be overly concerned with, but there are some delays as there is in all parts of the world right now, it seems. So nothing unusual there. And then some of the costs, right, the increased cost, inflationary pressures we're seeing in the business. It's going to be heavier in the back half of the year than it was the first half of the year. So all in, we think we're in a good place, and it's reasonable -- it's a reasonable estimate of the guide and what we expect for the second half of the year. 
Kecia Steelman: And for new store layouts, we're really focused on our new stores and our planned remodels going forward. While we're always making changes to improving the in-store guest experience, it's been a while since we've really made any significant changes to the store layout itself.
 Just as a point of reference, our -- today, our merchandise is organized by price point with prestige makeup and skin care in 1 side of the store and mass makeup and skin care on the other, with fragrance in the middle and haircare in the back and salon. Going forward, we really want to have a merchandise layout to magnify our differentiated assortment and really better reflect how a guest really shops with consolidated categories and intuitive adjacencies. So we're going to take mass and prestige makeup together in the front of the store with real clear brand delineation and then also reflect the growth of the category and that's important to the guests that moving skincare upfront.
 So the mass and prestige skincare are going to be all together, again with clear brand delineation. So you'll be able to tell the difference between mass and prestige, but it will be organized together the way the guest shops it. We're also going to elevate the front of the store to support more editorial storytelling and newness and events and recent trends. And then we're going to also create this new beauty bar at the center of the store that's really going to amplify the service experience and highlight the beauty attainment that is really happening on the sales floor. We're really excited to see this all come to life later yet this fall. 
Oliver Chen: Great job on the BIPOC initiatives as well. 
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Chris Horvers with JPMorgan. 
Christopher Horvers: As a follow-up question, maybe for Scott, could you talk about how your thoughts on the cadence of the back half changed? It seems like your -- you originally said low single digits for the back half, it seems like you're raising the third quarter comp, but keeping 4Q intact, 3Q gets more leverage. But at the same time, it sounds like you're adding a bit more promotion in the fourth quarter and maybe more investments potentially hitting that fourth quarter as well? 
Scott Settersten: Chris, you don't need me to answer the question. You already figured it all out. So gold star for you today. So I mean, that's it in essence. I mean, again, we talk about guidance and estimates on every one of these calls, people have questions. I mean -- and we really do look at it right up to just before the call. And so what we've seen in the last couple of weeks with sales strength. Again, Dave mentioned this late July bounced back just like how it looked early parts of the quarter. And August, we've kind of continued on the same trend.
 So we're taken up the third quarter, in essence, for the strength there. And we're kind of being careful with the fourth quarter for the reasons we've already stated. We think promotional environment is going to be higher. And so just navigating that balance between the sales line and the margin investment it takes to close that. So that's exactly right. 
Christopher Horvers: Since I answered my own -- since I answered my own question maybe [indiscernible] one in here. I guess maybe can you talk about how the prestige category performed in 2Q versus '19? And was that acceleration relative to what you saw in the first quarter? 
David Kimbell: Yes. The prestige category is up versus 2019. And so we're encouraged by that. You know that prestige has been -- we talked about this had been the laggard, prestige makeup in particular. And now we're seeing that performance come back.
 Compared to 2019, it would still be -- have the kind of the lowest, I guess, performance, incremental performance over that as these other categories have been strong, like hair care and skincare really throughout the last couple of years. But yes, we're pleased with the performance. We've been working on this for a while. As you know, the brands have continued to bring innovation and the combination of changing consumer behaviors, opening up engagement and the innovation that I talked about.
 And I think with -- specifically within Ulta Beauty, as we've -- our merchants have done just a tremendous job evolving our assortment to make sure we have the brands, the products, the innovation that allow us to gain share and lead in the category. So we're pleased with the overall performance and glad to see prestige performing at a high level. 
Operator: And the next question comes from the line of Mark Astrachan with Stifel. 
Mark Astrachan: Just a brief question, I think. curious about the contribution to Ultimate Rewards members from the Target relationship at year-end. Target mentioned, I think it was about $1.5 million guest co-linking accounts from their loyalty program to yours. Are those incremental kind of any learnings that you've gotten as those folks have participated in your program as well? 
David Kimbell: We've mentioned in the past that there's been a large number that have linked their accounts, but we haven't shared specific details on number of new members and break out by that, and we're not planning on doing that now. But as Kecia mentioned, we're just -- we're really encouraged by what we're seeing. We're really pleased with the overall partnership. The execution has been strong. The consumer reaction has been very positive. And the engagement in Ulta Beauty has really been a positive aspect.
 So our focus going forward, as I mentioned in the remarks, is to continue to drive that loyalty. That's key to our success is to engage guests in a new way to touch Ulta Beauty and ultimately get them connected to all aspects. We're encouraged by what we're seeing, and we're focused on driving that well into the future. 
Kiley Rawlins: John, I think we have time for one more question. 
Operator: And the next question comes from the line of Kelly Crago with Citi. 
Kelly Crago: I'm just curious, we did notice that you did sort of layer back in another sort of store-wide 20% off coupon promotion more recently. And I'm just trying to understand that. I know you pulled away from it during 2021 just because the business was so strong and promotions across the board are low. But I'm just curious some of the comments you're saying about back half of the year, whether or not you're sort of seeing that tick and that's a response to an uptick in promotions across beauty. So just curious any thoughts on that and if we should kind of expect that to be layered into your promotional strategy going forward?
 And then secondly, on the same line of thinking, just curious with the promotional environment in some apparel categories and some other categories out there, just wondering if in the past, you've had to sort of step up promotions even if the beauty category has been strong. Have you had to get more promotional during the holiday period in the past? Just curious on your thoughts there. 
David Kimbell: Great. I'm really glad you asked, Kelly. I do want to clarify, I know there's been some comments about a 20% off storewide customer base-wide. That is not -- we have not executed that. We haven't all year executed that.
 And that -- going back in history, we -- that was a trigger that we used frequently. And then pulling that out is core to our strategy of being more purposeful in how we're connecting with our guests. What you may have seen is more targeted. I mentioned how we've been -- you know we've been on this journey of investing in our personalization and our CRM capabilities. So we use a variety of offers, including 20% off but also points offers or newness offers or other broad communication to pinpoint and target subgroups within our typically smaller subgroups based on a specific behavior that we want to incentivize.
 One example might be if it's a Diamond member that hasn't shopped with us all year for several months, that guest may get a 20% off coupon, but it's only a small subset of groups. And we test and learn and we drive and we understand the profitability and return of doing that. So any 20% off has not been. There was an offer just -- if some of you saw this week that came out that was 20% off, that is a comp offer and is not storewide. It is -- we have a strategy within our mass side of the business that is -- as you know, mass tends to be a bit more promotional. So if any of you saw an offer this week that was 20% off, that was not storewide that was focused on our non-prestige side of our business, and we've been doing that particular offer for many years at this time of the year. So that's a comp event. So no incremental offers at this point.
 Now having said that to your second point about promotional intensity going forward. And holidays, Scott has mentioned this as well. We are seeing promotional intensity. That's obviously no surprise to any of you on the call, you're seeing it -- you mentioned Kelly apparel, it's happening just across retail right now. We continue to be focused. And in the second quarter, we're able to decrease our promotional intensity. We haven't layered in any big programs like I mentioned. But as we look forward, particularly going into the holiday, as Scott mentioned, the competitive set expands in gift giving to really all possible gifts, including apparel.
 So we're going to watch that. We are more promotional in the fourth quarter in the holiday historically. We -- and we see that as a strategic move to be competitive and to make sure we're delivering both on the gifting and the gaming side of our business. So we're watching that carefully. And Scott mentioned, that's kind of incorporated in our guidance going forward.
 Okay. So with that, a great question and thank you all again for your interest, and thank you for joining us today. I'll wrap up here. And I want to wrap up by again thanking the entire Ulta Beauty team for their passionate commitment to delivering on our mission, vision and values every day. Our strong performance is the direct result of our store, DC and corporate associates working together as 1 unified Ulta Beauty team to take care of our guests and to take care of each other while driving our business forward.
 So we look forward to speaking to all of you again in early December when we report our third quarter results. Thanks again for joining, and I hope you all have a great evening. 
Operator: Thank you, everyone. This does conclude today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation, and have a great day.

 We'll begin this afternoon with prepared remarks from Dave and Scott. Following our prepared comments, we will open the call for questions. [Operator Instructions] And as always, the IR team will be available for any follow-up questions after the call.
 Now I'd like to turn the call over to Dave. Dave? 
David Kimbell: Thank you, Kiley, and good afternoon. Fiscal 2022 is off to an outstanding start with the Ulta Beauty team delivering another quarter of excellent performance on top of last year's record results.
 For the quarter, net sales increased 21% to $2.3 billion, comp sales increased 18%, operating profit increased to 18.7% of sales and diluted EPS increased 54% to $6.30 per share. During the quarter, all major categories exceeded our expectations, and we increased our market share in Prestige Beauty based on point-of-sale data from the NPD Group.
 We also increased the number of members in our Ultimate Rewards Loyalty Program, introduced innovative digital experiences for our guests and continued to execute major strategic projects, including investments in new stores, supply chain and technology infrastructure, all while successfully navigating supply chain challenges, a tight labor market and operating cost pressures.
 I want to express my sincere appreciation to all of our Ulta Beauty associates for their collaborative efforts to create great guest experiences, execute against our plans and deliver these outstanding results.
 Consumers continue to be highly engaged with the beauty category as they participate in more in-person activities, engage in more travel and lean into experiential spending. And while macroeconomic pressures, such as rising inflation are top of mind for consumers, their resilience and emotional connection to beauty continues to drive the recovery of the category. This consumer demand, paired with strong execution of our strategic priorities, fueled our exceptional results.
 Looking at our operational performance for the quarter, I will focus on the progress we are making with our consumer-facing priorities and then share an update on our optimization efforts. Let's start with our first strategic priority to drive disruptive growth through an expanded definition of All Things Beauty.
 From a category perspective, fragrance and bath, hair care, makeup and skin care all delivered double-digit comp growth against the first quarter last year. Importantly, sales of makeup exceeded pre-pandemic levels in both mass and prestige cosmetics. The makeup recovery is progressing faster than we expected coming into this year. Compared to the first quarter of 2021, prestige cosmetics outperformed mass cosmetics, driven by new and expanding brands and a strong 21 Days of Beauty event.
 From a trend standpoint, foundation, concealers, eyeliners, and lipstick continue to deliver strong comp growth. New brands like Fenty Beauty, r.e.m. Beauty by Ariana Grande and Treslúce, a mass cosmetics brand founded by Latin Musician, Becky G, contributed to growth during the quarter. While new product launches from a wide range of brands, including Clinique, Lancome, NARS, e.l.f. and NYX also delivered strong sales growth.
 In addition, this quarter, we expanded MAC into 233 additional stores and introduced Chanel Beauté into 104 stores. Even as they increase makeup usage, beauty enthusiasts are maintaining their skincare routines. As a result, skin care delivered another quarter of strong double-digit sales comp on top of robust double-digit growth in the first quarter last year.
 Moisturizers, eye serums and acne treatments continue to drive category growth in the quarter. We also saw strong growth in sun protection and self-tanning that consumers increased travel and social activities. NEWNESS continued to appeal to guests with new brands, including Drunk Elephant, Fresh, Super Goop and Good Molecules, as well as new products from TULA, StriVectin and First Aid Beauty, contributing to the category growth during the quarter and established brands, including Peter Thomas Roth and La Roche-Posay continue to benefit from engaging social media content.
 Hair care delivered another quarter of double-digit growth, driven by strong guest engagement with NEWNESS and our core assortment as well as successful salon back bar takeover events. Trends focused on hair health like damage repair, color care and scalp treatments continue to resonate with guests and interest in hair styling aids increased with the rise of social occasions. New brands like OLAPLEX as well as new product launches from [ WEI ] and Briogeo, contributed to category growth in the quarter. And Dyson's Airwrap styling tool continue to be a member favorite. Guests continued to engage with core professional brands like Redken, Pureology and Biolage and our salon back bar takeovers drove strong growth for FEKKAI and IGK as our stylists engaged guests with these brands.
 Consumer strong engagement with the fragrance category continued, driving double-digit growth on top of a phenomenal results last year. Exciting newness, a strong Valentine's Day and strategic events, including 21 Days of Beauty and Spring Haul, contributed to this performance. The in-store launch of Ulta Beauty exclusive Billie Eilish as well as newness from Gucci and Carolina Herrera resonated with guests, and our monthly Fragrance Crush program drove growth for established brands like YSL and Valentino.
 In addition to driving core category growth, we are investing in key cross-category platforms to drive guest engagement and market share growth. Since launching Conscious Beauty in 2020, we have continued to expand brand participation, increase guest awareness and drive trial. At the end of the first quarter, more than 280 brands offered certified products in at least 1 pillar. And while we continue to certify existing brands and SKUs, many new brands are launching with certification in place. One such example is Andrew Fitzsimons, a hair care brand that offers proprietary bonding technology at accessible price points, which was certified across all 4 pillars when it launched in the first quarter.
 Another example is Sk*p, an Ulta Beauty exclusive hair and body care brand packaged in a fully recyclable, shower-friendly paper beauty carton, which also launched in the first quarter.
 Moving now to our efforts to continually expand and support our assortment of bipack brands, we launched 5 new bipack brands, BeautyStat, Rosen Skincare, Fenty Beauty, Treslúce Beauty and Mielle Organics. We also expanded Black Girl sunscreen into all stores. To promote trial, we introduced a spotlight display in select stores to showcase our bipack founders. In recognition of Black History Month, we launched a compelling omnichannel campaign to recognize, celebrate and support the black community and black-owned brands. We feature black-owned brands in stores and across enhanced digital and print channels, and we offered compelling loyalty rewards on black-owned brand purchases to drive awareness.
 Finally, our wellness shop continues to resonate with guests as they prioritize self-care and wellness journeys. We recently expanded the shop to an additional 266 stores, now reaching about 55% of our fleet and refresh the digital landing page on ulta.com. With easy ways to explore our curated assortment and helpful tips about easy self-care routines, guests can now more readily incorporate wellness into their busy schedules.
 Turning now to our efforts to evolve the omnichannel experience through a connected physical and digital ecosystem, All In Your World. Store traffic trends were strong in the quarter as guests capitalized on their preference for in-store shopping with fewer COVID restrictions in place than last year and store capacity returned to normal levels.
 While store traffic is still below pre-pandemic levels, the trend is improving.
 As a core differentiator for Ulta Beauty, beauty services deepen engagement and loyalty through human connection. Consumers are resuming their beauty service routines as they participate in more in-person activities. In the first quarter, our beauty services delivered double-digit comp growth, primarily due to increased capacity and new offerings, including OLAPLEX Repair and PROTECT and express color by Redken.
 To meet growing guest interest and services and experiences, we continue to expand our in-store events and enhance our service offerings. In April, we relaunched makeup services in all stores, just in time to support special events such as proms, graduations and weddings. As guests are coming back to shop in stores, they are also maintaining their use of convenient engaging digital channels. Reflecting these trends, we continue to enhance our omnichannel offerings, including buy online, pickup in store and same-day delivery.
 During the quarter, BOPIS increased 26% to 21% of e-commerce sales compared to just 16% last year. While still limited, guests are increasing their use of our same-day delivery options. Based on engagement trends, we recently expanded same-day delivery to 5 new markets, including New York City. And today, about 30% of our stores offer guests this convenient option.
 During the first quarter, we continued to expand and enhance our digital experiences. As part of our Digital Store of the Future Journey, we introduced a new homepage for both ulta.com and our mobile app. We also launched 2 Virtual Try-On tools, each powered by technology developed by companies we have invested in through our digital innovation fund.
 First, we launched GLAMlab Skin Advisor 2.0, powered by global artificial intelligence startup, pot.ai. This best-in-class skin analysis technology enables us to provide guests with a more accurate skin diagnosis, which has resulted in stronger satisfaction with the tool.
 We also launched GLAMlab hairstyle try-on powered by [ RE/STYLE ], a beauty tech start-up that uses artificial intelligence and machine learning to enable virtual try-on of more than 50 different hair styles, including options by gender and texture. We also introduced innovative AR and virtual reality experiences to support our launch of Fenty Beauty and r.e.m. Beauty. 
 Finally, we continue to enhance and expand our partnership with Target. This leading partnership is part of our long-term strategy to build brand loyalty and engagement with Ulta Beauty. We are seeing existing ultimate reward members, take advantage of the convenience of shopping while earning points at Ulta Beauty at Target. And we are leveraging Target's strong traffic to introduce Ulta Beauty and Ultimate Rewards to new guests.
 During the first quarter, we opened 26 Ulta Beauty at Target shops, ending the quarter with 127 locations. One of our priorities in 2022 is to leverage marketing to build engagement as we scale. As an example, in support of our 21 Days of Beauty event, we co-created brand-relevant digital and in-store communications with Target to support this strategic Ulta Beauty event, which resulted in strong performance and guest engagement across both channels.
 Moving to our efforts to drive love, loyalty and emotional connection with Ulta Beauty by expanding and deepening our presence at the heart of the beauty community. During the first quarter, we continued to optimize our marketing mix to reach guests through the most relevant channels and platforms. We leveraged audience data to execute a targeted digital-first approach to 21 Days of Beauty and Spring haul driving greater awareness and increased sales. We launched content partnerships to engage new audiences and increase awareness of our cross-category platforms, and we created innovative marketing campaigns to support key brand launches.
 We ended the quarter with 37.7 million active members in our Ultimate Rewards Loyalty Program, 17% above the first quarter last year. This increase was primarily driven by continued member reactivation growth, new member acquisition and strong retention. Our strategy is to reengage lapsed members, many of whom dropped off during the pandemic are delivering results. Additionally, new member conversion remains strong in stores and online conversion rates are improving, as we increase the visibility and value of ultimate rewards throughout the guests online journey.
 I'm also excited to share that we launched UB Media, our retail media network. Through UB Media, we will harness the power of our exclusive first-party data to transform the way brands connect with beauty enthusiasts. Building on our successful digital marketing partner program, UB Media offers brand partners an enriched portfolio of advertising products and channels as well as enhanced measurements in reporting, including audience and creative insights.
 The media network offers advertising, access fee display, video, search, product listing ads, social and influencers on both open web platforms and Ulta Beauty-owned properties. In addition to unlocking a new income stream while helping brand partners build digital campaigns to effectively engage audiences, we expect to see sales benefits as campaigns lead consumers back to Ulta Beauty properties to transact.
 Underlying these customer-facing priorities is a focus on to drive operational excellence and optimization. Last fall, we shared our updated supply chain strategy, including our plan to build market fulfillment centers, or MFCs, to supplement our existing DC network capacity and provide greater speed to stores and e-commerce guests in specific markets. We recently broke ground on our first MFC in Greenville, South Carolina, and expect the facility will be fully operational in the third quarter next year.
 In addition, our planned retrofit of our full service distribution center in Greenwood, Indiana is on track to be complete in the second quarter of 2023. I am confident our infrastructure investments, including key supply chain and IT investments, will enable Ulta Beauty to continue to deliver strong results and capitalize on future growth opportunities.
 In closing, a few weeks ago, I had the privilege to welcome nearly 2,000 members of the Ulta Beauty team to our annual field leadership meeting, bringing together our general managers, district managers, field support teams and brand partners for several days of recognition, leadership development and product education. The excitement was palpable and the optimism about our future was truly inspiring. We celebrated everything we have accomplished throughout the last 2 challenging years and set the stage to deliver on the incredible opportunities ahead for Ulta Beauty. I left the event even more excited about all we can do together as 1 Ulta Beauty team to refine -- redefine how the world sees and expresses beauty.
 As we look forward, the world around us continues to be dynamic. Product prices and operating costs are rising and consumers are increasingly concerned about the impact of inflation. While it is difficult to forecast how inflation may impact consumer behavior going forward, we are monitoring guest engagement and remain encouraged by the underlying trends we see in our business and in the beauty category. I am confident our team will continue to navigate near-term pressures, and I remain excited about the long-term opportunity for Ulta Beauty to continue to deliver profitable growth.
 And now I will turn the call over to Scott for a discussion of the financial results. Scott? 
Scott Settersten: Thanks, Dave, and good afternoon, everyone. I want to echo Dave's comments and thank our Ulta Beauty associates for delivering another outstanding quarter. Their collaborative efforts and commitment to serving our guests enabled this extraordinary performance.
 Our first quarter results were stronger than we planned. Robust top line growth due to several factors, including the continued resilience of the beauty category, stronger-than-expected store performance and the impact of new brand launches drove better-than-expected leverage in both gross margin and SG&A, resulted in record operating margin of 18.7%.
 Now let's dig into the details of our results. Starting with sales. Net sales for the quarter increased 21%, driven by 18% growth in comp sales, an increase in other revenue and strong new store performance. From a channel perspective, stores delivered strong double-digit comp growth, reflecting fewer COVID restrictions than last year, while e-commerce sales were flat, in line with our plan.
 Transactions for the quarter increased 10%, driven by double-digit growth in store transactions. Average ticket increased 7.3%, resulting primarily from an increase in average selling price. The increase in average selling price reflects the impact of product mix, retail price increases executed in the quarter and lower promotions.
 Other revenue increased $20.4 million, primarily due to growth in credit card income and higher loyalty point redemptions. The increase in credit card income was primarily due to stronger sales growth. The increase in loyalty point redemptions reflects the improving trend in store traffic and the impact of our proactive member engagement campaigns. 
 During the quarter, we opened 10 new stores and relocated 6 stores. For the quarter, gross margin increased 120 basis points to 40.1% of sales compared to 38.9% last year. The increase was primarily due to leverage of fixed costs, the growth of other revenue and favorable channel mix, partially offset by lower merchandise margin. 
 Robust top line growth and benefits from our occupancy cost optimization efforts resulted in meaningful leverage of store fixed costs. Despite experiencing double-digit growth in supply chain costs, primarily resulting from increases in wage rates, transportation costs and fuel surcharges, strong top line growth during the quarter enabled us to leverage supply chain costs. As sales growth moderates through the rest of the year, we expect higher supply chain costs to become more of a headwind.
 Reflecting strong sales performance of stores, channel mix was favorable this quarter. As a percentage of sales, e-commerce sales were about 400 basis points lower than the first quarter last year. Although the impact of lower promotions was favorable during the quarter, merchandise margin was lower than last year, primarily due to the impact of brand mix and lapping benefits from favorable inventory reserve adjustments last year.
 As planned, SG&A increased 12.9% to $501 million. As a percentage of sales, SG&A decreased 150 basis points to 21.4% compared to 22.9% last year. Lower marketing expenses and leverage of store payroll and benefits due to higher sales were partially offset by deleverage of corporate overhead, reflecting investments related to our strategic priorities.
 As Dave shared, we recently launched UB Media, a more sophisticated and expanded version of our digital marketing partner program. Reflecting the expected scaling of this platform, we are offsetting the incremental marketing expense of the digital campaigns we manage for our brand partners with the vendor income that is a direct reimbursement for these specific costs within total marketing expense. This resulted in about 70 basis points of favorable impact to SG&A in the quarter.
 Operating income increased 43.4% to $437.7 million compared to $305.3 million last year. As a percentage of sales, operating margin increased 290 basis points to 18.7% of sales compared to 15.8% last year. Diluted GAAP earnings per share increased 53.7% to $6.30 per share compared to $4.10 per share last year.
 Moving on to the balance sheet and cash flow statement. Total inventory increased 16% to $1.57 billion compared to $1.35 billion last year. In addition to the impact of 28 additional stores, the increase reflects inventory purchases to support key brand launches as well as continued efforts to maintain strong in-stock of key items to support expected demand and mitigate anticipated global supply chain disruptions.
 Capital expenditures were $71.1 million for the quarter compared to $34.6 million last year. The increase in capital expenditures reflects a more normalized investment cadence versus the last couple of years and includes investments in IT systems, merchandising improvements and store maintenance and other. Depreciation was $62.8 million compared to $70.6 million last year, primarily due to a shift of IT investments from capital to cloud expense. We ended the quarter with $654.5 million in cash and cash equivalents.
 In the first quarter, we repurchased 332,000 shares at a cost of $132.8 million. At the end of the quarter, we had $1.87 billion remaining under our current $2 billion repurchase authorization.
 Turning now to our outlook. Reflecting our strong first quarter performance and sales trends we've experienced so far in the second quarter, we are increasing our outlook for fiscal 2022. We now expect net sales to be between $9.35 billion and $9.55 billion with comp sales growth between 6% and 8%. Our updated outlook reflects trends year-to-date while continuing to consider uncertainties that could impact the second half of the year, including inflationary risk to consumer spending and the impact of increased points of distribution for Prestige Beauty. We anticipate comp growth will be in the low to mid-teens in the first half and then moderate to low single-digit growth in the second half. 
 We now expect operating margin for the year to be between 14.1% and 14.4% of sales. We anticipate operating margin will leverage in the first half but deleverage in the second half, as sales growth moderates and cost pressures and planned investments have a greater impact.
 We continue to expect gross margin for the full year will be lower than fiscal 2021, driven primarily by lower merchandise margin resulting from the impact of brand mix, more normalized assortment management activity and a more normalized promotional environment. In addition, we believe fuel prices will continue to be volatile, resulting in higher supply chain costs than initially planned.
 We continue to expect SG&A expense will deleverage for the year, driven primarily by $70 million to $75 million of expenses related to our strategic priorities, including investments to support UB Media, Ulta Beauty at Target, Project SOAR and other IT capabilities as well as higher wage rate growth across the enterprise, partially offset by lower marketing expense and incentive compensation. 
 In addition, we are seeing inflationary pressure on operating expenses like service provider fees, labor, supplies and travel, and we expect these trends to continue throughout fiscal 2022. These assumptions result in updated full year guidance for diluted EPS growth in the high single to low double-digit range. 
 For modeling purposes, some expenses initially planned for Q2 are expected to shift into Q3, primarily reflecting availability of resources and equipment. As a result of these shifts and a stronger than initially planned sales trend, we now expect to deliver earnings growth in the second quarter.
 In closing, fiscal 2022 is off to a great start, but uncertainties remain. Our updated outlook reflects stronger top line performance and greater cost pressures as well as economic and global uncertainties that could adversely impact consumer spending later in the year.
 While our updated expectations for fiscal 2022 are above our longer-term targets for comp sales and operating margin, we are not changing our long-term financial targets at this time, given our limited visibility into the economic environment and expected cost pressures as we move through the rest of the year and into 2023.
 And now, I'll turn the call back over to our operator to moderate the Q&A session. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Simeon Siegel with BMO Capital Markets. 
Simeon Siegel: Congrats on the great results. So great comp. Within the strong ticket growth, could you break out AUR from UPT? And then maybe more broadly, how you're thinking about average ticket going forward? And then just a follow-up, just given how well you guys do with that, any way to know within that 10% transaction growth, how much are the unique guest visits versus an uptick in guest visit frequency? 
Scott Settersten: Yes. Simeon, thanks for the question. So even if I answer directly, the units per transaction were essentially flat year-over-year. So again, we're seeing a lot of the benefit from the continuation what I'd call a moderate promotional environment overall, coupled with the mix of brands we have that entered the assortment here over the course of the last year. So again, you know the names well. We've been talking about Fenty and OLAPLEX and some of the other big hitters here we've added recently. So again, the mix of those 2 are really doing -- making a big contribution to our gross margin here in recent quarters. 
Simeon Siegel: And then just within the transactions, frequency versus unique visits? 
Scott Settersten: Yes. We don't really have anything in more detail to share with that at this point in time. Again, we are very happy to see the rebound in store traffic, right. And so a nice healthy transaction growth is always what we're striving for and planned for. And so we're super excited to see the bounce back of the consumer in the stores and making sure, again, that we deliver best-in-class specialty retail omnichannel experience. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Korinne Wolfmeyer with Piper Sandler. 
Korinne Wolfmeyer: Congrats on the quarter. So first of all, I'd like to just get your thoughts on the current inflation environment and how that's impacting consumers and maybe more so here in the early parts of Q2? Are you seeing any sort of shift in demand maybe from prestige to mass or vice versa? Or are you seeing mass be maybe more resilient than prestige or vice versa? Just any thoughts here would be helpful. 
David Kimbell: Yes. Great question. And yes, the inflationary environment, as we -- as both I and Scott said in the remarks, is certainly one that we're watching carefully, and we're staying close to our guests. So far, our guests are managing through it and we're not seeing huge impacts. In fact, as I mentioned in the script, Prestige makeup performed a bit higher than mass makeup. So we're seeing strong results across our portfolio. We haven't experienced meaningful trade down behavior that we can -- we could identify. And it's -- one of the unique things that we feel is core to our model is the breadth of our assortment, all price points, from mass to prestige, all categories, hair care and skin care, makeup and bath and fragrance. And so being able to adjust and adapt as consumers' needs evolve has been true to our model for a long time and allowed us to manage through any disruption in the marketplace. But right now, we're seeing strength across all aspects of our business, which we're obviously really pleased with. But we're also prepared to adjust and adapt if and when consumer behavior adjusts. 
Korinne Wolfmeyer: And then I'd just like to ask quickly on Target and the shop-in-shops in Target and how they're doing. Are you seeing any like big difference in traffic in the Target shop-in-shops versus Ulta shops? How is ticket value different between the two? And then also, are there any key brands you'd like to call out that are being particularly successful in Target versus Ulta? 
Kecia Steelman: Yes, I'll take that one. What I will say is that we're really pleased with the overall partnership with Target. As Dave mentioned, we co-created from brand-relevant digital in-store campaign during our 21 Days of Beauty, and we're really pleased with that performance. I would just say that we will continue to share more as we grow more to scale right now. As of today, we've got 140 stores that are open as of today. We're on track to open 250 plus stores with them this year, but we like what we see. When we get a member engaged in our Ultimate Rewards Program, what we're seeing is that they're behaving very similar to our existing loyalty members.
 As far as brands go, Ulta Beauty works closely with the partners, with our brand partners on the assortment, et cetera, but Target really owns the sales. So we're not at liberty to comment on the sales-specific performance by brand at this time. 
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Olivia Tong with Raymond James. 
Olivia Tong Cheang: My first question is just around the makeup recovery and compare and contrast that to the emergence of Prestige hair care and your view in terms of the opportunity in front of you, obviously, makeup is significantly larger. The recovery accounted like, from your earlier comments, is progressing faster than you had anticipated. As you think about the second half of the year and continuing to drive acceleration, can you talk a little bit about the plans in place to keep that going? And then I have a follow-up. 
David Kimbell: Great. Well, thanks for the question, Olivia. Yes, makeup did recover faster than we had anticipated coming into the year. You all know that we've been working on makeup for a while. It was somewhat soft going into the pandemic and was arguably the hardest hit category of segment beauty during the pandemic. And we're -- so we're excited to see it recovering, and that's driven by an elevated overall engagement in the category in part by more opportunities to go out, more social occasions, more people going back to work in person and then just some of the things that we've been talking about, the engagement, the excitement, the enthusiasm for makeup has remained high as evidenced in social media, just the opportunities to where makeup haven't been as numerous. So we're -- as that opens up, as the world opens up, we're definitely say, more opportunity, a high level of engagement. There's new trends that are coming in to make up that we're excited about, definitely a push towards bold looks, bright, glam, glitter, people are ready to get out in the world and that's shown up in the looks.
 At the same time, some of the dynamics around a more natural look that requires makeup, same consumers are balancing both of those. We're seeing brow innovation, contouring is being discovered by younger consumers who missed it the first time around long lip wear -- long wear lip is a trend that's that started in the pandemic and is continuing. So we're excited about what we're seeing and then in the Total category. And then Ulta, through our assortment has really been performing quite well adding key brands like Fenty, r.e.m., Chanel, lots of innovation from both mass and prestige, MAC, Clinique, Lancome and NARS on the Prestige side, e.l.f. and NYX are 2 big highlights on the on the mass side. So we're getting a lot of innovation, lot of creativity, all the things that we have been working on and driving towards really came together in a nice way in the quarter.
 So as we look forward to the second half of the year, we're confident. It's hard to predict exactly how consumer behavior will go. But as more and more people are comfortable going out, more opportunities exist, more people going back to the work, coupled with the continued pipeline of strong innovation, we feel like makeup is on its way to a full recovery. And in fact, in Q1 was up over 2019 results, so pre-pandemic results for the first time in the pandemic. So excited about what we're seeing and looking to continue to drive that forward. 
Olivia Tong Cheang: And then on the gross margin, you said earlier that you're still expecting gross margin to be down. It was obviously a much better start to the year than we probably thought. But of course, costs are material as you progress through the year. But relative to your prior expectations, as you think about gross margin being down, is it the same level? And could you talk about like the puts and takes there, maybe a little bit of granularity in terms of your thought process on costs now versus mix improvement and obviously some leverage associated with an improved sales outlook? 
Scott Settersten: Yes. So the great start we got in the first quarter is really kind of a background here driving some of the gross margin. So we still expect it to be down, as you said, but down less than what our initial plan was for the year. So we still have the same variables at play there. We talked about brand mix being a headwind this year. We think the promotional environment will normalize during the year. Again, we didn't see so much of that in the first quarter, but we are expecting more of that to come into play as we get deeper into the year and then supply chain costs. Again, we expected cost generally to be higher this year. We're seeing some costs, especially around fuel, higher than we expected. And we -- the back half of the year, there'll be more headwind from that piece of the equation as well. So overall, I feel like we're in a good place. And if sales stay strong and we're always focused on optimizing the business overall. So helping to deliver great results. 
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Steph Wissink with Jefferies. 
Stephanie Schiller Wissink: I have a really quick question on inventory. I'm wondering if you can just talk a little bit about the complexion of the balance sheet inventory? And it feels strange to ask, but do you feel like you have enough to chase if the momentum persists in the business? And Scott, 1 question for you. This is a clarification. Could you just walk through the accounting on the UB Media? I'm not sure I tracked with you in your prepared remarks in terms of the offset to marketing fee, just talk a little bit about how those vendor agreements work, just to understand a bit how that affects the middle of the P&L? 
Scott Settersten: That's 2 for me, Steph. That's not fair. Okay. So we'll go first up on the inventory. So again, it's up 16% year-over-year. We feel like we're in a good position. Again, it looks easy based on the results we're posting here, but our teams are doing an excellent job and working really hard with our vendor partners, the merchants, the inventory planning teams, the supply chain teams to make sure we get the right product in the right place. And so fill rates are good. We're feeling better. Things have kind of bounced back a little bit from what we saw mid- to late last year. So again, focused on high velocity SKUs, new brands to make sure we take advantage where we can there. We do expect that the growth rate, again, will moderate as we get further into the year this year and start anniversary-ing some of the steps we took last year to get more aggressive on inventory. So again, that's one place we always feel confident that we would make more investment if good judgment suggests that.
 And then on the accounting for the UB Media, so this one again for the accountants in the room. So last year, again, the vendor, the marketing partner program that we had in place, again, we've explained this. We've always been doing this in a smaller scale, I guess, I would say. And so historically, the accounting was all in the gross margin line by and large, okay, the vendor income piece of it. The cost -- the actual marketing cost within SG&A and all the benefits were flowing through the gross margin line kind of in line with all of our vendor money accounting so to speak. And this year, the difference is we're able to offset the incremental advertising costs in the SG&A line and the residual rolls through the gross margin line. I hope that helps. 
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Kate McShane from Goldman Sachs. 
Katharine McShane: Just a quick one from us. Just you mentioned increasing points of sales Prestige, just how are you viewing the competitive environment in light of that? And how are you looking to further differentiate yourself as those points continue to roll out? 
David Kimbell: Yes. We -- the beauty category is attractive and has been highly competitive for a long time. I've been here at Ulta for about 8.5 years now, and it's been hypercompetitive the whole time and for years before that. It's attractive. It's growing. It's engaging. So that's been part of the dynamic for a while. And certainly, it's true now. We're seeing new competitive locations, particularly on the prestige side, at the same time that we're opening up new stores of our own and in our partnership with Target. So there is some shift going on.
 What we're excited about and proud of is the fact that even in that environment, even in the first quarter with hundreds of new competitive locations, we continue to gain meaningful share in the Prestige category. And I think it's a reflection of the strength of our model. We have something that nobody else offers in the marketplace. The unique combination of an assortment that reflects the way consumers want to buy and shop beauty across price points, mass, prestige, across categories and then most importantly, in an experienced an environment that reflects the human connection that consumers are looking for in this highly emotional category. All of our research suggests that our experience is unique and special. What our team does every day to deliver a unique experience stands out in the marketplace, and that helps us drive our business and drive our market share.
 You add in loyalty and services and a great digital experience and add all the innovation that we continue to bring in all aspects of our business, we feel like we're doing -- we're playing offense. We're leading through what we know how to do best, which is drive engagement with beauty enthusiasts through all aspects of the beauty journey. And so we feel confident that if we continue to do that, it's going to continue to show up in our results. It's reflected in the strong results we had in the first quarter, the momentum we had coming out of fiscal '21 in our share results, in our loyalty, member growth, and we're -- that's our plan going forward. For us, we've always been focused on our strategy, executing our strategy with excellence. And when we do that, the results follow and that will be our plan going forward. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Daniel Hofkin with William Blair. 
Daniel Hofkin: Just a quick question regarding the Target partnership. I don't know if you commented specifically on this, but can you say whether it's having a measurable impact yet on your overall comp sales, obviously not at the Target stores themselves, but in the form of additional traffic to nearby Ulta stores or ulta.com and then kind of how you expect that contribution to evolve over the rest of this year and the next couple of years? 
Kecia Steelman: Yes. Dan, what I would say is that any time, as Dave mentioned earlier, we have new points of distribution, there's natural cannibalization that happens. But it's not meaningful yet. We've got just about 140 stores, as I mentioned out of today that are open. We've factored this into our expectations. We do see that whenever we've opened or there's other points of distribution, including our own office Beauty stores, we do see an initial impact that, that dissipates over time, we expect a similar pattern to happen here with our Ulta Beauty and Target locations. So as we continue to roll out more stores, we'll see if that continues to hold true. But we -- what we've seen so far is that seems to be the case. 
Daniel Hofkin: And then just as you think about the, obviously, overall stellar results, any just differentiation among categories or regions or parts of the quarter that you might call out plus or minus? 
David Kimbell: Yes. A few things that I might say. One, across categories, we're really pleased that we see strength in all of our major categories. I talked about makeup in detail already. And so that's an important improvement on our business. But at the same time, that improved. It was encouraging to see skincare deliver strong results, haircare continue through innovation and prestige, on tools to drive a lot of engagement and newness across haircare, continues to drive great results. Fragrance, which has been a shining star throughout the last 2 years continues to drive growth. I talked in the script about some of the drivers of that newness, brands, exclusive brands like Billie Eilish as well as innovation on our existing brands, that driving strong growth, sun care, expansion into wellness and driving incremental growth.
 So category performance was healthy across the board. Channel performance, again, strong results in both driven by our stores and traffic and engagement and the desire to get back and shopping in person, but to have our e-commerce business essentially flat after all the growth we've seen in that business over the last couple of years was in line with our expectation and salon coming back very strong. So our channels are performing well. Through the quarter itself, the first period, the first month or so of the quarter was the strongest as we kind of came out of the gates and then started lapping stimulus. But the other 2 months of the quarter were strong as well and well ahead of our expectations. So around a well-rounded delivery of results with all aspects of our business contributing to the performance that we have. 
Daniel Hofkin: And then anything you would call out either regionally or in terms of customer demographic differences? 
David Kimbell: No region. I mean 1 of the things that we really like about our model is our model works in all different types of geographies. Big cities from New York and L.A. to Chicago to smaller remote single-store markets, suburbs, urban, rural, and we saw strong performance across the board. So there was no real region or marketplace distinctions of note. And that to us is a reflection, this is working really well. And then when we look across economic, we saw growth across all income levels as well as we look at our consumer base. So strong growth from our highest income to more moderate income. So -- again, well-rounded growth. Consumers are engaged in the category. The category itself is, we think, more relevant, more important to our consumers, more connected to their overall sense of self-care and well-being. At the same time, there are so many more occasions to go out. We think the category is in great shape, and we're proud to be leading the category and driving these results through our strong execution. 
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Michael Lasser with UBS. 
Michael Lasser: Understanding you're looking to be conservative and mindful of the uncertain macro environment, you get to low single-digit comps in the back half. Again given the strength in the cosmetics category, it would imply that haircare and skincare probably turn negative, why would that be the case? 
Scott Settersten: Yes. I guess I would just chalk it up like we indicated, Michael, being prudent all things considered, looking at the world and all the uncertainty and all the warning signs that seem to be flashing a bit right now. So again, there's no -- we took the benefit of what we've seen strong performance so far in the first half of the year, bake that into our full year outlook and didn't really modify the second half of the year based on what our initial plan was for 2022. And so you take that and then you adjust for some of the expense pressures that we're seeing across the business right now, and that's where we think is an appropriate place to land it for the time being. And then we'll continue to modify as we work our way through the rest of the year. 
Michael Lasser: My follow-up question is you're still -- you haven't seen it, but you're still expecting promotions to come back. What is going to be the catalyst to spark an increasing in promotions? And how much have you factored in for that rise in promotions in the back half of the year? 
David Kimbell: Well, we won't get specific on any like -- specific elements of what we factored in. What I'd say about promotion is the environment is dynamic, as we talked about, highly competitive, and there's uncertainty ahead from consumer behavior. We -- what we know is we've been able to continue to manage our promotions in a smart, strategic way. We've been on a journey for a while to reduce nonstrategic broad-scale discounts and promotions to focus our efforts on personalization, CRM-enabled, highly relevant, strategic efforts that drive not just short-term but long-term results through higher engagement, higher loyalty, higher connection to Ulta Beauty over time. And that's what we are able to do in the first quarter.
 But as we've said probably through many of these calls, we're well aware that this is a competitive environment. We've got lots of outstanding competitors that are also looking at ways to drive their business. We will not lose share. We'll respond appropriately. We have more tools than we've ever had through our personalization and CRM capabilities to ensure that we are leading the market. But with uncertainty around inflation, consumer behavior, competitive environment, we are prepared to react. We're not going to lead promotional intensity, but we're also going to make sure that we're appropriately engaging with our beauty enthusiasts to drive them to Ulta Beauty. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. 
Simeon Gutman: I'm going to ask my question and follow-up. So Kiley -- coming back to the next call. My first question is on the merch margin. Given that haircare seems to be mixing up, shouldn't that have been a positive? And then when Scott, when you made the comment X reserve adjustments, does that mean the merch margin X reserve adjustments could have been up year-over-year? You're using that against the compare? And then the follow-up is what is just changing in the back half? It sounds like you're keeping sales the way you modeled it, if I'm interpreting it right, but what if anything else changed? 
Scott Settersten: That sounds like 3 questions, Simeon, actually. But I'll give it out 3 here. So yes, haircare has been a real contributor here recently. Again, it kind of gets back to the brand mix overall for the business, I would say. So while haircare, generally speaking, is higher margin than the house, some of the mix that's been added here recently, doesn't necessarily follow the same metrics overall.
 When we're talking about inventory, so it was favorable adjustments last year that was driving the tougher compare this year. So again, last year, cleaner inventories, we were coming off what I'd call some housekeeping, probably late in 2020, right? We closed some stores. We exited some brands later in the year. So we got some book benefit from that last year, which makes it a tougher compare.
 As far as the guidance overall, what changed, again, the strong sales, the strong start. Obviously, it's helping drive a lot of fixed cost leverage here for the year. For the revenue, it was something that was unexpected, really wasn't in the plan to see those redemptions come back in our loyalty program that way and to see the credit card benefit pop here in the first quarter. So again, we're planning for more of that to continue throughout the year. We've got operating costs that are increasing across the business, specifically in supply chain, but we're seeing in other areas, too, as we mentioned in our prepared remarks. So that's been feathered in as we think about the second half of the year.
 So again, we feel like we're in a good position. We feel like we've got all the variables covered. Again, we think it's prudent to take a more thoughtful, careful approach and outlook as we're looking ahead to the second half of the year, considering all the uncertainties that are kind of floating out there right now. 
Kiley Rawlins: John, I think we'll take 1 more question, please. 
Operator: Okay. And our final question comes from the line of Michael Binetti with Credit Suisse. 
Michael Binetti: Congrats on a great quarter, and thanks for all the detail here. A lot of our questions have been answered. But on the -- I guess as we think about SG&A versus gross margin, on the SG&A, if we look at it on a per store basis or some kind of leveling metric like that, it looks like it was up about 12% versus 2019. Comps up in the mid-20s. I just wonder if there's more noise in the SG&A line in 1Q than I appreciate it. I know you mentioned, Scott, that a few expenses move out of 2Q into 3Q, is there any onetime items to think about in 1Q that led to some underspend in SG&A?
 And I guess the follow-up is, if I look at some normal SG&A seasonality back pre-COVID it suggests gross profit margin could be down as much as a couple of hundred basis points in the guidance that you gave in 2Q through 4Q, is that the right magnitude of the puts and takes that you laid out for us earlier? Or would you direct me to... 
Scott Settersten: So on the SG&A, there's really nothing. There's no onetime extraordinary items floating around in there. I would call, go back and look at our comments around the marketing expense and how that is being treated year-over-year because that is a rather significant change. Again, that comes from the UB Media change going from what I'd call a small scale kind of operation to a more formalized and larger scale process overall. So we did change the accounting there year-over-year, and that is providing a pretty significant benefit in the first quarter versus a year ago and that's going to continue for the rest of the year, obviously, that comparison.
 Then when we're talking about gross margin and some of the variability that you called out there in the second half, again, we think it's still in the same range that we guided to early in the year. Again, we -- I would point back to changing an expectation. So again, first quarter promotional environment was moderate to slightly better than what we saw a year ago, which was not our plan for the year, and we expect that to get more aggressive in the back half of the year. So that's baked in there, along with the brand mix. So again, brand mix kind of worked to our benefit in the first quarter. We think some of that will moderate as we get further into the year as well. 
Operator: We have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. And I would now like to turn the call back over to Dave Kimbell for any closing remarks. 
David Kimbell: Okay. Great. Well, thank you all for joining us today. The year is off to a great start, and I want to thank the entire Ulta Beauty team for their collective efforts to support our guests and each other while moving our business forward. We look forward to speaking to you all again at the end of August when we report our second quarter results. I hope you all have a great evening. Thanks, again. 
Operator: This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation, and have a great day.

===== 2021 Q4  (2022-03-10 16:30:00) =====
Operator: Good afternoon, and welcome to Ulta Beauty's conference call to discuss results for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2021. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.
 It is now my pleasure to introduce Ms. Kiley Rawlins, Vice President of Investor Relations. Ms. Rawlins, please proceed. 
Kiley Rawlins: Thank you, Hector, and good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Hosting our call today are Dave Kimbell, Chief Executive Officer; and Scott Settersten, Chief Financial Officer. Kecia Steelman, Chief Operating Officer, will join us for the Q&A session.

 We'll begin with some prepared remarks from Dave and Scott. And following our comments, we'll open up the call for questions. Today, our remarks will be a little longer than usual. [Operator Instructions] And as always, the IR team will be available for any follow-up questions after the call.
 Now I'd like to turn the call over to Dave. Dave? 
David Kimbell: Thank you, Kiley, and good afternoon, everyone. Before discussing our results, I want to share how proud I am of our associates' performance throughout 2021. While consistently providing care and service to our guests and to each other, they successfully navigated pandemic-related challenges and delivered exceptional results for all of our stakeholders.
 In fiscal 2021, the beauty category recovered earlier and faster than we expected. And our teams adjusted quickly in many ways, including working with our brand partners to accelerate receipts and manage in-stocks, creating highly relevant content that reflected the rapidly evolving mindset of our guests, adjusting staffing levels across the organization to meet growing demand and protecting and strengthening our culture, leading with their hearts and working together to create new ways to delight and excite guests, all while continuing to execute against our strategic priorities and drive our business forward.
 Now moving to our results for the quarter. The Ulta Beauty team delivered record fourth quarter financial results despite COVID and winter weather disruptions. Net sales increased 24.1% to $2.7 million -- $2.7 billion. Operating profit increased to 13.8% of sales and diluted EPS increased to $5.41 per share for the quarter.
 The decisions our teams made and plans they executed with excellence around assortment strategies, inventory flow, marketing and staffing levels positioned us to take advantage of a positive consumer environment this holiday season and deliver strong results.
 I want to express my sincere appreciation to all Ulta Beauty associates, particularly in our stores and distribution centers, who show up every day, positive and optimistic, ready to serve our guests while facing personal challenges posed by the ongoing pandemic. Their dedication enabled us to deliver these outstanding results, and I am grateful for their flexibility as circumstances shifted.
 We kicked off the holiday season in early November with our multichannel celebrate more campaign. Our audience-tailored creative and contextually relevant storytelling connected with consumers in fresh and bold ways across platforms. And we continued to expand live streaming and social selling experiences. We enhanced our Member Love events, rewarding members with new loyalty offers to drive engagement, reactivation and retention.
 And we leveraged our CRM capabilities to further enhance the productivity of our promotions. We also enhanced our gift card program, including more innovative and inclusive designs and new multipack options, which helped deliver strong double-digit growth in gift card sales across stores and third-party channels.
 Our decision to proactively manage inventory flow resulted in strong sell-through of holiday merchandise and core product, and our teams transitioned quickly after Christmas to support our strategic Jumbo Love and Love your Skin events as well as significant brand launches. In January, we executed 4 exciting new brand launches at Ulta Beauty, OLAPLEX, N°1 DE CHANEL, Supergoop! and Billie Eilish.
 As the #1 prestige hair care brand in the market, OLAPLEX offers patented bond building products and is changing how consumers engage with the hair care category. While our initial assortment included only 7 SKUs, it was one of the strongest brand launches in Ulta Beauty history. With the unique ability to offer guests the professional service in our salons and the retail products to take home, we are delighted to expand our partnership with OLAPLEX.
 In makeup, we are excited to partner with Chanel Beauté as the exclusive U.S. retailer for the historic launch of N°1 DE CHANEL. Offering luxury to younger generations, this new line is sustainably sourced with clean ingredients and sustainable packaging. With an assortment spanning skin care, makeup and fragrance, N°1 DE CHANEL is currently available in 250 Ulta Beauty stores and on ulta.com. This launch is a key element of our luxury beauty strategy, and we're very pleased with the initial results.
 In skin care, we launched Supergoop!, known for its sunscreen expertise. Supergoop! is made with clean v-friendly ingredients, is cruelty-free and leverages sustainable packaging. And in fragrance, we launched a new offering exclusive to Ulta Beauty from acclaimed recording artist, Billie Eilish.
 Taking a closer look at sales trends in the quarter, guests were excited to return to in-store holiday shopping. Even as stores delivered robust double-digit comp growth, e-commerce sales exceeded our expectations, increasing slightly on top of last year's 70% growth. This reinforces us that e-commerce is complementary and incremental to the physical shopping experience.
 Guests continue to increase their utilization of "buy online, pick up in store" while also engaging with our new same-day delivery option. During the quarter, BOPIS sales increased 20% to account for 17% of e-commerce sales compared to 15% in the fourth quarter last year. While only available in about 200 stores, we are pleased with the performance of our new same-day delivery options.
 From a category perspective, all major categories delivered double-digit comp growth compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, driven by cycling last year's disruption from COVID, strong execution of our holiday plans and product newness. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2019, fragrance, bath, hair care and skin care, all continued to deliver strong double-digit growth. Makeup was more challenged this quarter with trends decelerating from the third quarter across both prestige and mass makeup, although sales of mass makeup continued to be positive compared to 2019.
 Over the last year, as the beauty category has recovered, the performance of makeup has been more volatile and lagged other categories, in part reflecting higher sensitivity to COVID fluctuations. We remain confident that makeup will return to growth as consumer optimism and comfort with out-of-home activities increases. But we recognize the timing and rate of recovery will continue to be impacted by changes in the COVID environment.
 Looking specifically at the fourth quarter trends in makeup, face, lip and eye continued to deliver strong growth, driven by blush, tinted moisture, lip balm and lashes. Newness from L, Kiss and Ardell continued to excite and engage guests, while prestige brands like MAC, Clinique and Lancôme also delivered positive growth. In addition, this quarter, we expanded Chanel Beauté into 50 additional stores and launched the full assortment on ulta.com.
 Hair care delivered double-digit growth, increasing to 28% of net sales. Consumer focus on hair health drove strong growth in treatments, shampoo and conditioner and tools like the Dyson Airwrap were hot holiday gifts this year. New brands like OLAPLEX, KRISTIN ESS and Briogeo, as well as guest favorites like Redken and Living Proof delivered nice growth during the quarter.
 The fragrance and bath category was again the best performing major category during the quarter, delivering robust double-digit comp growth and increasing to 18% of net sales. Compelling newness from luxury brands like Gucci, Dior and Carolina Herrera as well as exclusive newness from Ariana Grande and Billie Eilish contributed to the strong growth. In addition, our holiday fragrance programs and our monthly Fragrance Crush program performed very well.
 Finally, skin care delivered another quarter of double-digit sales growth. Beauty enthusiasts are maintaining their skin care regimens as they continue to focus on self-care. Category growth in the quarter was primarily driven by moisturizers, cleansers and Sun care. Newness continued to peel the guests as new brands, including Drunk Elephant, Good Molecules, Fresh and Black Girl Sunscreen as well as new products from Tula drove strong growth during the quarter. In addition, dermatology-based brands like CeraVe and La Roche-Posay continued to resonate with guests.
 The performance of our services business accelerated in the quarter, increasing more than 30% over last year, driven primarily by growth in transactions. During the quarter, we expanded salon capacity to 100% in all Ulta Beauty salons and Benefit Brow Bars, except where limited by state or local mandates. And we relaunched skin services in 130 stores.
 In addition, our recently launched salon services, Express Color and OLAPLEX Repair & Protect, continue to bring in new members to our salons, an encouraging trend as we know members who use our services are some of our most valuable and engaged guests. Reflecting this momentum, during the quarter, we hired approximately 1,000 new associates to support our expanding services business.
 Now turning to our results for the full year. The Ulta Beauty team delivered record sales of $8.6 billion, recorded operating margin of 15% of sales and record diluted EPS of $17.98 per share. Comparable sales increased 37.9% compared to fiscal 2020 and 12.6% compared to fiscal 2019. We expanded our market share in Prestige Beauty based on dollar sales for the 52 weeks ended January 29, 2022, compared to the same period last year based on point-of-sale data from the NPD Group.
 We continue to fuel guest desires for newness with relevant brand launches such as Drunk Elephant, BOBBI BROWN, OLAPLEX, KRISTIN ESS and Verb. We expanded our Conscious Beauty platform to 270 certified brands, launched SKU level certification for the clean ingredients and vegan peelers and expanded our Made Without List. We doubled the number of black-owned brands in our assortment, welcoming Black Girls Sunscreen, Camille Rose, Homebody and BLK/OPL, among others, to the Ulta Beauty family and introduced dedicated space for BIPOC-founded brands in 260 stores.
 We launched The Wellness Shop, a cross-category platform that offers guests self-care for the mind, body and spirit on ulta.com and in more than 450 stores. We opened 44 net new stores, relocated 7 stores, remodeled 9 stores and negotiated more than 150 lease renewals.
 We continue to drive higher BOPIS utilization with new guest incentives, increased marketing to drive awareness and operational improvements to the guest and associate experience. As a result, BOPIS sales increased to 18% of e-commerce sales compared to 14% in fiscal 2020. Between BOPIS and our ship-from-store capabilities, about 28% of our digital orders this year were fulfilled by stores.
 We launched our exciting new partnership with Target Corporation and opened 100 Ulta Beauty at Target locations. I'll share more on this later. We drove member growth through new acquisition, member reengagement and targeted retention efforts, increasing the number of Ultimate Rewards members to a record 37 million members. We grew aided awareness to 94% and maintained unaided awareness at 48%.
 Importantly, we significantly increased Ulta Beauty consideration with Gen Z, Hispanic and black beauty enthusiast and created deeper, more emotional connections with consumers.
 We successfully navigate macro headwinds, including supply chain challenges and tight labor markets. We proactively invested in our teams with appreciation bonus for our store and DC associates. We doubled our renewable energy credit, invested in energy management system retrofits, diverted nearly 15 tons of waste from landfills through our recycling efforts and joined other leading retailers in the consortium to reinvent the retail bag.
 And we made meaningful progress against our DE&I commitments, including launching the MUSE platform, signing the 15% pledge, investing in, in-store guest experience training, reimagining our diverse leaders development program and integrating DE&I and across our internal talent life cycle.
 Now as we turn to fiscal 2022, consumers in the operating environment are changing faster than ever. Consumers are becoming increasingly resilient to COVID surges, but macro headwinds, global uncertainty and potential pandemic setbacks will likely continue to impact consumers. The beauty category is healthy and growing, and our proprietary consumer insights give us confidence that the recovery, which began last year, will continue in 2022 as consumers maintain their self-care routines and engage in more social activities.
 And as consumers increase their consumption of services and experiences, our assortment and service offerings position us to benefit from these shifts. We know there will be challenges, but I am more excited than ever about the opportunity for Ulta Beauty to grow and continue to lead the beauty category. Last fall, we introduced a new strategic framework which will shape our future and enable us to deliver against our long-term financial targets.  
 Let me share our fiscal 2022 priorities through the lens of each of our strategic pillars. Starting with our first pillar. We will drive breakthrough and disruptive growth through an expanded definition of all things beauty. Our differentiated assortment is core to our success. And in fiscal 2022, we intend to enhance and expand our Conscious Beauty platform, further increase our assortment of black-owned, black-founded and black-led brands in support of our 15% pledge and build the infrastructure to support these brands, expand The Wellness Shop to an additional 300 stores and continue to evolve and expand our offering across core categories to engage and excite the beauty enthusiasts.
 To drive growth and capture market share, we will continue to add relevant brands to our assortment. In recent weeks, we've executed one of our most anticipated brand launches ever, Fenty Beauty. Partnering with Rihanna and Fenty Beauty, we announced the news on February 17 through social channels, achieving higher mentioned volume and reach than any other Ulta Beauty brand launch announcement. The initial guest response was incredibly positive, trending as the #1 topic on Twitter the day of the announcement.
 Turning now to our second pillar, to evolve the guest experience through our personalized and connected omnichannel ecosystem, all in your world. Beauty enthusiasts are increasingly leveraging both physical and digital channels, and we have the power to connect and engage with them across the beauty journey and meet them wherever they are.
 In fiscal 2022, we intend to leverage our real estate pipeline to pilot a new in-store experience with a layout and flow that reflects our key merchandising strategies and consolidates guest services in a central location, test a small store format with an optimized assortment and service offering in a handful of small markets, enhance our buy anywhere fill anywhere efforts by expanding our same-day delivery option, continue to create leading digital experiences through the ongoing refresh of our digital store to provide guests with an experience that seamlessly merges content with commerce, the expansion of our virtual try-on capabilities and new capabilities resulting from our digital fund investments.
 We'll provide guests with more convenience through the launch of Afterpay as a payment option in stores and will expand the Ulta Beauty at Target shop in more than 250 new Target locations.
 As part of our efforts to expand our omnichannel ecosystem, last year, we joined forces with the Target Corporation to create a new way for guests to discover Prestige Beauty. In just 9 short months, the Ulta Beauty and Target teams worked together to design a space that feels authentic to both brands. We connected 2 independent loyalty programs. We made it easy for guests to link their accounts. And we onboarded more than 50 prestige and emerging brands.
 I am pleased to share that in our Ulta Beauty at Target location, customer awareness remains very strong. Guests are shopping across categories, and more than 1 million members have linked their Ultimate Rewards and Target Circle accounts. Building on this foundation, this year, our focus is on accelerating new member acquisition, optimizing the guest experience and continuing to amplify marketing as we scale.
 Moving now to our third pillar, expand and deepen our presence across the guest beauty journey, firmly placing Ulta Beauty at the heart of the beauty community. In fiscal 2022, we intend to further build upon our brand purpose and elevate our marketing efforts to include more action-based programming that address the needs of key audiences; expand live streaming and social selling; drive member growth and leverage data and analytics to increase the personalization of our communication, deepen engagement and shift share of wallet; and launch our retail media network, UB Media.
 Our fourth pillar is to drive operational excellence and optimization. We are investing in multiple significant cross-functional projects that require capital and resources, but position us to capture additional market share, fund enhancements to the guest experience and deliver future profitable growth.
 In fiscal 2022, we plan to execute the first phase of Project SOAR, our multiyear effort to upgrade our enterprise resource planning platform, migrate to Google Cloud as our data and analytics platform to facilitate data accessibility, enhanced reporting and faster decision-making, begin a 2-year effort to refresh our store POS systems and leverage our continuous improvement capability to identify, prioritize, activate and measure meaningful cross-functional process optimization opportunities.
 In support of our supply chain optimization efforts, this year, we plan to begin an upgrade and retrofit of our Greenwood distribution center, begin construction of our first market fulfillment center and implement new transportation tools to provide better visibility to loads in transit.
 Our winning culture is a key driver of Ulta Beauty's success. And our fifth strategic pillar is to protect and cultivate our world-class culture and talent. We strive to make Ulta Beauty a great place to work by leading with our hearts, caring for each other in everything we do and demonstrating integrity, authenticity and inclusivity daily.
 To reinforce our position as an employer of choice and enable us to continue to successfully navigate anticipated tight labor markets, this year, we intend to increase investments in training and development programs to enhance the guest experience, improve personnel performance and help associates manage their career, continue leveraging our diverse slate recruitment efforts, further enhance and optimize our talent acquisition processes, increase investment in development programs to help associates plan and develop their careers and continue to navigate the pandemic with safety at the forefront for all of our associates.
 Finally, our sixth strategic pillar is to expand our environmental and social impact. As the largest U.S. beauty retailer, we have the power to shape how the world sees beauty and responsibility to inspire positive change.
 Building on the progress we made in 2021, this year, we plan to continue to amplify underrepresented voices through media investments with multicultural platforms; the expansion of our MUSE platform and increased brand marketing support for black-owned, black-founded and black-led brands within our assortment; build an ecosystem to support the pipeline of BIPOC brands, including the creation of an accelerator program focused on early-stage BIPOC beauty brands to educate, inspire and support brand participants to prepare for retail readiness; and an investment in new voices, a venture capital firm that partners with and invests in entrepreneurs of color to drive scalable, sustainable businesses; continue to invest in training and internal programming to ensure our guests, associates and communities feel connected to and reflected at Ulta Beauty.
 And as we look to reduce our carbon footprint, we plan to expand our LED lighting retrofit program, double our investment in renewable energy credits and explore opportunities to collaborate with our brand partners to identify opportunities to reduce Scope 3 emissions together.
 We recently published our 2021 ESG report, which includes information about our strong corporate governance practices and commitment to operating an ethical business. In addition, it includes disclosures aligned with the SASB Index and TCFD as well as updated EEO-1 information.
 In closing, I am incredibly proud of what the Ulta Beauty team has accomplished and excited about the opportunities ahead. We operate in a healthy, culturally relevant and growing category. We have a strong proven business model, and we have a winning culture and simply outstanding associates. We have ambitious plans, and I am confident we have the right team to execute our strategies and deliver for our guests, associates and shareholders.
 And now, I will turn the call over to Scott for a discussion of the financial results. Scott? 
Scott Settersten: Thanks, Dave, and good afternoon, everyone. Before I review our financial results, I want to echo Dave's comments and express my sincere appreciation to all our Ulta Beauty associates for their focus on providing great guest experiences and managing the business, especially in such a dynamic operating environment. Their dedication to our guests and each other enabled us to deliver another strong quarter and an outstanding year for our shareholders.
 Now to our fourth quarter results, beginning with the income statement. Overall, results for the quarter were better than anticipated, primarily driven by stronger-than-expected holiday sales and a rational promotional environment. Sales growth across both physical and digital channels were stronger than expected, resulting in gross margin and less SG&A deleverage than planned. As a result, operating margin increased to 13.8% of sales for the quarter.
 Net sales for the quarter increased 24.1%, driven by 21.4% growth in comp sales and strong new store performance. Transactions for the quarter increased 10.4%, driven by double-digit growth in store traffic. And average ticket increased 9.9%, resulting from both a higher average selling price and an increase in units per transaction.
 Looking at the cadence of sales for the quarter. November was the strongest month, supported by our successful marketing efforts and guests' early holiday shopping. Post-holiday, overall growth moderated, driven primarily by a deceleration of store traffic, likely reflecting disruption from weather and the Omicron variant.
 During the quarter, we opened 6 new stores, relocated 3 stores and remodeled 1 store. Compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019, total sales increased 18.4% and comp sales increased 15.4%. For the quarter, gross margin increased about 250 basis points to 37.6% of sales compared to 35.1% last year. The increase was primarily due to the leverage of fixed costs, favorable channel mix shifts and higher merchandise margin.
 Consistent with trends we experienced in the first 3 quarters of the year, in the fourth quarter, strong top line growth and benefits from our occupancy cost optimization efforts resulted in significant leverage of fixed costs. Channel mix was favorable as the penetration of e-commerce sales was about 600 basis points lower than last year. And merchandise margin improved, primarily due to lower promotional activity and ongoing benefits from our category management efforts.
 Comparing this year's performance to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019, gross margin improved by 260 basis points. Higher merchandise margin and fixed cost leverage were partially offset by adverse channel mix.
 As planned, SG&A increased 26% to $650 million. As a percentage of sales, SG&A increased 40 basis points to 23.8% compared to 23.4% last year, primarily due to higher incentive compensation and store payroll and benefits, partially offset by leverage of marketing expense due to higher sales.
 Reflecting strong operational performance versus our internal targets, incentive compensation associated with our annual bonus program increased compared to last year. In addition, we elected to grant discretionary appreciation bonuses to our store associates in recognition of their efforts to deliver this outstanding performance. In total, higher incentive compensation drove about 60 basis points of deleverage in the quarter.
 Store payroll and benefits expense in the quarter was higher than last year, reflecting an increase in the number of store associates and higher average wage rates. Compared to fiscal 2019, SG&A as a percentage of sales was about 140 basis points unfavorable, primarily due to higher incentive compensation and marketing expense.
 Operating margin was 13.8% of sales compared to 10.2% of sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 on a GAAP basis and 11.6% of sales on an adjusted basis. Strong top line growth, driven primarily by stores, combined with the impact of our ongoing cost optimization efforts, resulted in record level operating margin performance.
 The company's tax rate decreased to 22.9% compared to 23.4% in the fourth quarter last year. The lower effective tax rate was primarily due to a benefit from the income tax accounting for share-based compensation and state tax credits. Diluted GAAP earnings per share increased to $5.41 compared to $3.03 last year. Adjusted diluted earnings per share in Q4 of last year was $3.41.
 To recap the full year, our teams delivered sales and profits that far exceeded pre-pandemic levels. Compared to fiscal 2019, sales increased 16.7% to $8.6 billion. Operating profit increased 44% to $1.3 billion or 15% of sales. And diluted EPS increased 48% to $17.98 per share.
 Moving on to the balance sheet and cash flow statement. Total inventory increased 28% to $1.5 billion compared to $1.2 billion last year. In addition to the impact of 44 net new stores, the increase reflects inventory purchases to support new brand launches, including OLAPLEX, Fenty and Chanel as well as proactive efforts to maintain strong in-stocks of key items to support expected demand and mitigate anticipated global supply chain disruptions.
 In fiscal 2021, we invested $172 million in capital expenditures, including approximately $89 million for new stores, remodels and merchandise fixtures, $60 million for supply chain and IT and about $23 million for store maintenance and other.
 Depreciation for the year was $268 million compared to $298 million last year, primarily reflecting the impact of last year's store impairments and store closures. Ulta Beauty continues to generate significant cash from operations. As we shared at our October Analyst Day, our priority for use of cash is to reinvest in the business to drive profitable growth. After investing to support growth, we will continue to look to return excess capital to shareholders.
 During the fourth quarter, we repurchased 1.9 million shares at a cost of $760 million. We elected to accelerate repurchases in the fourth quarter to take advantage of better-than-expected cash flow.
 Since launching our stock buyback program in 2014, we've purchased 14 million shares at an average price of $275, effectively returning $3.9 billion to shareholders, while continuing to invest in strategic growth drivers. Having essentially completed the authorization announced in March of 2020, today, we announced a new share repurchase authorization for $2 billion.
 Turning now to our outlook. We are emerging from the pandemic as a stronger, healthier business. Over the last 2 years, we've strengthened category margins and improved our ability to optimize promotions. Our real estate portfolio is healthy and improving economics. Our e-commerce business is larger and more profitable. And we've strengthened our analytical capabilities and adjusted our cost structure.
 At our Analyst Day in October, we shared an updated growth algorithm with investors. Over the next 3 years, we expect to deliver net sales growth between 5% and 7% on a compound annual growth basis using fiscal 2019 as the base year; operating profit between 13% and 14% of sales; low double-digit diluted earnings per share growth on a CAGR basis, again using fiscal 2019 as the base year; and maintaining capital expenditures between 4% and 5% of sales.
 As we look to fiscal 2022, we continue to expect that sales growth and operating margin will be in line with these longer-term targets. Our EPS guidance of low to mid-single-digit growth reflects lapping extraordinary performance in fiscal 2021. Our guidance for fiscal 2022 also includes macro considerations, including continued wage pressures and higher supply chain costs as well as the impact of a more normalized investment agenda.
 Specifically, in fiscal 2022, we plan to open approximately 50 net new stores and remodel or relocate approximately 35 stores. We expect net sales will be between $9.05 billion and $9.15 billion, with comp sales growth between 3% and 4%. Our sales outlook reflects a more normalized growth trend for the beauty category, including a modest recovery in makeup, while also considering various uncertainties including inflationary risks to consumer spending and the impact of increasing points of distribution for Prestige Beauty.
 For your modeling purposes, we anticipate comp growth in the first half will be in the mid-single-digit range, driven by stronger growth in the first quarter and then moderate to low single-digit growth as we lap last year's recovery. We expect operating margin for the year will be between 13.7% and 14% of sales compared to 15% in fiscal 2021, with deleverage from both gross margin and SG&A. We anticipate operating margin deleverage will be greater in the first half as we lap last year's strong performance.
 We expect gross margin will be lower than fiscal 2021, driven primarily by lower merchandise margin resulting from the impact of new brand launches, lapping onetime benefits from favorable inventory reserve adjustments and a more normalized promotional environment. We also expect supply chain costs will increase more than sales, resulting in additional pressure on gross margin.
 We expect SG&A expense will deleverage, driven primarily by $70 million to $75 million of expenses related to our strategic priorities, including investments to support UB Media, Ulta Beauty at Target, Project SOAR and other IT capabilities as well as higher wage rate growth across the enterprise, partially offset by lower incentive compensation. These assumptions result in guidance for diluted earnings per share in the range of $18.20 to $18.70 per share, including the impact of approximately $900 million in share repurchases.
 We are not providing specific quarterly guidance. But as you update your financial models, consider that the second quarter will likely be our most challenging quarter of the year as we lap extraordinary performance in fiscal 2021. As a result, we are currently planning for EPS in the second quarter to decrease about 10%.
 Finally, we plan to spend between $375 million and $425 million in CapEx, including approximately $195 million for supply chain and IT; $150 million for new stores, remodels and merchandise fixtures; and about $55 million for store maintenance and other. We expect depreciation for the year will be between $250 million and $255 million. I would note that our guidance assumes no changes in federal tax rate environment and no material increases in the federal minimum wage.
 In closing, a rapidly recovering environment, combined with the outstanding efforts of our teams and the work we have done to strengthen the business, enabled us to deliver record performance in fiscal 2021. While lapping this performance will be difficult, we remain confident in our longer-term growth targets.
 Ulta Beauty has established significant long-term competitive advantages. And we believe we are well positioned to capitalize on growth opportunities within the $140 billion U.S. beauty products and salon services industry and continue to deliver long-term shareholder value.
 And now I'll turn the call back over to our operator to moderate the Q&A session. 
Operator: Our first question comes from Dana Telsey with Telsey Group. 
Dana Telsey: Congratulations on the nice progress. As you think about the current macro landscape out there and the inflationary pressures, how are you thinking about pricing in 2022? And how does that feed into the margin? And do you see any difference by category? 
David Kimbell: Great. Dana, thanks for the question. And yes, certainly, we are tracking and monitoring closely the inflationary environment, and we understand the unique dynamics that we're facing. We recognize consumers are going to be facing headwinds from rising prices and other dynamics.
 I will say that as we look at the beauty category, even with these headwinds, we remain positive. The category is healthy. It is growing. It's emotionally important and connected to our consumers. We are in the midst, even as we face some of these inflationary pressures, that we're in the midst of opening of the economy, of the world around us, which is beneficial. We know consumers are working to maintain their self-care routine.
 And so despite the headwinds, we think the category is well positioned. And then uniquely, Ulta is well positioned because of our model. The fact that we are across all price points, all categories, mass, prestige, we are able to adjust and reflect evolving consumer needs as the world around us changes. Pricing has -- every year, there's pricing. Certainly, over the last few months, we've seen some pricing action in -- from some of our brands.
 A reminder, in our prestige side of the business, it tends to be MSRP. And so we're -- we would be reflective of where the broader market is going. But it hasn't been an extraordinary amount of price increase yet. And any benefit of that is certainly reflected in our guidance going forward. But as cost pressures increase, both on our business and our brand partners' business, we'll be clearly tracking this closely and making sure we're adjusting appropriately as we manage through the year. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Mark Altschwager with Baird. 
Mark Altschwager: I wanted to ask about the rewards program and spend per member. It looks like kind of your average spend per Ultimate Rewards member must have been up pretty nicely 2021 versus 2019. Just any color there would be great. And how much of that is category recovery versus share of wallet gains? And then looking ahead, you did allow some of the increased distribution points for Prestige Beauty as a consideration in your guidance. So curious how you're thinking about ability to continue to capture share of wallet and the opportunities in 2022? 
David Kimbell: Great. Well, we are incredibly proud of our loyalty program. We have been for a long time. And I'm really, really pleased with the results that the team delivered in 2021 to reach a record level of 37 million active members, which is not only 13% ahead of 2020, but 6% ahead of 2019. So our guests are highly engaged. Reactivation rates and retention rates are very strong.
 We did see an increase in spend per member, which we're encouraged by. And that's driven by a number of factors as we continue to optimize the way we're engaging, leveraging our personalization efforts, providing more relevant, appropriate messages to our guests brought through our CRM capability. We've seen a category mix change.
 We've talked consistently through the year about the growth of fragrance. Some other like tools in our hair tools, some higher ticket items that have been driving very strong growth ahead of the total store. And so that's contributing to it. And I'd just say an overall connection to Ulta Beauty. I mentioned just the high level of unaided awareness, the strong emotional connection that we're building is driving greater share of wallet. And our efforts going forward will continue to drive that.
 As I look at the broader marketplace and share of wallet, and yes, there is expanded points of distribution on the prestige side of business, part of which is Ulta Beauty, both in our own stores and our partnership with Target. And I'm really pleased that in the fourth quarter, we gained share when we look across all of our points of distribution, including Target, despite hundreds of more new locations, competitive locations.
 So we're confident. We think we've got the right model, strong competitive position, most importantly, deep connection to our guests that's demonstrating stronger loyalty to Ulta Beauty. And we're going to leverage that to continue to drive growth and share growth into 2022. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Oliver Chen with Cowen. 
Oliver Chen: On the guidance, what gives you confidence that makeup will return to growth? And how does that intersect with inventory, category planning and also your comments on prestige and the competition there? As a follow-up, as you make strides in BIPOC brands, black indigenous and people of color brands, how should investors measure your success here? How are you measuring success? Do you have a lot of innovative programs there? 
David Kimbell: Great. Thanks, Oliver. Yes, there are some important topics in your questions. First, makeup, we are confident in the path ahead of makeup. And yes, and I'd say as we reflect back on the year, there were certainly some ups and downs. And what we continue to see is makeup, more than any other category, is sensitive to COVID fluctuations. And we saw that in the fourth quarter with Omicron and Delta and continued challenges there.
 But as I look forward on makeup, there are so many things that continue to encourage us. And we've seen some of these trends for a little while, but we've also -- as soon as we get momentum, we see some setbacks related to COVID. But broad macro trends of opening up and more opportunity for consumers to get back in the world, you know you're seeing it in back to work. We're seeing just a rapid acceleration in that. Events, activities, those things people getting out of their house are all exceptionally positive for the total category.
 We know all along that consumers have been passionate about makeup. Just there are opportunities -- their usage of opportunities have been more limited, but we see the passion in social media. The engagement continues to be high in all -- in TikTok and in Instagram and all other forms. So we know the connection is there. We know the opportunities are coming. We know there's important trends like the duality of natural looks and bolder looks, increased focus around eye and brow that even a resurgence of contouring, all these things are positive.
 And then you layer in for us our -- the outstanding work our merchandising team has done to continue to evolve our assortment. You -- I mentioned the launch of Fenty Beauty, which is just a really important step in our continued connection with our guests, and that is off to a very strong start. Launch of Chanel on the luxury side to tap into a new opportunity there. We have expansion in MAC, which is going quite well. And then a number of great brands. We're seeing innovation. I'll give you a couple of examples on MAC, a M·A·CStack Mascara that has 1 formula in 2 wands for both volume and precision.
 We've got a NYX Line Loud lip liner that's exclusive to Ulta Beauty that's performing well. We've got Morphe X Lucky Charms that's getting exclusive and driving engagement. And we've got Treslúce by Becky G, which is a Mexican-American Singer celebrating her Latin root. So we have exclusivity, newness. We've big brands, emerging brands.
 And it ties to your last point, your question about BIPOC. We see success by these brands thriving. We're not here just to get these brands on the shelf. It's one thing to arrive on our shelves, it's another thing to thrive. And that's how we're measuring success. We want these brands to be -- perform well, to grow, to have great opportunities [indiscernible]. And that's how we're measuring it. And that's how I'd suggest you look at it. We're doing this to drive engagement with our, we're seeing it for our brands. So we're optimistic about beauty, about makeup. And BIPOC will be one of the elements that will help us drive growth going forward. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Chris Horvers with JPMorgan. 
Christopher Horvers: You talked about gross margin down in 2022. That seems a bit different from your prior commentary. Is that simply lapping through this big gross margin beat in the fourth quarter? Or is there something changing in your outlook or something that you're seeing in the market? And then on the gross margin side, can you help us a little bit on the cadence front? 
Scott Settersten: Yes. Thanks, Chris. So I don't really think that there's any inconsistency in our messaging here. I think the variables at play are pretty consistent over the course of the year as you think about 2022, I would say. So again, it's back to merchandise margins, right, being under pressure in 2022 compared to what we've just been through the last year or so.
 With the promotional environment, we think it's going to get back to more normal kind of business environment and then incremental supply chain costs, including transportation costs and wages and our distribution centers being greater than our growth outlook is for next year. So a combination of those things driving deleverage.
 And then as we think about the year, I guess, as we said, second quarter is going to be the toughest. So again,first half of the year stronger, generally speaking, on operating margin than the second half. Partly that's being driven in the first quarter by stronger sales as we lap over. Last year at this time, we were just starting to come out of the depths of the pandemic.
 So sales, especially in the store fleet, stronger this year in the first quarter than they were a year ago. That drives a lot of leverage for us and helps gross margin and operating margin overall and then sequencing again, and I think we said in our prepared remarks, those impacts overall kind of moderate as we get deeper into the year. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Kelly Crago with Citi. 
Kelly Crago: Just curious if you could elaborate a bit on your partnership with Target. Now that you're at your 9 months in, are Target stops helping drive new customer sales? What does the spend look like for our customers who shop both channels? Any other color you could provide around customer behavior, at least at Target, would be helpful? 
Kecia Steelman: Yes. Thanks, Kelly, for the question. As a retail leader, we're really aiming to deliver a seamless, omnichannel experience that meets our guests wherever they are. The newest element of this omnichannel strategy of the Ulta Beauty at Target is really providing us another way to engage and discover Ulta Beauty for a new guest set that's shopping at Target. The strategy is working.
 What I would share is that our existing Ultimate Rewards members, they're taking advantage of shopping at Ulta Beauty at Target, and we're also introducing this to some new guests. The guest response has been really positive. The awareness remains strong. As Dave mentioned in his comments, more than 1 million members have linked their Ultimate Rewards in Target Circle accounts, and we're signing up new members every week.
 Target shared at their recent financial community meeting that the productivity in their space is very high. So that's always a good indicator, too. And I would say that while it's still really early, we're really encouraged that we see new members bouncing back into Ulta Beauty, and their shopping behaviors are very similar to our existing loyalty members. So just to kind of wrap up, overall, we're very pleased. While this is still new, we're pleased with how this is playing out as part of our omni strategy going forward. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Mike Baker with D.A. Davidson. 
Michael Baker: Maybe a 2-parter. Just on makeup, were you seeing it up on a 2-year basis earlier in the quarter and then Omicron slowed that down? Is that what you're saying? And can you talk about what you might be seeing in some areas of the country that seem to reopen earlier and not be as impacted by Omicron or at least didn't seem to slow down some of the people going out, Texas, Florida, maybe places like that? 
David Kimbell: Yes. What I will say, we won't get into like every period throughout the quarter. But for sure, what we see on makeup is a -- as anxiety around COVID has increased, has fluctuated through the last 2 years, we do see more pressure on makeup. And -- but now across the country, as more and more people both -- yes, some parts of the country have been more open than others, but there still has been a consumer concern, even as elements are open, that is easing right now across all parts of the country. And so that's encouraging to us.
 And that's what we think we need is more ongoing, consistent confidence to be back into work, be back at various activities and events. And as we see that, we know that's an element. It's not the only thing, but it's an important element to make up success going forward. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Anthony Chukumba with Loop Capital Markets. 
Anthony Chukumba: To be respectful for everyone on the call, I'll actually limit it to one question, one actual question. So I just was wondering if you could just give us a little bit more color on the rollout of Fenty Beauty. Just any color in terms of number of stores, linear feet, end caps. Any additional color would be very helpful. 
David Kimbell: Thank you for modeling the one question rule, Anthony. I appreciate that. And yes, we are thrilled with Fenty. It is in all stores. It is online. It is -- if you have a chance to go into any Ulta Beauty store, you'll see it right at the front of the store. In most of our stores right at the front, it has an entire the 18-foot run and an end cap broad assortment featuring Fenty among other things is known for the breadth of assortment in [ beige ] in particular. So you'll see that being able to test and try items.
 So -- and then strong, strong presence online. In fact, we really found some unique ways in our online footprint to bring that brand to life and communicate to our guests. And so off to a great start, really pleased with it. Really glad that Kendo organization has partnered with us in many ways and see this as a key part of our success going forward. I'm thrilled to have Rihanna and Fenty as part of the Ulta Beauty family for a long time to come. 
Kiley Rawlins: Hector, I think we have time for one more question, please. 
Operator: Our final question comes from Adrienne Yih with Barclays. 
Adrienne Yih-Tennant: Congratulations to the team and all the store employees, what a wonderful year. Dave, my question is for you, and it's getting back to the Ulta at TARGET a couple of weeks ago before announced the potential to expand to 850 stores by 2023 through Kohl's. You mentioned over 200 for this year. So I'm just wondering, can you share with us any data from that partnership, new customer acquisition? Any details there? And what would you need to see to accelerate that a little bit more aggressively beyond the 200? 
David Kimbell: Well, let me give a little bit of color, and I'll ask Kecia to kind of follow -- give some more detail to build off her previous answer on this. But -- and we are just thrilled to be partnering with Target. We know there's been -- we're in the midst of a real transformation in the Prestige Beauty landscape.
 And the fact that in the fourth quarter, with hundreds of new locations across Prestige Beauty, across the location, the fact that Ulta Beauty continues to gain share we think is a reflection of the strength of our strategy, the execution that we brought both in stores, online and in our Target Ulta Beauty at Target relationship.
 We are delighting guests. We're gaining share even as there's other competitive activity. And we're confident we're going to be able to continue to do. But Kecia, do you want to give some specifics about number of stores and what the outlook looks like there? 
Kecia Steelman: Yes. What we've said, Adrienne, is a little over 250 this next year. We are in close partnership and we are following Target's remodel schedule. So that really kind of plays into timing, sequencing, et cetera, of how we're going about opening new stores. But the partnership is really strong.
 We're really pleased with our results. And the space -- the productivity in this space is high. It's a highly curated assortment with 50 key brand partners. And we're continuing to learn and evolve and grow as we continue to roll out more locations, but over 250 in the next year. 
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of the question-and-answer session, and I would like to turn the call back to Mr. Dave Kimbell for closing remarks. 
David Kimbell: All right. Awesome. Thank you all for joining us today. Really appreciate it. In closing, I want to thank, again, our 40,000 associates for delivering a simply outstanding 2021 and with a relentless commitment to our guests, to each other and to moving our business forward.
 We all look forward to speaking to all of you again in May when we report our first quarter results. I hope you have a great evening. Thanks again for joining. 
Operator: This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you all for your participation.

===== 2021 Q3  (2021-12-02 16:30:00) =====
Operator: Good afternoon, and welcome to Ulta Beauty's conference call to discuss results for the Third Quarter of fiscal 2021. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.  
 It is now my pleasure to introduce Ms. Kiley Rawlins, Vice President of Investor Relations. Ms. Rawlins, please proceed. 
Kiley Rawlins: Thank you, Laura. Good afternoon, everyone. Hosting our call today are Dave Kimbell, Chief Executive Officer; and Scott Settersten, Chief Financial Officer. Kecia Steelman, Chief Operating Officer, will join us for the Q&A.  
 This afternoon, we released our financial results for the third quarter of fiscal 2021. A copy of the press release is available in the Investor Relations section of our website.  
 Before we begin, I'd like to remind you of the company's safe harbor language. The statements contained in this conference call, which are not historical facts, may be deemed to constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual future results may differ materially from those projected in such statements due to a number of risks and uncertainties, all of which are described in the company's filings with the SEC. We caution you not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of today, December 2, 2021. We have no obligation to update or revise our forward-looking statements, except as required by law, and you should not expect us to do so.  
 In today's comments, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted operating income and adjusted diluted EPS for the third quarter of fiscal 2020. A reconciliation of these measures to the corresponding GAAP measures can be found in our earnings release, which is available in the Investor Relations section of our website.  
 We'll begin this afternoon with prepared remarks from Dave and Scott. Following our prepared comments, we will open up the call for questions. [Operator Instructions] As always, [ Mary Kate ] and I will be available for any follow-up questions after the call.  
 Now I'd like to turn the call over to Dave. Dave? 
David Kimbell: Thank you, Kiley, and good afternoon, everyone. The Ulta Beauty team delivered outstanding results again this quarter. For the third quarter, net sales increased 28.6% to a record $2 billion. Operating profit increased to 14.2% of sales, and diluted EPS increased to $3.94 per share. 
 In addition to producing these excellent financial results, we also delivered strong operational results. We continue to increase our market share in Prestige Beauty based on dollar sales for the 13 weeks ended October 30, 2021, compared to the same period last year. We increased the number of members in our Ultimate Rewards loyalty program by 13% to a record 35.9 million members and returned to pre-pandemic member penetration levels. And we navigated global supply chain challenges and tight labor markets and remained well positioned to meet guest needs and deliver a successful holiday season. 
 This performance reflects the strength and resiliency of the beauty category, the power of Ulta Beauty's differentiated model and the impact of our winning culture and outstanding team. I want to express my sincere appreciation to all of our Ulta Beauty associates for their incredible efforts to serve our guests and deliver these excellent results. I'm inspired every day by our associates' passion for beauty and passion for our guests, and I am honored to lead such a great company of talented associates who continue to care for each other while driving our business forward. 
 At our Analyst Day in October, we introduced a new strategic framework, which will shape our future and enable Ulta Beauty to deliver against longer-term financial targets. Today, I'll reiterate some of the information we discussed about our strategic imperatives and share an update on progress made in the third quarter, then I'll share how we are positioning Ulta Beauty for holiday before I turn it over to Scott to discuss the financials. 
 Starting with our focus on driving breakthrough and disruptive growth through an expanded definition of All Things Beauty. Our differentiated assortment is core to our success. And we continue to innovate, evolve and expand our offering to excite the beauty enthusiast. 
 In the third quarter, all major categories delivered robust double-digit comp growth compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2020, driven by cycling last year's disruption from COVID, product newness and strong performance from our strategic promotional events, including 21 Days of Beauty, [ Ahava ] and our Gorgeous Hair event. 
 Compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2019, fragrance, bath, haircare and skincare all delivered strong double-digit comp growth. While makeup was slightly below 2019 levels, we are encouraged that the trend in Prestige Makeup improved from the second quarter, and growth in mass cosmetics remained strong. Engagement with the category remains high with consumers looking to refresh their beauty stash with new products, and recent trends give us confidence the makeup category will return to growth compared to pre-pandemic levels. 
 Compared to last year, eyes, face and lip continued to deliver strong growth within the makeup category. Engagement with false lashes and lash growth serums, combined with innovation like creamy eye shadow sticks, are driving continued growth within eye. Increased interest in tinted moisturizers and blush are driving growth within face. And lip color, lip gloss and lip balm continue to drive growth within lip. 
 Newness continues to excite and engage guests. New brands like Bobby Brown and Elaluz, combined with new product launches from a wide range of brands, including ColourPop, Urban Decay, Tarte and NYX drove nice growth in the quarter. In addition, this quarter, we expanded MAC into 200 additional stores. 
 Haircare delivered another quarter of double-digit growth driven by strong guest engagement with our strategic events, newness and our Back Bar Takeover events. In early October, we kicked off our fall Gorgeous Hair event, a semiannual event strategically focused on acquiring members who do not shop the haircare category or engage with our salon services. Building on the success of our spring event, we continue to streamline offers, focus our marketing events and create relevant storytelling around hair goals, service enhancements and holiday kits. 
 We saw good growth from our core assortment and engagement with new brands like KRISTIN ESS, Briogeo, and Verb. And product newness from brands like Dyson, Living Proof, Redken and Curlsmith continued to resonate with guests. We continue to expand our assortment of prestige haircare brands, and I'm excited to share we will launch OLAPLEX, the #1 prestige hair brand in the market, in all Ulta Beauty stores and on ulta.com in January. 
 Our Back Bar Takeovers give our stylists the unique opportunity to introduce new brands and products to guests. And this quarter, salon takeovers by Bondi Boost, IGK, Verb and KRISTIN ESS all drove nice sales growth during their respective takeovers. 
 Skincare delivered another quarter of strong double-digit sales growth as guests continue to invest in self-care and maintain their skincare regimens. Similar to last quarter, skincare routines, including moisturizers, serums and cleansers, drove category growth. New brands, including Drunk Elephant; Fresh; Good Molecules, which is exclusive to Ulta Beauty and peach slices; as well as new products from Tula, Clinique and The Ordinary drove solid guest engagement. 
 Finally, our fragrance and bath category continued to deliver exceptional growth. Ariana Grande's latest fragrance, God is a Woman, which is exclusive to Ulta Beauty; as well as newness from Carolina Herrera; Coach; YSL and Dior, drove strong growth during the quarter. Events included in our back-to-school gift with purchase and our monthly Fragrance Crush program also drove strong engagement. Beyond fragrance, the bath and body category continues to drive robust growth as moisturizers and scrubs remain on trend. 
 In addition to delivering growth from our core categories, we are focused on driving growth from key cross-functional platforms. Starting with Conscious Beauty, our cross-category initiative intended to help guests discover and engage with brands and products which reflect their personal values. Through this program, we identify brands across 5 key pillars: clean ingredients, cruelty free, vegan, sustainable packaging and positive impact. 
 During the quarter, we certified 19 new brands, including LAMIK Beauty, WLDKAT and Better Not Younger, bringing the total number of certified conscious beauty brands to 275 at the end of Q3. During the third quarter, we expanded our certification to the SKU level for clean ingredients and vegan and added in-store badging at the shelf for certified brands as well as new search filters online to help guests easily identify products, which reflect what is most important to them. 
 Moving now to our efforts to expand our assortment of black-owned and BIPOC brands. During the third quarter, we added 2 new black-owned brands, Sunday || Sunday and Nude Sugar, and we are on track to double the number of black-owned brands in our assortment this year. In addition, I am excited to share that we have welcomed our first South Asian owned makeup brand to the Ulta Beauty family, Live Tinted. Founded by Asian influencer Deepica Mutyala, Live Tinted is a cosmetic brand that celebrates multicultural beauty. The brand is also... 
Operator: [Technical Difficulty] 
David Kimbell: Hello, everyone. I think we're having -- we had a -- we were disconnected. I think we're having some phone network issues. But hopefully, you can hear me, and I'm going to pick up, I think, where we got cut off. So if I repeat a little bit, I apologize, but we'll dive right back in. 
 So moving now to our efforts to expand our assortment of black-owned and BIPOC brands. During the third quarter, we added 2 new black-owned brands, Sunday || Sunday and Nude Sugar, and we are on track to double the number of black-owned brands in our assortment this year. In addition, I'm excited to share we have welcomed our first South Asian-owned makeup brand to the Ulta Beauty family, Live Tinted. Founded by Asian influencer, Deepica Mutyala, Live Tinted is a cosmetic brand that celebrates multicultural beauty. The brand is also a part of our conscious beauty platform certified as clean, vegan and cruelty-free. 
 Based on our proprietary research, we know 65% of beauty enthusiasts believe beauty is significantly connected to wellness. Reflecting this consumer insight, in the second quarter, we launched the wellness shop online and in 450 stores. This cross-category platform offers self-care products for the mind, body and spirit in an accessible, easy-to-navigate way. In the third quarter, we refreshed the wellness shop assortment shifting from summer solutions to total body care and hydration, which is especially relevant during colder months and introduced new items from HAIRtamin, [ Alum ], OSEA and Josie Maran. 
 Turning now to our efforts to evolve the guest experience through our personalized and connected omnichannel ecosystem, All in Your World. We know the guest journey is increasingly blurring across physical and digital channels, and we aim to deliver a cohesive omnichannel strategy to serve our guests. During Q3, we enhanced our omnichannel strategy in 4 ways. 
 First, we launched Beauty to Go, our promise that buy online, pick up in store orders will be picked up and ready to go within 2 hours or less, giving our guests fast, convenient access to the beauty they want most. We also continue to test incentive strategies to encourage guest utilization. During the third quarter, BOPIS orders increased 28% compared to last year, totaling 20% of e-commerce sales in the quarter compared to 16% last year. 
 Second, partnering with DoorDash, we launched same-day delivery in Atlanta, Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles, Houston and Boise, and we're excited about the value and convenience that will provide guests this holiday season. 
 Third, in October, we launched 2 exclusive salon services in all stores and relaunched skin services in select stores. Starting with salons. We have partnered with OLAPLEX to offer guests a professional bond repair service, which reverses damage caused by hair color, chemical treatment, heat and styling and the environment. And we have partnered with Redken to introduce a new express root touch-up service that offers guests 100% gray coverage color in only 10 minutes. These new exclusive services are bringing new guests into our salon. 
 We also relaunched skin services in 100 locations featuring a revamped menu with new services to address specific guest concerns, such as hydration, anti-aging and acne. While it's still early, we are pleased with how guests are engaging with these new offerings. 
 Finally, we launched Ulta Beauty at Target in 92 stores and online during the third quarter, and I am pleased to share we have reached our fiscal year goal of opening more than 100 shops. We are excited about this innovative partnership and how, together with Target, we will change the way guests experience beauty. While it will take time for us to understand what role this new distribution point will play for our guests, we are incredibly pleased with the ongoing customer excitement and encouraged to see Ultimate Reward members linking their accounts with Target Circle as well as new members signing up through the shop. 
 Moving on to our efforts to expand and deepen our presence across the guest beauty journey as the heart of the beauty community. We are focused on how to best elevate consumer connection, supercharge, member acquisition and drive guest loyalty, love and share of wallet. 
 In the third quarter, we continue to elevate our storytelling with relevant content across channels to launch Ulta Beauty at Target and to support our strategic events. In addition, as students return to classrooms after more than a year of virtual learning, we saw an opportunity to deepen our engagement with Gen Z audiences across channels with insight-driven campaigns during key back-to-school moments. 
 We ended the third quarter with 35.9 million active members, 13% above last year and 6% above 2019. While we continue to add new members, member growth this quarter was largely driven by a reactivation of lapsed members and active member retention. 
 After experiencing headwinds last year due to the disruption from the pandemic, we have accelerated personalization to create stronger life cycle strategies, build baskets and maximize business returns, and we are very pleased with the results. We are driving strong conversion of new members in stores and online. We are successfully reengaging members who lapsed during the pandemic, and we are driving stronger engagement from our existing members. Importantly, our member retention rates have recovered to pre-pandemic levels, and spend per member is at an all-time high. 
 Shifting now to our plans and expectations for holiday. Based on our consumer insights, we expected many guests would start their holiday shopping earlier this year, and we proactively took steps to ensure we were ready with holiday sets, stocking stuffers and unique collaborations to help guests get a head start on their gifting needs. 
 If holiday 2020 was about less, holiday 2021 is about more, more fun, more in real life gatherings, more gifting and more glamming. All of our teams at Ulta Beauty are ready and excited to help our guests celebrate more this year. Like last year, we kicked off the holiday season in early November with our Hello Holidays campaign, early Black Friday deals and new loyalty offers. With authentic stories of connection and joy across video, digital, social and print platforms to encourage and motivate beauty enthusiasts to shop Ulta Beauty, we'll be everywhere our guests are this holiday season. 
 Our merchant teams have built an outstanding holiday assortment with giftable fun items across categories and price points. With new brands like Bobby Brown, Drunk Elephant and Briogeo, expanded assortments from brands like Laura Mercier, Florence and Pattern and exciting holiday offerings from brands like Dyson, Tarte, Ariana Grande, Truly and our very own Ulta Beauty Collection, we have great gifts for everyone. 
 To help guests explore our best holiday gifts, we developed a unique digital experience to allow for easy discovery of holiday gifts online and in-store. When guests visit ulta.com or scan the QR codes on a banner at the front of our store, an app click will launch giving the guest an opportunity to easily explore top gifts by category. Our stores are always the center of holiday at Ulta Beauty. 
 As we combine our great in-store experience with our innovative omnichannel capabilities, we'll meet every guest wherever and however they want to shop Ulta Beauty. To help guests get ready for in real-life celebrations, we've expanded salon capacity to 100% in all Ulta Beauty salons and benefit brow bars except where limited by state or local mandates, and we've relaunched skin services in select stores. 
 Finally, our BOPIS, curbside and same-day delivery options, will provide guests with great shopping convenience this holiday season. Our teams are excited, engaged and ready to support our guests from proactively managing inventory flow and anticipating supply chain challenges to stress testing our IT systems and digital platforms to successfully accelerating our holiday hiring. The holiday season is off to a strong start, and I am confident we are well positioned to deliver another successful holiday season at Ulta Beauty. 
 In closing, we are excited about the strength we are seeing in our business. Our third quarter performance exceeded our initial expectations, and we are encouraged by the early holiday trends. The beauty category is recovering, and our teams are executing well. We are investing and innovating to ensure Ulta Beauty will lead the new beauty landscape, and we are confident our well-defined strategy will enable us to capture more market share and drive profitable growth. 
 And now I will turn the call over to Scott for a discussion of the financial results. Scott? 
Scott Settersten: Thanks, Dave, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, we reported stronger-than-expected third quarter results, and I would like to echo Dave's comments and express my appreciation to all our Ulta Beauty associates for delivering another outstanding quarter. 
 Starting with the income statement. Q3 sales increased 28.6% driven by double-digit growth in comp sales and strong new store performance. Total company comp increased 25.8% primarily driven by strong transaction growth in stores. In addition to robust sales growth from stores, e-commerce exceeded our expectations delivering modest growth on top of last year's 90% growth. Total company transactions for the quarter increased 16.8%. Average ticket increased 7.7%, primarily due to an increase in average selling price, reflecting favorable category mix shifts and lower promotional levels. 
 During the quarter, we opened 7 new stores and closed 1 store. We also remodeled 3 stores and relocated 2 stores. Compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2019, total sales increased 19%, and comp sales increased 14.3%. From a mix perspective, makeup was 45% of sales compared to 47% last year. Haircare products and styling tools were 21% of sales compared to 20% last year. Skincare was 16% of sales, flat with last year. And the fragrance and bath category increased 200 basis points to 12% of sales. 
 Q3 gross profit margin increased 450 basis points to 39.6% of sales compared to 35.1% last year. The increase was primarily due to leverage of fixed costs, channel mix shifts, leverage of salon expenses and higher margin merchandise margin. 
 Consistent with what we experienced in the first half of this year, strong top line growth and benefits from our occupancy cost optimization efforts resulted in significant leverage of fixed costs. E-commerce sales penetration in Q3 was about 500 basis points lower than last year as we cycled last year's strong e-commerce growth. As a percentage of sales, salon expenses also leveraged, reflecting strong top line sales and lower costs from the elimination of the salon manager role. As a reminder, we will anniversary this change in Q4. 
 The improvement in merchandise margin was primarily the result of higher sales, lower promotional activity and ongoing benefits from our category management efforts. Comparing this year's performance to the third quarter of fiscal 2019, gross margin improved by 250 basis points. Higher merchandise margin, fixed cost leverage and leverage of salon expenses were partially offset by adverse channel mix. 
 As a percentage of sales, SG&A decreased to 25.2% and compared to 26.8% last year. Strong top line growth drove leverage of corporate overhead, store expenses and store payroll and benefits. This leverage was partially offset by deleverage from marketing expense, primarily reflecting increased spend on print advertising compared to the third quarter last year. 
 Last year, we significantly reduced our spend on print material in Q3 due to the pandemic. This year, our cadence of print was more normalized. And as Dave mentioned earlier, we are leveraging our CRM capabilities to optimize circulation and increase the profitability of our print vehicles. Compared to Q3 of fiscal 2019, SG&A as a percentage of sales was about 150 basis points favorable. As a percentage of sales, lower store expenses, store payroll and benefits and corporate overhead were partially offset by higher marketing expense. 
 Operating margin was 14.2% of sales compared to 6.5% of sales in the third quarter of fiscal 2020 on a GAAP basis and 8% of sales on an adjusted basis. Strong top line growth driven primarily by stores, combined with the impact of our ongoing cost optimization efforts, including promotional optimization, delivered strong operating margin results. 
 The company's tax rate decreased to 24.1% compared to 25.1% in the third quarter last year. The lower effective tax rate is primarily due to favorable provision to tax return adjustments driven by federal employment tax credits compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2020. 
 Diluted GAAP earnings per share increased to $3.94 compared to $1.32 last year. Adjusted diluted earnings per share in Q3 of last year was $1.64. 
 Moving on to the balance sheet and cash flow. We ended the quarter with $1.9 billion of inventory compared to $1.4 billion last year. In addition to the impact of 40 additional stores, the increase in inventory reflects our proactive efforts to mitigate holiday sales risk due to anticipated supply chain disruptions. Where appropriate, our teams work closely with our brand partners to prioritize receipts to ensure we have adequate inventory of core and seasonal product to support expected demand for the holiday season. 
 Capital expenditures were $51.1 million for the quarter, driven by investments in new stores, remodels and relocations, supply chain and IT systems. Depreciation was $65.2 million compared to $72.4 million last year, primarily reflecting the impact of last year's store impairments and store closures. 
 We ended the quarter with $605.1 million in cash and cash equivalents. In the third quarter, we repurchased 341,000 shares at a cost of $126.4 million. At the end of the quarter, we had $759.8 million remaining under our current $1.6 billion repurchase authorization. We continue to expect to repurchase approximately 850 million of shares in fiscal 2021, but as always, have the flexibility to modify the cadence of repurchases in response to market conditions. 
 Turning now to our updated outlook for 2021. We are very pleased with our year-to-date results through Q3 and are encouraged by the strong trends we've experienced so far in the fourth quarter. However, we recognize we still have several significant sales weeks left in the holiday season, and the operating environment continues to be dynamic. Despite these uncertainties, we have increased our financial expectations for the year. We now expect net sales for the year will be between $8.5 billion and $8.6 billion with comp sales growth forecasted in the 36% to 37% range. This guidance reflects our expectation that fourth quarter comp growth will be between 15% and 20%. For the year, we plan to open approximately 44 net new stores and remodel or relocate 17 stores. 
 We now expect operating margin rate for fiscal 2021 will be between 14.3% and 14.5% of sales. We continue to believe the largest driver of our operating margin expansion will come from gross margin, driven by leverage of fixed costs, less headwind from channel shift, improving merchandise margin and leverage of salon costs. 
 Based on higher top line growth, we now expect to leverage SG&A more than previously expected as compared to fiscal 2020. Based on these assumptions, we now expect diluted earnings per share will be between $16.70 and $17.10 per share, including the impact of approximately $850 million in share repurchases. 
 We now expect to spend between $200 million and $225 million in CapEx in fiscal 2021, including approximately $100 million for new stores, remodels and merchandise fixtures, $80 million for supply chain and IT and about $34 million for store maintenance and other. As a reminder, our guidance for fiscal 2021 assumes a consistent federal tax rate and no material increases in the federal minimum wage. 
 Before we open the call for questions, I'd like to address a few follow-up questions we received from our October Analyst Day event. First, our longer-term financial targets. In October, we shared targets for revenue and earnings growth, which we are confident we can deliver through fiscal 2024 based on the limited visibility we have in the dynamic operating environment. As a reminder, we are targeting net sales growth between 5% and 7% and diluted earnings per share growth in the low double-digit range on a compound annual growth basis using fiscal 2019 as base through fiscal 2024. 
 In addition, we are targeting operating profit margins in the 13% to 14% range over the next 3 years. Our operating margin expectations reflect a balanced and disciplined approach to strategic investments that will support our long-term growth aspirations and deliver strong shareholder returns. 
 Regarding the timing of investments related to Project SOAR, our multiyear effort to upgrade our enterprise resource planning or ERP platform. We expect to invest $160 million to $180 million in capital over the next 3 years, with most of the investment planned for fiscal 2022 and 2023. As a reminder, in addition to providing us with more flexible and scalable operating environment, this new platform will support future growth and innovation. We expect to begin to see operational benefits from this investment in fiscal 2023. 
 Lastly, we are still finalizing our budget for fiscal 2022 and plan to provide financial guidance in line with our regular cadence on our March earnings call. However, we wanted to share some initial thoughts to consider as you update your financial models. 
 Comp sales growth in fiscal 2021 is expected to be significantly stronger than we initially planned, but we remain confident we can deliver comp sales growth in fiscal 2022 within our longer-term targeted range of 3% to 5%. While we expect fiscal 2021 operating margin will be modestly above our longer-term target, we expect operating margin in fiscal 2022 will be within our longer-term targeted range of 13% to 14%, reflecting a more normalized pace of top line growth and capital and operational investment. We continue to target EPS growth in fiscal 2022 despite the challenge of cycling this year's stimulus payments and reopening of the economy, but acknowledge the earnings growth rate next year will likely be lower than our longer-term target. 
 And now I'll turn the call back over to our operator to moderate the Q&A session. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Michael Lasser with UBS. 
Michael Lasser: At the time that you provided your longer-term guidance, you were expecting to have a 13% operating margin this year. You're now on pace to have the mid-14% operating margin, and yet you still expect your operating margin to be within your guidance for next year. So will you be investing more than you had originally planned for 2022? And as part of that, if you do better than the 3% to 5% sales -- comp sales increase that you're anticipating for next year, would you let that flow to the bottom line and have better-than-expected margins? 
Scott Settersten: Yes. So to the first part of your question, Michael, what we're talking about today is consistent with how we framed it up at our Analyst Day in the later part of October. So again, over the longer term, we're very confident we can deliver operating margin in the 13 to 14 percentage range. We, again, reiterated today, that's a function of what we expect to be a more moderate top line sales growth environment next year, coupled with a more normalized investment cycle for the company, and that's with people cost and all the capital costs that go along with all those new great strategic initiatives that we have well underway now. 
 So as we think about potential sales overperformance next year, which, again, we would hope to see that, we would continue to take what we always have as a very disciplined, pragmatic approach to long-term investment to drive healthy growth in the business balanced against short-term operating results. So again, just making sure we take a very balanced approach to that as we have in the past, and you can expect that to continue into the future. 
David Kimbell: And Michael, I'd just add to what Scott said, just to reiterate what we talked about at Analyst Day that we are very optimistic about the path ahead. That's reflected in that long-term guidance. We believe we'll be growing faster than the market. The initiatives, both in our core business today as well as new programs and initiatives that we'll be adding over next year and the years ahead, give us a lot of confidence that we'll be leading the category and delivering profitable growth over that time frame. And as we shared at Analyst Day, we see a lot of confidence in that path ahead. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Lorraine Hutchinson with Bank of America. 
Lorraine Maikis: I wanted to follow up on the comments you made around cosmetics. Are you seeing any newness that you're excited about? And what do you think will be the catalyst to move the comp into positive territory versus 2019? 
David Kimbell: Great. Thanks, Lorraine. Yes, makeup, obviously, is an important topic for us and one that we're very focused on, and I'd reiterate our confidence in the category. It is -- as I said in the remarks, it is not performing at the level that our other categories, skincare, haircare, bath, fragrance, which are all delivering double-digit comp versus 2020. It has not caught up to that level of growth. But even with that, we feel encouraged by what we're seeing. 
 Our mass side of the business remains double-digit growth versus 2019 and is performing well. And our prestige business improved in the quarter, and we saw some real pockets of growth and success. And I think it's a combination of things, both currently driving the business and as we look forward. We continue to see strong innovation and growth from a number of brands, brands across the spectrum from Clinique and NARS and Lancôme to NYX and Maybelline. We're expanding MAC into 200 additional stores to have it in over 500 of our stores. We've launched new brands like Bobby Brown, and we're seeing newness from Laura Mercier, ColourPop, Urban Decay, Tarte. And so it is -- there's a robust pipeline, and it's hitting across all price points. 
 When I look at some of the trends that we see in the market and we believe will drive the business into next year. There's a number of things that, again, encourage us. We see really a duality of looks that's going on right now, a combination -- many consumers looking to a combination of both natural looks and bolder looks. Looks, the bolder looks that reflect kind of this idea of individual expression, bold colors with innovation, innovative formulas, color boost that bright impactful, particularly around the eye. And that's -- that combination of people looking to do both, natural and bolder colors, is really positive. 
 We've talked about skinification for a while, bringing moisturizing benefits or lightweight concealers or other elements that combine those categories. There's evolved application techniques, including what we kind of see as kind of next generation of contouring that's been driven by TikTok and other social media, which we think is encouraging. New product forms, including long wear lip. We've been looking at inclusive beauty for a while, and that's continuing to drive across all different types of skin tones, again, driven by influence and TikTok. And mascara and lashes is another space I've mentioned that we're seeing innovation and growth. A combination of both using more -- with more than one product or having different mascaras for different events and different times a day. 
 So a number of things that are coming together that are helping improve the category and give us confidence as we look forward. So as we look at the -- both the trend impact in the total category and the pipeline that we have, both of existing brands and new brands on the horizon in 2022, we feel confident in the path ahead and are working every day to drive that business forward. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. 
Simeon Gutman: Dave, I want to ask about OLAPLEX. Would you be willing to share with us how it could stack up relative to some of the prior big launches? Maybe Kylie. I wrote down Clinique and Lancôme. You also considered getting into pro hair color. And then this is Part 3, but I assume you're not going to give this product to Target right away, but curious how that works. 
David Kimbell: Well, yes, I'm not going to give you real, like, exact specifics of how any one launch would match up with others, other than to say we're thrilled about our partnership with OLAPLEX. We're already in partnership. We have been for several weeks now with our salon service, and that's performing exceptionally well, exceeding our expectations. Our guests are thrilled by it. And importantly, our stylist are thrilled by it. And so it's -- that's gotten out of the gates really strong. And as we move into January to be able to launch the product line in all stores, in online, a complete assortment of OLAPLEX. 
 As I mentioned in the remarks, and you know it's the #1 prestige haircare brand, and so we anticipate that it will have a big impact on our hair business and continue to support and drive our salon business. So we're excited about it, and we're putting the unique capabilities of Ulta Beauty behind the launch, a real 360 marketing program, leveraging our almost 36 million members and all the marketing tools and capabilities and partnership with just a fantastic OLAPLEX team. So excited about that launch and looking forward to taking the next step of that in January. 
 And then as far as other -- extending into Target, we look at every brand and every opportunity, and nothing here to specifically talk about as it relates to OLAPLEX. But Target is -- we're excited about, and we'll continue to evolve that assortment over time. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Steve Forbes with Guggenheim Securities. 
Matthew Norton: Matt Norton on for Steve Forbes here. I wanted to ask about the Target partnership. We know it's early but wanted to ask if you guys have seen any categorical differences, any customer demographic differences, spend for member frequency? Anything of that nature would be helpful. 
Kecia Steelman: I'll take that with one, Matt. This is Kecia. It's really too early to comment on the results as we really want to see a few purchase cycles to confirm the role of this new addition, how it plays for our guests. 
 We think about purchase cycle similar to what we see with our members who really typically shop Ulta Beauty 3 to 4x a year. So it's going to take a little bit more time because we just opened these stores at the beginning of August. Longer term, we do believe this partnership is going to really enable us to expand our loyalty members, increase our engagement, ultimately increase our spend per member. But bottom line, our partnership brings together these 2 powerhouse retailers to really reimagine prestige. We're really off to a strong start. We're excited to see what the holiday season brings, but we'll be able to update you after a few more shopping cycles here. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Binetti with Crédit Suisse. 
Michael Binetti: Scott, can we talk a little bit more about the gross margin? You helped us a lot with some of the drivers there in merch margin, the fixed cost leverage, salon leverage and I think you said a little bit of an offset from the channel mix headwinds. But you gave some comments on the merch margin as well. But as we think of where you are today, are there elements there that you're seeing in the gross margin this year that are -- that help you form a new baseline to grow off of going forward? Or would you point us to some of those elements that you think you need to give back? And I know you've done a lot of work on things like promotional levels and merch margin. You just told us the revenues will grow, so maybe there should be some fixed cost leverage still next year. I'm just wondering, as we take your comments and try to put them out to '22, if there's things we should think about as offsets there as well? 
Scott Settersten: Yes, I don't think there's anything incrementally new, I guess, I could share. It's really a combination of all the variables that we've been talking about with investors and with the analyst for quite some time. So it all kind of gets back to our EFG efforts, right? So a lot of great work has been done by our teams over the last couple of years across a wide variety of cost targets across our business. We talked about occupancy costs. We've been talking about promotional effectiveness. We've been talking about core end-to-end process opportunities. We've been talking about supply chain investments for the future. So there's a lot of variables at play here. 
 We're, I think, producing very good results this year under very difficult circumstances. So all this good work now is starting to bear fruit for us. So again, I would say those are the building blocks that we start with as we started thinking about our longer-term plan. And then as you heard us describe at Analyst Day, now we're into 2.0, I guess, I would call it, with our continuous improvement initiatives, right? And so building highly skilled resources internally here that can help us get after some of those harder to capture benefits. And of course, some of the new infrastructure investments that we talked about as well at Analyst Day, especially in Project SOAR, which is really a multigenerational opportunity for us to reimagine business flows across the business and improve our processes and take a lot of inefficiencies out of the business here. But again, some of that takes time. 
 So as we're thinking about the next 3 years or so, EFG core benefits will continue to deliver good cost optimization for us in the near term, and then CI with SOAR will drive longer-term benefits for us. So we still think there's plenty of opportunity to keep operating margins in a very healthy 13% to 14% range here over the longer term. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Mark Astrachan with Stifel. 
Mark Astrachan: I guess maybe I could try to just squeeze in a follow-up on Target and then another question. Maybe if you could just talk about any sort of thoughts on what consumers are buying there relative to kind of expectations, that would be helpful. And then just a bigger question, the brand owners seem to be reporting, what I guess I would call, kind of stickier D2C sales on their own website relative certainly to pre-pandemic levels. It would obviously seem like given your growth, these are incremental consumers to the category. So I'm curious how you're thinking about dealing with the partners as a supplier but also the customers -- or I mean the suppliers -- your suppliers, I should say, and then how they're dealing with their own customers and how kind of those 2 things interplay in your business over time? Do you think that's incremental? Do you think that's potentially something that you've got to watch for going forward? Because, obviously, as I said, it hasn't seemed to have an impact so far. 
David Kimbell: Great. Thanks, Mark. I'll start with your second question and then Kecia can give any more color on the Target part of that. But on DTC, it's -- that's not new, not new this year. That's been DTC. That's been building for a while, and so we really look at that as something that we're obviously monitoring and watching but also see as a development in the competitive landscape that we can manage through. And in fact, DTC, most of -- many of the DTC brands have found the importance of physical retail, and many of them have chosen to partner with Ulta Beauty. So start DTC and come into Ulta Beauty. Ulta Beauty brands, some larger brands kind of building a DTC brand presence, which we know is happening. 
 But we see -- our model has been very different. The guest experience, the combination of in-store and online, our loyalty program, the breadth of products across price points, the depth within brands and segments and categories, the salon services, everything that we offer. The competitive differentiation that we have really separates us from our other retailers and from DTC. And as I said, many DTC are partnering with us, whether they're long-time established brands or newer brands, and so we're watching that landscape. But for us, it's like we think with any competitive evolution in the category, we play offense. We do what we do best. We adjust and adapt, but we look to drive our business forward in a really differentiated way, and I think that's what's been driving our business so far this year. Kecia, any more color you want to add on the Target? 
Kecia Steelman: Yes, absolutely. What we're seeing is that they're shopping the entire assortment. You have to remember, this was a highly curated assortment of pure SKUs, best-selling items, must-have minis. So we are really pleased that they are shopping the entire shop-in-shop, which is what the intention was. Was it not just to help them shop one category to get a taste of what Ulta Beauty has to offer as a whole in the shop. So I'd say bottom line, they're really shopping the entire assortment. We like what we're seeing so far. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Omar Saad with Evercore. 
Omar Saad: Great quarter. Appreciate all the color and especially the kind of initial look at what you think comps and sales could look like in 2022. I really want to kind of get a better understanding of what underlies that confidence behind what you think is a plus 3% to 5% kind of long-term algorithm on top of what's obviously going to be a very big number this year. I think investors expect some of these franchise. They've done so well this year to give back some of those gains next year. But obviously, you guys don't see it that way. Would love to know if it's -- whether it's reactivating existing customers or new customers coming in or the trends around product innovation. Would love to get a better sense of why you expect to grow on top of this great growth next year. 
David Kimbell: Great. Omar, thanks for the question. Yes, I'd really -- I guess I'd answer that by looking back at what we shared at Analyst Day and the comprehensive nature of our strategic approach. There isn't any one thing that gives us confidence. And yes, we are having a very strong year, recovering out of the challenges of 2020 and increasing versus 2019. But by no means do we think this is kind of the end of the road. We actually see this is us strengthening and leading the category recovery. We think the category itself is going to be healthy beauty category in 2022 and beyond. And we think our differentiated model will continue to lead that category, gain share and drive growth for us. So it is the combination of an exceptional differentiated assortment. Nobody has the collection of products that we have, and we've brought a lot of newness in this year, some of that hitting even late in the year like OLAPLEX hitting in January that we'll be driving. And we've got a pipeline that I'm excited about going into 2022, and we'll be sharing that as time is appropriate. So assortment always drives our business. 
 Our loyalty program recovered from 2020, frankly, faster than we thought. And we think that's a great sign that what we believe what's going on in 2020 when we took a step back was not because they didn't like Ulta, just the disruption in their lives, and they've shown us that retention is high. We're acquiring new members. We're bringing lapsed members back in, and we see many more beauty enthusiasts to capture -- we see that growth happening across age groups. You know -- you've heard us talk about our strength with Gen Z as one example, and we see a lot of opportunity to continue to gain with our loyalty program. 
 And then frankly, the unique combination of digital and physical. We believe guests are showing us demonstrating with their loyalty and their spend that they really do prefer what all the data says, and they're showing us with their dollars they prefer to shop a combination of physical and digital. That's why our e-com actually grew in Q3 after such strong growth in 2020, even as our stores show exceptional growth versus 2020. So that experience and our continued innovation and evolution across both digital and physical, we believe is where the consumer is going, and we're leading in that as well. And then all the other initiatives, our program with Target, of course, is massive, new programs like Ulta Beauty UB Media. So we think we've got a pipeline. Growth won't be what it is this year, and that's reflected. But we're going to lead this category, and it's going to take -- it will be a unique combination of what makes us differentiated that gives us confidence. 
Operator: Our last question comes from the line of Rupesh Parikh with Oppenheimer. 
Rupesh Parikh: So Scott, I guess I just wanted for Q4, just dig into more how you're thinking about operating margins. So maybe if you can just talk more about the puts and takes on the gross margin and SG&A line. 
Scott Settersten: Sure. Thanks for the question. So big picture, operating margin versus 2020, it's going to be flattish in the fourth quarter. And versus 2019, we'd see some deleverage in operating margin. Again, both of those will have a mix of gross margin expansion and SG&A deleverage. So gross margin goodness coming from all the things we've talked about this year, fixed store cost leverage, merchandise margin improvements versus 2020. Channel mix is a benefit for us versus last year. Channel mix, more of a headwind versus 2019. So gross margin leverage for both years. 
 On the SG&A line, again, deleverage for both years. 2020 not as significant as it is versus 2019. Again, 2020, consistent with all the things we've been talking about all year with the addition of incentive compensation, I guess I would say, is more significant in the fourth quarter than earlier in the year. And then when we compare it back to 2019, store labor and wages, not only hours, but wage rates are up significantly versus 2019. Incentive comp, again, is a bigger impact versus 2019. If you remember, 2019, we were short of our targets in 2021. It's a bit of a different story, and then marketing expense as well. Again, more investment versus 2019 when we were kind of battening down the hatches, I guess I would say, in a tougher environment. And this year, we're taking advantage of tailwinds and investing in market awareness activities to, again, capture more market share over the long term. So that's what I would say a short story. Again, super excited and happy with the results so far this year through Q3 and very encouraged and excited about the kickoff to the fourth quarter. 
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of today's question-and-answer session. I would like to turn this call back over to Mr. Dave Kimbell for closing remarks. 
David Kimbell: Great. Well, thank you for joining us today, and I want to thank all of our Ulta Beauty associates across our stores, distribution centers and corporate offices who are working hard to ensure we deliver an outstanding guest experience this holiday season and who are committed to taking good care of our guests and each other every single day. As I said in the past, we have the absolute best team in retail, and I am so proud to lead this great team. 
 We hope you all have a safe and joyous holiday season, and we look forward to speaking to all of you again in March when we report our fourth quarter and full year results. Have a great evening. 
Operator: This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation. Enjoy the rest of your day.

===== 2021 Q2  (2021-08-25 16:30:00) =====
Operator: Good afternoon, and welcome to Ulta Beauty's conference call to discuss results for the second quarter of fiscal 2021. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.
 It is now my pleasure to introduce Ms. Kiley Rawlins, Vice President of Investor Relations. Ms. Rawlins, please proceed.

The statements contained in this conference call which are not historical facts may be deemed to constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
 Actual future results may differ materially from those projected in such statements due to a number of risks and uncertainties, all of which are described in the company's filings with the SEC.

 Now I'll turn the call over to Dave. Dave? 
David Kimbell: Thank you, Kiley, and good afternoon, everyone.
 The Ulta Beauty team delivered excellent results again this quarter, and I want to start by expressing my sincere appreciation to all of our Ulta Beauty associates for their outstanding efforts to drive these results. As I have traveled around the country visiting with our teams across all parts of the company, I continue to feel inspired by their commitment and passion for our guests, our business and for each other.
 We are excited about the momentum we are seeing in our business and are optimistic about our future. The beauty category is recovering faster than we expected, and the investments we've made over the last year to adapt to the market disruption and strengthen our leadership position are delivering results. Our value proposition is strong, and we are evolving and innovating to lead in the new beauty landscape, capture more market share and drive profitable growth.
 For the second quarter, net sales increased 60.2% to $1.97 billion. Operating margin increased to 16.9% of sales and diluted EPS was $4.56 per share. These strong results exceeded our internal expectations and reflect our ongoing efforts to serve our guests, especially as we continue to adapt to the changing environment. In recognition of their dedication to our guests and their efforts to deliver these strong results, this quarter, we awarded a onetime discretionary appreciation bonus to eligible store and DC associates.
 For the quarter, comp sales increased 56.3% driven by strong growth in our brick-and-mortar channel. As consumer confidence, optimism and comfort to shop in physical stores continues to increase, we are seeing more of our members return to stores. Traffic trends in stores improved from the first quarter, but remained lower than 2019 levels. However, comp sales in stores increased this quarter compared to 2019 driven by strong average ticket growth.
 We continue to optimize operating hours, and I am pleased to share that our retail operating hours are nearly back to 2019 levels. As expected, e-commerce declined as compared to the second quarter last year but were more than double 2019 levels. The sales decline was driven by a decrease in the number of transactions. Average ticket remains strong. Recall that our e-commerce business increased more than 200% in the second quarter last year as we phased the reopening of stores.
 Guest utilization of buy online pickup in store remained high totaling 20% of e-commerce sales in the quarter. To enhance the experience, we made operational improvements to increase order accuracy and fulfillment speed. And in the second quarter, 97% of orders were ready for pickup within 2 hours. We have also increased the number of stores with dedicated parking spaces and we continue to look for opportunities to make curbside pickup available at nontraditional Ulta Beauty locations.
 Customer engagement in our digital platforms remain strong even as store traffic ramps up. Compared to the first quarter, our omnichannel guests, on average, maintained the same number of transactions in the online channel even as they increased their in-store transactions, reinforcing that e-commerce transactions are incremental and help drive greater overall member engagement and spend.
 From a category perspective, we increased market share across all major prestige beauty categories based on dollar sales for the 13 weeks ended July 31, 2021 compared to the same time period last year. We also saw sales strength across all of our major mass categories.
 Compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2020, all major categories delivered robust double-digit comps as we anniversaried last year's phased reopening process and introduced more newness. Compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2019, fragrance, bath, skin care and hair care, all delivered strong double-digit comp growth. Makeup was only slightly lower than 2019. While comp sales in the makeup category are not yet positive compared to 2019, momentum is building with both mass and prestige categories improving from the first quarter trend. Reductions in mask-wearing requirements, combined with an increase in makeup-wearing occasions, helped drive strong growth in face and lip, while engagement with eye continue to be healthy.
 During the quarter, we launched 3 new makeup brands, Bobbi Brown, Elaluz, a prestige brand founded by a well-known Brazilian influencer and makeup artist, and Undone Beauty. These new brands, combined with new product launches from a wide range of brands, including MAC, Clinique, NYX, e.l.f. and Maybelline, drove improved sales performance in the quarter.
 Skin care delivered another quarter of strong double-digit sales growth compared to 2019. Reflecting the strong connection between beauty and self-care, guests are maintaining their skin care regimens even as they increase makeup purchases. Moisturizers, serums and cleansers continue to drive category growth. We also saw robust growth in sun protection and self-tanning as consumers re-engaged with travel and vacation activities. New brands, including fresh, Good Molecules, which is exclusive to Ulta Beauty, and b.tan as well as new products from Tula, Shiseido, CeraVe, La Roche-Posay and The Crème Shop, drove solid guest engagement.
 Hair care continued to deliver double-digit growth driven by newness and strong guest engagement with our strategic tent-pole events. We began the quarter with our semiannual Gorgeous Hair event, an event strategically designed to convert members who do not currently shop the hair care category or engage with our salon services. This year, we streamlined offers and invested in dedicated social and digital marketing campaigns to expand our reach. As a result, the event attracted new members to the category and delivered stronger-than-expected sales and profitability.
 We ended the quarter with our Jumbo Love event, a basket-building event focused on larger product sizes. We continued to narrow brand participation and simplify our presentation to guests. These improvements resulted in stronger sales and profitability. In addition to strong strategic events, we also launched a number of new hair care brands throughout the quarter, including Rizos Curls, Verb and CURLS, a well-established Black-owned brand. These new brands, combined with recently launched Briogeo and Kristin Ess, contributed to the strong category growth this quarter as consumers focus on building and maintaining hair health.
 Finally, fragrance and bath delivered exceptionally strong growth driven by Mother's Day and Father's Day sales as well as our Fragrance Crush events. Newness in fragrance from Marc Jacobs and Carolina Herrera as well as engagement with the base business from favorites like Dolce & Gabbana and Chanel drove meaningful market share growth. Body scrubs and moisturizers from brands like Truly and Tree Hut continued to drive outstanding sales growth, reflecting guests' continued commitment to self-care.
 Our Conscious Beauty platform continues to expand and resonate with guests. At the end of the second quarter, more than 270 brands were certified in at least 1 of the 5 Conscious Beauty pillars and now include fresh, Kylie Cosmetics, Happy Dance and Good Molecules, among others.
 To promote guest discovery and trial this quarter, we will offer guests the new Conscious Beauty sampler kit, which includes hero brands like Beekman 1802, Kinship, Tarte and Tula. We will also refresh our endcap in stores, adding products from Dermalogica, Sunday Riley, Florence and Truly. As we work to scale Conscious Beauty further, we are enhancing our search capabilities on ulta.com and in the mobile app to make it easier for guests to find certified products that reflect their personal values.
 Through the pandemic, the lines between health and beauty have blurred. Based on our proprietary research, we know that 65% of beauty enthusiasts believe beauty is significantly connected to wellness. Reflecting these consumer insights, this quarter, we launched The Wellness Shop in select stores and on ulta.com to help our guests navigate their personal wellness journey. With a guest category focus on self-care for the mind, body and spirit, The Wellness Shop features a curated selection of products across 5 key segments, including supplements and ingestibles and spa at home. From daily rituals to relaxation and sleep regimens, the shop addresses a variety of wellness needs in an accessible, easy-to-navigate presentation. Our guests are responding well to the platform, and we'll continue to increase awareness of the offering and expand its presence over time.
 Our services business is also gaining momentum. Sales from hair and brow services increased more than 60% compared to 2020. Despite capacity limitations due to mandates from the CDC and state and local authorities, we are increasing member engagement and driving retail attachment, especially through our salon backbar takeovers. Services play an important role in driving guest engagement, loyalty, frequency and spend. I'm excited to share that we plan to relaunch skin services in select stores in the third quarter. We plan to offer new services that target specific concerns such as hydration, anti-aging as well as acne facials that cater to our Gen Z guest, and we will test microchanneling, dermaplaning and HydraFacials in select stores.
 Turning now to our loyalty program. We are seeing faster recovery in active member growth than initially expected. We ended the second quarter with a record 34.6 million active members, 8% above last year and 4% above 2019. Spend per member also increased, driven by higher average ticket, surpassing both 2020 and 2019 levels.
 The majority of new member acquisition happens in stores and our talented store associates continue to convert new members at higher rates than in 2019. We are also improving our conversion rates online, reflecting improvements we had made in the online customer journey. In addition to growth in new members, we are accelerating reactivation of lapsed members and increasing retention rates of existing members as we continue to advance and apply our data and analytics capabilities.
 From a channel perspective, in-store-only members totaled 73% this quarter, increasing from 67% in the first quarter. As expected, the mix of omnichannel members moderated from the first quarter to 18% of total members, but remained well above 2019 levels. Importantly, omnichannel members continued to increase their spend across both store and digital channels. As we progress through the rest of the year, we expect the penetration of omnichannel guests will continue to moderate as in-store shopping increases, but remain above 2019 levels.
 Discovery and trial are critical parts of the beauty experience, and we offer a variety of physical and digital ways to discover new products, new trends and new applications. This quarter, we launched new functionality in our mobile app that allows guests greater access to select product scanning for content and reviews, loyalty information and virtual try-on while shopping in stores.
 In addition, we reintroduced testers in stores with expanded stations of testing and sanitation supplies. We continue to deliver hyper-relevant content to drive discovery and build stronger connections with our guests. This quarter, we introduced Beauty School Live Virtual Masterclasses focused on brand launches, demonstrations and beauty tutorials. BeautyBio founder Jamie O'Banion hosted a Megawatt Glow masterclass, showcasing skin care tools and products. And in honor of National Lipstick Day, we partnered with a NYX Professional Makeup pro artist to walk viewers through a long wear lip look.
 In July, we launched a partnership with Supergreat, a hyper-relevant, app-based, Gen Z-centric live stream platform that is 100% focused on beauty. From shoppable live videos to editorial content and exclusive product drops, the Supergreat community is an ideal partnership for experiential immersive beauty. While we are early in our pilot, we've already seen encouraging results with engagement tracking ahead of other live platforms.
 As part of our holistic marketing efforts to reinforce Ulta Beauty's authority in the skin care category, we launched #UltaSkinTok, our first multi-branded TikTok hashtag challenge. To drive increased awareness of our category breadth and depth, we asked audiences to post their favorite skin care products from Ulta Beauty. The hashtag has amassed more than 8 billion views to date with 1.6 million videos created.
 We want Ulta Beauty to be the most loved beauty destination and the most inclusive. Building on our focus as a diversity-forward company, we announced a number of commitments at the beginning of this fiscal year to further our efforts to champion diversity and inclusion. This quarter, we joined the 15 Percent Pledge, committing to dedicate 15% of our total assortment to Black-owned, Black-founded and Black-led brands. To date this year, we have welcomed 8 new Black-owned brands to the Ulta Beauty family, including Homebody, CAMILLE ROSE and mented, and we are on track to double the number of Black-owned brands in our assortment this year.
 As part of our cross-functional approach to integrate diversity and inclusion into all that we do, our teams launched a textured hair training series for all stylists to better enable more inclusive experiences in our salons. We also launched mandatory inclusion in action training in stores to understand what diversity, equity and inclusion means to Ulta Beauty.
 We strive to make a positive difference in the communities where we live and work. The Ulta Beauty Charitable Foundation focuses on improving the lives of women and families. This quarter, with the generosity of our guests, our teams raised more than $2 million for Save the Children, to support mothers and children in need. We also partnered with LinkedIn with the #BackToWork campaign, highlighting the pandemic's impact on women and providing resources to aid economic recovery.
 And as part of our ongoing efforts to reduce waste and minimize our impact on the environment, we recently launched the Consortium to Reinvent the Retail Bag, a multiyear collaboration across retail sectors that aims to identify, test and implement innovative new design solutions that serve the functions of today's single-use plastic retail bag.
 Finally, I am very excited to share that Ulta Beauty at Target has launched in 58 stores and online with plans to open about 100 stores by the end of the quarter. Over the last 9 months, the Ulta Beauty and Target teams have collaborated closely to create a unique way for guests to experience beauty, and we are excited to see it come to life.
 As guests come to Ulta Beauty at Target, they will be welcomed into a 1,000 square foot co-design space with bold new fixtures and lighting that celebrate premium beauty with a modern look. Each aspect of the shop was thoughtfully designed to make the space feel authentic to Ulta Beauty, Target and the featured brands within the assortment. From the unmistakable Ulta Beauty orange pop canopies and vivid graphics that weave into the existing Target store, everything was designed to create an inspiring and unique beauty experience for guests.
 With compelling product displays and unique discovery zones, the shop offers a curated selection of more than 50 prestige and emerging brands, including MAC, Clinique, Morphe, Tula, The Ordinary, Pattern, Madison Reed, Urban Decay and the Ulta Beauty Collection. The assortment is a compelling mix of best-selling items as well as limited edition collaborations and minis to drive discovery and trial.
 We're making the experience as seamless as possible both in-store and online. Guests shopping Ulta Beauty at Target on Target.com and the Target app will enjoy free shipping for qualifying orders and all of Target's same-day fulfillment services. And guests will benefit from rewards across both Ultamate Rewards and Target Circle.
 While it's only been 10 days since the first shop was opened, guest response has been overwhelmingly positive with enthusiasm about 2 of their favorite retailers coming together and excitement about the ability to earn points in both loyalty programs. We're thrilled about this partnership and how together we can change the way the world experiences beauty.
 Before I turn the call over to Scott, I want to announce that we will host an Analyst Day here in Chicago on October 19 to share how our strategic priorities are evolving and how we plan to continue to position Ulta Beauty to deliver sustainable, profitable growth. Given the ongoing uncertainty around the Delta variant, we are planning the event to accommodate both in-person and virtual participation. Our teams will continue to assess guidance from the CDC, and we will adapt our plans as necessary to ensure the safety of our team and attendees.
 And now I will turn the call over to Scott for a discussion of the financial results. Scott? 
Scott Settersten: Thanks, Dave, and good afternoon, everyone.
 Starting with the income statement. Q2 sales increased 60.2% as we anniversaried the disruption of stores last year due to COVID-19. We opened 7 new stores during the quarter and closed 1 store. We also remodeled 5 stores and relocated 1 store.
 Total company comp increased 56.3% driven by a 52.5% increase in transactions and a 2.5% growth in average ticket. As Dave mentioned, the resurgence of traffic in stores drove the strong comp performance. Compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2019, total sales increased 18% and comp sales increased 13.1%.
 From a mix perspective, cosmetics was 43% of sales compared to 45% last year. Skin care was 17% of sales compared to 18% last year, the fragrance and bath category increased 300 basis points to 12% of sales, and hair care products and styling tools was flat with last year at 21% of sales. The services category increased to 4% of sales compared to 3% last year.
 Q2 gross profit margin increased to 40.6% of sales compared to 26.8% last year. The increase was primarily due to the leverage of fixed costs, higher merchandise margin, more favorable channel mix and leverage of salon expenses. Strong top line growth drove significant leverage of fixed costs.
 The improvement in merchandise margin was primarily the result of anniversary-ing higher inventory reserves in the second quarter last year as well as higher sales, lower promotional activity and ongoing benefits from our cost optimization efforts. Recall that we increased inventory reserves by $16.5 million in the second quarter last year primarily to adjust for slow turning and discontinued makeup SKUs and permanently closed stores. As a percentage of sales, salon expenses were lower compared to last year, reflecting strong top line sales and the elimination of the salon manager role. As a reminder, we will anniversary this change in Q4.
 Comparing this year's performance to the second quarter of fiscal 2019, gross margin improved by 420 basis points. Higher merchandise margin, fixed cost leverage and leverage of salon expenses were partially offset by adverse channel mix. As a percentage of sales, SG&A increased to 23.6% compared to 22.1% last year. Higher store payroll and benefits and higher marketing expense was partially offset by leverage of corporate overhead and variable store expenses.
 Store payroll and benefits deleveraged in the quarter primarily due to the anniversary-ing of the $48.2 million in employee retention credits made available last year under the CARES Act. In addition, reflecting the strong operational performance, we elected to grant discretionary appreciation bonuses to our nonexempt store and DC teams in recognition of their efforts.
 Marketing expense also deleveraged during the quarter, primarily reflecting increased spend on print marketing. Recall that last year, we significantly reduced our spend on print material while our stores were closed due to the pandemic. We are also expanding our investment in digital marketing to support key events and re-engage lapsed members. In addition, we are leveraging our CRM capabilities and working more closely with our brand partners to create more targeted digital marketing campaigns across multiple touch points. Strong top line growth resulted in nice leverage of corporate overhead and store expenses.
 Compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2019, SG&A as a percentage of sales was flat. As a percentage of sales, lower store expenses were offset by higher store payroll and corporate overhead. Compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2019, advertising in the second quarter of 2021 was flat as a percentage of sales.
 Operating margin was 16.9% of sales compared to 1.1% in the second quarter of fiscal 2020 on a GAAP basis and 4.5% on an adjusted basis. Strong top line growth driven by brick-and-mortar, combined with the impact of our cost optimization efforts including promotional optimization, delivered record operating margin results.
 The tax rate increased to 24.4% compared to 20.6% last year due to a decrease in state tax credits as a result of an increase in pretax income. Diluted GAAP earnings per share were $4.56, which included $0.04 per share of tax benefit related to share-based compensation compared to $0.14 last year. Adjusted diluted earnings per share in the second quarter of last year was $0.73.
 Moving on to the balance sheet and cash flow. Total inventory increased 5.5% compared to last year, reflecting the impact of 32 additional stores, the opening of our Jacksonville fast fulfillment center in Q3 of fiscal 2020 and increased inventory purchases to support higher demand. Capital expenditures were $22.7 million for the quarter driven by our new store opening program, investments in IT systems and store remodels and relocations. Depreciation was $69 million compared with $77.4 million last year, primarily reflecting the impact of last year's store impairments and the 19 stores which were permanently closed.
 We ended the quarter with $770.1 million in cash and cash equivalents. In the second quarter, we repurchased 746,000 shares at a cost of $243.5 million. At the end of the quarter, we had $886.2 million remaining under our current $1.6 billion repurchase authorization. We continue to expect to repurchase approximately $850 million of shares in fiscal 2021 but as always have the flexibility to modify the cadence of repurchases in response to market conditions.
 Turning now to our updated outlook for 2021. We are encouraged by our first half results and the trends we've experienced so far in the third quarter. While the operating environment continues to be dynamic and our near-term visibility remains limited, especially as it relates to the spread of COVID variants, we have increased our financial expectations for the year. We now expect net sales for the year to be between $8.1 billion and $8.3 billion with comp sales growth planned to be in the 30% to 32% range.
 We continue to expect comp results will moderate to the low double-digit range as we move through the second half. We expect to open approximately 44 net new stores and remodel or relocate 18 stores. We now expect operating margin rate for the year will be approximately 13% of sales. We continue to believe the largest driver of operating margin expansion will come from gross margin, driven by leverage of fixed cost, less headwind from channel shift, improving merchandise margin and leverage of salon costs.
 Based on the higher top line growth, we now expect to leverage SG&A more than previously expected as compared to fiscal 2020. These assumptions result in an expectation for diluted earnings per share in the range of $14.50 to $14.70 per share, including the impact of approximately $850 million in share repurchases. Like others, we are managing global supply chain constraints, port congestion and other headwinds, including the resurgence of COVID-19.
 Our teams are working diligently to mitigate risk and where appropriate, we are proactively working with our brand partners to prioritize receipts to ensure we have adequate inventory for the holiday season. As a result, we expect that our inventory levels at the end of the third quarter will likely be elevated above expected sales growth.
 We plan to spend between $225 million and $250 million in CapEx in fiscal 2021, including approximately $100 million for new stores, remodels and merchandise fixtures, $105 million for supply chain and IT and about $33 million for store maintenance and other. As a reminder, our guidance for 2021 assumes a consistent federal tax rate and no material increases in the federal minimum wage and does not include assumptions for any impact related to a resurgence of COVID-19.
 And now I'll turn the call back over to our operator to moderate the Q&A session. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Adrienne Yih with Barclays. 
Adrienne Yih-Tennant: Congratulations. I mean, really, it's a huge inflection starting last quarter and great to see the momentum continuing. Dave, my first question is for you about Ulta and Target. Obviously, it's early days with just 10 days under your belt. But I wanted to see, what have your early learnings been? If you can help us with any details on that. And then I know the initial target was somewhere around 100 stores. What would be the benchmarks for more aggressive rollout?
 And then my second follow-up question is for Scott. Just remind us, this is one of the first calls where we haven't spent an inordinate amount of time on freight and the supply chain, although it is an issue. You're not as exposed to the Far East. So can you talk about kind of where you are exposed? And if you can, any kind of basis point impact for the back half? 
David Kimbell: Great. Well, thanks for the question and the comments, Adrienne. I appreciate it. Yes, let me start on Target and then I'm going to ask Kecia to give some more color because Kecia is leading this for us. But we are, as I said in the comments, we're just thrilled with the partnership and the launch guest response. We feel really confident how we've come out of the gate operationally, working really well. And most importantly, as I mentioned, consumers are thrilled by this. They're really excited about the idea of bringing together 2 great retailers in a unique experience that nobody else is doing. This is totally new to beauty. And so we're really, really pleased with the results and the engagement and the partnership. Kecia, why don't you share a few more details about what we're seeing and maybe the outlook on stores. 
Kecia Steelman: Yes. What we're most excited about really is the operational execution across both Ulta Beauty and the Target teams. The seamless integration between our technologies and making sure that we're capturing both the Target Circle members and the Ulta Beauty members and having them link their accounts were out of the gates really strong. We love what we see. The guests are really loving this experience overall. And there's just huge momentum that we're looking forward to continuing on getting the rest of the 100 stores open in Q3. 
Scott Settersten: And then I'll follow up on the international piece and supply chain. So we don't really break out geographic sourcing exposure. But most of our products, lipsticks, serums are made in the U.S. or Europe. We do have some limited exposure to China with the Ulta Beauty brand, private label and a few specific brands in the assortment like Morphe, and some components, of course, which are part of our vendor partners supply chain as well.
 So again, we're keeping a close eye on that. There's nothing that we see as a critical watch out at this point in time, but we're just trying to plan ahead and making sure we're as well prepared as we can despite any eventual outcomes there or development. So we feel like we're well positioned for holiday and the second half of the year. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Simeon Siegel with BMO. 
Simeon Siegel: Congrats on the great results. Dave, to follow up and Kecia, to follow up on that just slightly from the loyalty angle. So can you just speak to your expectations of the member? But first of all, fantastic loyalty results. Can you just speak to your expectations of member growth maybe over the year and then beyond just with the Target relationship now in effect. And then the follow-up, Scott, as you look past this year, can you just speak to how you're viewing these margin rates as to whether they're a new base or whether you expect just give back from the benefits we're seeing right now? 
David Kimbell: Great. Thanks, Simeon. Yes, let me start with loyalty and let me just, before I talk specifically about Target, zoom out a little bit. And we're really, really pleased with our loyalty results in the quarter and really through this first half of the year to get back to a new high of 34.6 million members, 8% above last year, 4% above 2019. As I mentioned in the comments, that's faster than we had anticipated. But it's really a testament to an effort across the entire organization from our loyalty team, our analytics team, marketing, merchandising and of course, our store teams and e-commerce teams that are delivering a great experience every day.
 And the fact that we were able to increase total loyalty members by 2.3 million members, which is the largest growth we've had in any single quarter is just exceptional and again, really proud of the team and the effort. That's come through strong new member acquisition, strong reactivation rates of lapsed members and of course, high retention among our existing members. And so our loyalty program has long been a focus of ours. It's absolutely a key differentiating aspect of our total model. We're very proud of it, and we're continuing to innovate and drive that part of our business.
 And specifically about Target, I'm not going to give any specific numbers about our outlook other than one of the main reasons that we're really excited about this program is the connection that we see with our loyalty program, both in delighting our existing guests, and we think over time, increasing their total share of spend with Ulta Beauty with another key pillar in our omnichannel experience with our relationship with Target, but also attracting new guests. The Circle program has over 90 million members in it. They have 30 million people walking through a Target every week. So we feel like there is a very large opportunity for us to attract new loyalty guests into our program, get them engaged in the Ulta Beauty at Target experience, but then also introduce them to all things Ulta across all touch points. So we're confident. And too early to kind of talk about the experience so far. But as Kecia said, we're excited about the results so far and see it as a big driver. Scott, do you want to hit on the margin? 
Scott Settersten: Sure, Simeon. So again, we're very, very proud of the results we posted this quarter and appreciative of all the hard work on behalf of our associates and brand partners to deliver great experiences to our guests, which at the end of the day is what delivers those kind of financial results. So I would say the comp performance, again, it was elevated over initial expectations. So the 56% versus last year and a 13% comp versus '19 reflects a mix of benefits, unique external factors, I guess, I would say, combined with the power of our model and all the great execution and things we're doing to drive stronger results and leverage across the P&L. I'd say it makes us increasingly more optimistic.
 Again, you've heard us say that we believe this is a double-digit EBIT margin business over the long term. Our goal is to expand operating margins, and we feel confident we can do that. I guess I would say we're not going to share too much today. We'll have more to say, more color to share on sales outlook and margin expansion opportunities when we get together at our Analyst Day here in October. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Chris Horvers with JPMorgan. 
Christopher Horvers: So my first question is, your 2-year comp CAGR accelerated in 2Q versus the first quarter. You're fading that back down to get to low double-digit comps in the fourth quarter despite what should be more work from work and learn from school in the back half. Is this just looking out into the uncertainty? And related to that, have you seen any impact from Delta in August from any markets in particular? 
David Kimbell: Yes. Great. Thanks, Chris. Yes, absolutely, we are so excited and encouraged by the first half results and the trends. And as you said, the strengthening we saw and the momentum we see throughout the first half. And we're feeling encouraged by what we're seeing so far in the third quarter. And that's why we have increased our sales expectation for the full year.
 I will say, so with that optimism and confidence, it does remain difficult for us with certainty to understand how these variables will impact our business through the remainder of this year. With the resurgence of variants, certainly, that's having a broader impact in the world around us. Our business remains healthy, but difficult to predict exactly how that will play out in consumer behavior. We're optimistic about holiday. We feel like it's going to be a strong holiday. But holiday is always a unique time of year, of course, with a lot of new dynamics going on and uncertainty how COVID and other influences will drive through that.
 And then we're lapping our business in the second half of the year in 2020 was stronger than the first half of the year, for sure, as we reopened stores and started to gain momentum. So we do believe our sales forecast is prudent. It's achievable, but it's also reflective of the uncertainty that we see out there.
 And last thing I'd say, as we've been doing throughout all of this, if the recovery is stronger or faster than planned, we're prepared. We're working closely with our brand partners to be ready to adapt and adjust. We're working hard to make sure we have the right inventory, the right store staffing, the right marketing plans to continue to lead the recovery in the beauty categories, we believe we've been doing so far this first half of the year. So optimistic but feel like our guidance is appropriate given the environment. 
Christopher Horvers: Makes sense. And as a follow-up, quick math suggests that it seems like you're implying maybe a 36.5%, 37% type gross margin in the back half. Is that in the ZIP code? And if that's the case, what drives the lower rate versus the first half? 
Scott Settersten: Yes. I would just say, we're taking a more tempered view, I guess, of the promotional environment. Again, naturally, holiday is more promotional. We're competing against a wider variety of retailers during the gift-giving season. We've got some incremental supply chain costs that we're baking into the plan to be prudent around fuel costs and things like that. So again, on balance, we think it's a prudent estimate forecast and we think it's achievable. And if things turn out better, sales are stronger, we'll deliver better results. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Olivia Tong with Raymond James. 
Olivia Tong Cheang: First, congrats on the quarter. The first question has to do with the margin because I imagine a lot of this is fixed cost leverage. But how much of this is, how much of the margin, incremental margin is an extension of some of the efficiency and promotional improvements lasting? And how does this, in any way, change your view on customer acquisition costs or additional promotional efficiencies over time?
 And then you also mentioned that the e-commerce sales are mostly incremental, which is fantastic. So can you talk a little bit about the profile of the customer that maybe primarily shops via online versus in-store? Is it changing? Is the incremental new people still coming in via omnichannel? Are they replacing customers who are back to shopping in-store now? Or can you just give a little bit more color there, that would be helpful. 
Scott Settersten: Yes. So maybe I'll start with the margin. So it's not exactly clear. But if we're looking at the second quarter, again, we describe that the biggest drivers in the second quarter were the reserve adjustments versus last year. Again, this is versus 2020. And so they were pretty significant last year. So of course, we didn't absorb any of that this year. We're doing a much better job with the stronger sales and better discipline in the stores. So that was a pretty significant benefit. Promotional, less discounting was kind of in the middle of the list, I guess, I would say. Fixed cost is another major driver of gross margin expansion in the second quarter and for the first half of the year just because of the much higher sales levels overall.
 So when I think about those things and of course, the salon manager shift versus last year was another element of that. So again, we're not going to quantify those things. But as I think about the future and we were thinking about the back half of the year, merchandise margin, we still expect to be able to expand it. The promotionality discipline, I think, again, we got a good start on that last year with some good learnings. Those are being played forward now. We still think there's opportunity there for us. There's other things we can do as far as tools and process improvements to help that, aid that over the longer term.
 Fixed costs, again, once we got sales back on track, fixed cost leverage is the gift that keeps giving. So that's something, again, that we feel pretty confident in. And then there's other things we're working on as part of our ESG efforts that will continue to deliver benefits over the long term. So when we think about gross margin, merch margin being the most important piece of that, we still think there's plenty of opportunity for us over the longer term. 
David Kimbell: And on your e-com member profile, I'll just hit a couple of high points here, which is, first, our e-commerce business, very healthy and such a strong and important of our total omnichannel mix. And we're really pleased with how that's complementing and integrating with our store experience. And so we're so glad to see strength across both of those channels.
 Omnichannel guests are among our very best guests. Those that are shopping both in-store and online do demonstrate a high level of incrementality with their e-commerce purchases because what we typically see is those that have been shopping in-store that start shopping online continue to shop in-store at, or in some cases, even higher levels. And it's because they get more ingrained and integrated into the total Ulta Beauty experience. They become more loyal to Ulta Beauty and concentrate more of their beauty spend at Ulta.
 So last year, with the stores being closed and the dramatic increase in our e-commerce, we introduced a whole lot of new consumers to our e-commerce business. Now some of them have gone back to shopping only in-store, but most of them are continuing to shop in an e-commerce business, I'm sorry, in an omnichannel way. And the behavior is really positive, both helping to deliver our Q2 results. But importantly, as we grow that base of omnichannel shoppers, we'll have even more consumers shopping across channels going forward, which we know will drive total sales in the out-years going forward. So excited about this omnichannel behavior and believe that one of the lasting impacts of this disruption will be a significant increase in our e-commerce business and our omnichannel behaviors. 
Olivia Tong Cheang: Maybe if I could just follow up on makeup. You mentioned obviously that the momentum has continued 2Q versus 1Q, even if it isn't back to where it was before. Why do you think it hasn't fully recovered back to where it used to be given the replenishment, given that people are going out, there is a lot of innovation. Do we need another trend or is it just there is still some holdback? Just kind of curious given the strength particularly of other categories outside of makeup. 
David Kimbell: Sneaking in one more makeup question. But yes, I'll just be brief here, the makeup. We're encouraged by what we see. And I think it's just a testament that the other categories had been strong, skin care, hair care, bath, fragrance. And they remain strong. There's a high level of engagement. But makeup, the trends that we're seeing are encouraging. While it was slightly below 2019 levels in Q2, we had weeks and times during the quarter that it was positive versus 2019. Our mass business, we talked about in Q1, was above 2019 levels, and it accelerated in Q2, also above 2019.
 And our prestige business is improving. We're bringing in newness. Our biggest brands are performing well. New brands are performing. So I think it's just consumer behavior as we recover is there's a high level of engagement, high level of excitement about makeup, more usage occasions and the momentum is building. Time will tell exactly when we get back to steadily being above 2019 levels and growing from there, but we're encouraged by what we see. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Steph Wissink with Jefferies. 
Stephanie Schiller Wissink: Hopefully, this is a quick one for you, but wanted to just talk about SG&A leverage because I don't think we've seen on a full year basis that in the guidance for quite some time. So I just wanted to understand a little bit about the key pieces. Maybe, Scott, if you could talk about what components of SG&A you expect to see the best leverage and where you might see some opportunity still in the future periods? 
Scott Settersten: Yes. So if you're looking back at 2020, Steph, I think there's going to be a good story there as far as leverage on SG&A overall. Of course, the better comparison is 2019. So that's where I'll spend my time. As we look back there, there's still, I guess, I would say there's going to be leverage versus '19 now versus our earlier in the year outlook there. Again, a lot of that's due to stronger-than-expected sales. So that's good news.
 We expect dollars to be higher in '21 than '19 primarily on store growth, number one, wage pressures primarily in the stores and a big variable here is higher incentive compensation levels than what we saw back in 2019. You'll recall, 2019, we missed our internal targets by a fair range. And so that's going to be a headwind, a significant headwind when we're measuring back against 2019. Of course, we have that service manager role as well that's been reallocated from the gross margin line, where it's a good guide down to SG&A, where it's a headwind versus 2019. But again, that's a net benefit for the company overall at the operating margin level.
 We're also going to be pulling in some incremental advertising, marketing expense in the back half of the year. I think we've mentioned that in some interim investor calls here to take advantage of market share opportunities now and the strength of our business. And of course, we've got good sales trends here, too. So we're going to make some more significant investments there in the back half of the year in digital channels. So again, places we know that it works and it's effective and there are strong ROIs. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Ike Boruchow with Wells Fargo. 
Irwin Boruchow: Scott, can you talk a little bit more about just the e-commerce? I mean, I think you said that the dollars doubled versus '19, which I think implies year-over-year was down around 25% to 35%, which makes sense given what you're lapping. But now that your compares are more, I mean, actually they're still tough, but not quite as elevated, do you expect e-commerce growth to return when you get to the third quarter and back half? 
Scott Settersten: Yes. Thanks, Ike. So again, yes, second quarter, a little bit unusual. I mean, we did see some growth in the first quarter. But again, we were lapping kind of just the initial stages, I guess, of the COVID and the shift and the store closings and kind of becoming a digital business 100% kind of overnight back in 2020.
 So it was what we expected. That was what was in our annual plan to see an overall decrease in the e-com versus last year. Again, brick-and-mortar, again, our guest demonstrating that brick-and-mortar is an important part of the beauty shopping experience and ecstatic to see traffic numbers coming back to the stores and again, sequentially improving here in 2021. So I think Dave called it out in his prepared remarks.
 We got to remember, last year, second quarter, we doubled our e-commerce business, right? So to expect a little bit of moderation here I don't think is anything extraordinary under the circumstances. As we think about the rest of the year, again, stores, the traffic trends are good. We're encouraged there. So I would expect that e-commerce is going to moderate as we look out to the rest of the year. And I wouldn't expect it to be a growth in absolute terms here as we look over the next couple of quarters. Again, for the full year, we expect e-commerce penetration to be in the low to mid-20% range. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Kate McShane with Goldman Sachs. 
Katharine McShane: You had mentioned that the comp did come in higher than your expectations. I wondered if that was a commentary on both what you saw in prestige and mass. And within mass, are you seeing an acceleration in market share gains there, whether it's in cosmetics or other categories? 
Kiley Rawlins: So Kate, I'm sorry, can you repeat the first part of your question. We didn't hear you. 
Katharine McShane: Oh, I'm sorry. I'll speak up a little bit. I just wondered based on your comments that you came in higher than your expectations for comp. Is that a similar commentary both for the prestige category and the mass category? And then just within mass, are you seeing an acceleration in share gains there versus what you saw in Q1? 
David Kimbell: Got it. Yes. Thanks for the question, Kate. And yes, we're really across the board. Yes, we were higher than our expectations and we're seeing strength versus expectations across really all aspects of our business. I talked about all of our categories demonstrating strong improvement. And in all but makeup, healthy growth versus 2019, and that is true both on the prestige and the mass side.
 And then within makeup specifically, and while we said it's not quite back to 2019, although getting closer and again showing moments through Q2 where we were above 2019. We saw improvement in both mass and prestige. Mass has recovered faster, but prestige is certainly showing signs. And we're seeing some good, and it's really driven by newness across the board, both some new brands that we brought in, but a strong newness across so many of our brands and different segments of makeup that are exciting our guests, getting them re-engaged in the category. So yes, we're seeing it across both price points and categories, and it's encouraging. 
Operator: Our last question comes from Krisztina Katai with Deutsche Bank. 
Krisztina Katai: Congrats on a very strong quarter. I wanted to touch on the membership base. You mentioned that it reached a new record. You are re-engaging with lapsed consumers and signing on new ones. So where do you think you are in terms of the target customer share of wallet compared to 2019?
 And then secondly, do you have any views on how the selling and competitive landscape is really evolving here as we exit the pandemic. And how are you thinking about the various players, including department stores, brand, DTC and specialty beauty players like Ulta and Sephora? 
David Kimbell: Great. Yes. Loyalty, as I mentioned earlier, we're really pleased and encouraged by the results we're seeing, both in the absolute number of active members as well as spend per member. We're seeing nice healthy improvement there, and it's just driven by high-level engagement across categories. And so as we look at share of wallet, we are confident that we're continuing to grow both share of categories and share of wallet, and feel like our efforts to lead the category recovery are driving a high level of engagement.
 And across the competitive environment, certainly, the beauty category is always highly competitive. This is a disruptive time with a lot of changes. We have a high level of respect for all of our competitors. But our focus is on Ulta Beauty and driving our business forward and leading the beauty category and leading the beauty recovery. Our model is unique. Nobody does what Ulta Beauty does. The assortment that we provide, the loyalty program, the guest experience, which is so important and done with excellence in our stores in particular and across all other touch points. And so we believe we have a unique business model that yes, while we certainly watch and are well aware of competitive activity, we're focused on playing offense and driving our business forward. And again, I couldn't be more proud of the way the team is delivering across every part of our business to ensure that Ulta Beauty is the really definitive leader in the beauty category and driving this recovery that we're very encouraged to see.
 So with that, thank you, again, for joining us today. I really appreciate your time. And I do want to thank all of our Ulta Beauty associates for their continued agility and commitment to serving our guests and taking care of each other, especially through the changing dynamics of COVID-19. We look forward to sharing more about why we are so excited about the future of Ulta Beauty when we host our 2021 Analyst Day here in the Chicago area in October. So have a good evening and thanks again for joining. 
Operator: This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation. Have a wonderful evening.

===== 2021 Q1  (2021-05-27 16:30:00) =====
Operator: Good afternoon, and welcome to Ulta Beauty's conference call to discuss results for the first quarter of fiscal 2021. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce Ms. Kiley Rawlins, Vice President of Investor Relations. Ms. Rawlins, please proceed. 
Kiley Rawlins: Thank you, Shamali. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Hosting our call are Mary Dillon, Chief Executive Officer; Dave Kimbell, President; and Scott Settersten, Chief Financial Officer. Kecia Steelman, Chief Store Operations Officer, will join us for the Q&A session.  
 Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that statements made on this conference call, which are not historical facts, may be deemed to constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual future results may differ materially from those projected in such statements due to a number of risks and uncertainties, all of which are described in the company's filings with the SEC. We caution you not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of today, May 27, 2021. We have no obligation to update or revise our forward-looking statements, except as required by law, and you should not expect us to do so.  
 In today's comments, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted operating income, adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share, which have been presented to reflect our view of ongoing operations by adjusting fiscal 2020 results for store impairment charges and adjusting both 2021 and 2020 for stock compensation and other tax credits. A reconciliation of these measures for the corresponding GAAP measures can be found in our earnings release which is available in the Investor Relations section of our website at www.ulta.com.  
 Following prepared comments from our leadership team, we will open the call for questions. [Operator Instructions] As always, I'll be available for any follow-up questions after the call. Now I'll turn the call over to Mary. Mary? 
Mary Dillon: Thank you, Kylie, and good afternoon, everyone.  
 This afternoon, we reported record first quarter financial performance, with sales and earnings exceeding both fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019 levels. For the first quarter, net sales increased 65.2% to $1.9 billion. Operating margin was 15.8% of sales, and GAAP diluted EPS was $4.10 per share. Adjusted diluted EPS for the quarter was $4.07 per share.  
 Fiscal 2021 is off to a fantastic start at Ulta Beauty, and I want to thank all our associates for their continued efforts to deliver great experiences and support our business in an environment that continues to be very dynamic. Now as you know, this will be the final time I speak with all of you as CEO as I will transition to Executive Chair of Ulta Beauty next week after our Annual Shareholder Meeting. I cannot express how much of an honor serving as the CEO of Ulta Beauty has been for me. I'm proud of what we've accomplished over the last 8 years and the amazing team and culture that we've built.  
 I want to thank my leadership team for their collaboration, agility and commitment to our associates and guests. And I want to thank all of you in the investor community for your interest and support. I am really excited about Ulta Beauty's future, and I'm confident this will be a seamless leadership transition.  
 Dave's passion for Ulta Beauty and our associates is unmatched. And he knows the beauty category, our business and our guests very well. In fact, his role as a Chief Marketing Officer, Chief Merchandising Officer and President have given him a much better understanding of the category, demand creation and the needs of our guests than I had when I assumed the CEO role 8 years ago. I know his knowledge and commitment will position him well to lead Ulta Beauty through its next chapter of growth.  
 And although many of you have met her, I want to take a moment to introduce Kecia Steelman, who is joining the call today and will become our Chief Operating Officer. Kecia has done an outstanding job as our Store Operations Leader for the past 7-plus years, and I'm excited that she will expand her scope to include supply chain, Ulta Beauty at Target and enterprise level continuous improvement efforts. As you get to know her in this new role, I know you'll be impressed by her knowledge, leadership style and passion for our business, associates and guests.  
 Although this change is somewhat bittersweet for me personally, I'm excited about my new role as Executive Chair. I look forward to supporting Dave, Kecia and the rest of the Ulta Beauty leadership team as they build on what we've accomplished together and continue to lead and disrupt the beauty category for many years to come.  
 Now I'll turn the call over to Dave to share more detail about the first quarter's results. 
David Kimbell: Thanks, Mary, for your kind words, confidence and support. We've worked together for a long time, and I'm grateful for the opportunity I've had to learn from you and to lead with you.  
 Under your leadership, Ulta Beauty has established a winning, engaging culture, become the largest U.S. beauty retailer, joined the Fortune 500 and tripled its market cap. And we have solidified the company as the preferred destination for beauty enthusiasts, created an inclusive, well-regarded workplace and become a recognized leader in the business and retail community. I want to thank you personally for your leadership and mentorship, and I look forward to your ongoing support and counsel as I transition into my new role.  
 Kecia, I'm thrilled to continue to work with you in your new role as Chief Operating Officer. We've worked closely for the last 7 years, and I look forward to leading with you and our experienced executive team in service of our associates, guests and shareholders.  
 I am excited and humbled to become the CEO of Ulta Beauty. Over the last several years, I've worked closely with Mary and the entire executive team to build our culture, strengthen our guest engagement, and develop our strategic plan, and I will work hard to ensure a seamless transition as we plan and execute the next chapter of our growth.  
 Over the last 60 days, I've spent time talking with and listening to our leaders and our associates across the enterprise. Most recently, Kecia and I visited our Greenwood distribution center and our new Jacksonville, Florida fast fulfillment center as well as a number of stores. And more than exceptional operations, we saw firsthand the commitment and passion our associates bring to serving our guests. Despite the challenges of maintaining COVID-related safety protocols, our DC teams continue to meet the growing demands across channels, and our store teams continue to create human connections and meaningful connections with our guests every day.  
 I continue to be proud of how our teams navigated the challenges of the last year with strength, grace and a commitment to our guests and to each other.  
 We are emerging from 2020 as a leader. We see this in our sales trends, market share gains, consumer sentiment, brand strength and most importantly, in our culture. I believe this is a testament to the choices we made throughout 2020 and also to the strength of our 31-year history as a vibrant company and successful category disruptor.  
 To build on this success, I am focused on 4 key areas as I transition into the CEO role: our culture, our members, omnichannel experiences and operational excellence. Ulta Beauty has built a guest- and associate-centric, values-based and high-performance culture. We value and encourage collaboration and enterprise thinking, and we respect and listen to our associates to continually improve as a company. These tenets are core to how we lead, how we engage with our guests and partners and how we make decisions. Our culture is a key part to our success and why I am committed to protecting and enhancing our culture as we move forward.  
 As we emerge from the challenges of the pandemic, consumers are creating new routines and habits, and we have the unique opportunity to build deeper connections and drive greater engagement with our members. Each of our more than 37,000 associates play a role in member engagement and retention. My vision is that, together, we can and will accelerate how we engage and delight our guests every day.  
 And not just in stores or online, but through a seamless omnichannel lens. Consumers are quickly evolving expectations for how physical and digital platforms work together to create holistic brand experiences. As we focus on longer-term growth for Ulta Beauty, we are thinking about how we can create emotional, immersive, human experiences across all touch points and how we can evolve our organization and the ways we work together to support a buy anywhere, fill anywhere approach.  
 Importantly, as we navigated the pandemic, we proactively took steps to optimize our cost structure while investing in new capabilities to support future growth. Looking forward, we see opportunities to drive greater efficiencies across enterprise-wide processes, to elevate our rigor and discipline, and to focus on metrics that are most important to achieving our operational and financial goals. By expanding our focus on operational excellence, we'll be able to invest more in creating great guest experiences while also improving profitability.  
 Now let's talk about our first quarter performance. For the quarter, comp store sales increased 65.9%. This outstanding performance was broad-based, with above plan performance across channels, categories and geographic markets. While we believe stimulus payments contributed to the quarter's strength, we also believe the relaxation of restrictions, increasing consumer confidence and a desire for newness are positively impacting consumer spending in the beauty category. Our differentiated model, combined with our efforts to create meaningful guest connections and experiences position us well to attract more guests and lead the category recovery.  
 Sales were strong across channels, with stores leading the way as consumers were increasingly comfortable with shopping in stores. As local restrictions lifted, we increased our operating hours and welcome brand partners back to stores. And as store traffic trends improved, we adjusted staffing levels to support the increased demand. While the hiring market remains challenging, we are pleased with our ability to hire and staff our stores.  
 E-commerce performance was also higher than expected. Strong traffic and higher average order value resulted in mid-teen growth on top of last year's 100% growth, with sales penetration in the mid-20s. This quarter, we continue to test ways to incentivize guests to use buy online, pickup in-store with new BOPIS-only promotions. Importantly, we drove above-trend BOPIS penetration while also continuing to drive growth through our store and ship-to-home channels.  
 For the quarter, BOPIS increased to about 16% of total e-commerce sales compared to about 4% in the first quarter last year and slightly above fourth quarter levels.  
 While we certainly expected brick-and-mortar would drive nice quarter nice comp growth in the quarter as we anniversaried store closures last year, the sales strength we're seeing in physical stores and in e-commerce continues to reinforce to us that e-commerce transactions are incremental and help drive greater overall member engagement and spend.  
 From a category perspective, we increased our market share across all major prestige beauty categories based on the NPD group's point-of-sale data for the quarter ending May 1, 2021. Additionally, we saw terrific strength across our mass categories and believe we are increasing our share within mass beauty as well. Newness in our strategic tent-pole events, 21 days of Beauty and Spring Haul, continue to resonate very well with guests. All major categories delivered robust double-digit comps as we anniversaried last year's store closures.  
 Compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2019, fragrance, bath, skincare and hair care all delivered robust double-digit comp growth. Now starting with one of our strategic growth categories. skincare delivered strong sales growth this quarter, driven by newness and great engagement in our tent-pole events. Guests continue to embrace skincare as a form of self-care and wellness with body care, sun protection and facial serums driving nice year-over-year growth. New brands, including Keys Soulcare, LOLI Beauty, and Urban Skin Pro as well as new products from Tula, Pacifica and [ Central Pay ] drove good guest engagement. And dermatologist-recommended brands, including CeraVe and La Roche-Posay, continued to see gains driven from interest and support on social media platforms.  
 Fragrance and bath was our strongest category again this quarter, demonstrating that consumers remain focused on self-care, even as they become more comfortable reentering public spaces. Newness in fragrance from Dolce & Gabbana, Versace and Carolina Herrera as well as continued strength in potty scrubs and moisturizers from brands like Truly, Tree Hut and Hempz drove exceptional category growth. Strong guest engagement with our monthly Fragrance Crush programs, Valentine's Day and Spring Haul also drove robust growth in the quarter.  
 We're seeing nice momentum in the hair care category as well, driven by newness, innovation and do-it-yourself beauty. The first quarter saw growth from new brands like Briogeo, Kristin Ess and Monday, as well as product launches from Redken, Curlsmith and Pattern. And our salon back bar takeovers helped drive growth for established brands like Living Proof, FEKKAI and Bumble and Bumble.  
 Reflecting ongoing DIY trends, hair color, color care and hair styling tools also contributed to the category's strong sales performance for this quarter. Compared to 2019, comp sales in the makeup category were negative, but we are encouraged by sequential improvement in the trends from Q4. Newness and innovation, combined with strong guest engagement during our tentpole events, delivered better-than-expected performance in this category. Subcategories that focus above the mass continue to perform well, including mascara, lashes and eyeliner. We're also beginning to see guests engage with categories like lip and face, driven by newness from brands like Benefit, Tarte and Morphe, as many begin to adjust to reduce COVID-19 restrictions and look to refresh their stash.  
 Newness from Nicks, e.l.f. and Kiss are driving strong growth in mass cosmetics, while newer prestige brands, including KBD, Vegan Beauty, HOURGLASS and Jaclyn Cosmetics are delivering growth and prestige. Although it remains difficult to predict the specific timing of a full recovery in makeup, we are seeing early signs that guests are engaging more with the category. Confidence is growing, restrictions are lifting, and many consumers are increasingly looking forward to a fresh start in a new post-COVID normal.  
 As travel and wearing occasions increase, the desire for something new is growing. At the same time, engagement with social media platforms like TikTok are bringing new life to the color cosmetic category, engaging younger audiences, driving trends and reinvigorating trial and usage. These drivers, combined with an expanded pipeline of newness expected in the second half of 2021, increase our optimism about the pace of recovery of the makeup category this year.  
 This quarter, we continued to enhance and expand our Conscious Beauty platform, an initiative intended to help guests discover brands and products that reflect their personal values. In Q1, we certified 27 additional brands, bringing the total number of brands in the program to 250. We refreshed our Conscious Beauty end cap in stores, adding new brands like Pure, First Aid Beauty and COOLA to the presentation. And celebrated Earth Day with a unique gift with purchase offer. We also launched our circular shopping pilot with reusable packaging pioneer loop in 10 of our brand partners.  
 Building on the success of this cross-category promote platform, earlier this month, we launched the Wellness Shop in a select number of stores and on ulta.com. With a focus on self-care for the mind, body and spirit, the Wellness Shop features a curated selection of products across 5 key segments to help our guests easily navigate their personal wellness journey. We built the assortment with hero brands like Love Wellness, megababe and Kitsch and also introduced new brands like BLUME, Goli and The Good Patch. From scalp care routines and bath and shower rituals to supplements and adaptogens to relaxation and sleep regimens, this new shop addresses a variety of wellness needs in a curated, easy-to-navigate presentation.  
 As the country's beauty retail leader, we have the power to shape how the world sees beauty and a responsibility to drive greater diversity, inclusivity and equity. In February, we announced tangible commitments to this effort and I am proud to share that we continue to make progress in support of our goals. This quarter, we debuted MUSE in multifaceted platform to celebrate, honor and amplify black voices in beauty and announced the partnership with CURLBOX, a subscription box service catering to [ curly ] and textured hair consumers, featuring some of our most coveted products and brands. We've launched 5 new black-owned brands, including BLK/OPL and Mented Cosmetics, Black Girl Sunscreen and Skincare, CAMILLE ROSE and Hair and Homebody, a wellness-focused bath and body brand. And we created new educational content for textured hair, which was deployed to our salon teams earlier this month.  
 Sales from our service businesses increased nearly 50% compared to 2020, but were still lower than 2019 levels, reflecting appointment constraints due to social distancing. We are excited to welcome walk-ins for salon and brow services in states where mandates allow it and hope to reengage skin services in select stores later this year. We continue to focus on strengthening our stylist teams and where we have high demand in capacity, we're hiring experienced stylists with existing books. As a result, we are seeing nice increases in our stylist sales productivity as compared to 2019.  
 Our mobile app, virtual try on and skin analysis tools continue to resonate with guests as easy and safe ways to discover and try new products. We continue to see good conversion and higher average order values from guests to engage in these experiences.  
 This quarter, our services and events team began leveraging these tools for one-on-one consultations and small group events. In April, we launched a modified in-store event strategy aligned with COVID protocols, utilizing our virtual tools and successfully executing 350 events with 17 prestige brand partners.  
 Turning now to our loyalty program. We increased our loyalty members by 1.7 million members in Q1, the largest increase we've seen in a single quarter. We ended the quarter with 32.3 million members above our initial expectations. While this level is about 2% lower than Q1 last year, it is 5% higher than Q4 and only slightly below our member level in the first quarter of 2019.  
 The recovery of our member base from Q4 was driven by strong reactivation back into Ulta Beauty stores as well as increased new member acquisition. Our store associates continue to deliver a compelling member experiencing, welcoming members back and converting new members at higher rates than in 2019. We are seeing strong retention across all tenures as we deepen engagement with members who continue to shop with us throughout the pandemic, manage at-risk members to prevent attrition and introduce Ulta Beauty to new or newly reactivated members. We continue to lean into our member data to target high-value audiences and apply predictive behavioral modeling while personalizing experiences with product recommendations, replenishment reminders and offers optimized for incremental response.  
 We're using engagement levers like the mobile app to communicate our holistic member experience and drive key moments like 21 Days of Beauty, where we featured personalized offer for every member to drive retention and increase sales per member. These efforts are helping us accelerate the recovery of our member base and give us confidence that we can get back to 2019 levels this year.  
 Before I turn the call over to Scott, I want to provide a quick comment on Ulta Beauty at Target. We continue to make progress across all of our work streams to bring this new experience to life for our guests and we're on track to open our first shops later this summer. We remain confident that this innovative partnership with the light guest and strengthen engagement with the Ulta Beauty brand. We have very strong support from our brand partners and are confident that our assortment, which is an exciting mix of large established favorites and vibrant, often exclusive emerging brands, with the light guest when we launch. I know there are many questions about the assortment and experience, but our focus now is on building guest anticipation and excitement for the launch. Stay tuned for more details closer to launch.  
 Now let me turn it over to Scott to provide more detail about our financial results. Scott? 
Scott Settersten: Thanks, Dave, and good afternoon, everyone.  
 Starting with the income statement. Q1 sales increased 65.2% as we anniversaried the temporary closure of all of our stores last year in response to COVID-19. We opened 28 new stores during the quarter, including our new Herald Square store in New York City and closed 2 stores. We also remodeled 3 stores and relocated 1 store.  
 Total company comp increased 65.9%, driven by an 8.8% growth in average ticket and a 52.5% increase in transactions. Compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2019, total sales increased 11.2% and comp store sales increased 7%. As Dave mentioned, we saw stronger-than-expected sales growth across channels, with brick-and-mortar and e-commerce contributing to the strong comp performance.  
 From a mix perspective, cosmetics was 45% of sales compared to 50% last year. Skin care increased 200 basis points to 19% of sales, the fragrance and bath category increased 400 basis points to 11% of sales, and hair care products and styling tools increased 90 basis points to 19% of sales. As a percent of sales, the services category was down 40 basis points to about 3%. Note, the nail category is now included in cosmetics, instead of Other and we have updated 2020 results to reflect this change.  
 Gross profit margin increased to 38.9% of sales compared to 25.9% last year. The increase was primarily due to significant leverage of fixed costs resulting from higher sales. In addition, gross margin benefited from higher merchandise margin, lower salon expenses and a more favorable channel mix.  
 While the higher sales delivered some benefit on merchandise margin, the improvement also reflects lower promotional activity in the quarter and ongoing benefits from our efficiencies for growth, or EFG, cost optimization program. Salon expenses were lower compared to last year, reflecting the elimination of the salon manager role. As a reminder, we will anniversary this change in Q4.  
 Comparing this year's performance to the first quarter of fiscal 2019, gross margin improved by 190 basis points. Higher merchandise margin, fixed cost leverage and lower salon expenses were partially offset by channel mix. As a percentage of sales, SG&A decreased to 22.9% compared to 32.5% last year, reflecting strong expense leverage on higher sales. Compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2019, SG&A as a percent of sales was about 20 basis points favorable. As a percentage of sales, lower corporate overhead and store expenses were partially offset by higher advertising expense.  
 Operating margin was 15.8% of sales compared to negative 8.7% in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 on a GAAP basis, and a negative 7% on an adjusted basis. Strong top line growth, especially in brick-and-mortar, combined with the impact of our cost optimization efforts, resulted in robust operating margin performance.  
 The tax rate increased to 24.5% compared to 23.6% last year, primarily due to a decrease in state tax credits. Diluted GAAP earnings per share was $4.10 compared to a diluted loss per share of $1.39 last year. Adjusted diluted earnings per share were $4.07 compared to a diluted loss per share of $1.13 a year ago.  
 Moving on to the balance sheet and cash flow. Total inventory increased 1% compared to last year, reflecting the impact of 26 additional stores as well as the opening of our Jacksonville fast fulfillment center, partially offset by lower inventory levels due to higher-than-expected sales. Capital expenditures were $34.6 million for the quarter, driven by our new store opening program, investments in IT systems and store remodels and relocations. The decrease in capital expenditures compared to the first quarter last year was primarily related to investments last year related to our planned Canadian expansion, which was suspended in the second half of fiscal 2020. Depreciation was $70.6 million compared to $76.6 million last year, primarily reflecting the impact of last year's store impairments in the 19 stores, which we permanently closed.  
 We ended the quarter with $947.5 million in cash and cash equivalents. In the first quarter, we repurchased 1.2 million shares at a cost of $392.3 million. At the end of the quarter, we had $1.1 billion remaining under our current $1.6 billion repurchase authorization. We continue to expect to repurchase approximately $850 million of shares in fiscal 2021, but as always, have the flexibility to modify the cadence of repurchases in response to market conditions.  
 Turning now to our updated outlook for 2021. We are encouraged by our first quarter results and the trends we've experienced so far in the second quarter, but we are still early in the year. While the presence of vaccines and new CDC guidance gives us optimism for the recovery, our visibility into the trajectory and sustainability of recent trends is limited and the second half of the year remains difficult to forecast. We now expect net sales for the year will be between $7.7 billion and $7.8 billion, with comp sales planned in the 23% to 25% range. We continue to expect comp results will vary significantly between the front half and the back half of the year as we lap store closures that occurred in the first half of 2020. But we now anticipate comp growth will be in the high 40s to low 50s for the first half of 2021 and then moderate to high single-digit growth for the second half.  
 We continue to expect to open approximately 40 net new stores in fiscal 2021 and to now remodel or relocate 19 stores. We now expect operating margin for the year will be approximately 11% of sales. We continue to expect the largest driver of operating margin expansion will come from gross margin, driven by leverage of fixed costs, less headwind from channel shift, improving merchandise margin and leverage of salon costs.  
 Based on higher top line growth, we now expect modest SG&A leverage for the year as compared to fiscal 2020. These assumptions result in an expectation for diluted earnings per share in the range of $11.50 to $11.95 per share, including the impact of approximately $850 million in share repurchases. We plan to spend between $225 million and $250 million in CapEx in fiscal 2021, including approximately $115 million for new stores, remodels and merchandise fixtures, $90 million for supply chain and IT and about $33 million for store maintenance and other.  
 As a reminder, our guidance for 2021 assumes a consistent federal tax rate and no material increases in the federal minimum wage and does not include assumptions for any impact related to a resurgence of COVID-19.  
 And now I'll turn the call back over to our operator to moderate the Q&A session. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Rupesh Parikh with Oppenheimer. 
Rupesh Parikh: So first, Mary, wish you all the best, and you're certainly going to be missed. 
Mary Dillon: Thank you, Rupesh. 
Rupesh Parikh: And then, I guess, for the team, just congrats on a really amazing quarter. So I guess the one question I have is, if you look at Q1, obviously, operating margins are now well above where they were in Q1 '19. Are there any new learnings that you can share in terms of maybe some new structural benefits you see in operating margins going forward just based on the performance we saw during the quarter? 
Scott Settersten: Yes. So we're very proud, Rupesh, of the results that we were able to post in the first quarter and our teams did a great job collaborating with our brand partners to deliver a great experience to our guests and an outstanding financial performance. Part of what was driving some of that overperformance was obviously the very strong comp, right, in the sales generation versus what our initial expectations were. So nearly a 66% versus last year and about 7% versus fiscal 2019. 
 So a lot of good things going into that. Besides the great tailwinds we saw from stimulus payments and optimism about the economy and the COVID vaccine rollout across the nation, there was also structural changes we made in our business model, right? So we've talked about these over the course of the last couple of calls. So there's some good things that we did, some great self-help things, but we also took advantage of a great sales environment. 
 As we think about the 15.8 that we posted in the first quarter versus kind of the rest of the year and what our long-term expectations are, I would say that there was a bit of over-leverage maybe in the first quarter, right? So again, we didn't expect those sales levels obviously, as we get started in the year. And so the spending, we were unable to kind of match spending with the sales generation. So especially in the store environment, I mean, there were some longer lines at the checkout that maybe we would have preferred to see if we had that choice ahead of time. So as we're looking out to the rest -- the second half of the year, there's things around wages, store labor, some upward pressure in fuel and transportation costs. And then we're going to do some more advertising in the back half of the year than what we had initially planned to make sure we take advantage of the environment and make sure we really maximize market share gain opportunities in this environment. So longer term, very optimistic about operating margin expansion opportunities across the wide variety of elements in our business. 
Operator: Our next question is from Mark Altschwager with Baird. 
Mark Altschwager: I was hoping you could speak a little bit more to the trend you're seeing in the recovery in stores, perhaps relative to 2019, I think comps up 7%, with some of the e-commerce growth you cited, if my math is right, I think it implies stores still down versus '19, but it sounds like traffic is recovering nicely. So just any insight there. Just bigger picture, how the Q1 results have really informed your thinking on the trajectory of the store productivity recovery through the remainder of the year? 
David Kimbell: Yes, Mark, yes, we are very encouraged by the performance of our store channel. In fact, our entire omnichannel experience, even as our e-comm performed above expectations, our stores strengthened. So it just reinforces for us, the importance and the power of our model and the connections that we've built. 
 Yes. Yes. Stores did exceed our expectations, grew throughout the quarter. We saw -- as our guests became more comfortable in shopping in person, we certainly benefited from that and saw continued improvement throughout the quarter. Traffic was still down -- meaningfully down for the quarter, down in the 20% range. So the strength we saw in stores, we are pleased to see a lot of guests coming back in, but also strong -- saw strong ticket performance, which we think is driven by renewal reengagement in the category, trip consolidation, a lot of newness coming. But yes, so while we're encouraged by store, we know we still have opportunity ahead to get all of our guests back comfortable shopping in store, and we're continuing to see that trend. 
 I will just say that the -- as I mentioned, the e-commerce business also exceeded our expectations, including strength in BOPIS, so it reinforces for us, not just any individual strength across either stores or e-commerce or any element, but the connected strength that we're seeing, which is a strong indicator to us that our members are getting back involved in all aspects of Ulta, and we're pleased with that and anticipate more to come. As we look out over the rest of this year, as it relates to store traffic, we would anticipate it getting -- continue to improve traffic, but there's still a lot of uncertainty about how the rest of the year will play out and exactly how that will translate into store behaviors, but we're encouraged by what we saw in Q1. 
Mark Altschwager: That's really helpful. And maybe just as a quick follow-up to that, just the strength in BOPIS is nice to hear. Could you just maybe address e-commerce margins and how you're kind of closing the gap there relative to stores? I guess, maybe that would be for Scott. 
Scott Settersten: Yes. So I guess I would start with overall versus last year, the channel shift is going to work to our advantage, right? So that's going to be a nice tailwind as we talk about gross margin specifically, but operating margins overall. So as you've heard us talk about before, Mark, many times, there's a lot of different levels we have at our disposal to help mitigate some of this -- the margin headwinds that come with that part of the business. So again, that's just part of how consumers are going to shop, and we're focused on making sure we deliver the best shopping experience regardless if it's in our stores or an online digital kind of environment. 
 So BOPIS is one piece of that. We saw a nice increase this quarter. We're working on other ways we can motivate our guests to take advantage of that because that is a margin help for us on a rate basis. Again, we want to remind everyone that, as Dave mentioned during the prepared remarks, that our e-com business is largely an incremental piece. So it's driving a lot of incremental sales and the rate headwind we get from that is something we will take, all things considered, but we've got lots of ways to help improve that over the longer term. BOPIS is a piece of it, supply chain, getting closer to the guest is piece of it. And optimizing our promotional cadence overall is a big piece of it as well. So there's still a lot of ways for us to improve that as we look ahead. 
Mark Altschwager: That's great. Congrats to the team on a strong start and best of luck. 
Operator: Our next question is from Oliver Chen with Cowen. 
Oliver Chen: Great quarter and, Mary, we'll miss you a lot. Congrats on the next steps. The inventory position looks really, really tight in terms of it being somewhat low. Were sales left on the table? And what are your thoughts on inventory versus sales going forward in an environment where supply chains have been tougher and just making sure you're as well positioned as possible to realize the market share gains? 
David Kimbell: Yes. Thanks for your question, Oliver. We feel good about our inventory position, but it's certainly true that we've been working hard to ensure that we maintain a strong level of in-stocks. We've been working very closely with all of our brand partners to respond to this increased demand. And fortunately, we're having good success with that. As we look forward over the year, we would anticipate inventory levels to be higher than 2020, but at a rate lower than our comp sales. 
 So as far as leaving sales on the table, we feel like we were able to deliver and meet the demand. There are pockets of brands that had just extraordinary growth that we're working hard to maintain in-stock levels. But I'd say, overall, our guests were able to -- you'll find what they were looking for, and we felt like we met their expectations. And it's probably reflected in the strong basket size we saw both in-store and online. 
 So a lot of work going on to ensure this. I know our brand partners are max -- really looking to maximize their production to meet this growing demand, and we feel confident we'll be able to meet our guest demand going forward. 
Oliver Chen: And a follow-up, related question for Kecia or David. Supply chain priorities, just would love your take on the major priorities on the road map ahead as there are many initiatives you're working on? 
David Kimbell: Yes. That's great. Kecia, do you want to give some highlights there? 
Kecia Steelman: Yes. We're continuing to look for efficiencies within our supply chain and our network as we build out to support the -- not only the store business, but also the e-com business. So we'll have more to share here in the future, but we're continuing to look for efficiencies and the ways to get the products to our stores and to our consumers in the quickest, most efficient way possible. 
Operator: And our next question is from Erinn Murphy with Piper Sandler. 
Erinn Murphy: Mary, it's been an absolute pleasure working with you. And Dave and Kecia, congratulations. So my question is for Dave. On the cosmetics category, you mentioned it was still negative versus 2019. Could you just put a finer point on quantifying that? And then as you've kind of monitored the pace of reopening, has there been any key regional differences between markets like Florida or Texas that has been a little bit more outspoken in terms of the going out trend? And then what's implied in the guidance for cosmetics as you look at the back half of this year versus 2019 levels? 
David Kimbell: All right, Erinn, let me -- I'll tackle some of the your cosmetics questions and as both what we're seeing as it relates to the guidance. And I'll ask Kecia to kind of talk about our regional performance here. As far as makeup, as we said, well, and we're really pleased with the performance across all categories with strong growth versus 2020. We'll get extremely specific by category other than to say our makeup category was one major category where versus 2019, in total, we were still short of 2019 performance. 
 Having said that, we're seeing lots of encouraging signs. Our mass business is particularly strong. We've always been -- we've been working on for many years, building a really differentiated mass assortment with many brands that are exclusive or in limited distribution with us. Those partners have been leading innovation and driving new ways to connect with our guests, and that strength has really showed up in Q4. 
 We had strong positive growth on a number of our brands and brands across the assortment in our mass NICs, e.l.f., kiss, Morphe, Maybelline, really across the portfolio, really pleased with the business on that side of the business. Prestige makeup, was not quite as strong. We -- but again, encouraging signs. Newness is kicking in, and we see a lot more coming as we look into the balance of the year. The performance that we've had for a while, prepandemic on Prestige has been challenging, but so many of our brand partners have reacted with strong innovation -- strong product innovation, new marketing approaches, connection through social media. And as customers come back in, as our guests come back in, we're anticipating that part of our business really strengthening over the balance of the year. 
 A couple of highlights where, again, newness, I talked about it in the script, but we're seeing some newness across different areas of the business. Anastasia and brows, Benefit with Mascara new entry -- expanded performance in our luxury segment with HOURGLASS, newer brands like KVD Vegan and Jaclyn cosmetics, performance from some of our strongest largest brands like Clinique and Tarte. So we're seeing some encouraging signs, not quite yet back to 2019 and some uncertainty, how that will play out for the rest of the year. 
 As your question about performance and how makeup performance is reflected in our guidance, we'd say we're still watching it closely. We're not anticipating a massive turnaround, but we do see some encouraging signs. And if newness strengthened throughout the rest of the year, we'd anticipate it performing even better. So good signs in makeup, great signs happening in all categories outside of makeup, and so the balance of our portfolio feels really helpful -- healthy right now. Kecia, do you want to talk about some regional? 
Kecia Steelman: Yes. Sure. We stayed really close to this as they were starting to list the mask mandates across the states. And we really didn't see the variances across the United States, like what we would have thought. It was strength across the whole U.S. in regards to traffic. And I think it was more related around the confidence of the vaccine, the vaccine rollout and people getting more confident with coming back out into the stores and also getting ready for the reemergence of getting the mask off in the near future. 
 So there were no real regional variances that we saw across the U.S. There was strength in traffic really from coast to coast. 
Erinn Murphy: That's great. And then just my quick follow-up. So 1.7 million gain in loyalty members this quarter. How did that break down between lapsed versus new consumers? 
David Kimbell: Yes. We don't typically break that out that specifically. I'll just say we're really proud of our team in coming together to both reengage. I've talked in previous calls about the disruption in 2020 wasn't anything necessarily that they didn't like about Ulta. They just for all the obvious reasons, weren't engaged in 2020. And so the reengagement strategy across all aspects of our business, in particular, in our stores, really paid off with a lot of lapsed guests -- recently lapsed guest coming back in. But equally encouraged by the number of new members in this environment that we attracted. 
 And what's exciting about that is there's a lot of disruption and a lot of potential new members that are maybe reevaluating their -- the way they engage in beauty, and we think our model is perfect for that. So strength across both, and we find it really a good sign and more to come throughout the rest of this year. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question is from Mike Baker with D.A. Davidson. 
Michael Baker: Okay. Sort of following up on something that they talked about earlier. But if I have -- if I look at your guidance right here, you still have profits down, operating profit that is versus 2019. I think by about $50 million at the midpoint, yet you were up in the first quarter by $70 million. So that implies down somewhere in the $110 million, $125 million for the next 3 quarters. So what are the reasons that the operating profits would be down over the 3-year basis versus being up in the first quarter? 
Scott Settersten: Yes. So there's a mix of things. Again, the elements that play here, whether you're comparing to last year 2020 or 2019, the drivers are largely the same. It's just the overall impact weight of those in any one particular period that you're looking at. 
 So the primary reason is channel mix, right? When you're looking back to 2019, channel mix is a big influencer there. Again, we're doing a lot of things. Sales increase sales back into brick-and-mortar helps offset some of that headwind when you're looking to 2020. But back to 2019, that's a much larger part of our business. And as we've talked about before on a rate basis, it's definitely a pretty significant headwind for us. 
 Again, a reminder, those are incremental sales. So it's helping the total dollar performance and profit performance, but it hurts us on a rate basis. The other thing is you still got COVID costs in there, right? In 2021, you had none in 2019. We still have social distancing. We mentioned salons were operating at 50% capacity. TBD when all that's going to be able to open up and when we'll be able to be in our full line of businesses as we want to be. There's things in our DCs where we still have the social distance. Again, you got to look beyond the headlines on a lot of these themes. And so we're operating at reduced capacities. We have to add weekend shifts to make sure we can get our pick bins filled and keep the product moving to support an accelerated brick-and-mortar bounce back as well as a continued strong e-commerce business here above what we expected this year. 
 We also have wage pressure. Again, these are things most people are aware of, have seen in the headlines, whether it be just recruiting people to come back and fill open roles in our stores. Or pressure in the DC network. We see what others are doing out there to try to retain and find new employees. So again, we're not -- we have to compete with those people the same way everyone else has to do. And then lastly, I'd say a big piece is incentive compensation falling on the SG&A line. Again, when you think back to 2019 and our performance there, and what the outcome was for -- as far as incentive comp goes versus the performance, the expected performance now for 2021, that's a big headwind as well. So those are kind of the major elements, Mike. 
Michael Baker: Okay. That's helpful. And a lot of pressure there. But so as a follow-up, I think it's fair to say you got back to this 11%, or you will get back to this 11% quicker than you expected. But with all those pressures you just articulated, can we think about ever getting back to the 12% to 13% level that you ran out from, I think, like 2012 to 2019? Or do all those pressures make that not attainable? 
Scott Settersten: Yes. So we're not providing any long-term guidance today. We'll save that for November at our planned Investor and Analyst Day. But obviously, the trends of the business are quite strong, right? First quarter, way exceeded our expectations. The early read on second quarter is it's going well. Again, you got to keep in mind what we're lapping, right? Last year, in the first quarter, we were on a decelerating trend and then all those stores closed. Second quarter, we're starting to open stores last year in a kind of a wave action, but there was still a lot of requirements and limited capacity, things we were dealing with. And so that's phenomena. That explains the comp guidance, 40 to 50 first half and much more moderated in the second half. So that's what's driving the lower operating margin expectations versus last year. 
 Longer term, we feel like there's a lot of levers. Again, we've talked about this often with investors whether it be things around the e-commerce business with BOPIS and supply chain initiatives, our EFG work in the real estate area and other parts of our business and a lot of other -- Kecia mentioned a lot of efficiency work that's underway right now under the EFG umbrella gives us a lot of optimism for longer-term operating margin improvements. 
Operator: Our next question is from Anthony Chukumba with Loop Capital Markets. 
Anthony Chukumba: Let me add my congratulations to Mary as well, though I'm sure I'll see you walking your daughters in the neighborhood. So glad... 
Mary Dillon: That's right, Anthony, thank you. 
Anthony Chukumba: So my question, just a quick clarification. If I was looking at my notes from the last earnings call and  it said that you're going to -- you're planning to open those first Target shops and shops in the fall. And now you're saying late summer. So I just want to make sure I heard that correctly. And if so, just any reason that you were sort of moving up the rollout to the extent that you actually are moving up the rollout date? 
David Kimbell: Yes. I'd say we're just getting a little more specific. We've been kind of talking in general terms previously and now a bit more specific in late summer. I'll say we're really excited about it. And I guess I'd ask Kecia to just give a quick update. Kecia, as I think was mentioned in the call, is leading our Target initiative, and we're very excited about the opportunity. Kecia, do you want to give where we are on that? 
Kecia Steelman: Yes. Absolutely. What's been so exciting is that it's been highly collaborative with the Target team and we've got a cross-functional team that's hard at work to bring the Ulta Beauty at Target concept to life. We've crossed some critical milestones. We've built the joint project plan. Our fulfillment plans are all completed. Brand selections and store selections for this first wave are all done. We're finalizing our IT requirements, our training of our Target team members and the joint marketing strategies. But we're on track to deliver and launch this at the end of late summer, and we're really looking forward to this coming to life and having our guests see what this is all going to bring to play for Target and Ulta Beauty together. To the 90 million loyalty members of Target and 32 million of ours, I just think that the ecosystem that this is going to deliver for the world of beauty is going to be second to none. 
Operator: We have reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I'll now turn the call over to Dave Kimbell for closing remarks. 
David Kimbell: Great. Thank you all for joining us today. Fiscal 2021 is off to a great start, and I want to close by thanking the entire Ulta Beauty team for their collective efforts to support the business and to meaningfully engage with our guests at every touch point. Our team is the secret to our success, and I'm so grateful for their impact, particularly during these disrupted times. 
 I also want to thank our brand partners for their continued support as we navigate the dynamic operating environment. We are encouraged by the momentum we're seeing in the business and excited about our opportunity as consumers gain confidence and engage in the new normal. While the sequence and sustainability of demand remains difficult to predict, our teams are prepared and actively engaged to capitalize on opportunities as they arise. We remain very excited about the opportunity for Ulta Beauty to continue leading the beauty category recovery and we look forward to speaking with all of you again in August when we report our second quarter results. Thank you. 
Operator: This concludes today's conference, and you may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.

===== 2020 Q4  (2021-03-11 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Greetings, and welcome to the Ulta Beauty Fourth Quarter 2020 Earnings Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. 
 It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Ms. Kiley Rawlins, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please proceed. 
Kiley Rawlins: Thank you, Laura, and good afternoon, everyone. Joining me on the call today are Mary Dillon, Chief Executive Officer; Scott Settersten, Chief Financial Officer; and Dave Kimbell, President. 
 Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that statements on this conference call, which are not historical facts, may be deemed to constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual future results may differ materially from those projected in such statements due to a number of risks and uncertainties, all of which are described in the company's filings with the SEC. We caution you not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of today, March 11, 2021. We have no obligation to update or revise our forward-looking statements, except as required by law, and you should not expect us to do so. 
 In today's comments, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted operating income, adjusted net income and adjusted diluted EPS, which have been presented to reflect our view of our ongoing operations by adjusting fiscal 2020 results for store impairment charges, costs associated with the permanent closure of 19 stores and the decision to suspend our expansion into Canada as well as other restructuring costs, and adjusting both 2020 and 2019 for stock compensation and other tax credits. A reconciliation of these measures to the corresponding GAAP measures can be found in our earnings release, which is available on -- in the Investor Relations section of our website at www.ulta.com. 
 Following prepared remarks from our leadership team, we will open the call for questions. As our prepared remarks will be longer than usual, we plan to end our call today at 5:15 Central Time. [Operator Instructions] As always, the IR team will be available for any follow-up questions you have after the call. 
 Now I'd like to turn the call over to Mary. Mary? 
Mary Dillon: Thank you, Kiley, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll start today with comments about our leadership transition plans and then share highlights from our fourth quarter and full year results. Then Dave will discuss our priorities for 2021, and Scott will review the financial results and our outlook. 
 Starting with the succession plans we announced this afternoon. I am very excited to announce that in June, Dave Kimbell will become CEO of Ulta Beauty, and I will transition to Executive Chair of the Board. In addition, Kecia Steelman will be elevated to Chief Operating Officer in June. In conjunction with these changes, Bob DiRomualdo will retire from his role as Chair of the Board as planned, and Lorna Nagler will assume the role of Lead Independent Director. These changes reflect a thorough and thoughtful succession planning process I have engaged in with our Board of Directors over multiple years and are designed to ensure strategic and leadership continuity as Ulta Beauty moves into its next chapter of growth. I personally want to thank our Board for their care, consideration and oversight of this important process. 
 After serving as CEO for nearly 8 years, I believe the time is right for me and for Ulta Beauty to make this change. We have a differentiated business model that has proven its strength over and over again throughout our 30-plus year history and position Ulta Beauty as a leader in the beauty industry. We've developed and sustained a world-class, guest-centric, values-based, high-performance culture. 
 We're emerging from the 2020 pandemic with a strong foundation and good operational momentum, and we have a talented, diverse and experienced team of leaders to drive our next phase of growth. While I'm proud of what we've achieved over these past 8 years, I truly believe now is the time for my successor and their leadership team to continue the journey. 
 Since joining Ulta Beauty as Chief Marketing Officer in 2014, Dave has continued to expand his leadership responsibilities, ultimately assuming the role of President in 2019. Highly regarded in the beauty industry, Dave is a results-driven, guest-focused, inclusive leader who've to motivate teams and activate strategies to move our business forward. Dave's passion for Ulta Beauty, our guests and our associates is extraordinary, and I believe there was no one more prepared or better suited to lead Ulta Beauty into the future. 
 Kecia Steelman joined Ulta Beauty in 2014 as Senior Vice President of Operations before assuming the role of Chief Store Operations Officer in 2015. In this role, she has overseen all aspects of store and salon operations, leading passionate associates to consistently deliver great experiences for our guests, even as we nearly doubled our footprint. As Chief Operating Officer, Kecia will have responsibility for store and services operations, supply chain, external partnerships, including Ulta Beauty at Target and key enterprise-wide continuous improvement initiatives. 
 Dave and Kecia will be supported by an executive team with deep expertise and Ulta Beauty experience. My focus has been and will continue to be on Ulta Beauty. And in my new role as Executive Chair, I'll advise and support Dave on key issues, including strategy, external relationships and organizational development. My plan is to remain in the Executive Chair role for 1 year. I am optimistic and excited about the long-term growth opportunity for Ulta Beauty, and I'm confident that under Dave's leadership, Ulta Beauty will keep shaping and leading the beauty industry for many years to come. 
 Now let's talk about our fourth quarter performance. The Ulta Beauty team delivered better-than-expected results for the fourth quarter. For the quarter, net sales were $2.2 billion, and GAAP diluted EPS was $3.03 per share. Adjusted diluted EPS for the quarter was $3.41 per share. Strong enterprise-wide execution of our plans, combined with improving trends in consumer demand, resulted in momentum across multiple metrics, including sales, transactions and profitability. 
 We experienced less disruption from COVID than we anticipated in the quarter, and top line trends improved across all channels and all categories, resulting in a comp store sales decline of 4.8%, an improvement compared to the 8.9% decline in the third quarter. We kicked off the holiday season in early November with our multichannel See the Joy campaign, targeted marketing and promotional activity and an extended Black Friday event. We continue to lean into our successful We Love Our Members events throughout holiday, rewarding guests with member-only offers promoted broadly across channels to reinforce the value of the program and to engage our members. 
 And we leveraged our CRM and analytics capabilities to expand our reach and maximize productivity. We drove strong sell-through of holiday merchandise and core product, and transitioned quickly after holiday to support our strategic Love Your Skin and Jumbo Love events. The planned expansion of our gift card program drove robust year-over-year growth in gift card sales during the holiday period and delivered elevated redemption activity in stores post-holiday. 
 Our e-commerce business increased more than 70%. With increased fulfillment capacity in place, our DC and store teams did an excellent job supporting record level of e-commerce demand. Limitations on in-store capacity and reduced operating hours are still in place, but we're encouraged by the momentum we're seeing in store traffic. 
 From a category perspective, we continue to increase our market share across most major prestige beauty categories. Starting with one of our strategic growth categories, skincare delivered a low double-digit comp. In addition to broader self-care and wellness trends, newness and engagement and social media platforms are driving interest in newer brands like The Ordinary and Urban Skin Rx as well as established brands like CeraVe and First Aid Beauty. Fragrance and bath delivered strong double-digit comp growth delivered -- driven by newness and a strong base fragrance business from brands like Chanel and Dior. Bath also continued to benefit from self-care trends, newness and social media engagement. 
 Comp sales in haircare were down slightly in the quarter, primarily reflecting planned changes to our Jumbo Love event, which negatively impacted top line growth but delivered significant profit improvement. Excluding the event, comp sales in the haircare category were positive for the quarter, driven by hair color, color care, texture and innovation. Prestige hair continues to be an area of focus. And in January, we launched Briogeo, a black-owned clean brand formulated for all hair types in all stores and online. 
 Comp sales in the makeup category were negative but improved sequentially, reflecting less year-over-year product newness and continued mask wearing and limitations on makeup wearing occasions. While new launches were limited, we do see guests eager to engage with newness from established brands like Too Faced and NYX as well as new brands, including Laura Mercier, KVD Beauty and HOURGLASS. 
 Sales from our services business were down more than 40% in the fourth quarter due to a decline in transactions, while average ticket continued to be higher. Our services business remains adversely impacted by COVID-related capacity constraints and local restrictions, but we're starting to see some local markets increase capacity thresholds. 
 While we ended fiscal 2020 with 30.7 million loyalty members, about 10% fewer than last year, we maintained strong retention levels of our high-value platinum and diamond members. The reduction in total members was anticipated given store closures earlier in the year and ongoing store traffic challenges. Importantly, we saw a rebound in new membership this quarter as our store associates delivered stronger conversion versus last year. 
 Reactivation trends also rebounded due to amplified marketing and promotional efforts across print and digital channels. We also saw good growth in our credit card program, increasing our member penetration by about 400 basis points versus last year, reflecting strong acquisition and retention of our highly engaged credit card members. 
 We ended the year with noteworthy changes in our member channel mix. While 2/3 of our members continue to be in-store-only shoppers this year, our mix of omnichannel members nearly doubled to 23% of members, and our online-only members grew to 12% of members. 
 While Scott will take you through the details of the P&L in a few minutes, I want to highlight 2 areas of focus that are delivering tangible results for our profitability. First, we continue to see strong success in optimizing our promotions. We offered a number of compelling promotions during holiday, but we further leveraged our CRM capabilities to be more targeted and more profitable with our offers. Post-holiday, we saw an opportunity to be more strategic and employ relevant storytelling to drive guest engagement. For our Love Your Skin and Jumbo Love event, we took a content-forward approach across print and digital channels to focus on education and routines, highlighted newness like never before and refined the focus of offers in brand participation. As a result of these efforts, we delivered meaningful improvement in our merchandise margin. 
 Second, we continued to take steps to reset our cost structure. After a thorough and thoughtful evaluation of work and capabilities across every corporate function, this quarter, we eliminated approximately 340 roles, resulting in a charge in the quarter of approximately $10 million. Even as we made difficult decisions to eliminate certain roles, we also reorganized select teams, expanded some roles and introduced a number of new positions in key investment areas aligned to our strategic priorities. We expect these decisions will result in approximately $50 million of SG&A savings in 2021. These decisions were incredibly difficult, but I'm proud of the respect, care and compassion that went into the process. I'm confident these changes, combined with planned investments to enhance our enterprise capabilities, will position Ulta Beauty for continued success in the short and long term. 
 And now turning to the full year. From a financial perspective, total sales were $6.2 billion; comp store sales decreased 17.9%; and GAAP diluted EPS was $3.11 per share. Adjusted diluted EPS for the year was $4.68 per share. While fiscal 2020 was not the year we originally planned, I am proud of how our teams adjusted and responded to the unprecedented challenges, and I want to express my sincere appreciation to my leadership team and all Ulta Beauty associates for their flexibility, agility and unwavering commitment to our guests and to each other. 
 Facing a very dynamic operating environment early in 2020, we moved quickly to align on 6 strategic priorities intended to expand our market share and extend our competitive advantages. We made meaningful progress across each of these priorities in 2020. 
 Our teams continue to deliver great omnichannel experiences for our guests. After temporarily closing all of our stores in March in response to the spread of the virus, we began welcoming back guests and associates to stores in May with our new shop safe standards in all stores and enhanced digital shopping capabilities to keep our guests and our associates safe. 
 While store traffic remained challenged, sales through our digital channels doubled in fiscal 2020. To meet this increased demand, we expanded our e-commerce fulfillment capabilities, including the opening of our Jacksonville fast fulfillment center, expansion of our ship from store capabilities and introduction of curbside pickup. Reflecting increased safety concerns, we restricted the use of testers in stores but accelerated our virtual try-on capabilities. 
 We expanded GLAMlab, our virtual try-on tool, beyond cosmetics to include hair color, false lashes and the Benefit Brow Bar. We expanded our shade library to include more than 11,000 shades. We introduced QR code so that guests could virtually try on shades while in store. We also introduced a digital skin analysis tool to assess guest skincare needs and offer personalized product and regimen recommendations. In 2020, more than 11 million guests engaged with these tools, trying on more than 100 million shades through the app and ulta.com. 
 In a year that saw the contraction of the U.S. prestige beauty market, Ulta Beauty gained dollar share, specifically in key categories, such as makeup, skincare and fragrance based on NPD's point-of-sale data for the 52 weeks ending January 30, 2021. We expanded our assortment in key growth categories like skincare, haircare and wellness to provide guests with engaging newness and innovation. And we launched Conscious Beauty at Ulta Beauty in stores and at ulta.com, certifying more than 230 brands across 4 key pillars: clean ingredients; cruelty-free; vegan; and sustainable packaging. 
 Our marketing teams pivoted quickly to reflect the environment. And as a result, we maintained our unaided awareness in the mid-50% range and increased our aided awareness. 
 We drove innovation in our Ultamate Rewards loyalty program, launching new member appreciation events, implementing new reactivation campaigns and reinforcing the value of the program across all communication channels. Behind the scenes, we expanded our CRM capabilities, leveraging new propensity modeling applications to optimize the return on print investment and reengage with labs and at-risk members in our marketing outreach. 
 We took actions in fiscal 2020 also to adjust our cost structure. We delivered meaningful reductions in occupancy costs through aggressive negotiations and effective portfolio management, and we permanently closed 19 stores to further strengthen our store portfolio. We made changes to our store management structure to improve efficiency and productivity, and we took steps to rightsize our corporate structure. 
 We announced, of course, an exclusive partnership with Target Corporation that will disrupt the beauty category and change how guests experience beauty. 
 And finally, we published our first ESG report, sharing our efforts and commitments in 4 key pillars: people, product, community and the environment. While we're early in our journey, I am proud of the progress we've made in these areas, particularly as it relates to diversity and inclusion. Diversity and inclusion have always been important at Ulta Beauty as we want all associates to feel they can be their true authentic selves. 
 Given the events that unfolded throughout 2020, addressing racial and social injustice has become more important than ever. At the end of fiscal 2020, 91% of our associates were women and 47% of our associates were people of color. On our leadership team, 64% were female and 18% were people of color. We recently announced new commitments to help us progress further in our journey to support greater diversity, inclusivity and equity. Our team is deeply committed to leading purposefully with and for underrepresented voices across retail and beauty. 
 Fiscal 2020 was a difficult year, but the progress we've made positions us well to grow and lead in a post-COVID environment. 
 And now I'd like to introduce Dave Kimbell, who will share more about our plans and priorities for fiscal '21. Dave? 
David Kimbell: Thanks, Mary. 
 Before I discuss our priorities for 2021, I want to thank you, Mary, for your world-class and exceptional leadership of Ulta Beauty, and personally, for your mentorship. Your impact on our company has been tremendous. Under your leadership, Ulta Beauty has grown to become a beloved beauty destination, known as a welcoming and accessible place for guests and an inclusive workplace, offering outstanding career opportunities for associates. I'm grateful to have worked alongside you for many years and look forward to your ongoing support and guidance as I transition to my new role in June. 
 I also want to express my sincere appreciation to our Board of Directors for the opportunity to become Ulta Beauty's next CEO and to all of our associates and partners for their continued support. 
 In addition, I want to offer congratulations to Kecia on her well-deserved promotion to Chief Operating Officer. I look forward to leading with Kecia and our experienced diverse executive team in service of our Ulta Beauty associates, our guests and our shareholders. 
 I am passionate about the beauty category, the vibrant and dynamic business we have built, and the role we play in the beauty industry and in our guests' lives. Ulta Beauty is the leading destination for beauty discovery and meaningful human experiences, and I am excited and humbled by the opportunity to lead such a strong organization through the next phase of its growth. 
 As Mary said earlier, fiscal 2020 was a difficult year, but our teams met the challenges with agility, creativity and an unwavering focus on serving our guests. As a result, we begin 2021 with a strong foundation from which we can accelerate our growth and shape how guests experience beauty in the post-COVID environment. 
 As we think about growth opportunities in the new normal, we are focused on 6 strategic priorities to continue expanding our market share gains and extending our competitive advantages. 
 First, we are committed to meeting guests wherever they want to shop, whether it's in physical stores or on digital platforms. To support this commitment, we're building capabilities to win in an increasingly omnichannel world. This is not a new journey for us. And as Mary noted, we made a lot of progress in 2020. As we look forward to 2021, we plan to continue to expand and refresh our store fleet, including opening approximately 40 net new stores this year; further accelerate our e-commerce business through elevated marketing, loyalty engagement and advancement on our journey to create a more personalized experience for our guests on all our digital platforms; continue to evolve our supply chain to enable more flexibility while also supporting our omnichannel strategies; and as the newest pillar in our omnichannel strategy, successfully open Ulta Beauty at Target. 
 Since our November announcement about the new partnership with Target, our teams continue to make progress to bring our vision to life. Our brands are excited to partner with us, and we have more brands than originally considered for the space, with strong support from our largest brand partners as well as several brands, which are exclusive to Ulta Beauty across makeup, skin, skincare, haircare and fragrance. We remain confident that this partnership is an innovative, forward-looking approach to further delight our existing members while also acquiring new members from the millions of guests shop in Target every day. We continue to see great social engagement and enthusiasm for Ulta Beauty at Target, and we're on track to launch online in about 100 stores in the fall, scaling to hundreds of stores in the next few years. 
 Our second strategic priority is to reimagine how guests experience and discover beauty across all touch points. COVID-19 has not changed the importance of beauty, and we are confident in the future growth of the category. Beauty enthusiasts still value the human connection and physical experience of beauty but want to balance safety with the desire to discover and play with product. Reflecting these factors, we are elevating the end-to-end guest experience at Ulta Beauty. 
 In 2021, we intend to safely reintroduce testers in select areas of the store and work closely with our brand partners to develop innovative sampling programs; drive enhancements to our digital experiences, further investing in our app, including guided education and recommendation experiences like our skin advisor; implement layout changes in select new stores to elevate key growth categories; unify the presentation of skincare makeup and improve the focus pickup experience; and as our associates have the greatest impact on the guest experience, we plan to implement training for our team, focused on priority categories like skincare as well as key skills to further strengthen human connections with our guests. 
 Our third priority is to drive winning category strategies to engage and delight beauty enthusiasts and expand our market share. Our curation of a diverse assortment focused on newness, exclusivity and leading brands has enabled us to grow our market share over time. Building on the progress we made in 2020, we plan to continue to strengthen our assortment in key growth categories like skincare and haircare while protecting our strength in makeup; scale our Conscious Beauty platform; introduce a new wellness shop to offer guests self-care for the mind, body and spirit; and double our number of black-owned brands while investing to increase awareness and support of those brands. 
 Our fourth priority is to deepen Ulta Beauty love, loyalty and engagement. Over time, we've evolved our brand purpose to build stronger connections with our guests and the changes and challenges our guests experienced in 2020 provide us with a unique opportunity to reinforce our brand purpose. And of course, our loyalty program is central to our efforts to build brand love for Ulta Beauty. 
 In fiscal 2021, we are focused on creating culturally relevant content that leverages the power of beauty to deeply engage with guests across channels, including expanding our Where Dreams Begin campaign and building out our MUSE platform, which was developed to celebrate, honor and amplify black voices in beauty; expanding Beauty School at Ulta Beauty, our content-forward entertainment digital platform to drive hyper-relevant product and services engagement; increasing member growth across channels through new guest acquisition, lapsed member reengagement and targeted retention efforts; and we will accelerate spend and engagement through further personalization efforts, including advancing offer optimization in print and digital channels. 
 Our fifth priority is to drive holistic cost optimization. Like others, we face ongoing headwinds from macro cost, including wage pressure and transportation costs. We are also navigating category and channel shifts. In fiscal 2020, we actively took steps to reshape our organization and adjust our cost structure while also investing in new capabilities that will drive future growth. Building on these efforts, we will continue to pursue process optimization opportunities in merchandising and supply chain while also looking for ways to reduce occupancy and operating costs. Importantly, we will continue to invest some of these savings in support of our strategic priorities to drive growth. 
 Our final priority is to develop our talent and strengthen our culture. This is not a new priority. Our talent and culture are always in focus, and we know that our associates bring to life the Ulta Beauty brand for our guests. I am incredibly proud of how our teams led through 2020 with respect, empathy and courage. 
 Looking to 2021, we will continue to work to create an environment where every associate feels they can fully contribute, and every guest is optimally served regardless of differences. We will expand our training and development to inspire and empower our associates, and we will continue to enhance and magnify our diversity and inclusion efforts. 
 In closing, I am excited and optimistic about the future of Ulta Beauty. Our business is emerging from 2020 with good momentum and a strong foundation in place. We are positioned to thrive going forward, and I am confident our team will continue to lead with creativity, passion and continued care for each other and our guests while leading the beauty industry, capturing market share and driving profitable growth. 
 And now I'll turn the call over to Scott for a discussion of the quarter's financial results and our outlook for fiscal 2021. Scott? 
Scott Settersten: Thanks, Dave, and good afternoon, everyone. 
 Before I review our financial results and provide our outlook for the year, I just wanted to take a moment on behalf of the entire executive team and all of our associates to congratulate Dave on his upcoming appointment as our next CEO. We are excited for Dave as he takes this next step in his already successful career and have the utmost confidence in his ability to lead Ulta Beauty through its next phase of growth. 
 Now beginning with the income statement. Net sales for the quarter declined 4.6%, and total company comp declined 4.8%. As Mary mentioned, we are incredibly pleased with our performance as top line results for the quarter were much better than our internal expectations. 
 Average ticket increased 8.3%, primarily driven by an increase in units per transaction. Transactions declined 12.2%. As we have seen in recent quarters, we experienced nice conversion in both channels. We continue to be impacted by softer traffic to stores as well as capacity limitations and fewer operating hours compared to last year. However, we are encouraged by the sequential improvement in store traffic during the fourth quarter. 
 As expected, e-commerce growth slowed relative to the third quarter as demand in stores improved but still delivered very strong growth versus last year. Our e-commerce operations delivered a sales increase of 72% for the quarter as guests continue to take advantage of our omnichannel capabilities. Buy online, pick up in store and curbside were strong again this quarter, particularly in the weeks leading up to Christmas, and totaled about 15% of e-commerce sales for the quarter. 
 Gross profit margin was 35.1%, an increase of about 10 basis points compared to 35% a year ago. The largest driver of gross margin performance was an increase in merchandise margin, which was driven primarily by lower promotional activity as we chose not to repeat certain promotional activity from last year and continue to refine our promotional strategies. 
 We also experienced a positive outcome from our holiday purchasing strategy, which reduced our exposure to limited edition holiday sets and leaned more into core product, resulting in higher sell-through and minimal post-season markdowns and clearance. 
 Lastly, we continue to see benefits from our cost optimization efforts across the organization. The increase in merchandise margin was partially offset by the impact of channel shift. However, we are pleased with the profitability improvement in our e-commerce business driven by continued strong adoption of our BOPIS and curbside capabilities as well as the impact from our efforts to refine our promotional strategy. We also experienced deleverage of fixed costs due to lower sales, although the headwinds improved from what we experienced earlier in the year given the better sales trend and actions taken by our real estate team to strengthen our portfolio and reduce occupancy costs, including lease negotiation efforts and our decision to permanently close 19 stores. 
 SG&A expenses decreased to $514.1 million compared to $515.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2019. The largest drivers of the decrease were lower store payroll and benefits, and lower variable store expenses as we adjusted to softer store traffic. These reductions were partially offset by higher marketing expense as we continue to prioritize and invest in digital and social channels and resume print advertising in preparation for the holiday season. We also experienced an increase in corporate overhead, primarily due to higher incentive compensation, reflecting our financial performance versus our internal targets, partially offset by reduced spending across multiple areas. 
 We incurred about $18 million in PPE and COVID-related expenses during the quarter. This quarter, we recorded a charge of $30.4 million for impairment, restructuring and other costs. Last quarter, we suspended our planned expansion to Canada, and our teams completed the wind down effort during the fourth quarter. This resulted in a $13.2 million charge related to lease termination costs, long-lived asset impairment charges and severance. We also recorded $10 million in severance associated with the charges -- changes made to our corporate and field management organization, $5.6 million in lease termination costs related to the previously announced permanent closure of 19 stores and $1.5 million due to the impairment of tangible long-lived assets and operating lease assets associated with certain stores. 
 GAAP operating income decreased to $224.3 million compared to $287.8 million a year ago. Adjusted operating income was $254.7 million or 11.6% of sales. Diluted GAAP earnings per share was $3.03 compared to $3.89 for last year's fourth quarter. Adjusted diluted earnings per share was $3.41 compared to $3.83 a year ago. 
 Moving on to the balance sheet and cash flow. Total inventory decreased 9.7% compared to last year as we adjusted purchasing to maintain flexibility and manage inventory. For the year, we invested $152 million in capital expenditures, including approximately $70 million for new stores, remodels and merchandise fixtures, $49 million for supply chain and IT, and about $33 million for store maintenance and other. We ended the year with $1 billion in cash and cash equivalents. 
 Reflecting our confidence, we resumed our stock buyback program in the fourth quarter and repurchased approximately 148,000 shares of stock. We have $1.5 billion remaining under our current repurchase authorization. 
 Turning to our outlook for 2021. While we are encouraged by recent sales momentum, visibility into the timing of a demand recovery remains limited. We expect much of 2021 will continue to be negatively impacted by masking requirements and social distancing. And while we expect sales trends will improve as we progress throughout the year and COVID-19 vaccines become more accessible, we are planning for total sales to be slightly lower than 2019. That being said, we plan to be nimble and agile, and we'll be prepared to capitalize should the environment improve earlier than we expect. 
 Now specifically for 2021. We expect to open approximately 40 net new stores, remodel 11 stores and relocate approximately 10 stores. Note that when the pandemic hit last year, we moved quickly to defer most of the new stores planned for 2020. As a result, more than half of our new stores are expected to open in the first quarter. 
 We anticipate net sales for the year will be between $7.2 billion and $7.3 billion, with comp sales planned in the 15 to 17 percentage range. We expect comp results will vary significantly between the front half and the back half of the year as we lap store closures that occurred in the first half of 2020. With this in mind, we anticipate comp growth will be in the low to mid-30s for the first half of 2021 and then moderate to low- to mid-single-digit growth for the second half. We expect operating margin rate for the year will be around 9% of sales as we lap easier top line comparisons due to COVID-19-related store closures in 2020. 
 To give you a little more color on the expected puts and takes driving our operating margin expectation, overall, we expect the largest driver of operating margin expansion will come from gross margin. For the year, we anticipate an improving sales trend from our brick-and-mortar operations, resulting in less headwind from channel shift and leverage of fixed costs. We are planning e-commerce penetration to be in the low to mid-20s for the year. We also expect merchandise margin will improve modestly as we continue to optimize our promotional strategy and continue to pursue efficiency for growth opportunities. We also expect SG&A will deleverage, driven primarily by higher store payroll, as we anniversary the $52 million benefit from the CARES Act in fiscal 2020. 
 In addition, we expect to see payroll deleverage from store management changes made in 2020 and ongoing wage pressures. Recall that in the fourth quarter of 2020, we realigned our store management structure to create a more cost-efficient store model. As a result of these changes, we will see a reduction of salon payroll, which is part of cost of goods sold, and an increase in retail payroll, which is included in SG&A relative to last year. The deleverage of retail payroll should partially offset by lower corporate overhead, reflecting changes we made in 2020 to reset our corporate cost structure. We anticipate advertising will be relatively flat for the year as a percent of sales. 
 These assumptions result in guidance for diluted earnings per share in the range of $8.85 to $9.30 per share, including the impact of approximately $850 million in share repurchases. We plan to spend between $200 million and $250 million in CapEx, including approximately $115 million for new stores, remodels and merchandise fixtures, $77 million for supply chain and IT, and about $33 million for store maintenance and other. 
 I would note that our guidance for 2021 assumes a consistent federal tax rate and no material increases in the federal minimum wage and does not include assumptions for any impact related to a resurgence of COVID-19. 
 Before we take your questions, I want to announce that we plan to host an analyst and investor conference this fall to share our longer-term plans and outlook. We'll share more of the logistical details later this summer. 
 And now I'll turn the call back over to our operator to moderate the Q&A session. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Kate McShane with Goldman Sachs. 
Katharine McShane: Congratulations, Mary and Dave, on the news today. My question is centered around the guidance for the 15% to 17% comp growth for 2021. I just wondered to the extent that you could comment how you expect the cadence or the role of haircare and skincare driving that comp versus makeup. 
David Kimbell: Yes, Kate. Yes. Great question and one that we're spending a lot of time on. As we look out over the course of the year, we continue to be encouraged by the engagement that we're seeing from our guests across channels, both in stores and online. Our non-makeup businesses have been strong throughout -- really, throughout 2020 and certainly in the fourth quarter with skincare, fragrance, haircare, bath, all performing at or above our expectations. And we anticipate that continuing throughout this year. 
 There is -- continues to be a fair amount of uncertainty about makeup. And I'd say that's, as we look out over the year, while we have a lot of confidence in the long term of makeup and we know that there will be innovation and growth and new behaviors that will drive long-term growth, and we see signs of engagement through our consumer research, and we anticipate pent-up demand and excitement from guests -- from consumers as they feel more comfortable participating in society and going out and celebrating and doing all the things that I think we know is coming. The question for us is when that will come. And we've built in a number of models where we're certainly prepared for that renewed engagement in makeup. We haven't fully seen it yet even though we've seen signs of it. But we have a whole line of sight towards driving innovation with our brand partners, highlighting through our marketing and communication, leveraging our digital tools, our virtual try-on tools and then being prepared from -- with close coordination with our brand partners on inventory as we see makeup grow. 
 So uncertainty by when because it's been a bit of a ride even before COVID on makeup, but we're confident in the long term and prepared for that growth. And all of that is reflected in our guidance for 2021. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Christopher Horvers with JPMorgan. 
Christopher Horvers: And so, Mary, you're still young. You own a lot of stock in the company, and the business is clearly poised to recover here in 2021. So I think a lot of investors look at the announcement and think this is at least a year early. Can you share your thoughts on why -- further why now? Why investors shouldn't think that way? And any thoughts on how you're thinking about your next career steps beyond June '22 when you leave the board? 
Mary Dillon: Well, Chris, I'll take that as a compliment. I'm teasing you. Listen, this has been planned for a while with the Board in terms of the kind of governance and succession planning that we all do. I just feel that this is the right time for me personally. I'm excited. I'm going to be the Executive Chair for a year. So I'm excited about that as well. I'm staying very close to the strategies in the future as well. 
 We're coming out of 2020 strong. The foundation of the business is very strong. Most importantly, Dave is ready to take on the next chapter of growth as the CEO of the company. So it just felt to us and to me like a natural time to make this transition. I'm very confident, very confident about the future of Ulta Beauty. And we're excited. I'm also excited that Kecia Steelman is going to have new responsibilities as Chief Operating Officer. So all told, I think this is about as seamless of a succession story as you can come up with, and that we're really excited about it. 
Christopher Horvers: I guess from the personal side, I mean, do you view this as also a good time for you to take another transition into your career? As you think about beyond Ulta, do you still think you're sort of going to stay in the game here as a retail executive? Or any thoughts there would be really helpful. I know it's a personal question. 
Mary Dillon: There is so many questions. Yes. No, listen, I'm focused on Ulta Beauty right now, and I'm very excited about that. And that's why I'm going to be the Executive Chair. I'll be the CEO through June and the Executive Chair for a year after that. And we'll see. I'm excited to the next -- for the next chapter, but I don't really have any plans yet. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Omar Saad with Evercore ISI. 
Omar Saad: I would add my congratulations to everyone as well. I'd be curious -- this is kind of a specific question on makeup, but I'd just be curious what you're seeing given this kind of uncertainty around what the recovery is going to look like and when it's going to start to happen. But a lot of the products you sell have expiration dates on them, expiration periods. I'd be curious if you're seeing any consumers come back into the store or online and kind of throwing out the expired makeup that hasn't been used in the last year and starting to replenish that part of their closet, if you will. 
David Kimbell: Well, first, yes, we don't -- we haven't had any issues for sure with expired products or too much inventory or anything like that. But your point about consumers refreshing their stock, their cabinets at home is, we believe, a behavior that is happening throughout 2020. There's been -- as there's been slower engagement in makeup pre-pandemic and then certainly all the disruption that happened throughout 2020, we see a renewal coming in just how people will engage -- how our guests will engage in makeup. The behaviors, the fashions, the looks, the styles will continue to evolve. We're excited and optimistic about that emergence. As I said earlier, the timing is a bit uncertain, but we see it coming. 
 And we feel that with that -- our guests are -- they love makeup. They love beauty. They love diving into different categories. They love newness. And I think because the makeup category has been challenged, as a reflection of less engagement for probably the last couple of years, we know our beauty enthusiasts are excited about it. So we'll see that exact behavior you talked about of cleaning out your stock, replacing it with new, leaning into newness, which there is tons coming, and then kind of embracing new looks and new styles as that moves forward. So we think that will be part of the total story. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Dana Telsey with Telsey Advisory Group. 
Dana Telsey: And Mary, congratulations on a wonderful career at Ulta, and who knows what comes next. 
Mary Dillon: Thank you, Dana. 
Dana Telsey: And Dave, congratulations to you on assuming the new role also. As you think about the changes that happened in 2020 going into 2021, how do you think of the digital channel and e-commerce and the margins that you've had in the past? Any opportunity for margins on e-com and digital to improve go forward and how we get there? 
David Kimbell: Well, we're thrilled with our digital and e-commerce experience. The growth has been strong for many years and, of course, was extraordinary in 2020 as our guests embrace that channel. And our entire team worked tirelessly to make sure that we are able to service our guests with really unexpected growth in demand. So -- and that engagement will pay off for Ulta Beauty for a long time, not only in the short-term sales, but history shows that as we get our guests engage in multiple aspects of our business, not just in stores, but in stores and online and participating in salon and other aspects, their total loyalty to Ulta Beauty, their total spend, their frequency increases dramatically. And so we're confident that, that will pay off. And so overall, it is a very good outcome for our business to have more people engaged in our digital channels and driving that growth. 
 We are, of course, focused on -- there are margin pressures on that part of the business. Again, overall, a very positive part of our business, but -- and so we're focused on that. And we have an entire kind of process to try to continue to optimize costs through promotional activity and cost to serve, and we see that as an important part of the business. 
 And Scott, do you want to give a little more color on how we're approaching that? 
Scott Settersten: No, no. We've seen -- we've demonstrated in the fourth quarter some of the benefits from promotional optimization, which, again, a lot of that occurs in the digital channel just by the very nature of the shopping experience there. So we believe there's plenty of opportunity to improve the profitability of that channel of our business, both on the promotional side, but also on the supply chain effectiveness side of the business. 
 So the FFC strategy, the ship from store strategy, getting closer to our end customers will help. But also just overall scale as that business continues to grow, we believe, will help drive some rate improvement there over the long term. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Kelly Crago with Citi Research. 
Kelly Crago: Mary, Dave, congratulations. Mary, you will be missed. 
 My first question or my question is really around the gross margin. A couple of different areas I want to focus on. I guess, number one, is there a chance that gross margin could reach back to F '19 levels in F '21? 
 And then just drilling down a little bit further on the rent and occupancy line. Could you first talk about some of the abatements you got this year and how we should think about the rent and occupancy line in '21? 
 And then on the merch margin, I think you said that you expect the merchandise margin to be up for the year. Is that going to be pretty consistent throughout the year given it seems as your [ strategy ] can pull on to some of these lower promotional [ savings ] going forward? 
Scott Settersten: Yes. So there's a lot connected to that question, but the overall theme about gross margin getting back to 2019, again, there's a lot of puts and takes. If you go back to the -- our prepared remarks, just we gave a lot of detail -- provided a lot of detail on that. I would say our initial outlook is not to get back to 2019. Part of it is the geography change on the services manager moving out of gross margin. So that's a plus up for us, but there is something -- the sales -- lower sales overall, at least our initial outlook there, creates a bit of deleverage there when we look back and try to compare to 2019. So there is quite a laundry list of things besides channel mix, which is one of the biggest drivers when we look at '21 versus '19. Again, a reminder, 2019 e-commerce was in the mid-teens as a percent of total sales, and we're thinking it's going to be in the mid-20s for 2021. So a lot of puts and takes there. 
 I mean I would go back to the comment we made about sales upside. So we are optimistic. We feel good about exiting the fourth quarter. And if sales come back stronger, especially in the makeup part of our business, then there's potentially some good tailwinds there. And that, again, sales helps scale and helps drive leverage. 
Kelly Crago: Got it. And then just on the merchandise margin side, is it -- do you expect it to be consistently up throughout the year? Or is it sort of weighted to the first half given some of the pressures you saw in the first quarter last year? 
Scott Settersten: Yes. I think it'll be a little stronger first half of the year because we're lapping some large disruptions over a year ago and then building momentum throughout the course of the year. So again, there's a lot of levers that we have to pull and push as we navigate through the course of the year with promotion cadence and some of our major events. So again, we're be looking to optimize the total business as we navigate throughout the year. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. 
Simeon Gutman: Congratulations, Mary and Dave. I want to ask a question that I think you'll probably defer to the Analyst Day. So I guess, Dave, in the next chapter of growth where margin can go, and part of the question is, it looks like your sales level is not going to be that far below 2019, and it looks like your SG&A level is somewhat back to 2019 levels. So I guess, what level of sales can you get back to 2019 level of margin? 
David Kimbell: Well, you're right, we'll talk a lot more about the future growth and what we have seen coming ahead at the Analyst Day in the fall, and we're excited to share those plans with you. We do see pressure now that Scott just -- Scott has described on the guidance that we've given around our overall profitability for 2021, and said that over time, we see that we're focused on improving that. We're optimistic that we can improve that, and we see that continued growth as we manage through some of those short-term disruptions. 
 So we'll have much more detail in the outlook, on the planning and the timing of our sales outlook beyond this year. We're focused right now on driving our business through the reemergence as we get in through 2021. 
Scott Settersten: And I would just add to that, that we are -- and we've talked about this over the course of the last couple of phone calls, I mean, that we're -- the executive team and all the senior leaderships are focused on getting back to double-digit EBIT margins. We're very confident we can do that. I think you can look at the fourth quarter result and see it's within striking distance. Again, that's a little bit of an outlier because of the level of sales there and some of the leverage it creates by nature. But we're confident that as 2021, the plan is put together, again, in a prudent and reasonable fashion here initially, and hopefully, the crisis passes by us a little bit quicker, and we can get some win in our sales and hopefully drive a better result overall than what we're planning for today. 
Simeon Gutman: Yes. And Dave, when Mary did the keynote for shop talk a couple of years back, she came out dancing. So yes. 
David Kimbell: Yes. I'll work on that, Simeon. Thanks. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Steph Wissink with Jefferies. 
Stephanie Schiller Wissink: And I'll add our congratulations as well to the whole team. Dave, this is a question for you. It's on the changes in the loyalty balance. I think, Mary, you mentioned a 10% reduction in customers within the program. Can you help us just think through, is that a function of how you define customers -- active customers, meaning someone that hasn't shopped with you within your defined period? Or are those customers that have opted out of the loyalty program? And if so, is that giving you any indication about how you have to think about retaining or reengaging those customers that you may have lost? 
David Kimbell: Yes. Of course, our loyalty program is key to our success and has been for a long time and will be well into the future. We believe we've got just a world-class loyalty program. The engagement, it remains incredibly high. We think we've got one of the best loyalty programs in all of retail. 
 There's been no change to how we define our guests. Our definition is to be counted as a member, you need to have shopped at least once in any of our touch points in the last 12 months. So that hasn't changed. But what we are seeing is we -- as -- particularly early in this crisis when our stores were closed, so a little over -- really about a year ago and for the next few months, we'll start lapping that. Our store-only guests, we lost some of the less engaged -- less tenured, less engaged members that either stepped out of beauty for a little bit or shopped at some of the retailers that were open and did not pivot to our e-commerce business. We've had a big focus in reengaging them. We know who they are. We know that they didn't have a bad experience with Ulta. They just changed behavior in the short term. 
 And so some of this is the math as we start to lap. We're lapping -- we're strong months, 12 strong months in 2019 with some of the challenges we had in 2020. And so we'll continue to work through that over these next few months. Said that there's nothing in any of our research that suggests our guests are any less engaged in beauty over time, in Ulta Beauty or anything that we've done. And one of the biggest and most important parts of that is our diamond and platinum guests, our most engaged guests, have maintained really best-in-class retention, really, very committed and connected to Ulta Beauty. 
 So we have a whole team that's focused. Really everything we do is for our loyalty guests. The communication we have through personalization, the broad scale marketing, our assortment evolution, they love our newness, and the merchant team has done a great job. Our stores are focused on ensuring that every guest gets a great experience. So we're confident. 
 There's a bit of a lapping element going on. And as we work through those short-term disruption, but the long-term outlook for loyalty is very positive. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Lasser with UBS. 
Michael Lasser: And congratulations to everybody. As part of the succession process, was there a thought to guide conservatively for the year ahead to help with the transition and provide more flexibility for 2021 as folks will be in their new roles? Or does it simply reflect the fact that Ulta's long-term operating profit margin won't be as high as it's been, in part to e-commerce penetration being in the low to mid-20% range versus 2019 when it was in the 13% range? 
Mary Dillon: Well, I would say this. We guide, to the best of our ability, to what we think is going to happen with some range around that. So if you look at the guidance, we feel encouraged and optimistic about the momentum on the business. But as we said, there's a great deal of uncertainty still ahead, and we've embedded some of that uncertainty into our outlook as we would normally under any circumstances, not just due to a transition. 
 As we said, we still lack clear visibility into the exact timing of an improvement in our largest category, which is makeup. So while we see something -- I think Dave explained it really well. We see some green shoots, and we're excited about the pipeline, but the timing is uncertain. So with all the puts and takes, both in managing costs, which I think we're doing well, but also investing in the future of the business, that leads us to the guidance that we provided. We think it's achievable. We're ready to move quickly if things get even faster in terms of the economic recovery and consumer recovery. But we think this is very reasonable guidance. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Paul Trussell with Deutsche Bank. 
Paul Trussell: My congratulations as well Mary, Dave and Kecia, and also to the team. On the MUSE campaign, this household is a fan. Just wanted to inquire about a few updates. One, 40 store openings this year, just maybe if you can put that in context of how you think about long-term door growth and potential kind of reacceleration in the outer years and maybe incorporate just any updates on Canada into that? And then similarly, just any updates as you've had further conversations with your vendor partners around the Target shop-in-shop and that partnership and what your expectations are for when that launches. 
David Kimbell: Yes. So yes, I'll start here. The -- first of all, thanks for the shout-out on MUSE. The team -- we're all really proud of that work. And I'm sure some of our team is listening, and they'll be glad to hear that. 
 On stores, we have 40 stores this year, and we remain consistent with the guidance that we've had that over time can grow in to 1,500 to 1,700 stores. No update, no changes to Canada specifically as related to that. That's all on pause, and we have no news related to that. 
 We continue to be optimistic and positive about the outlook of physical retail, and we'll continue to find just terrific locations across the country. The 40 that we're opening this year, we're -- we feel really, really good about, and we see plenty of growth ahead of us. So that's the plan on stores. 
 That's connected in ways to our Target business. So your question about how that's coming along, we're just really, really pleased with that partnership. The relationship we have with Target as we've been building this together has just been exceptional, and we're really thrilled with the feedback that we've had from -- on the concept from our consumers. They are pumped up about this and excited for it to come to life. We really see this as just a completely new way to engage our consumers in the prestige segment, and in beauty overall, it's definitely not. I mean we've worked so hard to make sure this is not just more of the same from a retail standpoint, which we think is really critical in this time of disruption in the marketplace. 
 So this is going to be completely new, totally different, focused on the best of the best in prestige, highly curated assortment, beautiful presentation, exceptional staffing, and we're anticipating high consumer engagement, compelling guest experience and, for us, acquiring millions of new members over time. 
 We're not sharing much more detail than what I shared in the script earlier today. We'll be sharing that as we get a bit closer. But I can assure you that our plans are on track. We're ready to launch Ulta Beauty. And we have tremendous support from our brand partners, both big, the biggest brand partners that we have, and small and emerging brands. In fact, we're going to launch with more brands than we originally considered. We have the brands that we wanted to launch this with and more, and we're excited about it. So it's coming together great. We think it's going to be an awesome experience. We're thrilled to be partnering with Target. They've been nothing but just exceptional partners to build this with, and we're excited to go create this next chapter in the future of beauty. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Binetti with Credit Suisse. 
Michael Binetti: And let me add my congrats. Mary, we'll miss you a lot. And Dave, we look forward to working with you. Congrats on the new role. 
 I guess maybe my first one will be for Scott. But I'm wondering if you can help us understand any of the metrics around how much of the SG&A that you guys have in the plan that you guided us to this year is what you'd call investment. I know -- I think Dave described it as investments partially offsetting some of the tailwinds on the margin. But if we just look at EBIT dollars per store, I think you're at like $740,000 in 2019, and the guidance looks like it's closer to $500,000. So I'm just curious, it seems like a lot of the focus here is in SG&A. 
 And then, Mary, in the markets that have been less restrictive or opened up more quickly, what are you seeing there as leading indicators that leads you describing the beauty category -- the color cosmetics category as low visibility or uncertain as you guide us with your thoughts on how the rest of the markets will start to reopen? 
Mary Dillon: Yes. I wouldn't say that we've seen a material difference in performance across markets for the most part. I mean there's certainly been weather disruptions and everything with COVID. We've been watching it closely. And I think just with makeup, we just know it's a category that's been under pressure even prior to COVID. And then we have a long period of time where folks are changing their makeup routines. And so we know that the category has lots of newness and innovation to come, and it's large. People are very engaged in the category. We're just not sure exactly when people are going to start wearing makeup, more makeup for social occasions and things like that. So we're watching it closely. 
 But it's a great aspect of our business model that we are across so many categories that the self-care, the skincare, the bath and fragrance categories have performed, as you know, exceptionally well. So we're well balanced, and we're poised to take advantage of the uptick, which we think will come. 
Scott Settersten: And on the SG&A part of the question. So again, it depends what you're trying to measure against, 2020 or 2019. I guess I'll keep it in context to 2019, be specific that there's roughly 50 net new stores in the store fleet compared to 2019 by the time we get the end of 2020. So there's a natural fixed cost element of that, that runs through gross margin, and then there's a variable cost piece of that, right, on payroll for stores and all the signage and other variable costs that it takes to operate a store. So that's embedded in there. 
 A top line that's slightly weaker than 2019 is what our initial outlook is. So that's a big element of it. The service manager recategorization, right, out of gross margin down into SG&A. So it's a help on the gross margin line, but it is a headwind on the SG&A line, but it's an overall win for the company because we're more effective in it. It is plus up on operating margin overall. 
 The investment, I mean, we don't -- we've never shied away from that. I mean, yes, 2019, it's a recovery year. That's how we're looking at it. Makeup is a big part of our business. As Dave and Mary both said, there's a lot of uncertainty on when it will come back. We're optimistic that it will, but there's just a question of timing, and that's a big part of our business. And then there's continuing investments in just all the infrastructure, especially in the digital and IT space, which, again, is a key component to being able to deliver a great omnichannel experience to the guests and to make sure that we're continuing to innovate for the long term and to help drive future growth for the business. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Steve Forbes with Guggenheim Securities. 
Steven Forbes: Let me extend my congratulations as well. Maybe I wanted to sort of focus on the outlook for ad spend. So a quick 2-part here. Scott, you mentioned flat year-over-year. Maybe just tell us, if you can, on what the expense ratio was for 2020. And then more importantly, for maybe all of you, as I think about the reopening opportunity here, right, to drive new customer acquisition, to drive services adoption, right, and maybe reaccelerate those member trends, it just seems like there's a very large opportunity ahead of us. So I'd love to just hear about why not be more aggressive, right, or sort of how you're thinking about overall ad spend, whether it's payback or -- just love to hear just higher level thoughts on how you're sort of viewing this reopening opportunity, right, in terms of customer acquisition vehicle. 
Scott Settersten: Yes. So maybe I can start there. So again, I would just say we're being flexible. Like we were in 2020 when the COVID crisis was on us, we pulled back significantly, especially in area of print and reallocated resources into the digital space, I think, smartly, right, looking at the results of that. So again, this is an area when we talk about EFG, efficiencies for growth, the print -- the whole advertising bucket is another large area of opportunity for us over the long term. And so we continue to look for ways to optimize both print, just the cost of print overall, but also the distribution and the postage and working with our vendor partners on new, better ways to be thinking about how we go to market over the long term. So that's part and parcel of our everyday activities, I guess, I would say. And again, we're thinking it's going to be flattish year-over-year as a percent of sales. So -- but always a work in progress. 
David Kimbell: Yes. And just to reiterate on the -- yes, your points about reopening and guest reengaging in the category. We feel confident in what we're seeing but uncertain about the pace and the return, particularly in our biggest category of makeup. And so we feel, as Mary has said, I think, as Scott has said, we feel the guidance that we have is right, but we're also prepared to adjust. 
 We've -- becoming increased -- 2020 just further enhanced our skills at agility and being prepared to take whatever comes at us. And so we're ready to drive growth and lead the industry and -- but also feel like the guidance that we've given is correct. 
Operator: Our final question comes from the line of Ike Boruchow with Wells Fargo. 
Irwin Boruchow: Congrats to everyone as well. Just 2 quick ones. So Dave, for you, on store productivity, can you talk to us -- I think you were doing around $500 a foot pre-COVID. Can you -- not necessarily this year, but maybe over the next 2 to 3 years, where do you see store productivity kind of normalizing to given the rise in e-com? 
 And to that point, Scott, on the guidance, it seems to imply that e-com sales, you're expecting them to decline year-over-year in dollars based on the mix. Could you maybe give some color about what's embedded on e-com revenue, either first half, back half or full year? Anything would be helpful. 
David Kimbell: Yes. Store productivity, I'm not going to give any specifics right now because we've got a lot to figure out of where things settle out and settle down. Having said that, we remain really committed and positive about the physical store channel for Ulta Beauty and in beauty in general. And so we're watching that closely. We're seeing positive trends as guests are getting reengaged. We know our guests are telling us and then increasingly demonstrating that they want to get back in a physical way, but we know e-com will play a bigger part of it, too. So I imagine that'll be a big part of our discussion in the fall as we kind of talk about a longer-term outlook, but it's a big focus for sure. 
Scott Settersten: Yes. I would just, yes, add on to that exactly. In the fall, we'd have more to share on that with investors. I mean the fact is that the trends in the store, the traffic trends, have been negative now for a while. And so we're going to have to watch how consumers -- how that rebounds here as 2021 plays out and how that fits into the overall digital part of our business and omnichannel equation. 
 As far as the e-com question goes, Ike, so yes, you're on the right track there. We're guiding 20 -- mid-20-ish kind of penetration for the year, which, again, we're not apologizing for based on what we just delivered in 2020. That business is twice the size it was a year ago this time. And the team is ready, and we're ready to scale that up and take advantage of opportunities that are presented to us. And now we're just focused on making sure we take care of the store fleet, the teams that are out there and make sure as customers come back and shop us in brick-and-mortar, that we're delivering a great guest experience and continue to keep them engaged with the brand. 
Mary Dillon: Okay. I think we're done with the questions. Thank you. So I just want to thank everybody for joining us today. 
 The future is really bright for Ulta Beauty. We have a strong and differentiated business model. We're emerging from the 2020 pandemic with good momentum. We're strategically investing in our business to drive further market share gains, and we have strong leadership for the next chapter of growth. I'm really proud of the job that the Ulta Beauty store, distribution center and corporate associates did all year to deliver this amazing but tough year. 
 I remain very excited about the long-term growth opportunity. I'm confident Ulta Beauty will continue to shape and lead the beauty industry. I'm excited about the next chapter ahead for all of us. It's the right time for me personally, the right time for Dave and Kecia and the right time for Ulta Beauty as the team continues to drive growth for many years to come. 
 We look forward to speaking with all of you again in May when we report on our first quarter results. Thank you. 
Operator: This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation. Enjoy the rest of your day.

===== 2020 Q3  (2020-12-03 17:00:00) =====

 We'll begin this afternoon with prepared remarks from Mary and Scott. Following our comments, we'll open the call for questions. [Operator Instructions] As always, Patrick and I will be available for any follow-up questions after the call. 
 Now I'll turn the call over to Mary. Mary? 
Mary Dillon: Thank you, Kiley, and good afternoon, everyone. 
 Today, we reported financial results that reflect the strength of the Ulta Beauty model and improving trends in consumer demand. I continue to be very proud of how well our teams are responding and navigating through this difficult period. And I want to thank all of our Ulta Beauty associates for their continued agility, creativity and commitment to serving our guests and taking care of each other during this unprecedented period. 
 For the third quarter, net sales were $1.6 billion and GAAP diluted EPS was $1.32 per share. Adjusted diluted EPS for the quarter was $1.64 per share. 
 Building on the momentum we saw at the end of the second quarter, third quarter comp store sales declined 8.9%. The mid-single-digit comp declines we experienced in August continued through September, with October sales impacted by our decision not to repeat certain promotional activity from last year. 
 As we discussed on our last earnings call, we're working to optimize promotional events to remain competitive while also improving profitability. In the third quarter, we executed several promotional events that drove strong guest engagement and profitable sales. 
 We launched our first-ever We Love Our Members event to reengage and welcome Ultamate Rewards members back to Ulta Beauty, having completed our phased store reopening process. We rewarded guests with member-only points and services offers and amplified the offers across owned, earned and paid channels to reinforce the value of our rewards program. We successfully executed a more focused 21 Days of Beauty, one of our most strategic events intended to drive mass migration to prestige products. To excite and reengage guests, we accelerated our digital and streaming first approach to support expanded messaging for our compelling beauty steals, newness and exclusive products. 
 We expanded the focus of our Fall Haul event beyond makeup to include key self-care categories while reducing the length of the event to drive greater productivity. And to further elevate our hair authority through our Gorgeous Hair event, we leverage engaging storytelling around healthy hair, color care and black-owned brands. 
 Now turning to our performance by category. We continue to increase our market share across most major prestige beauty categories. Starting with one of our strategic growth categories, skincare delivered positive comp growth driven by newer brands like The Ordinary, TULA and Beekman 1802 as well as existing brands like CeraVe, First Aid Beauty and La Roche-Posay. From our proprietary consumer insights work, we know most beauty enthusiasts are maintaining or expanding their skincare routines as a form of self-care. Increased interest for home skincare treatments as well as newness and innovation in body treatments, face serums and eye creams are driving strong category growth. Leaning into these trends and the opportunity to increase our market share in this category, we continue to expand our assortment while also increasing space and marketing support for this key growth category. 
 Fragrance and bath was our strongest category this quarter, delivering double-digit comp growth, driven by newness, exclusive and unique Ulta Beauty programs. Guests responded well to our fragrance gift with purchase programs as well as our Fragrance Crush program, which highlights a favorite fragrance each month. Sales of fragrance also benefited from our exclusive launch of R.E.M. from Ariana Grande and innovation from established brands like YSL and Marc Jacobs. The bath category continues to deliver strong growth. And this quarter, we introduced newness from brands like Truly, Hempz, Ulta Beauty Collection and Tree Hut.
 Reflecting ongoing DIY beauty and self-care trends, haircare and hairstyling tools also delivered positive comp sales growth this quarter. Within haircare, color continued to deliver strong growth driven by brands like Arctic Fox and Madison Reed. Textured hair brands, Curlsmith and Pattern by Tracee Ellis Ross, also delivered nice growth. Our leader business also continued to perform well, and newness from Dyson and the continued popularity of one-step tools drove strong growth in styling tools this quarter as guests leverage more options to achieve different looks. 
 Makeup continued to be challenged given shifts in consumer behavior and delays in planned newness and innovation. Despite these headwinds, subcategories that focus above the mask continued to perform better, including lashes, brow and eye. Newness, while more limited than last year, continues to be important to guests, with nostalgic themes like Ulta Beauty Harry Potter collection, Makeup Revolution's Nightmare Before Christmas and ColourPop's Hocus Pocus collection, all resonating really well with guests. 
 Although the pandemic has accelerated channel shift, our consumer insights and results continue to confirm that our members prefer to shop in physical stores for beauty even as they have increased their adoption of online shopping. As expected, with stores opened for the full quarter, store traffic trends improved and e-commerce growth moderated from trends we saw in the first half of the year. 
 For the quarter, our e-commerce business delivered sales growth of about 90%. And buy online, pickup in store was strong again this quarter. 
 Turning now to services. Our services business continues to be adversely impacted by COVID-related capacity constraints and local restrictions. At the end of the third quarter, salon and brow services were available in nearly all stores, but we've not resumed skin or makeup services based on ongoing safety concerns. Although trends improved from the second quarter, sales from our services business were down more than 30% in the third quarter primarily due to a decline in transactions. Average ticket was higher, reflecting pent-up demand for cut, color and style services. 
 At the end of the quarter, we had 31.7 million active members in our Ultamate Rewards Program, essentially flat with the second quarter and about 6% lower than the third quarter last year. While we're pleased with our new member acquisition and reengagement trends this quarter, we will continue to focus on reactivation of members who haven't shopped with us since the pandemic began. 
 Now importantly, retention rates among our platinum and diamond members who are most engaged with our brand remain very strong. We continue to see an increase in members shopping with us online. As we've discussed before, omnichannel members are our most engaged and most productive members, historically spending 3x more per year than store-only guests. In the third quarter, omnichannel members were about 22% of the total compared to about 12% in the third quarter last year. 
 As our teams continue to manage the day-to-day operations in the current environment, we're also building the foundation for profitable growth in 2021 and beyond. Specifically, we're focused on 5 strategic priorities to expand our market share gains and extend our competitive advantages. And during the third quarter, we made progress on each of these priorities. 
 Starting with our continued focus on building the capabilities to win in an omnichannel world. We are committed to meeting guests wherever they want to shop. In April, in response to COVID-related constraints, our digital and store teams moved quickly to launch a new curbside pickup option. To make it easier for our guests and our store teams, we have recently enhanced this option with the launch of a curbside customer alert notification. We've refreshed curbside signage and established dedicated Ulta Beauty parking spaces at select stores. We've also expanded our store locator functionality to include greater visibility to store-specific service offerings and separate store and curbside hours. And in the Ulta Beauty app, we now provide store-specific occupancy levels for greater transparency and guest safety. 
 To support our growing e-commerce business, this quarter, we opened our Jacksonville fast fulfillment center, expanded e-commerce operations in our Chambersburg, Greenwood and Dallas distribution centers and expanded our ship-from-store program to 105 stores. These investments have increased our e-commerce shipping capacity and will improve delivery speed to guests. 
 This quarter, we also completed the rollout of our new booking tool for services in the app and on ulta.com. This new digital application enables guests to easily book or reschedule salon, brow and other service appointments. Adoption of the tool continues to increase, and nearly 1/3 of our service appointments were booked through this new tool in the most recent quarter, resulting in more convenience for our guests and more efficiency for our associates. 
 Our second priority is to reimagine how guest experience and discover beauty in the new normal. Product discovery is a hallmark of the beauty shopping experience, and we're welcoming more guests to experience the fun of GLAMlab, our virtual try-on tool. Our store associates have done a great job introducing GLAMlab to guests as a safe alternative to testers in stores, which are currently for display purposes only. To help facilitate even more in-store engagement, we've introduced new QR codes on select shelf strips that take guests directly into the GLAMlab experience, making it even easier for guests to virtually try on products while they're in stores. 
 Building on our successful virtual try-on capabilities, last quarter, we introduced a skin analysis tool, which uses augmented reality technology and artificial intelligence to assess skincare needs and offer personalized product recommendations. This quarter, we enhanced this tool to include new routine recommendations and the ability for guests to save analyses to track changes. In addition to offering guest digital tools, we're also testing one-on-one video consultations across all beauty categories in collaboration with our brand partners and our own services team members. 
 Our third priority is to engage and delight beauty enthusiasts with a curated beauty assortment focused on exclusivity and leading brands. Reflecting the growing importance of clean beauty, in October, we launched Conscious Beauty at Ulta Beauty at all stores and on ulta.com and on our app, and the enthusiasm and feedback from our guests and brand partners has been tremendous. This holistic initiative provides greater transparency to help guests choose brands and products that reflect their personal values and individual needs. 
 Through this initiative, we're certifying brands across 4 key pillars: clean ingredients, cruelty-free, vegan and sustainable packaging, and highlighting participating brands for their positive impact on communities. And today, more than 200 brands are participating in the program, and more than half have been certified in more than 1 pillar. As part of the launch, we established the Conscious Beauty Advisory Council, a coalition of experts at the forefront of clean beauty, product development and packaging sustainability. With the help of our advisory council, we will ensure that Conscious Beauty at Ulta Beauty will continue to evolve and grow as expectations and standards for clean beauty continue to change. 
 In tandem with the launch of Conscious Beauty, we collaborated with Credo Beauty, a pioneer in Clean to introduce the Credo Collection at Ulta Beauty, a curated collection of prestige and masstige brands. Available in select stores and in ulta.com, this collection features 9 clean brands handpicked by the Credo experts across multiple categories, including skincare, haircare and cosmetics. 
 Our fourth priority is to leverage insights from our Ultamate Rewards Program to cultivate brand love and loyalty, deepen guest engagement and increase spend per member. We continue to build content that reflects our brand purpose and drives meaningful connection with our guests. After suspending most of our marketing efforts in the first half of the year while stores were closed, this quarter, we launched Where Dreams Begin, a campaign that reflects the next chapter of our brand journey. Launched across linear television and digital streaming platforms, the work reinforces our brand purpose and celebrates optimism, togetherness, self-care and self-expression in a world increasingly challenged by uncertainty and division. We continue to enhance our ability to create personalized offers and recommendations based on a holistic, data-led understanding of guest preferences and behaviors. This quarter, we increased our use of propensity modeling to help reactivate members, and we continue to strengthen our ability to optimize offers in e-mail and online, enabling us to maximize the return on select promotions. 
 Our fifth and final strategic priority is to drive holistic cost optimization. We continue to work to create a more cost-efficient store labor model. As we discussed on the last earnings call, we made the difficult decision to eliminate 2 store leadership roles, the salon manager and the prestige manager, and created a new service manager role responsible for services, events and prestige retail. Effective November 1, this new structure creates a stronger linkage between services and products. 
 This quarter, we also made another difficult decision to suspend our expansion to Canada. This was not an easy decision to make and in no way reflects a lack of confidence in the international growth opportunity for Ulta Beauty. Our teams work diligently to position us for a successful entry into Canada next year, and I'm proud of what they accomplished in such a short period of time. However, after much consideration, we determined that prioritizing our efforts to strengthen and grow our U.S. operations must be our top priority in the current operating environment. 
 So these are just a few of the examples we've taken to adjust our model to reflect the challenges and opportunities we see today. We've also maintained significant limitations on corporate hiring and controllable expenses, and we continue to look across the enterprise for additional ways we can optimize our cost structure while also investing in new capabilities to support future growth. 
 We've made a lot of progress in pursuit of our strategic priorities, which positions us to drive continued market share growth in the fourth quarter and beyond. 
 Certainly, 2020 has been a year like no other, and it's difficult to predict exactly what the holiday season will bring this year. With Shop Safe Standards in all stores and enhanced digital shopping options, our teams are ready to meet our guests wherever and however they want to shop with us this holiday season. 
 We're encouraged by the sales trends we've seen so far in the quarter, but uncertainty remains as we navigate ongoing disruption from a resurgence in the virus and continued economic uncertainty. As we execute through this holiday season, our top priorities are to reengage existing members and capture new guests with relevant content, compelling offers and unique products, and also to deliver engaging omnichannel experiences. 
 Ulta Beauty is well positioned for this gift-giving season as consumers seek moments of joy, connection and self-care. Our holiday campaign is focused on helping guests see the joy this holiday season. Leveraging influencers from our Ulta Beauty Collective, we're sharing ways to practice self-care. We're celebrating community and relationships with gifting ideas, and we're highlighting the magic and generosity of the season. We kicked off the holiday season at the beginning of November with the distribution of our holiday print magazine, a reimagining of our holiday offers and multiple member appreciation events. 
 Building on newness and exclusives introduced earlier this year, we've launched several new brands just in time for holiday season. In skincare, we're excited to launch Alicia Keys' new brand, Keys Soulcare, exclusively at Ulta Beauty, with a limited selection of products for the holiday season. The full assortment will be available in early 2021. In makeup, we're excited to welcome HOURGLASS, a cruelty-free luxury beauty brand to the Ulta Beauty family. And while we offer Chanel fragrances in stores, we're excited to announce we've recently launched Chanel fragrances on ulta.com for holiday gifting and beyond. 
 To help our guests give the best gifts this year, we have introduced a new digital gift guide, including a 3-step quiz to inspire and help find the perfect gift. And for those who prefer to give gift cards, we've expanded our designs to include more inclusive options, and we've expanded our distribution in third-party outlets as well for added guest convenience. 
 In anticipation that more guests will utilize digital channels this season, we've made curbside and BOPIS pickup easier than ever. These enhancements, combined with the investments we've made to increase our ship-to-home capacity, position us well to deliver a great omnichannel experience this holiday season. 
 The operating environment continues to be dynamic and challenging. As COVID-19 prevalence increases, so are market-specific government restrictions, resulting in some reductions in operating hours, limitations on in-store capacity and, in some cases, mandated store closures. Our priority is to ensure the safety and well-being of our associates, guests and brand partners, and we'll continue to monitor the situation closely and adjust our operations as needed. 
 Now before I turn the call over to Scott, I want to highlight the exciting new partnership I'm sure you've all read about. In 2021, Ulta Beauty will partner with another powerhouse retailer, Target Corporation, to disrupt the retail industry and redefine how guests experience beauty. Next fall, we'll introduce Ulta Beauty at Target, a shop-in-shop experience online and in select Target locations. With 1,000 square feet of space, Ulta Beauty at Target will offer a curated assortment of established, emerging and prestige brands across multiple categories. Our vision is to create an extension of our welcoming Ulta Beauty experience with dedicated Target team members trained to provide elevated service and offer deep product expertise with a dedicated space that inspires trial and discovery. Leaning into the power of our respective loyalty programs, we intend to reward guests with benefits across both programs for all purchases made within the shop. 
 Leveraging a royalty structure, this unique collaboration brings together Ulta Beauty's category authority and brand relationships with Target's traffic-driving business model and industry-leading fulfillment services. Together, we will deliver industry-leading guest experiences across multiple touch points, provide the prestige beauty category and participating brands with an unparalleled platform for growth, drive market disruption and capture more market share. For Ulta Beauty, this partnership will build on our strength as the nation's largest beauty retailer, bring our beauty authority to life in a new way and create additional touch points for millions of loyal and new guests to discover and engage with Ulta Beauty, ultimately leading to more members as well as greater spend per member. 
 Expanding our omnichannel capabilities to more deeply connect with guests is a strategic priority for us. We believe this new channel will create more opportunity to drive demand for the full beauty experience for discovery, services and play available in all Ulta Beauty stores. Importantly, we'll be able to leverage our robust CRM capabilities to engage guests who shop Ulta Beauty at Target with targeted personalized communications to highlight and enhance their total Ulta Beauty experience. 
 In closing, we know guests are changing how they shop for beauty, but their engagement with the category remains strong. In fact, the role of beauty is more important now than ever. In this new normal, beauty has become more than makeup, more than product. Today, beauty is a critical link to acts of self-care and wellness. And as a well-loved brand with a diverse assortment and a wide range of price points, outstanding service offerings and knowledgeable and passionate associates, Ulta Beauty is well positioned to lead and shape how guests experience beauty in this new normal. 
 And now I'll turn the call over to Scott for a discussion of the financial results. Scott? 
Scott Settersten: Thanks, Mary, and good afternoon, everyone. 
 We appreciate your support of Ulta Beauty and hope you and your loved ones are staying safe and healthy. I will reiterate Mary's comments and thank all of our dedicated associates for their tireless efforts in safely serving our guests and keeping our operations running smoothly during this difficult time. 
 I'll begin with the income statement. Net sales for the quarter declined 7.8%, and total company comp declined 8.9%. Given the challenges from the COVID-19 pandemic, we are very pleased with this performance as top line results for the quarter were better than our internal expectations. 
 Average ticket increased 7.6%, primarily driven by an increase in units per transaction, while transactions declined 15.4%. We experienced nice conversion in both channels but continued to be impacted by softer traffic to stores. 
 As expected, e-commerce growth slowed relative to the second quarter but continued to deliver very strong growth versus last year. Our e-commerce operations delivered a comp increase of 90% for the quarter as guests continue to take advantage of our omnichannel capabilities. Buy online, pickup in store was strong again this quarter, totaling about 16% of e-commerce sales, approximately double the penetration in the third quarter last year. 
 From a mix perspective, makeup was 45% of sales, down 600 basis points from last year. Skincare, bath and fragrance collectively increased 500 basis points to 26% of sales. Haircare products and styling tools increased 300 basis points to 21% of sales, while the services category was down 200 basis points to about 4% of sales. 
 As Mary indicated, our service business continued to be negatively impacted by COVID-related capacity constraints. 
 Gross profit margin was 35.1%, a decline of about 200 basis points compared to 37.1% a year ago. Similar to what we have seen since the onset of the pandemic, the largest driver of gross margin deleverage was fixed cost due to lower sales. I would note that the trend improved from what we experienced in the second quarter due to the stronger sales trend. Channel shift was also a large contributor to gross margin deleverage again this quarter, albeit less than we experienced in the second quarter as stores were open for the entire quarter. These headwinds were partially offset by an increase in merchandise margin, which was primarily driven by our lower promotional activity as well as continuing benefits from our efficiencies for growth or EFG efforts. 
 SG&A expenses decreased to $416.4 million compared to $449.2 million in the third quarter of last year. The largest driver of the decrease was lower store payroll and benefits as we reduced investments in labor to reflect lower demand. Store expenses were also lower as we adjusted and managed to softer traffic in stores. 
 Marketing expense was also lower year-over-year, reflecting reduced spend on print, offset by higher investment in digital channels. These reductions more than offset a modest increase in corporate overhead and PPE and COVID-related expenses. The increase in corporate overhead primarily reflects higher compensation and benefit expense partially offset by investments to support strategic growth initiatives made last year. 
 As a reminder, in the third quarter of last year, incentive compensation expense decreased versus the prior year, reflecting financial performance that was below targeted levels as well as a lower stock price. 
 This quarter, we recorded a charge of $23.6 million for impairment, restructuring and other costs. As Mary mentioned earlier, we suspended our planned expansion to Canada, resulting in a $15.9 million charge related to long-lived asset impairments, lease termination costs and severance. Our teams continue to wind down this effort, and we now expect to incur between $30 million to $40 million of Canada exit expenses in fiscal 2020. 
 In the third quarter, we also recorded $5.7 million in severance associated with the elimination of the salon manager and prestige manager roles and recorded $2 million of lease termination costs related to the previously announced permanent closure of 19 stores. 
 Preopening expense was $4.2 million in the quarter, a decrease from $6.5 million a year ago. We resumed new store openings in early August and opened 17 stores in the third quarter compared to 31 new stores a year ago. Interest expense related to the drawdown of our revolver totaled $1.4 million compared to interest income of $900,000 a year ago. 
 Diluted GAAP earnings per share was $1.32 compared with $2.25 reported for last year's third quarter. Adjusted diluted earnings per share, excluding charges related to impairment, restructuring and other costs, was $1.64 compared to $2.23 a year ago, which excludes stock compensation and other tax credits. 
 Moving on to the balance sheet and cash flow. For the quarter, total inventory decreased 11% compared to the third quarter last year, and inventory per store decreased 12.5% year-over-year as we adjusted to recent demand trends and reduced holiday receipts. To maintain flexibility and manage inventory risk, we have reduced our exposure to limited edition holiday sets and are leaning more into core product. We ended the quarter with $560.9 million in cash and cash equivalents. 
 At the beginning of the pandemic, we drew down $800 million on our $1 billion revolver and suspended our stock buyback program as precautionary measures to increase liquidity. Reflecting on our confidence that we have sufficient liquidity to support our operations and investment priorities, we repaid $800 million of borrowings that were outstanding under the facility on September 2. We remain confident in our ability to generate strong cash flow, and we may resume our stock buyback program this quarter, depending on market and operating conditions. We currently have $1.58 billion remaining under our current repurchase authorization. 
 Turning now to the rest of 2020. The overall operating environment remains uncertain, and it continues to be difficult to forecast our business with precision. Therefore, we are not providing EPS guidance at this time. However, I want to provide some color on how we are thinking about the fourth quarter. 
 We are encouraged by the sales results for November. However, the operating environment continues to be dynamic, and it is difficult to predict how the effects of the pandemic, including any lockdowns or restrictions, may impact consumer demand through the rest of the quarter. As such, we now expect our fourth quarter comps to be in the range of down 12% to 14%, slightly better than the expectation of mid-teen comp declines we shared on our last earnings call. 
 Two callouts as you think about your models. As Mary shared, we have realigned our store management structure to create a more cost-efficient store model. As a result of these changes, we will see a reduction of salon payroll and cost of goods sold and an increase in store payroll and SG&A relative to last year. Second, we expect to incur $15 million to $20 million of PPE and COVID-related expenses in the fourth quarter. Overall, we expect SG&A dollars in the fourth quarter will be similar to last year's levels. 
 We continue to adjust our capital spending plan. Our updated plan for 2020 is to invest between $150 million and $160 million in capital expenditures, including approximately $65 million for new stores, remodels and merchandise fixtures, $65 million for supply chain and IT, and about $25 million for store maintenance and other. We expect to open approximately 30 new stores and relocate 5 stores in 2020. We are still finalizing our plans for next year but continue to expect to open at least 30 new stores in 2021. We remain confident in the long-term opportunity to continue to expand our store fleet. 
 One final comment. We recognize that our long-term profitability potential is top of mind with investors, and I want to take this opportunity to reiterate our confidence that Ulta Beauty is a double-digit margin business. However, given the uncertainty and lack of visibility as to when the operating environment will stabilize and recover from the pandemic, it is difficult to say with certainty when we will return to double-digit margins. 
 To start, we have healthy product margins, and our merchant teams continue to work to improve merchandise margins as we expand and enhance our assortment through both negotiation efforts as well as EFG opportunities. As sales stabilize and return to growth, we'll be able to leverage fixed costs. In addition to our ongoing EFG efforts, our real estate team is capturing significant benefits from lease renegotiation efforts, reflecting the market impacts of COVID-19, and these efforts will help us reduce occupancy costs over the longer term. 
 Although e-commerce will likely continue to be a headwind to overall EBIT margins, we are improving e-commerce profitability as we increase utilization of BOPIS, leverage size and scale with growth and get closer to our guests through the expansion of our supply chain network. And we see additional opportunities to mitigate rate impacts in the future. 
 As we discussed on our last earnings call, we continue to make progress on our journey to strengthen the effectiveness and profitability of our promotions. And we are actively taking steps in the near term to rightsize our cost structure in the new operating environment. Longer term, we are also working to identify additional opportunities across the enterprise to optimize our cost structure while also supporting investment to support growth capabilities. 
 And now I'll turn the call back over to the operator to moderate the Q&A session. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Erinn Murphy with Piper Sandler. 
Erinn Murphy: My question, Mary, is for you on the Target partnership. I was hoping you could talk a little bit more about the brand production process and the inventory buying process between both Target as well as Ulta, and then how do you intend to integrate the Ulta Rewards Program at Target from a technology perspective? 
Mary Dillon: Great. Thank you. Well, let me just start about the fact by reiterating we're very, very excited about the partnership. We've got a strong business model and track record to start with and feel very confident about our long-term growth prospects. And of course, we're really thrilled to unlock even more excitement for guests and growth with our Target partnership. 
 Just to recap, we're thrilled. It's an amazing retailer. Brian Cornell is a fantastic CEO, and they've got a fantastic team. These are 2 very strong retail brands that are loved by consumers. And the concept of Ulta Beauty inside Target, 9 out of 10 people loved it, complementary brand DNA and team DNA. And of course, I think we both bring very different strengths to the equation from Ulta. It's our beauty authority, our best-in-class understanding of the beauty category, and for Target, certainly, the scale of Target and the millions of guests that will discover Ulta Beauty at Target is a huge benefit for us as well, as well as their omnichannel capabilities. 
 As we think about bringing this forward, I think our brand -- we're early in the process with our brand negotiations and discussions. It's a lot of positive, a lot of enthusiasm. I think as a category and for brands, it's a great new platform for growth and for new customers, millions of new customers who discover brands. And so we feel very optimistic about that. Target will own the inventory. And that -- I think we've talked about that publicly. So that's what we really own the brand relationships, and that's part of the partnership that we developed from the start. 
 Early on in terms of integration of technology, but certainly a very important part of this is that our -- is that the customers that participate in the Ulta Beauty at Target will be able to earn -- will be able to sign up if they're not currently members in Ultamate Rewards. If they're Ultamate Rewards members, earn loyalty points as well as Target loyalty points. And then for Ultamate Rewards, redeem those at Ulta Beauty. So we think that's a critical part as we think about the way to really create a flywheel here that works -- creates a win, win, win, I'd say, for guests and for Ulta Beauty and for Target. 
Operator: Our next question is from Joe Altobello with Raymond James. 
Joseph Altobello: So first question, in terms of the experience that you guys had in October, you mentioned comps were down mid-singles in August, September and saw a little bit of a down draft in October given the fact that you guys didn't repeat a promotion you did last year. Was that different from what you expected? And I'm curious, did it cause you guys to rethink your promotion strategy as we head into the holiday season? 
Mary Dillon: Yes. I would say it's not -- wasn't a surprise. I mean we made a very specific decision to pull back some level of promotion. And adjusted without the promotion, of course, the comps are even stronger. So we think it's an important step, and just continuing to refine our promotion strategies to make them be as ultimately profitable as possible, but it's not a pullback on our ability to be very competitive. So the holiday season, we started early because we needed to get people to start early in November, right, given the capacity constraints. And we've got a very robust program throughout the holiday season that we think is very competitive. And so far, as I said in the script, we feel good about the results that we're seeing. So I think it played out exactly as we had expected. 
Joseph Altobello: And in terms of the guide for Q4, you mentioned the comp down 12% to 14%. It does sound like November was off to a fairly decent start. So maybe help us understand why you're assuming a pretty significant slowdown in December. 
Mary Dillon: Yes. Well, stepping back, again, we're pleased with the momentum that we're seeing, and the demand signals are strong. And we did feel good about how we started in November. It's a pretty simple answer to your question. We're in the middle of this unprecedented pandemic. And as you know, we just reached peak levels of hospitalizations yesterday in the U.S. So it's uncertain. 
 Certainly, we know we're set up well. Our e-commerce business is performing extremely well. Our stores are doing a great job. But there's uncertainty about what will happen, I guess, I'd say as we get closer to the holiday in terms of store traffic, and that would be true for everybody. So we're just trying to meet the guests where they are, be pragmatic about this. Certainly, the news about the vaccine is positive, but there's many difficult weeks ahead. So we feel good, but we're also being cautious about the uncertainty that's going to, we think, play out in the next several weeks and few months. 
Operator: Our next question is from Oliver Chen from Cowen. 
Oliver Chen: The e-commerce growth continues to be outstanding, but it decelerated from prior amazing quarters. So what are you seeing there in terms of category performance? And what's happened in different areas of growth in that business? I would also just love more details on Ultamate Rewards in that member count and how that may trend and what's under your control in terms of keeping the member count at or above 31.7 million. 
Mary Dillon: Sure. Well, Oliver, that's a 3-pronged question. That's impressive. And I'll -- maybe Dave and I will tag team a little bit. E-commerce traffic and comp, we -- we're very pleased with how that's going, and in fact, expected it to moderate somewhat as we open up stores. And that -- we like that. It's -- obviously, as people are coming back to stores, historically, what we've seen is omnichannel guests are our best guests because they add the e-commerce purchase on top and really spend 3x as much as somebody who is store-only. So as we open up stores, expected to see some moderation of e-commerce demand, but it's still up 90% last quarter. So we feel very good about that. 
 In terms of -- I think the second part of your question was about category performance on e-com, which Dave will be happy to take, and then we can just get into Ultamate Rewards at the end of the 3-pronged question. 
David Kimbell: Yes. Oliver, category performance on e-com really mirrors the total company performance that we highlighted in the script. So strength across skincare, haircare, bath, fragrance, exceptionally strong and continued challenges although some bright spots in makeup. So nothing different about our e-commerce business versus our store from a category standpoint with real strength and growth coming outside of the makeup category. So we're pleased with that. 
 As it relates to the -- our loyalty program, I'll just start with saying we are really -- remain incredibly proud of what we believe is one of the best loyalty programs in all of retail. And even with some of the challenges we faced this year, we know our guests continue to love the program. They're highly engaged in that program. Our brand partners continue to find a lot of value through the access and the insights that they get by engaging in that program. Our elite guests, our diamond and platinum guests are still highly engaged. It is working at a very high level, and we're really glad that we -- we've always been glad to have it, and we certainly have been happy to have that as part of our arsenal this year as we face this unprecedented times. 
 But yes, we did see a decline this year, primarily due to store closures. That hurts our new member conversion, and it also impacts retention because, as you know, while our e-commerce business is growing, and we have a significant increase in penetration of our member base at our e-commerce, it's still a majority store-based user loyalty program. And some of those guests, particularly the least engaged, the non-elite guests, we have seen a bit of a hit on retention with those least tenured guests. 
 Importantly, as I think Mary mentioned in the script, our retention with our most tenured guests, the platinum and diamond, remains very strong, and we're seeing a lot of strong performance in that. So with nearly 32 million members, we're -- we feel like it's still very strong, and we're focused on reactivating guests, continuing to drive strong engagement with our engaged guests and those elite guests. But as a reminder, we do calculate loyalty -- the number of our loyalty program over rolling 12 months. And so as each month goes by, we're still lapping a pre-COVID period through this -- through the next several months. So we're working hard to reengage our guests, but we'll continue to be lapping a period where we weren't facing the challenges, particularly in our store fleet. So we're anticipating some challenges with our less tenured guests for a little while but focused on retaining them and seeing strength as we emerge out of this in 2021. 
Operator: Our next question is from Rupesh Parikh from Oppenheimer. 
Rupesh Parikh: So I guess, Scott, just going back to some of the commentary that you provided for guidance for Q4. I was curious if you can provide maybe the puts and takes for gross margins. And then related to that, I just want to get a sense of what you guys are seeing right now in the promotional environment during the holiday season. 
Scott Settersten: All right. Thanks, Rupesh. So first, I think with fourth quarter, it's important to keep in mind what the sales guidance is. So again, we expect a softer top line in Q4 versus Q3. Again, that's compared to last year's trends, right? So that comes with inherent margin pressure, generally speaking. 
 We anticipate gross margin to leverage in Q4 similar to Q3 levels, with many of the same drivers that we've seen through the last couple of quarters primarily deleverage of fixed cost in the stores and across the supply chain, on lower sales volumes. And then this -- we can have some nice offsets with improving merchandise margins similar to what we saw in Q3. 
 I guess as long as I'm talking about margins, I'll just pivot over to SG&A as well. Just as a reminder, we've made some comments in the call about the shift in the payroll, right, from -- related to the services manager going from cost of goods sold down to SG&A. So that's something to keep in mind as you update your model and just a little bit more color there. So we expect -- in SG&A, we do expect more deleverage in Q4 versus Q3, with the pressure being from store payroll and benefits as we ramp up store labor again and make sure we deliver excellent guest experience during the holiday season and then some increasing store expenses primarily due to the COVID and PPE-related costs. 
 Lastly there, I'd say on the advertising or marketing side, there was a shift. We talked about this earlier in the year. So marketing is going to be heavier in the fourth quarter as we go into holiday. We view that as opportunistic spend versus what we saw earlier in the year. 
David Kimbell: Then on your promotional question for the holidays, of course, as we've talked about before, holiday is always a very promotional time frame for every retailer. And we see it as not just competing against other beauty retailers, but really other categories as well as we're competing for the gift-giving occasions. So naturally, we see an increase in promotionality. We also, as Mary mentioned, have -- we've pulled up our promotions and changed the cadence a bit, and we're seeing that across the category as well as more effort to spread promotional activity around, to give guests more opportunities to feel more comfortable shopping both in store and online to manage their gift-giving and personal occasions. 
 Overall, we see it as competitive. We've seen some competitors be a bit more promotional. We've seen brands a bit more aggressive in some limited time offers, in their DTC. I wouldn't classify that as a dramatic or radical shift in promotionality. And as always, we're watching the market very closely. We've got great tools in place. We feel like the efforts we've implemented so far this holiday season this quarter have been effective. And we're confident in the promotional plans that we have, both leading up through the rest of Christmas and then post holiday as well. So feel good about the position and certainly managing and monitoring it on a daily basis. 
Scott Settersten: And Rupesh, I just want to clarify, I did mean deleverage. So gross margin deleverage in Q4 versus Q3, same with SG&A. 
Operator: Our next question is from Simeon Siegel with BMO Capital Markets. 
Simeon Siegel: Maybe a little higher level. Mary or Dave, I get pandemic might be a weird time to ask this, but how are you thinking about where you are in terms of the target -- your target customer share of wallet versus where you've told us historically? And then maybe any views you have on how the selling landscape might change post pandemic? So just thinking about potentially shrinking department stores but growing online beauty, maybe DTC brands, big box, et cetera. Just any of the changes you're seeing there. And then, Scott, did you say what you expect to save from Canada next year? 
Mary Dillon: Okay. Thank you. It's another 3-pronged question. Starting with the broader environment, I would say, we are always in a strategic planning mode, right? Looking around the corners, thinking about the future, looking at what's happening with consumer behavior, channel behavior, competitive behavior. There's no question about that. The pandemic has accelerated many things that were on the horizon anyways and certainly increased e-commerce shopping, no surprise, disruption in some physical shopping, which is coming back. And we think there's a bit of a shakeout -- maybe accelerated shakeout in terms of who the winners and losers will be long term in terms of retail format. 
 So part of what we -- a big part of what we do is think about how can we meet guests in new ways and new channels, new formats to meet them where they're going to be. And that has been a strategy for us already, which is increasing our omnichannel capabilities. So whether it's BOPIS, curbside, e-commerce, shipping capacity, digital tools, but we certainly -- that's another great opportunity for us with the Target partnership is to really disrupt at a time that there is disruption happening and accelerate the opportunities for us to drive growth through accessing new customers in new omnichannel ways. 
 So D2C brand, certainly, there's strength in that segment as well. We think overall, e-commerce will be bigger than it would have been, it's been pulled forward. I think we all know that. But we see that our customer in this category also still really wants the in-store shopping experience. And so that's kind of exciting for us as we are always thinking about what that store of the future and experience of the future would look like. 
 And frankly, I'm very happy that we had digital tools available like GLAMlab to immediately pivot to virtual try-on for makeup and now skincare in a way that is very helpful right now. So I think we're well positioned given the shifts. I don't think the shifts are done. I think we just have to assume that we have to continue to look around corners for new shifts and opportunities. Share of wallet, do you want to take that? 
David Kimbell: Yes. I'd just say certainly, it's, as you said in your question, a really disrupted time to try to measure consumer dynamics. And so we're watching closely on share of wallet. What we do know is we continue to gain share, and we talked about this, I think, in previous calls and discussions, gaining share on the prestige side, we're across categories within prestige, makeup, skincare, haircare. We've seen that consistently. 
 As we talked in previous calls, we lost -- we feel like we lost some share as our stores were shut earlier in the pandemic in the mass side, and our mass competitors remained open, which would imply a bit of a short-term hit on share of wallet, but we're seeing that business strengthen and perform really well in Q3. And so confident in that. So we're going to wait for the dust to fully settle on 2020 to really assess the impact of share of wallet. What we do know is we came into this pandemic with real momentum and strength across categories and price points, gaining share, gaining share of wallet, gaining customer growth. There's been disruption, but we think our model, as Mary said, is quite strong. We think we're very well positioned to accelerate out of this and continue the path of driving growth and share across all dimensions. 
Scott Settersten: And then finally, on the Canada piece, we haven't really quantified any element of the Canadian expansion plans here over the last couple of years we've been talking about this. So suffice it to say, it's a start-up investment like a lot of other things, and there's typically some deleverage that comes along with that during their early phases. That wasn't -- so we will avoid that next year, obviously, by not moving ahead with that. But back to Mary's comments, that's not the reason why we stepped away from that. I mean it was just a question of what were the highest priorities and where should we be focusing our efforts in light of all the disruption we're dealing with these days. 
Operator: And our last question would be from Mark Altschwager with Baird. 
Mark Altschwager: Great. I guess a 2-pronged one related to stores. Maybe just first is, with respect to the store opening plans, you mentioned at least 30 next year, what are the factors you're considering today that would most impact the final plan for 2021? And is there a scenario where you could get back to something closer to the prior cadence? And then the second part, just related to Target. From a store perspective, I mean, if that partnership is successful, does it change your view on the longer-term store target for Ulta? 
Scott Settersten: Yes. So I guess maybe I'll go to the last piece of that first. So no, it doesn't change our outlook really on that range that we've been talking about and reaffirming over the last few years. So 1,500 to 1,700 stores in the U.S. We still feel comfortable that that's very doable range even with the new Target announcement here recently. So as you can well imagine, real estate being one of our core competencies, this has been on the front burner, just thinking about the impact to store growth in the future and how -- what changes this might drive us to. So we don't see any big pendulum swing with respect to that, although that's something we'll keep our eyes on, right, as we move down the pathway with the Target team. 
 And so as far as next year, the cadence, so yes, at least 30 stores, markets partly related to our ability to work with our landlord partners. I mean you know a lot of these leases we're working years in advance, right? So there are signed leases and commitments to move forward with certain projects. So again, we're relooking at all of those, all the signed agreements that we have and all the others that are in the queue, just to make sure we're making good decisions and going with the best of the best kind of locations that we feel very confident in. So it's a thoughtful process, but we feel like we've got really great capabilities there analytically, and our real estate team is best in class. So we feel confident in the future. 
Mary Dillon: I'm just going to add one thing to Scott's answer, which is on top of it, the way that we thought about the Target partnership, I'd say, is really an amplifier to our business model. As Scott said, we believe we can still build out the number of stores that we've mapped out. And this yet gives us yet another point of distribution, a way to reach millions of new guests with a trial and discovery version of Ulta Beauty, right, that we amplify back to the Ulta Beauty full business model as well. And so as we map out the future of those locations, plus our store locations, working in partnership with Target to make this a win for everybody. 
Operator: And we have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back over to Mary Dillon for closing remarks. 
Mary Dillon: Thank you for joining us today. I'd like to close by thanking all of the Ulta Beauty associates across our stores, distribution centers and offices for their truly relentless effort to navigate through this challenging environment while also working hard to get our stores, website and DCs ready for the holiday season. We know this holiday season will be like no other, but our team is ready and excited to help our guests see the joy of the season. And we hope that you, your colleagues and your loved ones stay safe and healthy. We look forward to speaking to all of you again in March when we report our fourth quarter and full year results. Thank you. 
Operator: This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.

===== 2020 Q2  (2020-08-27 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Greetings, and welcome to the Ulta Beauty Second Quarter 2020 Earnings Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. 
 It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Ms. Kiley Rawlins, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please proceed. 
Kiley Rawlins: Thank you, Diego. 
 Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today for our discussion of Ulta Beauty's results for the second quarter of fiscal 2020. Hosting today's call are Mary Dillon, Chief Executive Officer; and Scott Settersten, Chief Financial Officer. Dave Kimbell, President, will join us for the Q&A session.

The statements contained in this conference call, which are not historical facts, may be deemed to constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual future results may differ materially from those projected in such statements due to a number of risks and uncertainties, all of which are described in the company's filings with the SEC.

We have no obligation to update or revise our forward-looking statements, except as required by law, and you should not expect us to do so. 
 In today's comments, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted diluted EPS, which has been presented to reflect our view of our ongoing operations by adjusting for store impairment charges and costs associated with the permanent closure of 19 stores. A reconciliation of these measures to the corresponding GAAP measures can be found in our earnings release, which is available on the Investor Relations section of our website at www.ulta.com. 
 We'll begin this afternoon with prepared remarks from Mary and Scott. Following our prepared comments, we'll open the call up for questions. [Operator Instructions] 
 As always, the IR team will be available for any follow-up questions after the call. 
 Now I'd like to turn the call over to Mary. Mary? 
Mary Dillon: Thank you, Kylie, and good after afternoon, everyone. 
 Let's start with an overview of where we are today. First, I will say that since the beginning of the pandemic, we've navigated through the crisis with our associate and guests at the center of every decision made. I'm really proud of how our teams have responded through this challenging period and I want to thank my leadership team and all of our Ulta Beauty associates, especially our store and distribution center associates for their agility, creativity and commitment to serving our guests and taking care of each other during this unprecedented period. 
 On our last earnings call, we were in the early stages of our reopening process. During the second order, we reopened stores for retail, expanded curbside capabilities to nearly all stores and began relaunching select services, all with a thoughtful consideration for the safety of our associates and guests, balanced with our desire to reopen quickly. By the end of June, more than 90% of our stores were open for retail. And by mid-July, our reopening process was complete. 
 Reflecting local regulations and guidance, the resumption of our service offerings has been on a more and more measured pace. Today, salon services are available in about 88% of stores and brow services are offered in about 85% of the fleet. We've not resumed skin or makeup services, but we're working closely with medical experts to ensure we have strong safety protocols in place when it's appropriate to resume these services. 
 In this new normal, we're operating Ulta Beauty stores with new shop safe standards, limited physical capacity to accommodate social distancing and reduced operating hours. To date, we have reactivated approximately 17,000 of our furloughed associates who are able to return to work. We're committed to maintaining a safe experience for our associates and our guests. As different markets manage fluctuating COVID-19 cases, we will continue to monitor guidance from government and health authorities, as well as local transmission levels to determine if we need to modify our shopping options or revert to closures in the near term. 
 Now turning to our second quarter results. For the second quarter, total net sales were $1.2 billion, comp sales declined 26.7% and GAAP diluted EPS was $0.14 per share. Excluding the impact of impairment charges and costs associated with the previously announced store closures, adjusted diluted EPS was $0.73 per share. 
 Comp sales improved significantly throughout the quarter from down 37% in early May, as we began reopening stores, to down only 10% in July after most of the stores have reopened. Sales trends have continued to improve, with comps down in the mid single-digit range for the first 3 weeks of August. We're excited about the positive signals we're seeing from guests. However, we believe it will take some time to fully return to pre-COVID levels and expect demand will continue to be suppressed for the rest of the year given the likely ongoing disruptions, we'll see as we continue to live with the realities of COVID-19, whether the continuation of working from home, managing the complexities of educating our children, the ongoing need for social distancing, mask wearing and need to avoid large gatherings, or coping with near-term employment and economic uncertainties. 
 Longer term, we're confident beauty will recover and thrive given the strong emotional connection consumers have with the category. We know beauty enthusiasts remain passionate in and about Beauty and Ulta Beauty. We see it through the engagement in our social channels. And while the connection with Beauty has not diminished, how consumers engage with the category is changing. Health and safety concerns have led to fewer physical shopping trips but higher average ticket. And while we've seen greater adoption of online shopping, we're really encouraged to see guests coming back to stores as well. 
 From a channel perspective, e-commerce achieved record growth in the quarter, delivering sales growth in excess of 200%. Curbside pickup and buy online pickup in some store were very strong during the quarter, totaling about 20% of total e-commerce orders as guests embrace this limited touch beauty-to-go option. Despite reducing advertising and promotional activity during the quarter, we maintained our unaided awareness in the mid-50% range and increased our aided awareness to 94%, and  are focused on driving meaningful connection with our guests through relevant content and inspirational brand messaging through our digital and social channels is having an impact. Our brand health is very strong with improvements in consideration, connection, integrity and advocacy, reflecting our response to the safety and social concerns of our guests. Building our brand affinity during this tumultuous time will continue to pay dividends over the long-term. 
 Now turning to our performance by category. During the second quarter, we increased our market share across most major prestige beauty categories, and we saw an improving trend in our share of mass beauty as we reopened stores. Reflecting our pace reopening process, comp sales declined across all major categories for the full quarter. As stores reopened, sales trends improved with skincare, fragrance, bath and PCA, delivering double-digit comp growth in July. 
 The makeup category continues to be challenged due to shifts in consumer behavior and limited newness and innovation in the category. Even with these headwinds, some subcategories of makeup performed better than others including lashes, brow and eye. Sales and services decreased for the quarter, reflecting our measured reactivation of hair and brow services and limited capacity due to social distancing. As sales -- as salons reopened, we saw significant increases in average ticket driven by pent-up demand, particularly for color and texture services. Importantly, we're seeing some strong double-digit growth in rebooking rates as our stylists deliver a safe and enjoyable experience and proactively focused on scheduling future visits. 
 The number of active members in our ultimate rewards loyalty program decreased by 4% compared to the second quarter of last year to 31.9 million members. As a reminder, active members are members who have shopped with us at least once in the last 12 months. During the quarter, we saw modest growth in our diamond and platinum membership levels, however, new member growth and retention rates were pressured due to store closures and lower levels of marketing and promotional activity. New member acquisitions through our digital channels continue to expand at healthy rates, and we continue to see previously in-store only members engage with us online with greater frequency. 
 Omnichannel members are our most engaged and most productive members, historically spending 3x more per year than store-only guests. So we're pleased to see that omnichannel guests grew to 21% of our members in the second quarter, nearly double the penetration in the same quarter last year. And online-only members represented 7.5% of our members, 2.5x the penetration last year. 
 With our fleet open and trends improving, we're shifting our attention to strengthening the business in this new normal and expanding our market share in the second half of the year while also setting the foundation for profitable growth in 2021 and beyond. On the last earnings call, we introduced 5 strategic priorities where we're accelerating efforts to expand our market share gains and extend our competitive advantages. I'd like to give you an update on our progress in each of these areas. 
 But first, I'd like to share our perspective on racial equality, inclusion and diversity. As a priority and a value, this is not new for us. But certainly our focus has been sharpened and elevated by the recent awakening in our country to the forces of systemic racism and the important dialogue and actions that have resulted. At Ulta Beauty, diversity and inclusion have always been core values, an important part of who we are. 
 In the 7 years I've been CEO, we have worked hard to represent the wonderful diversity of our country and how we show up as a brand and as a retailer in everything we do, from our marketing communications to our brand partnerships and our team. I'm proud that our Board is 18% black and more than half are women. Our executive team is 13% black and 50% women. And our Ulta Beauty team overall includes 47% people of color and 92% of our associates are women. That said, there is still much more to do. 
 Today, more than ever, we're working to accelerate our leadership ship in this space. We're using our social channels to amplify black voices and beauty, and we're working to grow our roster of black-owned brands. We recognize this as a journey, but we're firmly committed to creating an inclusive experience for our guests, building a diverse representative workforce and serving as an authentic leader of diversity and inclusion in corporate America. 
 Let me now recap the progress we're making on our 5 strategic priorities. Our first priority is to expand our omnichannel business to more deeply connect with guests across channels and unlock the potential of our combined physical and digital footprint. This is not a new priority for us. We've been on this journey for several years, and we've made progress. However, the pandemic has accelerated consumer engagement and desire for online and contactless shopping, and we believe our e-commerce penetration will remain meaningfully higher than pre-COVID-19 levels. 
 Our customer insights and member data show many of our members prefer to transact in store where they can discover and interact with products and other beauty enthusiasts. But we also know our members engage online to research, learn and discover new products. As the pandemic has accelerated the adoption of these digital channels, we're expanding our investment in digital innovation with enhancements to the Ulta Beauty app and ulta.com to create more personalized and seamless shopping experiences. We've also continued to enhance and expand our ability to provide members with personalized recommendations based on insights from our loyalty data. 
 Today through the Ulta Beauty app and on ulta.com, we provide members with unique recommendation across a variety of experiences including new products, products based on category preferences, reminders for replenishment or handpicked items, all powered by our internal AI platform. We also recently launched app-only offers and exclusive ships to drive member app engagement, and we've introduced sponsored ads to allow our brand partners to influence specific product placements. 
 We continue to drive innovation to make it easier for guests to shop with Ulta Beauty. In July, we began rolling out our new service booking tool in the app and on ulta.com, which enables guests to easily book or reschedule salon, brow and other service appointments. More than 1,000 stores are actively using this new tool, and the feedback from guests and stylists has been great. We're also testing new notification processes to expedite the curbside pickup experience with the goal of having a more seamless digital experience in place for holiday. 
 As we work to enhance the digital experience for guests, we've launched a guest service chatbot on ulta.com for ease, convenience and speed in resolving a basic guest questions. And we launched a new guest service customer engagement platform that allows our call center team to seamlessly respond to guest needs across a variety of contact channels and across internal platforms. We continue to invest in our fulfillment capacity to support a larger e-commerce business. 
 As discussed in the last earnings call, we pulled forward the opening of our Jacksonville fast fulfillment center, and we're on track to be operational to support higher levels of e-commerce demand this holiday season. In addition, we're expanding our ship-from-store program to 100 stores to increase shipping capacity and improve speed to guests, while also leveraging store labor and inventory. 
 Longer term, we'll continue to evaluate our infrastructure to determine how we can leverage our supply chain network and store footprint to support our growing omnichannel business. We're actively reviewing our network to identify opportunities to improve product flow from brand to guest while enhancing inventory productivity and guest service levels. Similarly, we're looking at our store footprint through an omnichannel lens to ensure we're strategically positioned to optimize share and profitability opportunities in every market. 
 Moving on to our second strategic priority: We are reimagining guest experience and discovery. We know guests still want the opportunity to test and play, but we also recognize the increased importance of safety. As we think about supporting and discovering the new channel, we're leveraging digital tools like GLAMlab, our virtual try-on tool. Since the COVID-19 crisis began, guest engagement with the tool has increased meaningfully, with product views in the second quarter increasing more than 150% from the first quarter. In addition in the second quarter, we expanded our virtual try-on capabilities to include hair color, false lashes and the benefit brow bar. While these are newer capabilities, our guests are actively playing and engaging with these innovative tools. 
 Longer term, we intend to support discovery trial in play by offering a combination of limited safe product testing with an expanded selection of single-use samples and seamless digital innovation like GLAMlab and 3-D printing. In addition, we're retooling our approach to in-store education, events and services and reimagining our fixtures and visual merchandising with a focus on safety, flexibility and cost effectiveness. 
 We know human connection in the physical shopping experience are important to beauty enthusiasts, so we're rethinking the whole store experience from BOPIS and curbside to the flow and feel of the store and the role of the associate as a trusted guide. Our vision is to continue to be the most loved destination and beauty by reimagining the end-to-end guest experience at Ulta Beauty, and we'll share more about these efforts on future calls. 
 Turning now to our third area of strategic focus, to drive winning category strategies and engage and delight beauty enthusiasts with a curated, relevant and unique beauty assortment. Newness and price innovation drive beauty category growth. And while we've successfully launched newness online this year, many of our planned brand launches and expansions in stores have been necessarily delayed because of store closures. With the reopening process complete, our store teams are working hard to deliver more exciting newness across all categories. 
 Clean Beauty continues to be a growing area of interest among our guests. Last month, we announced the launch of Conscious Beauty at Ulta Beauty, an initiative intended to help guests find brands and products that reflect their personal values. Through this initiative, we will certify brands across 5 key pillars: Clean ingredients; cruelty-free; vegan; sustainable packaging; and positive impact. Our goal is to give guests access to more choices, guide them along their journey and celebrate the brands and products that are aligned with this mission. 
 Conscious Beauty at Ulta Beauty will launch this fall in all stores online@ulta.com and on our app. In conjunction with this launch, we established sustainable packaging goals with a pledge to ensure 50% of all packaging sold will be made from recycled or bio-sourced materials or will be recyclable or refillable by 2025. As part of this effort, we'll pilot a circular shopping experience with Loop, a reusable packaging pioneer in early '21. 
 COVID-19 has amplified many of the category trends we've experienced over the last year, most notably the emergence of self-care has fueled consumer interest in skin care and hair. We're accelerating our focus in these areas to drive market share growth. 
 In skincare, our merchant teams have made terrific progress at expanding our assortment and improving the profitability of this important growth category. We continue to expand our brand portfolio across all price points including brands like Beekman 1802, L'Occitane and GLAMGLOW; and expanding brands like the ordinary Urban Skin Rx and e.l.f. skin care. In addition, we're highlighting a number of new skin care brands from our Sparked platform, including kinship, UpCircle and [ Gift on Routes. ] 
 To support these launches, we're dedicating more space for skincare in prominent areas of the sales floor and on ulta.com. And next year, we plan to implement more holistic changes to the layout in select new stores, which allocates more prominence and easy to navigate space for skin, more intuitive adjacencies and spaces in the front of the stores for curated events. 
 In addition to product newness, we're investing in digital innovation to help our guests identify and address skin care concerns with the launch of a new skin analysis tool in the Ulta Beauty app. This new skin analysis tool uses augmented reality technology and AI to assess skin care needs and offer personalized recommendations and skin care tip. 
 In hair, we're expanding our focus on texture and color with the introduction of brands like Arctic Fox,  Kreyol Essence, and the expansion of brands like Pattern and Curlsmith. To support these launches, we've increased our storytelling through our marketing vehicles, elevated the visibility of our stylists via social media and relaunched our salon takeovers to increase this visibility to key brands. 
 Makeup remains our largest category and we remain confident in the long-term opportunity. But changes in consumer behavior, a reduction in wearing occasions and events and the delay of new product innovation coming to market will likely continue to challenge growth in the category in the near term. Makeup is still an important, profitable category for us, and we're prioritizing newness in high-growth areas including Laura Mercier, Pixi and the launch -- the newly launched KVD Vegan Beauty, while also working to improve the space productivity of prestige color and prestige skin categories through recent planogram realignment. 
 Moving on to our fourth strategic priority. We'll continue to drive innovation in the ultimate rewards program in meaningful ways, personalizing experience across by touch points and creating stronger connections with our members. We have a large differentiated loyalty program with strong member engagement. Recent store closures and disruptions will constrain member growth this year, but we believe in the long-term opportunity to expand our loyalty program. To increase membership, we're focused on converting new members, both online and in-store and reengaging with members we haven't seen in a while. 
 As consumers shift increasingly to online shopping, we're seeing more nonmembers engaging with us online. Since the pandemic began, we've seen more than 2 million online transactions from nonmembers, more than 4x the number over the same period a year ago. To increase our conversion of these online guests, we're enhancing our communications on ulta.com because we can reach them through e-mail, and we're proactively communicating and promoting the value of ultimate rewards with these guests. 
 To reenergize our in-store efforts, we provided additional associate training during store closures. And in stores that have reopened, we've seen in-store member acquisition rates rebound at higher levels than pre-COVID. 
 With the reopening process complete, we're actively implementing reengagement strategy starting with member appreciation months in August, where we celebrated our members, welcome them back to Ulta Beauty with new bonus points offers, incentives for app downloads and exclusive app offers. In addition to communicating directly with our members, we've highlighted these offers across all of our digital channels, including ulta.com, to raise visibility and awareness of our ultimate rewards program. In addition, we're using our customer insights and predictive tools to create relevant, real-time anticipatory interactions across channels to reactivate and engage targeted membership segments and to drive greater loyalty. 
 And finally, our fifth area of focus is to drive strategic, holistic cost structure optimization. As we've discussed previously, we've made progress through our efficiency for growth, or EFG efforts, to improve our merchandising effectiveness and enhance core processes across our real estate and supply chain operations. While we recognize the rapid growth of e-commerce and increasing external cost pressures combined with the need to build critical capabilities to support our growth strategies, all require us to evolve our thinking about how we operate. So in addition to the near-term actions we're taking to stabilize and recover the business at the same time, we're also looking at opportunities to optimize our cost structure. 
 A few examples include store optimization. We have a strong profitable store fleet. And as with any portfolio, there's always top and bottom performers. Last month, we announced our decision to permanently close 19 stores this year to strengthen our overall portfolio. In addition, we slowed new store growth to manage operational risk this year. The role of physical retail and beauty remains crucial to the shopping experience. So while we know the role of e-commerce will continue to grow, we also continue to believe we can ultimately operate between 1,500 to 1,700 stores in the U.S. As we plan growth beyond this year, we will seek to balance the opportunity for lower rents with the opportunity to upgrade existing locations. 
 Second example, promotional efficiency. We continue to refine and strengthen our promotional strategies. While we will continue to lead into strategic events to drive market share, we're moderating or eliminating less profitable or less strategic promotions. For example this summer, we eliminated our Jumbo Love leader event, replacing it with a more focused promotional event for haircare. We limited the number of participating brands, reduced the average discount rate and eliminated additional marketing coupons. These changes delivered significantly more profit despite negatively impacting the comp in the hair category, and our core business was stronger during and after the event. 
 Another example of store labor model, we're implementing changes to our store management structure. This fall, we will eliminate the store manager and prestige manager roles and create a new single service manager role responsible for services, events and prestige retail. This change will create a stronger linkage between services and products and provide our guests with better customer service and expertise. It will also result in a more cost-efficient labor store model -- store-labor model. 
 Now one additional comment about our labor model. In April, we furloughed 33,000 associates, and to date, we brought back about 17,000 associates. Given our reduced operating hours, we know not all of our part-time associates will be able to work the shifts available given personal needs and availability. We also want to be realistic about capacity constraints, service limitations and the likelihood that demand will take time to recover. As such, not all of our furloughed associates will likely return to Ulta Beauty this year. 
 These are a few examples of steps we're taking to adjust our cost structure for the new environment. We are also looking at additional opportunities across the enterprise to optimize our cost structure while also building new capabilities to support our competitive advantage and our future growth. 
 So in closing, we believe the near-term environment will continue to be dynamic, but I'm confident our team can successfully navigate the challenges. And longer term, I remain optimistic about the growth opportunity for the beauty category and for Ulta Beauty. We have a strong and differentiated business model with diversity across categories and price points and outstanding service offerings. We're actively evolving and investing to extend our brand leadership, and I remain confident that Ulta Beauty will continue to innovate and lead, capture market share and drive profitable growth as we continue to be the most admired beauty retailer. 
 And now I'll turn the call over to Scott for a discussion of the financial results. Scott? 
Scott Settersten: Thanks, Mary, and good afternoon, everyone. 
 Starting with the income statement. Sales for the second quarter declined 26.3% and total company comp declined 26.7%. Overall, sales for the quarter were in line with our internal expectations, with sales from e-commerce a little stronger and stores a little softer than expected. Average ticket increased 14.9%, while transactions declined 36.2%. 
 As Mary mentioned, the beginning of the quarter was significantly pressured due to store closures, but we experienced improvement in the business as the quarter progressed. We are very pleased with the performance of our e-commerce operations, which exceeded our internal expectations and delivered a comp increase of more than 200% for the quarter, as guests continue to take advantage of our omnichannel capabilities, including curbside pickup and buy online pickup in stores. As expected, e-commerce growth slowed as stores reopened, but continued to deliver strong triple-digit growth versus last year. 
 From a mix perspective, makeup was 43% of sales, down 400 basis points from last year. Skincare, Bath & Fragrance collectively increased 600 basis points to 28% of sales as the penetration of all 3 categories increased year-over-year. As a percent of sales, haircare products and styling tools was flat at 21% of sales. 
 The services category was down 300 basis points to about 3% of sales as all services were suspended for much of the quarter. Gross profit margin was 26.8%, a decline of 9.6 percentage points compared to 36.4% a year ago. Many of the trends we saw in the first quarter continued in the second quarter as we transitioned through the store reopening process. 
 Similar to what we saw in the first quarter, the largest driver of margin deleverage were fixed cost due to significantly lower sales. Although not readily apparent in the gross margin results this quarter, we continue to reduce overall store occupancy costs. In addition to our ongoing EFG efforts, our real estate team is capturing significant benefits from lease negotiation efforts, reflecting the market impacts of COVID-19. These ongoing efforts will help us continue to reduce our occupancy costs over the long term. 
 Channel shift was also a large contributor to gross margin deleverage this quarter, albeit less pressure than we experienced in the first quarter due to increased utilization of curbside pickup and buy online pick up in-store and higher shipping volumes. As we shared last quarter, we would not anticipate this magnitude of deleverage on gross margin from channel shift to continue once we return to a more normalized operating environment. 
 We also experienced deleverage in salon expenses. While we furloughed many of our stylists as stores were closed, we continue to pay salon managers and our elite stylists. In addition, as Mary mentioned, as salons have reopened, our guest capacity has been constrained by safety protocols and social distancing, resulting in lower sales. 
 In addition to these factors, we increased inventory reserves by $16.5 million during the quarter, primarily to adjust for slow turning and discontinued makeup SKUs and permanently closed stores. The sales pressure we have seen in makeup over the last several quarters has been exacerbated by COVID-19, which has resulted in changes in consumer behavior as well as delays in newness and innovation within the category. As we believe these factors will persist in the short term, we decided to move aggressively through slower-turning makeup SKUs to ensure that we maintain healthy inventory levels. 
 In addition, we wrote off $1.4 million of inventory related to the previously announced 19 stores that will close in the third quarter. These headwinds were partially off offset by the impact of lower promotional activity as we chose to pull back on many promotional levers during the quarter as well as benefits from our credit card program. 
 SG&A expenses decreased to $271.6 million compared to $392.8 million in the second quarter of 2019. A large portion of the decrease compared to last year was due to employee retention credits of $48.2 million made available under the CARES Act. It's important to keep in mind that the employee retention credits were recorded in the second quarter, but reflect credits for payroll taxes paid in both the first and second quarters. 
 The decrease in SG&A is also attributable to lower store payroll and benefits, as many store associates were furloughed for much of the quarter. We also pulled back on marketing by significantly reducing spend on print material while investing into our digital channels. Store expenses were also lower, reflecting that many stores were closed for much of the quarter. These reductions more than offset an increase in corporate overhead, reflecting the impact of investments to support growth initiatives we made in 2019 that have not yet been anniversaried, and the impact of $37.5 million of PPE and other COVID-19-related expenses incurred in the quarter. 
 We recorded a charge of $40.8 million for impairment, store closure and other costs. As discussed on our first quarter earnings call, we performed reviews on long-lived asset on a quarterly basis, or when events or circumstances indicate that asset values may not be recoverable based on current expectations for future cash flows through the remaining lease term. 
 This quarter, there were 26 stores where the projected cash flows are lower than the current asset balance, which based on market value of the rent relative to our contractual obligation of the property resulted in impairment charges of $20.9 million. We have a strong on and productive fleet of stores, but the dynamic operating environment may result in additional impairments as we complete our quarterly testing process. 
 We also recorded an impairment charge of $19.9 million related to the previously announced permanent closure of 19 stores. Pre-opening expense was $3.9 million in the quarter, a decrease from $5 million a year ago. As a reminder, preopening expense represents primarily rent expense associated with stores we control but are not yet open. Given the disruption related to COVID-19 pandemic, we chose to not open any new stores during the quarter. We resumed new store openings in early August and are on track to open 19 stores in the second half of fiscal 2020. 
 Interest expense related to the drawdown of our revolver totaled $2.6 million compared to interest income of $1.7 million a year ago. Diluted GAAP earnings per share was $0.14 compared to earnings per share of $2.76 reported for last year's second quarter. Adjusted diluted earnings per share, excluding charges related to impairment, store closures and other costs, was $0.73 compared to adjusted diluted earnings per share of $2.72 a year ago. 
 Moving on to the balance sheet and cash flow. We ended the quarter with $1.16 billion in cash and cash equivalents and remain confident that we have sufficient liquidity to fund our operations now and in the future. For the quarter, total inventory grew 4% compared to the second quarter last year, primarily reflecting inventory needed to support 51 net new stores. Inventory per store decreased slightly as we have closely monitored demand as stores reopened and adjusted inventory levels accordingly. 
 Turning now to the rest of 2020. We're not providing an earnings outlook at this time. However, I want to share with you how we are thinking about the rest of the year. As Mary mentioned, we're pleased with the sales performance we have seen since we reopened stores, but we believe it is prudent to take a cautious approach to the second half. Given the ongoing uncertainty, we are currently planning comps to be down in the low double digit to mid-teens range in the second half, reflecting a number of factors. 
 First, we believe the near-term environment relative to containing the pandemic and related economic impacts will continue to be dynamic and challenging, and like others, we have seen volatility in our business as local markets experienced higher transmission levels of COVID-19. Two, we are pulling back on our promotional activity to drive profitability, of course we're watching the competitive environment closely and will adjust if needed. And finally, we expect store traffic this holiday season will be impacted by ongoing consumer health concerns and limited physical capacity in our stores as well as our decision to close stores for Thanksgiving. 
 We anticipate our gross profit margin will deleverage in the second half but not as much as we experienced in the first half. Compared to the first half trends, we expect less deleverage from fixed-cost and in-channel mix as sales improve and e-commerce penetration normalizes to a level higher than last year but lower than what we saw in the first half when stores were closed. 
 We expect to incur between $35 million and $40 million in PPE and COVID-19-related cost in the second half. As Mary discussed, we are actively taking steps across the organization to rightsize our cost structure in the new operating environment. We have limited the number of new hires and look to repurpose open positions. We delayed and reduced merit increases for our corporate, store and salon associates. We reduced marketing, travel and other controllable expenses, and moderated our pace of investments to build international capabilities. 
 Looking forward, we continue to identify additional opportunities across the enterprise to optimize our cost structure, while also building new capabilities to support competitive advantage and future growth. 
 In addition to cost management efforts, we continue to refine our capital spending plans. Our updated plan for the year is to invest between $180 million and $200 million, including approximately $65 million for new stores, remodels and merchandise fixtures; $90 million for supply chain and IT; and about $30 million for store maintenance and other. 
 We expect to open approximately 30 new stores in 2020 and relocate 5. We are still finalizing our real estate plans for next year, but plan to open at least as many new stores in 2021 as we do in 2020. While we have slowed our new store growth opening pace in the near-term in response to COVID-19 and evolving market conditions, we remain confident in the longer-term opportunity to continue to expand our fleet. 
 And now, I'll turn the call back over to our operator to moderate the Q&A session. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Adrienne Yih with Barclays. 
Adrienne Yih-Tennant: Nice to see the progress. Mary, I wanted to go back to the comment you made, newness is sort of coming through nontraditional brands. So I want to go back to -- given that prestige brands are contending with the contracting mall-based distribution channel, are you seeing either broader SKU assortment from existing prestige brands? And is there an opportunity to expand beyond fragrance into some brands like Chanel or Dior? 
 And then my follow-up for Scott, just a clarification, the negative low double-digit to negative mid-teens. If you're running negative single-digit now at the beginning of the third quarter, should we expect the third quarter to be stronger than the fourth quarter with all the uncertainty, or maybe the 2 of them similar in nature from a year-on-year standpoint? 
Mary Dillon: So Adrienne, thank you for your questions. And maybe I'll start with the second one first because, yes, so I think right directionally, we'd say we're expecting Q3 to be somewhat better than Q4. There's a lot of uncertainty, as everybody knows, but we've got resets and launches coming in Q3. I think holiday is just something we're all a little more cautious about, given new ways that people are going to think about shopping and hours available, et cetera. So we're thinking directionally that way. 
Scott Settersten: Yes. And as far as the comp sequence is concerned, I would just point maybe to looking at the promotional calendar. I know a lot of you guys track this stuff very closely. So you can schedule out what types of things we did last year over the course of the third and fourth quarters. And with the background color being we're trying to pull back on some of those things, right, we talked about in our comments. 
 So overall, directionally, I would say the fourth quarter, probably slightly weaker on balance just because of the volume of sales there and some of the promotional activity that historically have taken place in the fourth quarter overall. 
Mary Dillon: And Dave, would you take the first part of the question? Thank you. 
David Kimbell: Yes, absolutely. As it relates to your question on assortment and evolution of that, for sure, we're continuing to see disruption in the prestige marketplace. And that's something we've seen for a while, and a dynamic that we feel like we've been taking advantage of and continuing to grow share across all categories in the prestige side of the business. 
 And that comes from all different types of brands. Certainly, exclusive and new brands like Kylie, some of our established and dependent brands, brands like Tart and Urban Decay and Two-faced, where we launched exclusive innovation across those brands. And on the more prestige luxury side, we have made specific advancements on that. You asked specifically about Chanel. And yes, we have a strong fragrance business but we have rolled out in the Chanel Beaute line, a small number of stores with an expanded portfolio in the makeup side. 
 So we see continued opportunity across all aspects of that business to capture more share, expand our assortment and meet our guests' needs in multiple ways. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Ike Boruchow with Wells Fargo. 
Lauren Frasch: This is Lauren Frasch on for Ike. Given the massive acceleration in e-commerce that we've seen in 2020, could you talk a bit about the current margin profile of e-com initiatives and any initiatives you might be taking on to improve that? 
 And then as a follow-up, how does that new acceleration in online penetration play into your vision of longer-term margins for the overall business? 
Scott Settersten: Yes. That's a broad question. But let me first start out by saying, just, I guess, reiterating how proud we are of our teams, the e-com digital teams, the distribution centers, our store associates and all the support people that work with them. I mean it was a spectacular outcome to deliver a complex, that 200% year-over-year expansion, just really a great outcome overall, with the thought being, that's the average for the quarter. At some point during the quarter, it was higher than that, right, higher than 200%. So very proud of the outcomes there. 
 When we think about, over time, the e-commerce business, we haven't been shy about sharing the challenges we have with rate. I mean, everybody is very aware of that overall. So when we think about what we're trying to balance is rate versus dollars and speed versus cost. And we've talked to investors in recent years about the heavy investment cycle we've been in to support that part of our business. And it's really worked to our advantage now, right, in this time of crisis and change pivot point with consumers. So very happy what we've been doing in recent years to support that business, and obviously, that's going to be the trend for the future as well. So we'll continue to be focused there. 
 When we think about the margin profile overall in the future, again, our historical guide was that it was going to be a 20 to 40 basis point headwind. Obviously, that's not what it is in this time and space. We're happy with the sequential improvement we saw from the first quarter, right? And we expect that to continue to moderate sequentially as we go deeper into 2020. 
 And we're thinking and working collectively on other levers we can pull to try to mitigate some of that rate headwind, specifically in the e-commerce space. So things like BOPIS, we've been talking about and curbside now that we have that available to us. And again, those are higher-ticket transactions typically and better margin profile file overall. Our DCs are operating more efficiently now, so that helps offset some of that headwind. 
 And then we're thinking about other parts of the business, right? Mary pointed to cost optimization. So it's not just an e-commerce question. It's more of what else are we looking at overall for the enterprise to help optimize the overall margin profile of the business, not just the e-com piece of it. 
 So the entire team is focused on that, and we're doing a lot of work now framing up 2021 in how we deliver the best overall financial result there and then start marching back to healthier operating margins. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Steven Forbes with Guggenheim Securities. 
Steven Forbes: Mary, maybe a question for you. You mentioned in the prepared remarks about the doubling of the omnichannel penetration rate, right, among the members. Curious if you could just discuss how the behaviors of these new omnichannel members has compared, right, to the legacy group. Are they repeating faster, shopping more categories or sort of think like potentially consolidating their spend, right, with Ulta, just given the trip consolidation pieces? We'd love to hear how you sort of think about that doubling in this quarter. 
Mary Dillon: Yes. Well, it's too early to really kind of parse out the exact dynamics of their behavior, but we like where it's heading. I mean, omnichannel guests, I said this earlier, I think you probably know this, but they're most engaged guests, and they spend 3x historically as much as somebody who's shopping in-store only. So this is sort of a forced migration to more folks to get it into this. 
 And so while you can debate sort of the margin impacts of e-com, we know the total value of this customer is quite significantly strong. Because most of our guests historically have started a store-only, and then started to shop online with us as we saw their spend triple, they basically were keeping pretty similar what they were buying in-store and just adding incrementally online, and the categories tended to be similar. 
 So we would expect a similar behavior, except we've got a lot of folks now who started first online, right? And so -- and as we open up our stores and saw people coming back, I mean, certainly, traffic isn't where it was, but we're pleased with the pace of people coming back to the stores. I think it just kind of continues to support that premise that beauty enthusiasts like the idea of shopping, both physically and digitally. They get good things on the side both of those things. 
 So I mentioned this also that as we saw a lot of new people shopping us who weren't rewards members, we also have the opportunity, now that we have their e-mail, to convert them into the loyalty program. 
 So I think this is all good. I mean, the thing -- that swift increase that happened showed that: a, we were in the right place, from an e commerce perspective. I mean that e-commerce business doesn't just happen on its own. Our team was doing a great job of connecting with guests and social and digital channels to drive -- make sure we're driving awareness and staying top of mind at a time that there was a lot of things on people's minds, right? So we pivoted out of what we would have done traditionally and really focused on understanding where people were in terms of self-care and things like that. 
 So it was strategically, I think, a great pivot. And we'll continue to watch it closely, but we think it's a good thing for our business. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Michael Binetti with Crédit Suisse. 
Michael Binetti: Nice job on the quarter. I guess, Mary, I found it a little, on the plan of pullback on promotions in the back half, somewhat counterintuitive. I think there's obviously an unprecedented numbers of department stores that have been closing around you, and it seems to me that, that's a really good opportunity for you guys to grab market share. You seem like the heir apparent for that share. 
 I mean, are you -- would you be willing to walk away from a new customer opportunity if you do see a path to that customer as those doors start to close in the back half? And then I guess as a... 
Mary Dillon: Oh, you're going to ask a 2-part question, okay. I'll call you on that. 
 Let me just start with that one. Maybe, Dave, maybe you can add to it. But I'd say high level, of course, we're focused on driving market share gains, and there's opportunities out there. Having said that, all we're doing is saying, let's be as targeted and strategic as we can about how to do that. We are -- I mean, through this entire pandemic, we've been gaining share in Prestige Beauty, and while -- and so we know that we're competing well even with a somewhat less promotional kind of cadence than we would have had at that time. 
 So the idea is to still compete at the peak times of things like holiday, do strategic promotions that we work really well for us, and just be more efficient with how we do this. And certainly, if we see opportunities to get more aggressive or need to, we will. I mean we're not -- we understand that there's an opportunity to convert, especially as we convert people into our loyalty program, and that becomes very sticky. 
 So I think it's a good, good balanced way to think about this, but we're obviously keeping a close eye on it. Is there anything you'd add to that, Dave, that I didn't hit on there? 
David Kimbell: Just to reinforce, yes, this idea of just being much more strategic in our approach towards promotional optimization, but we are not pulling, eliminating all promotions. In fact, starting this Sunday will be 21 Days of Beauty, one of our biggest and most important, most strategic events of the year. And it's a good example of an event that is promotional but it has a strategic role in driving what we call mass migration, introducing our guests many times for the first time to a new prestige brand. 
 So focusing on activities like that, optimizing programs like our loyalty program, personalization efforts that more pinpoint and direct target -- direct promotional activity, specifically to people that we know respond to it will -- just allow us to be more efficient with that spend, and ultimately, be more effective in the marketplace. 
Michael Binetti: Got you. If I could ask a follow-up. I mean, how best to connect that to the progression of margins as you think multiyear? I think what I heard here today that was incremental. I heard more efficient promotions, more efficient labor model. You have Jacksonville coming back online -- or coming online again, so e-com should be more efficient. I think you talked about negotiations, other EFG initiatives. 
 What are the headwinds we should think about that would offset some margins as you try and orient yourselves? I guess we're looking at 2019 since we're trying to forget about 2020 for several reasons here. 
Scott Settersten: Yes. So when we work -- I mean, we're in the throes of it right now, Michael, looking at 2021 operating plan and looking at new embedded cost headwinds to the business overall. So some of the things we've talked about historically around channel mix headwinds and store payroll headwinds, and some new, like PP&E cost implications and how long that might be with us. So there's a lot of ores in the water, so to speak, right now. The team is focused on it. 
 Again, we're focused on overall operating margins, trying to squeeze out the best overall financial results, and we're focused on double-digit operating margins over the longer term. We still think that, that's kind of the minimum threshold for this business. We got healthy product margins. It's part of the base of our operating model, and there's still lots of levers for us to pull on, and we're just making decisions now on which ones we're going to push and pull for next year. So we'll have more to say on that as we get further along this year. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Paul Trussell with Deutsche Bank. 
Paul Trussell: Good job in the quarter. Wanted to ask about stores. You mentioned that as stores reopen, online still remained very strong, up triple digits. How should we think about the productivity and the profitability of your store fleet? And while your long-term target remains intact, do you view the cadence of store openings, on an annual basis, potentially any different going forward, both in the U.S. and your approach to opening in Canada? 
Scott Settersten: Well, I guess I'll start. So just the basic runway on the store buildout program, so we pulled back, we moderated this year for obvious reasons, right? So you're in that 30 new store opening range for 2020. And as we stated in our remarks, next year, the way we're looking at it now because, again, you're working on leases as years in advance, right? Working with landlord partners, lining up the right kind of space and making sure you got the right co-tenancy mix there. So these are far down the road kind of decision. 
 So we feel good about at least 30 new stores for next year, and hopefully, maybe more depending on how some of the pandemic impacts other retailers in our centers across the U.S. right now. 
 So we still feel good. Again, I think we mentioned in the remarks that we're looking at the optimal footprint, right? So the fleet we have now versus the fleet we would want if we had a white sheet of paper to work with, and then layering on top of that, the omnichannel sales opportunity for us for the long-term and just making sure we got the right number of stores with the right incremental -- digital sales offering as well. 
 So again, looking at it today, we still feel like 1,500 to 1,700 is a good range. I mean, that's definitely something we feel comfortable with. And that we just want to make sure that it's optimal, right? So we're in the midst of that work now, and we'll have more to share on that later in the year. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. 
Simeon Gutman: My question and follow-up in one is financial related. First, can you talk about the fixed cost per store? They sound like they're going lower. Are you able to quantify so we can understand leverage or even deleverage going forward? 
 And then related to something that was asked earlier, Scott, the 20 to 40 basis points you mentioned in e-commerce or as penetration went up, margins got hit. Was that number inclusive of what was happening to the store-only business, and that was the overall result to the business? Or was that a channel-exclusive comment that as that mix to that channel increased, that was the pure impact to the overall business? Hopefully, that makes sense. 
Scott Settersten: Yes. So we're thinking about the second part of your question, Simeon. But as far as the first question there, so fixed cost overall is something that we have been focused on for a couple of years already. So when we talk about efficiencies for growth, or EFG, real estate is a core pillar in the work that we do there. So again, thinking about the whole portfolio when we're dealing with landlords, not just individual stores and looking further out into the future on renewals and opportunities to reposition stores or renegotiate overall economics on those stores, so that's been underway now for a period of time. And so we're -- we've got an embedded process in the business, and we're feeling really good about what we're doing. 
 So COVID-19 just kind of put that on steroids here in the near term. So again, you've seen other retailers talking about challenges they've had, so we're doing a lot of the same things behind the scenes. We feel like we've got a better process. We've got strong relationships. We're a retailer of choice for many landlords, the beauty category being a healthy one to add to the mix, and we drive a lot of traffic to centers. So we feel like we're in a good position to make sure we get the best overall economic deals. 
 That's something that will be part of our long-term plan. We're getting benefits now, and we will continue to scale that up over the long term. 
 As far as the 20 to 40 basis point headwind in our historical guidance, I mean, that's -- again, that's -- the page has been turned on that here over the last, call it, 3 to 5 months. And we've been reacting and leveraging and trying to optimize the overall impact there. I think I mentioned earlier, DC, throughput, efficiencies are getting better as the business scales up to 2 and 3x times. We are getting efficiencies out of the network overall. 
 I mean, there are headwinds. You've seen the news reports here on some of the surcharges that are coming from some of the shipping operations here in the U.S. So that's another bit of a wildcard that we're balancing against. But it's a little too early to really be able to quantify what the impact on that is. I would say, in the big scheme of things, that's a smaller item compared to some of the other headwinds that we're dealing with now here in 2020. But again, we've got a great team in supply chain in that's smart and thinking about all the long-term impacts of this over the long term. 
 And again, when we put it into the mosaic that we're dealing with, whether it's specific, digital, gross margin headwinds or other things in the business, PP&E costs, we're kind of putting all the PPE -- all the puzzle pieces together here to kind of try to come up with the best overall operating margin answer that we can. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Steph Wissink with Jefferies. 
Stephanie Schiller Wissink: First part of the question is for Scott. You gave us some great detail for the back half on gross margin. I'm wondering if you're willing to give us some direction on SG&A. In the quarter, you had a few transitory elements. So I'm just curious if you can help us unpack -- or I think retention credits, you mentioned around $48 million. Some of your store staff are still furloughed. Maybe just help us think about the puts and takes as you think about first semester versus second. 
 And then Mary and Dave, so related to that is on marketing. I think, Mary, you mentioned that your unaided awareness was stable despite pulling back pretty significantly on marketing. So I'm wondering if that's reshaping how you're thinking about marketing the Ulta brand, if you're seeing that you're better known and better selected today than you've been in the past, if that changes how much you think you need to spend on brand marketing going forward? 
Mary Dillon: I'll start with that one, because I'm sure our Head of Marketing probably wasn't thrilled when I make that comment. I thought that's a logical question. 
 No, I would say that I think -- well, Dave is closer to it than I am. But the notion of being able to retain and maintain great aided awareness, unaided awareness and strong brand equity means there's consistent kind of investments you have to make over time, I guess, I'd say, through the lens of things that, like media, like advertising. So we have pulled back maybe some pieces here and there because we really didn't have the ability to -- need to create that kind of demand. 
 But our marketing team does an amazing job of just constantly looking at return on investment and improving what we do every day to maximize the levers that we use. So I think our marketing investment has gotten, tell me if I'm wrong, more efficient over time, and it will continue to do so. So okay, Scott? 
Scott Settersten: So SG&A in the back half of the year. So you're right, the CARES Act, $48 million was a onetime kind of thing for the second quarter and won't recur in the back half of the year, but then we'll have the PP&E cost. PPE costs, the $35 million to $40 million in the back half, that's primarily SG&A costs. So a lot of it is store labor. When you think about metering people in and out of the stores and making sure we're guiding them to safe shopping practices. And then you got cleaning of the stores and related supplies to all that. 
 Store payroll and benefits is the largest bucket in the SG&A line item. Directionally, you've heard us talk about some of the changes we're making here. Mary mentioned a few of those. And so lower in the second half versus last year by some of those actions that were taken. 
 Marketing, lower in the second half versus last year, but not as low as it was in the first half. Some -- we pulled some expenses out of the first half and we're putting in the second half to -- we've got some great new advertising, right? Television advertising coming here, so we're really excited about. 
 Overhead, then would be the last bucket, and there's going to be some growth versus last year because some of those investments we made, growth investments, are still yet to be anniversaried and will be when we get through the full year. 
Mary Dillon: So thank you. Thanks, everybody, for joining us today. We're out of time. 
 I just want to express my sincere appreciation to all of our Ulta Beauty associates for their efforts as we continue to navigate well through this unprecedented environment. 
 I just hope that you and your colleagues and your loved ones are safe and healthy, and we look forward to speaking with all of you again in December when we report our third quarter results. Thank you. 
Operator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference. All parties may disconnect. Thank you for your participation.

 Now I'll turn the call over to Mary. Mary? 
Mary Dillon: Thank you, Kiley, and good afternoon, everyone. Before we talk about our first quarter results and how we're responding to the challenges created by COVID-19, I want to first take a moment to thank all who have been on the frontlines selflessly fighting the outbreak and caring for the country since this pandemic began. We're truly grateful for your dedication. I also want to thank my leadership team and all Ulta Beauty associates for their unwavering commitment, tireless efforts and continued agility as we adjust to a very dynamic and uncertain operating environment.
 As we've navigated through this crisis, our lens for every decision has been the safety and the well-being of our associates and guests. In early March, as the virus began to spread in the U.S., we quickly took steps to keep our associates and guests safe and healthy. We increased sanitation measures and cleaning frequency in stores, limited the use of testers and suspended all beauty services. As the situation escalated, we made the difficult decision to temporarily close all of our stores on March 19 and quickly shifted our focus to operating our e-commerce channel only.
 When we began 2020, we certainly did not plan to operate the digital-only business, but I'm very proud of how quickly our teams pivoted to support our e-commerce operations. Our marketing team shifted rapidly to create highly relevant digital content sensitive to the mindset of our guests at that time, a focus on connection, self-care and positivity while also acknowledging new consumer behavior such as social distancing and wearing masks.
 Anticipating an increase in demand, our digital teams quickly leveraged the existing capabilities to support higher e-commerce order volumes and manage order flow. Our supply chain teams quickly increased capacity while implementing enhanced cleaning protocols in alignment with CDC guidelines and new processes that support social distancing within the distribution centers to keep our associates safe. Our DC associates were incredible in their ability to quickly meet the increased demand in our e-commerce business, and I'm deeply grateful for their efforts.
 With more than 80% of our revenues previously generated in stores, we knew that the expected acceleration in e-commerce would not recoup all of the lost brick-and-mortar sale. So early in the COVID-19 crisis, we took several precautionary steps to protect liquidity and enhance our financial flexibility, which Scott will discuss shortly. And as we actively took steps to manage the business through the short-term uncertainty, we simultaneously began to plan the reopening of our stores and to adjust our operational plans for the rest of 2020.
 In April, it became clear our stores would remain closed longer than initially expected. After evaluating multiple options and considering the changes in unemployment insurance details incorporated into the CARES Act, we made the decision to furlough many of our store and salon associates. Our intention is to retain as much of our workforce as possible, and we look forward to when we can safely welcome associates back into all of our stores.
 To help support our associates through this crisis, we expanded the criteria for our Associate Relief Program to include those who need assistance due to a personal hardship as a result of COVID-19. This program is one way we can care for our associates. And I, along with Ulta Beauty executive team and Board of Directors, have made personal donations to the program.
 We're also providing support for those who are working hard on the frontlines to take care of all of us. Since the crisis began, Ulta Beauty has donated 450,000 gloves and 110,000 essential beauty items to several national organizations serving local communities and health care workers. And throughout this crisis, we've worked closely with our brand partners, both big and small, to ensure that we successfully navigate this crisis together. We're appreciative of their ongoing partnership and are confident our relationship remains strong and in a good position to drive growth.
 Now let's turn to our first quarter results. Reflecting the impact of store closures, total net sales for the quarter were $1.2 billion. Comp store sales declined 35.3%, and we had a net loss of $1.39 per share. While these are certainly not the results we planned, I'm proud of how our team has worked together to respond to the unexpected challenges.
 The first quarter began well with good growth in comp store sales, market share and our Ultamate Rewards loyalty program. However, the escalation of COVID-19 in mid-March, the need to temporarily close all of our physical stores and immediate changes in consumer behavior disrupted these positive trends. Within beauty, consumers focused on immediate safety and protection necessities like hand soap and antibacterial gels early in the crisis.
 As salons and other beauty service outlets closed, guests shifted to do-it-yourself beauty solutions, including hair color, nail care and hair removal products. And as quarantines became more pervasive, guests looked to self-care and wellness products like skincare treatments, hair masks and bath products, home fragrance and others to relieve stress. Although comp sales after mid-March declined in all categories as a result of our store closures, the skincare, haircare, bath and nail categories all increased as a percentage of sales.
 Early in the quarter, we saw nice market share gains across the majority of categories. The temporary closure of our stores in mid-March impacted our overall market share. But in our digital business, which operated for the full quarter, we are pleased to see strong market share gains across all of our prestige categories.
 From a channel perspective, our e-commerce channel was strong early in the quarter, with sales trends accelerating from levels we saw in the fourth quarter. As we close stores and transition to a digital-only business, sales accelerated further. Despite proactively managing demand in light of capacity constraints resulting from increased social distancing protocols in our DCs, we more than doubled our e-commerce sales this quarter.
 The number of active members in our Ultamate Rewards loyalty program increased 2% compared to the first quarter last year to 33.1 million members. While this growth was lower than planned, we are pleased to see it in spite of the store closures. Historically, stores have been the largest source of new member acquisition. And while we saw significant growth in new member acquisition through our digital channels, it was not enough to offset the impact of store closures.
 We're also very pleased to see that a large number of previously in-store-only members engage with us online for the first time. Our omnichannel guests historically have had very strong engagement with Ulta Beauty with nearly 3x the annual spend of an in-store-only guest. So we're excited about the opportunity to maintain strong engagement with these new guests that are shopping in our omnichannel format as our operations fully reopen.
 Reflecting heightened guest focus on safety and social distancing, our digital and store teams moved quickly to create and launch a new touchless curbside pickup option for our guests. And on April 23, we launched buy online, pickup curbside in 70 stores across 9 states. Guests have enthusiastically embraced this beauty-to-go option, and our store associates are doing an amazing job bringing this to life for them from flawless execution to wearing welcome back signs as they deliver purchases to guests. Since launching this option 6 weeks ago, we've seen a nice acceleration in the average number of orders per store, strong average order values and high satisfaction ratings as more guests are using this option as a fun and convenient way to come back to Ulta Beauty.
 Over the last month, various states and local authorities have begun to lift restrictions in an effort to restart their economies, allowing us to make key decisions on how and when to reopen stores. Of course, we want to open our stores as quickly and as safely as possible and have been doing so. To help us make reopening decisions, we've developed a rigorous process to evaluate the safety risk for each store.
 In addition to reviewing the legal guidance to determine we're allowed to reopen, we also assess local COVID-19 transmission trends and evaluate certain operational criteria and local guest sentiment. Once we determine that it's safe to open, we will flex based on local conditions. Some stores will reopen curbside pickup, some stores will reopen curbside and retail only, and some stores will reopen with curbside retail and a limited service offering. All doors will initially reopen with limited store hours.
 We know that health and safety will remain top concerns for all. And as we reopen stores, we're implementing new Shop Safe Standards to ensure the safety of our associates and guests. Reflecting guidance from government and health officials as well as recommendations from RILA and NRF, these standards include associate wellness checks, increased cleaning frequency and additional hand sanitizer station. All associates are wearing face coverings in store, and we're asking all guests to do the same while shopping. To promote social distancing, we've reduced the number of [ added chairs ] on the sales floor, created one-way aisles and added plexiglass shields at checkout. And we're limiting occupancy and the number of open registers.
 The opportunity to test and play is an important part of the beauty shopping experience. And while we've kept most testers on the sales floor to help guests visualize color, texture and packaging, we've made them unavailable for guest use. As an alternative, we're directing guests to our GLAMlab tool, which is our live interactive virtual experience that lives within the Ulta Beauty app. GLAMlab allows users to virtually discover and try thousands of beauty products. Since the crisis began, guest engagement with the tool has increased nearly 5x, and more than 30 million shades have been tested virtually.
 We're also making changes in our salons to promote and protect safety, including offering services by appointment only, performing associate and guests wellness checks, using protective wear, increasing cleaning between appointments and implementing social distancing between stations. Last month, we began the reopening process with the launch of curbside pickup. And on May 11, we reopened 180 stores to guests, including many with salon services. As of today, 840 Ulta Beauty stores or about 2/3 of the fleet offer curbside pickup. 333 stores or about 1/4 of the fleet are open to guests for retail, and 283 of those stores are open with salon services. While it's early in the reopening process, we've seen stronger-than-expected sales in reopened stores. And we're seeing great guest engagement with our salon services with many appointments booked several weeks out.
 To get a sense of how reopened stores are performing, when we look at the first wave of 180 stores that have reopened, omnichannel comp sales in these stores are collectively flat a year ago with some states even comping higher than last year. And sales in these initial stores continue to reflect strong penetration of e-commerce in BOPIS and curbside pickup as well as ship to home. Of course, these are early results but encouraging.
 Over the next several weeks, we'll continue to assess opportunities to reopen additional stores and expand services offerings. As we learn, we will adjust, communicate and continue to prioritize the safety and well-being of our associates and guests. Based on current available information, we expect to have a vast majority of stores reopened in some capacity by the end of June.
 I'll just add that earlier this week, I was able to hold a virtual store team visit with Kecia Steelman, our Chief Stores Officer, in markets across the country: Epping, New Hampshire; Hendersonville, Tennessee; Delray Beach, Florida; Austin, Texas, Indian Land, South Carolina; Norridge, Illinois; and Orland Park, Illinois. Some of these stores are doing curbside. Some are fully reopened for retail. But one thing was true for all, our teams are excited to be back to work and appreciate how Ulta Beauty has treated them through this difficult time.
 Now as we look beyond the reopening process, we're adjusting our plans for the rest of 2020. Consumer safety concerns, macroeconomic pressures and the risk of a resurgence in the infection rate are dynamics that might constrain demand for the rest of the year. As a result, we are reimagining holiday, rethinking our tentpole events and continuously looking for opportunities to reduce costs. We believe that demand will improve as guests regain confidence, and our goal is to maintain operational flexibility so we can adjust quickly to changes in demand while also managing inventory risk and cost as we navigate continued uncertainty.
 Longer term, I remain excited about the opportunity for Ulta Beauty. The beauty category, while not recession-proof, has fared better than many other discretionary categories in economic downturns, reflecting the relatively low price point and the emotional connection with the product. While our business is larger and more diverse than it was in the last downturn, our annual comp performance in 2008 and 2009 was positive. And we know from our proprietary research and engagement that the beauty category remains strong despite the uncertainty many guests are experiencing today.
 Within the beauty category, our diverse assortment, combined with convenient locations, strong brand awareness and our differentiated loyalty program all position us to gain market share in a challenging economic environment. Most importantly, I believe our values-based, guest and associate-centric culture and commitment to high performance will enable us to continue to expand our leadership position.
 Over the last 90 days, I have been inspired by the power of the culture we've built as our teams have worked quickly and collaboratively to care for our associates, to support our e-commerce business and to reopen our stores. Whether it's volunteering to help guest services respond to e-commerce inquiries, stepping in to help our HR service center support furloughed associates or virtually collaborating to swatch samples for GLAMlab, our associates have stepped out of their regular duties to support each other, our guests and Ulta Beauty through this truly unprecedented period.
 Despite our universal desire to return to normal, COVID-19 will likely have sustained effects on consumers, the competitive environment and how we all operate and work. We're thinking through all of these changes and what they may mean to our business model going forward, but we know we'll emerge strong. Health and safety concerns are elevated. And while we're all rethinking the risk of close contact in physical touch, consumers have adopted new shopping behaviors quickly. Many consumers have more comfort with online purchases and in-store pickup, and we expect they may continue to participate in these convenient ways of shopping.
 Businesses have been financially challenged due to closures, category shifts and liquidity pressures, and some will likely not reopen. And we will likely see additional cost pressures due to channel shifts, PPE costs and increased promotional intensity as businesses look to drive demand in a difficult economic environment. At Ulta Beauty, we are not sitting still. We intend to leverage the strengths of our operating model and investments to reimagine the future of Ulta Beauty and the new normal. Specifically, we're accelerating efforts in 5 key areas to expand our market share gains and extend our competitive advantages.
 First, over the last few years, we've invested to expand our digital and omnichannel capabilities. As a result, we've delivered double-digit growth in e-commerce sales. COVID-19 has hastened channel shift across retail, and we believe much of this new consumer behavior will be sticky. So we're focused on how we can move even faster to win in an omnichannel world. We're accelerating investments to expand our shipping capacity this year, which includes the pull forward of our Jacksonville fast fulfillment center into 2020, investments in existing buildings and the expansion of our ship-from-store capabilities.
 During this crisis, we've seen strong conversion of an in-store-only guest to omnichannel guest, with trends accelerating since the launch of curbside pickup. We know there's a strong connection in beauty between the digital and the physical, and we're looking at our brick-and-mortar footprint and how we can accelerate our efforts to build a comprehensive multichannel view of how we serve our guests.
 Second, we know that beauty enthusiasts love to shop for discovery and trial no matter the channel. And we do not expect this desire to change. We also know that concerns about personal safety and close contact caused by COVID-19 will require the beauty experience to change in the short term but will also likely spark longer-term innovation. We're reimagining the guest experience and product discovery and looking at ways technology, services and the role of our associates can evolve to create a new wow experience for our guests.
 Our Ulta Beauty app and GLAMlab tool will continue to play a big role in guest discovery and trial. Today, guests can use GLAMlab to match foundation, try on makeup and play with hair color and lashes. And in the future, guests will have even more opportunities as we accelerate the implementation of new categories and experiences.
 Third, we plan to build on the successful work we've done to expand our market share and accelerate gains even further in key categories like skincare, hair and wellness. Social distancing has resulted in many consumer behavior changes, and the crisis has exacerbated many of the category trends that we saw playing out during the crisis. While we remain confident in the long-term potential of makeup, headwinds facing the makeup category will likely persist in the short term given the impact of social distancing and masks as well as the delayed introduction of newness and innovation this year. On the flip side, many people seem to be on video calls now most of the day, so we'll watch the impact on makeup usage closely.
 Conversely, skincare has become more important as guests look to take care of their skin and relieve stress. And wellness has taken on new dimensions, extending to both physical and mental aspects as consumers increase efforts to stay healthy and look to feel better in this new environment. We intend to lean into these trends to drive further market share expansion.
 Fourth, we've built a tremendous asset in our Ultamate Rewards program. With more than 33 million active members, we build a differentiated loyalty program that provides us with valuable customer insights, and we're applying advanced analytics and artificial intelligence to leverage this data to deliver personalized targeted communications. As we focus on deepening guest engagement, we're looking at ways to drive next level loyalty and accelerate personalization to increase spend per member. This will be particularly relevant in an increasingly omnichannel marketplace as more consumers move seamlessly between channels.
 Finally, through our efficiency for growth or EFG efforts, we've made progress in improving our merchandising effectiveness and enhancing core processes across our real estate and supply chain operations. As we think about cost pressures increasing as we move forward, we're looking at how we can go beyond process optimization and develop a cost structure that will enable us to weather economic challenges while also supporting investment in capabilities and opportunities that will set us up for future success.
 So in closing, this crisis certainly has been fluid, swift and inescapable. Businesses and consumers alike are adjusting to the effects of COVID-19, and longer term, the pandemic will have a sustained impact on how we all live and work. While the economic environment will be challenged, beauty enthusiasts have a deep emotional connection with beauty that in the past has not diminished in softer economic environment. Routines will continue to shift and evolve, but beauty is a platform for self-expression, togetherness, joy and self-care, all of which are even more important for beauty enthusiasts during this time of uncertainty and change.
 At Ulta Beauty, we have a strong differentiated operating model, a brand that's known and loved and dedicated associates who are passionate about our guests and our company. And I'm confident we will emerge in this crisis well positioned to accelerate our market share gains and extend our competitive advantages.
 And now I'll turn the call over to Scott for a discussion of the financial results. Scott? 
Scott Settersten: Thanks, Mary, and good afternoon, everyone. Before I review our financial results, I'd like to reiterate Mary's comments, and on behalf of Ulta Beauty, express our immense gratitude for the first responders who are on the frontlines every day, protecting us from the spread of the coronavirus. I would also like to acknowledge all our associates, from those in the field and in our distribution centers, to our team members from our home office, who have worked tirelessly to adapt to the rapidly changing environment. I could not be more proud of the work they are doing.
 Now the situation with COVID-19 is dynamic and fluid, so our first priority has been to protect liquidity. We have taken steps to enhance our financial flexibility, including drawing down $800 million on our $1 billion revolver, suspending our stock buyback program and actively managing and prioritizing our expense structure, working capital and capital investments. We have also taken a conservative approach to inventory management, adjusting receipts to reflect current and expected sales levels.
 As a result of these efforts, we had $1.15 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments at the end of the quarter. We are proud of the quick actions we've taken to further enhance our financial strength and are confident that we have sufficient liquidity to fund our operations now and in the future.
 Turning now to our results for the first quarter, beginning with the income statement. Q1 sales declined 32.7% as we temporarily closed all of our stores in response to the spread of COVID-19. Total company comp declined 35.3% and was composed of 3.3% average ticket growth and a 38.6% decline in transactions. As Mary mentioned, we were pleased with our performance in the beginning of the quarter, with total company comp sales trending above our plan through March 10. However, we began to experience softer traffic as consumers became concerned about the spread of the virus. And we subsequently closed all of our stores on March 19, resulting in a 62% comp decline from March 11 to the end of the quarter. Fortunately, we continue to operate our e-commerce business, which delivered a comp increase of just over 100% for the quarter.
 From a mix perspective, makeup was 49% of sales, down 400 basis points from last year. The skincare, bath and fragrance category increased 300 basis points to 24% of sales. Haircare products and styling tools increased 100 basis points to 18% of sales. The services category was down 100 basis points to about 4% of sales, reflecting the temporary suspension of all services in mid-March.
 Gross profit margin was 25.9%, a decline of 11 percentage points compared to 37% a year ago. The deleverage in the quarter was primarily due to 3 items: deleverage of fixed costs, channel mix and the deleverage of salon services. Fixed store and supply chain cost deleveraged roughly 500 basis points due to significantly lower sales related to temporary store closures.
 Channel shift contributed approximately 400 basis points of deleverage as our stores were closed for much of the quarter, and e-commerce was a much larger mix of our overall business. As we have shared previously, our e-commerce channel sales, or more aptly described, our direct-to-consumer sales channel, are less profitable than a typical retail store sale with the variance between the 2 channels being most pronounced on the gross margin line, where all of the fixed and variable costs as well as the higher promotional intensity cost of that channel sales are captured, while for retail store sales, a large portion of the variable cost, i.e., store labor, is included in our SG&A line.
 It's also important to keep in mind the unique circumstances we experienced this quarter, having all of our stores closed, which exacerbated the impact of channel shift. We would not anticipate this kind of deleverage on gross margin from channel shift once we return to a more normalized operating environment and our stores are open.
 We also experienced deleverage in salon services as we chose to continue to compensate our stylists for most of the quarter despite all stores being closed. These headwinds were partially offset by the impact of lower promotional activity within the e-commerce channel as we chose to pull back on many promotional levers to manage e-commerce demand and volumes at our distribution centers as well as benefits from our credit card program.
 SG&A expenses decreased 5.5% to $380.9 million compared to $403.1 million in the first quarter of 2019 as we pulled back on store expenses in light of temporary store closures as well as advertising by reducing our spend on print material and reallocating resources into our digital vehicles. As a percent of sales, SG&A increased to 32.5% compared to 23.1% last year. We experienced the most deleverage from store labor which is the largest expense within SG&A. Store labor is normally a more variable expense as we often adjust payroll hours to support sales volumes. However, payroll was more fixed during the quarter as we chose to continue to pay our store associates for most of the quarter despite temporarily closing all stores. We also experienced deleverage on corporate overhead, reflecting the impact of investments we made in 2019 that have not yet been anniversaried.
 This quarter, we recorded an impairment charge of $19.5 million related to the expected future performance of a small number of stores. To provide some context, we perform reviews on long-lived assets on a quarterly basis or when events or circumstances indicate that asset values may not be recoverable. The basis of our evaluation is whether future cash flows through the lease term are greater than or equal to the asset balance on the balance sheet.
 There are a small number of stores that were underperforming before we made the decision to temporarily close stores. These stores were further impacted due to COVID 19. The projected cash flows for these stores are lower than the current asset balance, and based on the market value of the rent relative to our contractual obligation of the property, resulted in impairment charges. We have a strong and productive fleet of stores. But going forward, we will continue to test for impairments and adjust accordingly.
 Preopening expense was $4.6 million in the quarter, an increase from $4.2 million a year ago as we assumed control of the property at Herald Square in New York City. The rent for this property is higher than our other stores and will be recognized in the preopening line until the store opens.
 Interest expense related to the drawdown of our revolver totaled $1.3 million compared to interest income of $2 million a year ago. Diluted GAAP loss per share was $1.39 compared to earnings per share of $3.26 reported for last year's first quarter.
 Moving on to the balance sheet and cash flow. For the quarter, total inventory grew 7.2%, primarily reflecting inventory needed to support 68 net new stores. Inventory per store increased 1.5%, reflecting the impact of store closures for most of the quarter. We will continue to closely monitor demand as we begin to reopen stores, and we'll adjust our inventory levels accordingly. Fortunately, we have not experienced any significant issues accessing inventory.
 Reflecting our proactive efforts to manage liquidity, capital expenditures for the quarter were $45.1 million compared to $71.8 million last year.
 Turning now to the rest of 2020. We continue to operate in an uncertain environment and have been working under a variety of assumptions to help us make the best financial decisions we can for our people and our business. However, the situation is dynamic, and it remains difficult to model sales and expenses with certainty. Therefore, we are not providing earnings guidance at this time.
 We are able to provide an update for a few other key model inputs. We have reduced our CapEx plan by about $100 million in response to the current operating environment. Our updated plan for the year is to invest between $200 million and $210 million, including approximately $92 million for new stores, remodels and merchandise fixtures, $80 million for supply chain and IT and about $33 million for store maintenance and other.
 We now expect to open approximately 30 to 40 new stores in 2020 and relocate 3 stores. We have chosen to defer some store openings into 2021 and are currently evaluating what the right pace of new store openings should be next year. We have a strong and profitable fleet of stores. And given the new operating environment, we plan to accelerate efforts to strengthen our fleet through relocations, negotiations with our landlord partners and potential store closures. And while we believe there's opportunity to open more stores and reach new guests, we are also evaluating our long-term store target in the U.S. given the acceleration we are experiencing with our e-commerce business.
 In closing, although we lack some near-term visibility, we remain confident in our differentiated business model and our ability to adapt to our guests' changing preferences. We believe that we have the financial strength to manage through the crisis and are making decisions to ensure Ulta Beauty is even better positioned for the long term.
 And now I'll turn the call back over to our operator to moderate the Q&A session. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Christopher Horvers from JPMorgan. 
Megan Alexander: This is actually Megan Alexander on for Chris. I was just hoping you could elaborate a bit on what you're seeing in the stores that you've reopened just in terms of pent-up demand and whether you're seeing any change in the category trends as you reopen them. And then can you just talk about any detail on what you're seeing in terms of guests using curbside versus actually coming into the stores? 
Mary Dillon: Yes. Well, we're really, I guess, I'd say pretty pleased about what we're seeing so far in terms of consumer behavior, right? So, so far, our trends are stronger than we expected in terms of sales. It varies by market. We actually have some markets comping positively, others negative. The e-commerce trends have been very encouraging. And they're remaining resilient and really accelerating because of the adoption of curbside, which we can talk more about.
 But -- and I mentioned this in the script, but the first 180 stores, if you look at their performance so far, total sales are flat to a year ago. But of course, the mix is quite different, right, between stores, curbside, BOPIS, ship to home. So I'd say overall, guest reaction has been quite positive. But we're cautious. I mean it's early, early, and we're taking a conservative stance as we look forward.
 The opportunity for us that we see as well is that I've mentioned that we've got a lot of guests who've never shopped online with us before who are now converting to omnichannel guests, I guess, out of necessity. And that guest, the more that we can keep them shopping in multiple channels, they're very valuable to us. They spend almost 3x as much historically as somebody who shops in stores only.
 So the other thing I'd add is that -- and maybe David can comment on category mix. But on the curbside, so far, we invented that. I'm very proud of the team for really kind of putting that together pretty quickly. We hadn't been doing curbside. We even had launched BOPIS in the fourth quarter of last year, and that was going really well, but we hadn't needed to do curbside yet. So I really congratulate our team for getting that stood up. And we've been pleased to see the guest reaction.
 So I'd say what they like about it is the speed, the ease and the overall enthusiasm of our first staff. We're following all the kind of social distancing and safety guidelines that you can imagine. But we feel that so far, that could be -- again as people try that, they find it as another convenient way to shop at Ulta Beauty, and we expect that will continue to be part of the mix as we go forward.
 Is there anything else you want to add on categories, Dave? 
David Kimbell: Well, the only thing I'd add on categories, and you mentioned it in the script, Mary, is that categories that were strong with us when we were operating on an e-commerce only continue to be strong. And those are kind of self-care categories and wellness categories, skincare, haircare, bath, other categories that have been -- that have accelerated throughout this crisis. But interestingly, as curbside became available, we also saw a pickup on makeup as more guests were engaging in that category. And as we've made -- as we've evolved through the initial phases of this crisis, we've seen makeup make a bit of a strengthening move as curbside has given our guests more options to engage in the category. 
Operator: And our next question is from Mark Altschwager from Robert W. Baird. 
Mark Altschwager: Maybe following up on the category trend. Wondering if you can just give us some broader perspective on the beauty cycle and how you're planning for mix shifts in the near term just with the economic backdrop. Are you seeing or expecting to see a shift to mass and masstige from prestige? Sounds like skincare has remained robust. However, as the industry starts to cycle the sharp decline in color cosmetics as we go through the mid- to late part of the year, just wondering if there's any reason to think there's a light at the end of the tunnel there from a product innovation and growth standpoint. 
Mary Dillon: Thank you, Mark. I'd say in some ways going into this, what we've seen is at the beginning of the cycle, of course, the types of things that people bought were quite different than what we've seen in the past, right, things like hand sanitizers and soaps. And then we saw folks get more engaged in things that I would call like self-care, do-it-yourself at home. So haircare, nails, that kind of thing, and then kind of more into things that are a bit more self-indulgent or self-care, like whether it's mask, skincare, fragrances for the bath, that kind of stuff. So it's just kind of interesting to see that cycle of -- the psyche of consumer behavior.
 As an aside, one thing I'll say is I feel like our team did a great job from a social media and just marketing perspective to really meet our guests where they were and kind of talk to them about those things. Engagement was really high.
 The core category trends, I'd say, were similar -- roughly similar to what we saw coming into this year, which is acceleration in skin care. We've talked about that. We see that as a big future trend. The intersection of wellness and beauty together is going to be important. I think with makeup, as Dave said, I think it's an interesting early fact that on curbside, we saw some tick-up in makeup. You can debate the 2 sides of it. But I mean anecdotally, I'd say that folks who maybe were doing -- working from home before on phone calls are now all of a sudden all working from home on video calls, and everybody is on video call.
 So will that have -- will that help bring the light at the end of the tunnel as you said? Well, certainly, makeup is still large and it's very -- customers are very engaged in that category. But it has been in a lower cycle. You're right. So could this help it? I think we'll see. We don't know. Right now, I wouldn't say that's happening in the large scale. 
Operator: And our next question is from Kate McShane from Goldman Sachs. 
Katharine McShane: I wondered if we could drill down a little bit more around your commentary about the promotional environment, maybe what you saw during the quarter and what you expect for the rest of the year. And just one housekeeping question about the impairment charge. Just how many underperforming stores account for that? And do you plan to reopen them? 
David Kimbell: Yes. So I'll start with the promotion and maybe Scott will take the impairment piece here. Yes, promotion activity, of course, like everything else, was disrupted through the quarter. Our strategy pre-COVID has been on really a multiyear journey to try to reduce broad-based promotions and be more strategic and focused on driving consumer engagement demand across all of our activities, the brands that we're bringing in, our loyalty program and other aspects of ways to engage with our guests.
 We are -- we do -- as we enter into -- as the category shifts into a reopening of stores and a recovery phase coming out of the March and April elements of this crisis, we are anticipating, as a category, potentially higher promotional activity. But our focus will continue to be on driving the more strategic aspects of our business. We have a very strong loyalty program. We've built, we think, very strong personalization capabilities, and in fact, in some ways, have strengthened aspects of that over the first part of this year. And we intend to leverage that to be more personalized and direct with our communications and aspects.
 We will lean into the most strategic aspects of our promotional -- annual promotional programs, 21 Days of Beauty, holiday, skin and hair events through the year. But of course, we're going to be nimble in the category. And while we know we're not anticipating leading a massive increase in promotional activity, we won't cede share either. So we have tools to respond appropriately in the category, and we'll do so and make sure that we're remaining competitive in the marketplace. 
Scott Settersten: To the impairment question, so the short answer is it was around 20 stores in total that were impacted by this. And really, it was 10 stores that drove the majority of the impairment charge during the quarter. The slightly longer answer is, Kate, this is going to be a multi-chapter story here. So again, the fact that we took impairment charges on these stores doesn't mean we're closing these stores necessarily. These might still be productive stores, but they just might be in higher rent kind of geographies in the United States, for example.
 And as we mentioned in our prepared remarks, we are taking a clean sheet look at the whole store fleet. So there are instances that we're looking at where maybe we're not in the best center or we're not in the best position in the center. And now with the disruption we're seeing in the retail environment, there are centers that we've been blocked from historically that we might get more aggressive on and might have opportunities now in the future. So there could be other potential store closures come somewhere down the road here. Hopefully, we can get all that house kept in fiscal 2020, but it's not all a one -- a first quarter kind of story. 
Operator: Our next question is from Kelly Crago from Citi Research. 
Kelly Crago: I was just wondering what your exposure is to some of the department stores that have announced store closings. Have you done any work there? And should we expect any sort of promotional cadence geared towards gaining that customer? And then my second question is just around vendor support given you're expecting a more promotional environment. How are those conversations going with your vendors? 
Mary Dillon: Yes. I would say we'll step back and start with department stores. I mean just in general, we have a very sort of broad competitive environment, and we think about that because we do -- we bring all things together in beauty. And as a result, we compete with everybody from department stores to mass retailers to other specialty retailers, e-commerce only. So it actually is a pretty broad competitive environment that we're in. And we pay close attention to everything that's happening and see opportunities and risks throughout.
 So I mean that's how we've always been as a business, is to play our offense and to make sure that we get the share gains that we believe we can get in certain categories. I mentioned already in the digital channel, we gained share in every category in prestige, and we were only digital in this past quarter. So we feel good about that. So that's something we pay close attention to.
 And the second part of the question was... 
David Kimbell: And vendor support. 
Mary Dillon: Vendor support. Yes. I mean listen, there was -- it's a very important time for us to be very close with our vendor partners, big and small. And so I feel very good about -- we have worked -- Dave leads the merchandising team. And you can add more to those if you like. But I mean we -- I'm proud about the fact that I feel that we've been very transparent with our vendors, share the dilemmas with them, share the opportunities with them as we move forward. And our relationships are very strong. So I certainly -- I feel very confident about our ability to come out of this stronger than ever and continue to win in the marketplace, and I think our vendor relationships will be a key part of that. 
Operator: And our next question is from Omar Saad from Evercore ISI. 
Omar Saad: Really impressive digital e-commerce growth in the quarter. Obviously, you guys have one of the best-in-class loyalty programs out there. I'm curious what you're seeing in that part of the business as stores reopen or what your expectations are for that kind of run rate you've been at. Do you expect that to moderate? Are you seeing that moderate? Is that demand shifting to more buy online pickup or curbside? What are your expectations for that strong digital growth in the intermediate term as we go from a fully locked down state to one that's more open than the store network thing? 
David Kimbell: Well, yes. We've been really, of course, pleased with the e-commerce performance. It's a part of our business that we've been building and investing in and bringing innovation into for many years, and it certainly has been paying off for us through this crisis. Obviously, as stores opened, it will decrease in its total penetration of our business from being 100% e-commerce only. But what we do believe going forward is that we've moved quite a few of our guests that have previously only shopped us in-store, has shopped us online. And that's a really positive thing.
 We know -- and Mary mentioned some of these statistics, but we know that guests shop -- that shop us in an omnichannel way are among our very best guests. They shop us more frequently, both in store and online. They spend more with us. So we anticipate, from a member standpoint, this could have some really positive lasting impacts of introducing more guests to the total Ulta Beauty experience.
 Penetration going forward, we think there will be a step change in penetration because of this introduction of omnichannel capabilities to more guests. We think it will be a higher run rate going forward, but time will tell exactly where that settles, but certainly higher than it was and a faster acceleration and adoption of our e-commerce capabilities.
 And curbside has been a big win for us. Mary said how quickly we adopted that. We were happy to have BOPIS in the fourth quarter as we rolled that out last year. To be able to shift and pivot that to curbside capability was really meaningful. And as stores have reopened, guests -- some guests are still opting for curbside capability. And so we'll sustain that going forward, and we think it adds actually a nice -- essentially a third option for our guests. If they don't want to actually come into a store at this time, they can still get their products that same day and have a great experience from Ulta. So that will be a big role going forward. 
Operator: And our next question is from Dana Telsey from Telsey Advisory Group. 
Dana Telsey: I hope everyone's and healthy. As you think about the store reopening platform and the service model in there, how do you think of employee staffing and the percentage of payroll that you'll need going forward versus what you would need in the past? And then secondly, on products and just color cosmetics, is the state of innovation or the pace of innovation that you've seen with your vendors, does that accelerate or decrease going forward? And does the closures of department stores give you more runway to gain market share even as we go through this year? 
Mary Dillon: Dana, it's Mary. Thank you. On the services staffing, I can't tell you the precise ratio there in terms of where we're going to land. But I will tell you that I actually feel that -- first of all, we're taking a conservative and cautious approach to thinking about services. But I also believe we've got a great opportunity because there's -- we have a national platform, a national brand. And there's still pretty, I'd say, low usage of our services relative to the total retail percent of business that we have. So we feel like there's a great opportunity. We also know, as you know, like our omnichannel guests, that people who use our services are spending almost 3x as much as somebody who's not.
 So it's a great opportunity. We are starting slowly, and we're starting with hair only and I would say with even stricter protocols of health and safety than just the reopening of the store, which is very strict. So there's additional steps in place to make sure that that's done safely and well. But frankly, as we started to open up, we have about 280 stores that have salons open right now. And there's a lot of pent-up demand for cut and color, as you can imagine.
 So we have many, many stores that are well booked right now. We are stylists. We kept them on the payroll largely so that we knew we could come back strong. We wanted them to stay with Ulta Beauty and help us capitalize on this opportunity over time. So over time, we'll go from hair to brows again and things like that, but we're just going to take it a step at a time.
 Your question about cosmetic innovation, maybe, Dave, if you want to add to that? 
David Kimbell: Yes. I'd say on innovation in total, certainly, this has disrupted the brand's view on innovation and timing. And in some cases, new launches have been shifted back or readjusted. But what I'd say is 2 parts to that. We felt really good about newness across categories, makeup included, skincare, haircare, fragrance coming in pre-COVID and this crisis, several new brands across the portfolio like Laura Mercier, Thrive, Pixi on the makeup side; Kiehl's, Ordinary, Indie Lee, Urban Skin Rx in skincare; Pattern, Arctic Fox, [ Wella ] in hair. Several new brands that had launched recently, in either very late Q4 or early in Q1, actually performed well throughout this crisis and will be well positioned coming out. So we still have that pipeline of newness.
 And then as we look forward over the rest of the year across categories, again, including makeup, as I said, brands, in some cases, have adjusted their plans. But as we start to get more confidence in consumer reaction and store opening timing, we will rebuild our innovation introduction time line in the second half of the year and are optimistic. We know our guests continue to be attracted to newness, both new brands and new products from existing brands. So we see a strong pipeline coming through as we work our way through this, through the 2020 and then certainly into 2021. 
Operator: Our next question is from Simeon Siegel from BMO Capital. 
Simeon Siegel: I hope you're all doing okay. Mary or Dave, how are you thinking about marketing? I know -- it's obviously the easiest lever to pull back on, but just given the balance sheet strength, is there an opportunity to actually go on the offensive there and take some share? And then just, Scott, how are you thinking about inventory savings for the rest of the year? And maybe any color you might be able to give on gross margin. 
Mary Dillon: It sounds like a party at your house, Simeon. I love it. 
Simeon Siegel: Everyone is so excited for this call. 
Mary Dillon: I'm so happy they're excited. That's awesome. 
David Kimbell: Yes. So I'm glad you asked about marketing. Yes, we have -- we really see a great opportunity to continue to build the Ulta Beauty brand and really in a lot of ways, accelerate out of this crisis behind the strength of our brand and everything that our brand represents: the assortment, the loyalty program, the guest experience, the strength of our associates and what they bring to our guests every day.
 Coming into this crisis, the work that we've done to establish our brand and to create a brand platform that is rooted in this idea of possibilities, of joy, of connection to others and the power of beauty, I think, actually that served us really well. And I'm really proud of the work that the marketing team did to shift the strategy to be really responsive and reflective of the new mindset and to more focus more on these connections and self-care and just bringing joy and happiness, which is ultimately what beauty is about through all channels.
 To your point, we believe that we have an opportunity to continue to invest in marketing because we're so, we believe, well positioned to, again, have a leadership voice in that. So while we pull back on certain elements, most notably print tactics because they have long lead time, we can't be as responsive to store dynamics or shifting consumer dynamics. We've pulled back on those elements. We've invested more in digital and social aspects.
 And as we look out over the rest of the year, it is not our plan to make a significant reduction in total marketing spend as much as shift our focus to both a messaging that's relevant and compelling as well as the tools that will be -- both give us some flexibility to adjust whatever comes ahead of us through the rest of the year. But it was also very relevant in the time frame. 
Scott Settersten: And it sounds like you had 3 questions, Simeon, right, 3 questions there. But they're important. So we'll answer the 2 -- the final 2 here. So on inventory, I would just say we're being careful. I think the team did a great job, again, high sense of urgency to monitor receipts and order flow during the depths of the crisis. And now we're back. Again, it's back to vendor relationships. Dave and Mary both alluded to being transparent and clear and having good connections with vendors because we're making orders. We're making orders, and we have been now for a number of weeks.
 So the sales throughput there on our e-commerce business, we need to stay in stock. And when the store is opening back up, we want to make sure that the newness, that the back half is flowing out there to make sure we're ready for guests to come back and visit with us.
 On the gross margin, I think we laid out the first quarter pretty thoroughly in the prepared comments. As we think about the rest of the year, I mean, that's part of the primary reason why we don't feel comfortable providing guidance for the rest of 2020 at this point. But again, you can go back through the script comments. I mean we've given you a laundry list of things that we're thinking about, right, and with the key being opportunistic as we go through the rest of 2020, whether it be pulling forward the Jacksonville fast fulfillment center here in the back half of the year, provide more capacity.
 We talked about rethinking the cadence of some of our major events and the promotional elements that go with some of those things, reassessing our assortment strategies, maybe being opportunistic about moving out of some of the slow movers, so to speak, as we go through the back half of the year. We talked about store footprint optimization. So there could be some impairment charges or closure charges that come along with those kinds of things. But again, it's not going to be a first quarter only story. This will evolve as we go through the rest of the year, and we'll be as transparent with you as we can along the way. 
Mary Dillon: So let me just close this. I really want to thank everybody for joining us today. I know at the end of every quarter, I thank my team. But honestly, in my 7 years as CEO of this company, in fact, in my career, I don't think I've ever seen a group of people leading with more resilience and heart and collaboration and more drive to win. So I want to thank the Ulta Beauty team, and we hope that you stay healthy and safe, and we look forward to speaking with all of you again in August when we report our second quarter results. Thank you. 
Operator: And this concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.

===== 2019 Q4  (2020-03-12 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Greetings, and welcome to the Ulta Beauty Fourth Quarter 2019 Earnings Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.
 It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Ms. Kiley Rawlins, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed. 
Kiley Rawlins: Thanks, Daryl. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today for Ulta Beauty's Fourth Quarter and Fiscal 2019 Earnings Conference Call. Hosting today's call are Mary Dillon, Chief Executive Officer; and Scott Settersten, Chief Financial Officer; Dave Kimbell, President, is also with us today.

 We'll begin this afternoon with prepared remarks from Mary and Scott. Following our prepared comments, we will open up the call for questions. [Operator Instructions] 
 Now I'll turn the call over to Mary. Mary? 
Mary Dillon: Thank you, Kiley, and good afternoon, everyone. Before we talk about our results, I want to address a topic that's on everyone's mind, the ongoing risk related to the spread of the coronavirus. Our first concern, of course, is the safety and well-being of our associates, guests and brand partners, and we've taken a number of actions focused on prevention to keep people safe and healthy. We've increased sanitation measures and cleaning frequency in all stores with extra focus on product testers and high traffic areas, and we've increased availability of hand sanitizers in high traffic areas, including our cash wraps, makeup stations and salon stations.
 We've posted signage in stores directing guests who want to try a product to find an associate who will sanitize testers on demand. In addition, we're implementing a no-touch approach when it comes to selling assistance, like shade matching. We have temporarily suspended all makeup, skin and brow services in stores. Based on feedback from experts, we will continue to offer hair services with an increased focus on maintaining the health and safety of our guests and associates. 
 For our associates, we're encouraging them to stay home if they're not feeling well, and we're adjusting our policies to accommodate personal and family needs and ensuring that associates who face a quarantine are compensated during that time. We've also limited travel in the U.S. and restricted international travel, and we're limiting in-person meetings, especially for large groups. And as a further step, we've canceled our Annual General Managers Conference originally scheduled for April. 
 We're closely monitoring guidance from public health officials and government agencies to make sure we have the best information to keep our associates and guests safe and informed. We have a cross-functional team meeting daily to respond to and plan for any potential impacts this may have on our associates or our operations, and we're working closely with our partners to manage any potential disruption to our supply chain. Given the highly uncertain nature of the situation, we are actively assessing various actions we can take to manage our business differently during the current environment. 
 Now I'd like to turn back to our normal course of business before opening up to your questions. Moving on to our results for 2019 and expectations for 2020. Starting with the fourth quarter. The Ulta Beauty team delivered sales and earnings that were at the high end of our expectations. To recap our fourth quarter financial performance, total sales increased 8.5%, and comp store sales increased 4% on top of a strong 9.4% comp last year. Gross margin for the quarter expanded by 10 basis points, and diluted EPS increased 7.8%. These results were achieved despite ongoing challenges in the U.S. makeup category.
 As we've discussed on previous earnings calls, the makeup category in the U.S. is experiencing a down cycle. The U.S. makeup category was negative again this quarter across both prestige and mass measured channels. We knew the fourth quarter would be challenging, given both the category headwinds in makeup and the fact that we're lapping a very strong fourth quarter last year. But our enhanced omnichannel capabilities, combined with our merchandise exclusives and cross-category marketing events, helped us deliver a successful quarter. 
 Consumer shopping patterns continue to evolve with convenient online options becoming more important during key shopping periods. Retailers who offer a great in-store experience as well as great online and omnichannel experiences, will benefit from these shifts. 
 With increased distribution center shipping capacity, Buy Online, Pick Up In Store options available in every store and enhanced app and mobile platforms in place, including a new virtual waiting room to improve the guests experience on Black Friday, Ulta Beauty was well positioned for shifting consumer preferences this holiday season and delivered strong double-digit growth in e-commerce sales. 
 We kicked off the holiday season in mid-November with Ulta Beauty Fest. With product demonstrations, influencer activations and merchandise giveaways, this new in-store event drove nice traffic to our stores and helped us comp last year's very successful launches of Kylie Cosmetics and the James Charles Palette by Morphe. Our new holiday campaign, Give, Gather, & Glow, position Ulta Beauty as the go-to destination for all things beauty and included improved promotions like Holiday Beauty Blitz and our cross-channel gift guide to inspire and help our guests with their holiday shopping. 
 In fact, holiday is a great time of year for Ulta Beauty because we participate in both gift-giving and as well what we call glamming, which is guests preparing for holiday parties and events. And with services optimization fully implemented in all stores, we saw good growth in our hair, skin and lash services during the quarter. 
 We delivered strong comp performance through key holiday periods, including Black Friday and Cyber Monday, and finished the holiday season well. Importantly, our teams did a great job resetting post-holiday and executing on our January events, Jumbo Love and Love Your Skin. And as a result, we saw a nice acceleration in sales and traffic trends post Christmas. 
 Now turning to our performance by category. We increased our market share across all major beauty categories. The skincare category delivered the strongest growth this quarter, with prestige, mass and sun care, all delivering double-digit comps. Fragrance and PCA important gift categories and haircare all delivered high single-digit comp growth this quarter.
 As expected, our makeup category was down slightly again this quarter driven by low single-digit decline in prestige cosmetics. Growth from newer brands like Kylie Cosmetics, KKW Beauty and Grande Cosmetics as well as growth from iconic prestige brands like Clinique partially driven by the expansion of these brands to additional doors, was offset by sales declines in many of our established prestige brands. 
 Mass cosmetics delivered a low single-digit comp for the quarter on top of robust double-digit growth in the fourth quarter of last year. Strong sales of brands exclusive to Ulta, including ColourPop, Florence and Juvia's Place helped to offset the impact of anniversarying the launch of the James Charles Palette last year.
 Turning now to the full year. While fiscal 2019 was more challenging than we initially planned, I'm proud of how our teams reacted and adjusted to the unexpected headwinds in the U.S. makeup category and delivered solid results for our shareholders. From a financial perspective, total sales increased 10% to $7.4 billion, and comp store sales increased 5%. We expanded gross profit margin and delivered EPS growth of 11%. Importantly, this year, we made good progress across each of our strategic imperatives, which positioned us to deliver industry-leading growth and long-term shareholder value. 
 Some of the highlights of 2019. We opened up 86 new stores, remodeled 12 stores, relocated 8 and refreshed 240 stores. We increased our unaided brand awareness by 3 points from 53% to 56% with increases across every demographic group. We gained market share across all major beauty categories. We expanded membership in Ultamate Rewards by 8% to 34.3 million active members and increased our average spend per member to $206.
 We grew Diamond and Platinum membership by 10%, which outpaced overall portfolio growth, and continue to retain these members at very high rates. We increased the number of cardholders in our Ultamate Rewards credit card program by 40%, thanks to outstanding execution from both our store and digital teams in engaging with our guests. We increased our penetration of omnichannel members. While the percentage of members to shop in-store only remains in the low 80s, the percentage of members who shop online and in-store increased to just over 12% of total members.
 We expanded the distribution for our iconic prestige brands, including Clinique, Lancôme, MAC and Estée Lauder to more doors. In total, we rolled out 973 expressions of these brands in 2019 in various in-store presentations. We completed the rollout of services optimization in all stores. As a result, we significantly improved our retention of stylists and aestheticians and are seeing encouraging trends in guest retention and average ticket.
 We delivered strong double-digit growth in e-commerce sales on top of strong double-digit growth last year. We completed the rollout of Buy Online, Pick Up In Store in all stores, refreshed our mobile app and launched Afterpay as a new payment option for online purchases. We seamlessly transitioned our Romeoville distribution center into a fast fulfillment center and improved the productivity in our full-service facilities, resulting in faster e-commerce order processing for our guests and more consistent on-time deliveries to our stores as well as better in-stocks during the holiday season.
 We began planning and building the capabilities to operate as a global beauty brand. And we continue to strengthen our culture and again achieved industry-leading associate engagement scores and accelerated our diversity and inclusion efforts across the company, culminating a national recognition, including Forbes Best Employers for Women and Best Employers for Diversity. We also raised more than $5 million to benefit life-changing breast cancer research at BCRF. 
 Now 2019 was not without challenges, but by keeping our guests and our associates at the center of all of our decisions, staying focused on the longer-term growth opportunities and also staying agile and flexible in the moment, our teams delivered solid results. 
 As I describe now our priorities for 2020, I want to acknowledge that these plans were developed before the recent changes we've made to services and do not consider any prolonged disruption to demand resulting from coronavirus. As I said earlier, we're actively assessing various actions we may take to react to the current environment, but the theme still hold and are important to discuss. 
 So first, in 2020, we expect the makeup -- U.S. makeup category will continue to be challenged, and we built a plan that reflects these headwinds while also supporting opportunities for longer-term growth. Starting with our strategic imperative to drive growth across beauty enthusiast segment and strengthen the Ulta Beauty brand, in 2019, we continue to evolve our guest messaging to reflect our brand purpose. We created stronger, more immersive storytelling in all of our communications, and we launched key partnerships with NBCUniversal Telemundo, ESSENCE and Allure to connect with key consumer segments. We also continue to optimize our marketing mix and invested in channels that drive even stronger returns, including mass channels, multicultural media, digital, streaming and emerging channels like podcast. Building on these successes in 2020, we'll continue to elevate media partnerships that help us raise awareness and deepen our connection with key beauty enthusiast segment and increase our focus on cross-category storytelling and events that reflects how our guests engage with beauty. 
 Moving to our efforts to deepen love and loyalty with our members, in 2019, we added 2.5 million guests to our loyalty program and increased our average spend per member driven by double-digit growth in our lead membership levels, credit card program and mix of omnichannel guests as well as our personalization efforts. With more than 34 million active members, we built a differentiated loyalty program that engages guests and provides us with valuable customer insights. As the program matures and as new store growth flows, we know that absolute new member growth will continue to moderate. In 2020, we'll focus our efforts to attract, educate and engage new members while also reaching out to members who haven't shopped with us in a while. We'll also sharpen our focus on increasing spend per member through more personalized experiences across categories and channels. 
 Turning now to our strategy to delight our guests with a one of a kind world-class beauty assortment, our focus in 2020 is on increasing our market share across all major beauty categories, especially in skincare, haircare and makeup. Skincare delivered double-digit comp growth and was our fastest-growing category in 2019 and remains a meaningful growth opportunity for us. In 2019, we added 47 new skincare brands to our assortment, including The Ordinary, Sunday Riley, Urban Skin Rx and most recently, belif skincare. We also increased selling space in stores and enhanced our marketing communications to support this growing category. In 2020, we'll continue these efforts with a focus on further expanding the assortment across channels to highlight emerging brands and product innovation, and we'll increase associate training and education in this category. 
 Haircare delivered high single-digit comp growth in 2019 driven by newness and a focus on key categories like color and texture. Newness in 2019, including popular brands like IGK and OUAI as well as exclusive brands like Pattern by Tracee Ellis Ross and Curlsmith. In 2020, we'll continue to focus on growth areas like texture and color care, and we'll look for additional opportunities to gain share in prestige hair. We also plan to leverage our salons and experienced stylists with signature hair events to highlight brands, educate guests and drive sales. 
 Makeup remains our largest category and delivered low single-digit comp growth in 2019. While the category continues to face near-term sales headwinds, our research continues to show strong interest in makeup among Gen Z and millennial segment. Leveraging our proprietary research and loyalty member data, in 2020, we'll focus on key brands that are driving growth, look to add new brands that address assortment opportunities and continue to explore co-creation opportunities. 
 And finally, Clean beauty continues to be a growing area of interest with our guests. Guests are engaging in a variety of areas within beauty, including ingredients, animal testing and sustainable packaging. While the demand for Clean products is strong and growing, the landscape is challenging. Regulation, particularly related to chemicals, doesn't provide the clarity that guests need or want in this space. Guests are seeking transparency and choice in the products that are aligned to their personal values, but they need help navigating the complexities. So in 2020, we intend to provide our guests with a framework to help them evaluate products based on what's most important to them. Our goal is to give our guests access to more choices, guide them along their journey and celebrate the brands and products that are aligned with this mission. We'll share more about these efforts on future calls. 
 Now moving on to beauty services. In 2019, we completed the rollout of services optimization to all stores, and as a result, delivered better trends in average ticket, guest retention and satisfaction and product attachment. We also increased stylist retention and strengthened our recruitment of experienced stylists with established client books. In 2020, we'll work to optimize these investments and to drive further improvements. To support these efforts, we'll introduce our new proprietary online booking and scheduling tool in all stores this spring. Available through the Ulta Beauty app, this tool will make it easier and more convenient for guests to schedule and manage their salon service appointment, and it will make it easier for our associates to manage their guest books. 
 Beyond our new booking tool, we've increased our focus on reinventing digital engagement. In 2019, we refreshed the Ulta Beauty app to incorporate more personalization, reinforce the value of our loyalty program and make it even easier to shop directly from the app. We also leveraged augmented reality capabilities to provide virtual try-on experiences for our guests across multiple categories. Building on these capabilities, in 2020, we'll invest to accelerate engagement with the app with the goal of transforming the app into the Ulta Beauty personal shopping assistant, where guests can track and activate points, respond to app-only personalized offers, schedule services, check store availability, engage with BOPIS and play with new looks, including lashes, brows, makeup and hair. 
 Now let me give you a quick update on our ongoing efforts to drive operational excellence and deliver efficiencies for growth. In 2019, we have leveraged our size and scale to deliver cost savings, improved key merchandise planning processes and enhanced processes to support core operational disciplines across our real estate and supply chain operations. As a result, we delivered meaningful savings to fund investments.
 In 2020, we'll build on these efforts and work to improve our operational execution through enhancing our merchandising effectiveness, optimizing our supply chain network, enhancing fulfillment capabilities and capturing additional efficiencies for growth. We'll also work to ensure we delivered expected returns from investments and process improvements we made in 2018 and 2019. 
 Finally, in 2020, we'll continue to invest to build our international capabilities as we continue to believe this is an important long-term growth opportunity. As we discussed in previous calls, Canada will be our first step towards becoming a global beauty brand and will allow us to build experience and capabilities to expand successfully into other international markets. We intend to leverage U.S. best practices to preserve what has made Ulta Beauty successful, but we'll also enhance our assortment, systems and processes to ensure that we address the unique needs of our Canadian guests. 
 In 2019, we began the effort developing our strategies, plans and requirements. In 2020, we'll ready our systems and processes and begin hiring and training new associates with the goal of offering an omnichannel experience for Canadian guests in 2021. 
 So today, we've shared with you our priorities for 2020. While we believe the U.S. makeup category will return to growth at some point, we believe it's prudent to build a plan for 2020 that assumes no improvements this year. We can certainly adjust if we start to see positive momentum in the category. 
 Before Scott discusses the financials in more detail, I want to talk about how we're thinking about the longer-term growth opportunity for Ulta Beauty. At our analyst meeting in late 2018, we talked about growth targets for 2019 through 2021 of comp sales growth in the 5% to 7% range, modest operating margin expansion and earnings growth in the mid- to high teens. Since we initially shared these expectations, the U.S. makeup category has experienced much slower sales trends than we initially expected. We remain very optimistic about our future. The beauty market is growing, and the Ulta Beauty model is strong and winning share. And we remain confident that we will see a return to growth in the U.S. makeup category, although the exact timing of recovery is still uncertain. 
 Without improvement in the U.S. makeup category, we believe we can deliver comp growth in the range of 3% to 4% and EPS growth in the high single-digit range, and our expectations for 2020 after adjusting for incentive compensation and tax benefits in 2019 are in line with this view. While we're confident that the U.S. makeup category will return to growth, it's unlikely that it will return to the elevated levels of growth seen during the most recent up-cycle. However, with more normalized growth in the U.S. makeup category, we think we can deliver mid-single-digit comp growth and low double-digit EPS growth. 
 And with that, I'll turn it over to Scott to discuss our financial results and outlook for 2020 in more detail. 
Scott Settersten: Thanks, Mary, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll begin with an overview of our fourth quarter before turning to a summary of our results for 2019, and I'll close by sharing our outlook for 2020. 
 Starting with the income statement. Q4 top line growth of 8.5% was driven by a 4% comp, strong new store productivity and robust growth in other income primarily driven by continued growth of our credit card program. The total company comp of 4% was composed of 2.2% average ticket growth and 1.8% transaction growth. Our retail comp was down slightly as growth in average ticket was more than offset by a low single-digit decline in transactions. 
 Ulta.com growth was modestly above our expected range of 20% to 30% growth driven by traffic. To provide some more color on our e-commerce performance, we were up against an easier comparison this quarter. You may recall that in the fourth quarter of 2018, we experienced a reverse channel shift given our guests' avid interest to come to stores to see and experience high-profile launches from several digitally native brands. This year, the rollout of Buy Online, Pick Up In Store and enhancements made to our app were also contributors to the e-commerce channel's outperformance. 
 From a mix perspective, makeup was 48% of our sales, down 300 points from last year. The skincare, bath and fragrance category increased 200 basis points to 25% of sales. As a percent of sales, haircare products and styling tools were flat at 18%. The services category was also flat at about 4% of sales. 
 Gross profit margin of 35% increased 10 basis points from 34.9% a year ago, primarily due to improvement in merchandise margins driven by marketing and merchandising strategies, partially offset by investments in services and supply chain. We leveraged fixed store costs slightly. 
 To provide more color on merchandise margin, the improvement year-over-year reflects ongoing benefits from our Efficiencies For Growth, or EFG, cost optimization program, which more than offset headwinds from channel and category mix. While we made good progress this year in improving the profitability across many of our merchandise categories, particularly our prestige skincare category, the softness in prestige makeup, which is our largest category as well as the expanded distribution of our iconic brands, pressured merchandise margin in the quarter. 
 The impact of promotional activity during the quarter was slightly higher than last year. As we shared on our last earnings call, we expect it to be more promotional in the quarter to offset the headwinds we are experiencing in the color cosmetics category and did indeed implement incremental promotions, many of which were in partnership with our brand partners. I would remind you that we take a holistic approach to our promotional strategy, and we're able to pull back on other promotional levers during the quarter to minimize the overall impact of merchandise margin. 
 SG&A rate of 22.4% deleveraged 90 basis points from 21.5% last year. As anticipated, we experienced the most deleverage from planned investments and growth initiatives, and we saw a deleverage of marketing expense as we invested in digital marketing campaigns and media spend to support the holiday season. We also experienced deleverage in store labor and benefits versus last year, primarily due to continued investments to support the guest experience as well as wage pressure as we adjust to rising minimum hourly wages. This was partially offset by lower incentive compensation expense, reflecting our actual financial performance versus our internal targets, which were established at the beginning of the year. 
 Operating margin of 12.5% was down 70 basis points from 13.2% in the fourth quarter of 2018. Diluted GAAP earnings per share grew 7.8% to $3.89 per share, which included a $0.06 per share benefit, primarily due to an increase in federal income tax credits, compared to $3.61 per share reported for last year's fourth quarter. 
 Before we move on, I'd like to take a moment to review our operating results for fiscal year 2019. Net sales increased 10.1% driven by a 5% comp on top of an 8.1% comp in fiscal 2018. For the year, e-commerce sales growth was near the high end of our expected range of 20% to 30% growth. 
 Operating profit for the year increased 5.5%. As Mary highlighted, our EFG efforts provided meaningful net savings in 2019. Operating profit margin also benefited from about 30 basis points of lower incentive stock -- and stock compensation expense this year as our actual results were below our internal targets. These gains were more than offset by 110 basis points of pressure from strategic investments to drive longer-term growth, including salon optimization, personalization, digital store of the future and efforts to support EFG. 
 SG&A was also pressured by increases in payroll and benefits, primarily due to continued investments to support the guest experience as well as ongoing wage pressures. Diluted GAAP earnings per share increased 11.1% to $12.15 per share, which included $0.20 per share of benefit related to income tax accounting for share-based compensation and $0.10 per share related to federal income tax credits compared to $10.94 per share in fiscal 2018, which included a $0.09 per share benefit due to income tax accounting for share-based compensation. 
 Moving on to the balance sheet and cash flow. Total inventory grew 6.5% driven by 80 net new stores. Inventory per store was approximately flat as we continue to gain efficiencies from enhanced merchandising and supply chain processes. Capital expenditures for the year were $298.5 million for new, remodeled and relocated stores, investments in IT systems, store maintenance, merchandise fixtures and supply chain activities. Free cash flow, defined as cash flow from operations less CapEx, was $802.8 million for the year. We ended the quarter with $502.3 million in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. 
 During the fourth quarter, we repurchased 681,000 shares for a cost of $174.1 million. For the full year, we repurchased 2.3 million shares for a cost of $681 million. 
 Turning now to guidance for 2020. Before I get into specifics, I'd like to provide an overview of how we are approaching this year. As Mary mentioned earlier, our outlook assumes that the U.S. makeup category remains challenged throughout the year. We are no less confident in our ability to gain share and believe we will be well positioned when the U.S. makeup category returns to growth, but we lack visibility into the exact timing of recovery. Given our expectations that top line growth will continue to be challenged, we are prioritizing our investments and slowing CapEx and SG&A growth while continuing to invest in initiatives that will further differentiate Ulta Beauty and drive long-term growth.
 Reflecting our confidence in the longer-term growth opportunity, we intend to leverage our strong financial position to accelerate our share repurchase program this year. Our Board of Directors has approved a new share repurchase authorization of $1.6 billion, which replaces the prior authorization implemented in March 2019. Yesterday, we expanded our revolver to $1 billion and extended the term to 2025. We intend to use our strong free cash flow and some of the capacity of our expanded revolver to repurchase around $1.3 billion worth of stock in fiscal 2020. 
 Now specifically for 2020, we expect to open approximately 75 net new stores, remodel or relocate 15 stores and execute 42 store refreshes or mini remodels to facilitate the addition of new brands and improvements to overall fixturing. We anticipate driving top line growth in the 7% to 8% range with total company comparable sales planned in the 3% to 4% range. Reflecting the quarterly cadence in 2019, we expect comps in the first half of the year will be near the low end of this range, and comps in the second half of the year will be near the high end of the range. We expect operating margin for the year will delever by approximately 70 to 80 basis points. 
 To give you a little bit more color on the expected puts and takes driving our operating margin expectation, overall, we expect modest gross margin expansion in 2020 with benefits from EFG and our credit card program offset by higher shrink. While shrink was flat in 2019, we started to see some adverse trends emerge. We expect other items in cost of goods, including fixed costs, supply chain cost in salon will be mostly flat as a percent of sales for the year given our comp expectations. Also embedded in our operating margin guidance is an expectation that SG&A will delever, primarily due to investments to support long-term growth and the normalization of incentive comp. While we are investing at a lower pace in 2020 than we did in 2019, we expect that investments to support international expansion, personalization, digital store of the future and other IT capabilities will result in about 60 basis points of SG&A headwind in 2020. In addition, the normalization of incentive compensation expense will result in about 30 basis points of SG&A deleverage for the year. 
 We estimate that depreciation and amortization expense will be between $310 million and $320 million. Net interest expense is expected to be approximately $9 million, and we expect our tax rate for the year to be in the range of 24% to 24.5% as we do not expect to repeat the benefit of federal income tax credit that we experienced in 2019. These assumptions result in guidance for diluted earnings per share in the range of $12.55 to $12.75 per share, assuming weighted average diluted shares of approximately $54 million. We expect to repurchase about $1.3 billion of stock in 2020. 
 While we don't provide quarterly guidance, we expect the first half of the year will be more challenging than the second half. Specifically, we expect that EPS in the first half of the year will be lower than EPS in the first half of last year as we anniversary strong comp growth, strong gross margin expansion and $0.21 in tax rate benefit from share-based compensation. We expect CapEx to be in the range of $280 million to $300 million, including approximately $165 million for new stores, remodels and merchandise fixtures, $90 million for supply chain and IT and about $35 million for store maintenance and other. 
 Finally, I would note again that our guidance for 2020 does not include assumptions for any impact related to coronavirus. The situation is dynamic, and it's very difficult to predict or quantify the impact of any potential disruption to our supply chain, changes in consumer demand or any other actions that may become necessary as events unfold. As Mary indicated, we are monitoring this evolving situation closely. We are assessing actions we can take to manage our business through this rapidly changing conditions, and we will certainly adjust our plans as necessary. 
 And now, I'll turn the call back over to the operator to moderate the Q&A session. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Rupesh Parikh of Oppenheimer. 
Rupesh Parikh: So I guess, Mary, just going back to your comments on the coronavirus, I was just curious if you can just share any color in terms of what impact you're seeing right now in your stores, and if you're seeing any changes in the behavior, I guess, the past few days. 
Mary Dillon: Thank you, Rupesh. Thanks for asking that. I guess I would start with just reiterating that our first priority is really focusing on the safety and health of our associates, our guests, our brand partners. You can imagine, as a leadership team, we're very focused on this, staying agile 24/7, focused, really action-oriented. So -- and I think, obviously, everybody in business will look at it that way. 
 And I'd say if you break it apart from a supply chain perspective, we really haven't seen any material impacts to our supply chain. Our team has been working closely with our brand partners and our carrier partners really for weeks as necessary to pull forward some inventory of high velocity SKUs. So right now, we feel pretty good about that. It's possible that it could get disrupted, but we feel good about that. 
 On the demand side, we started to see some impact, on store traffic this week, but it really varies by market. On the flip side, our e-commerce business has continued to perform strongly. And I'd say that's true broadly, really, even including affected areas. So we're keeping a close eye on all of this. It's really too early to tell how it's going to play out. But so far, that's our assessment of the situation. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Simeon Gutman of Morgan Stanley. 
Simeon Gutman: I'll get my one question in, and I'll jump off. It's somewhat of a modeling question. First, you mentioned on the makeup comps, you're not expecting an improvement. If we heard it right, I think you actually ended the year positive even though the fourth quarter was negative. If I heard that right, what is the assumption for the full year for 2020? Is it a low single digit comp? Or is it the negative run rate from the fourth quarter? 
 And then related to your point that you just said on e-commerce, Mary, doing well, what is your expectation for the mix of e-commerce, I guess, deliveries in 2020? And could that end up being low given what we're going to maybe see from consumer behavior over the next, I don't know, weeks or months? 
Mary Dillon: E-commerce deliveries, did you say, or e-commerce demand? I'm sorry, just to clarify that, Simeon. I think he's gone... 
Simeon Gutman: Thinking of the mix of the -- yes, if the deliveries goes up, what happens to the gross margin? 
Mary Dillon: Okay. So do you want to start with the category question, Dave, and then we'll come back to e-commerce? 
David Kimbell: Sure. We'll start with makeup. And yes, to reiterate one thing, we remain confident over the long term of makeup and are optimistic about the role that, that will continue to play over the long term. But as both Scott and Mary mentioned, we are uncertain about when this turnaround will happen. So specifically, wanting to answer your question, yes, we did see a combined total growth in makeup. We're anticipating that to be roughly in line or maybe slightly below that, flat to maybe slightly negative. So consistent-ish with 2019 performance and not a dramatic change in results. But again, over time, as we look at both demographic change, innovation that we feel like there's opportunities down the road, we believe that the category will be returned to health at some point. 
Mary Dillon: On the e-commerce front, yes, we're watching it closely. I mean the good news is that we feel like the investments that we've been making to improve the overall experience for our guests from the app to the platform, to the offerings as well as investing in our supply chain capabilities has put us in a good place as well as BOPIS. I mean BOPIS was a good addition to the portfolio of the omnichannel tools last year. So we'll watch it closely. I mean certainly, a shift up in that mix has some pressure on margin. But we'll -- obviously, we're going to meet consumer demand where it is and make other adjustments in the business model as we need to. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Oliver Chen of Cowen and Company. 
Oliver Chen: Mary, one of the strategies that's under -- unfolding here is social distancing in terms of the strategy to mitigate what's unfolding. What are your thoughts on how your business is best prepared in that context? And what are some levers you could pull regarding traffic and thinking about the interplay of physical traffic as well as a potential for a recession? I would love your thoughts. 
Mary Dillon: Well, again, the investments that we've been making in our digital platforms, our AR platforms, are all, I think, are smart that we have those capabilities, right? So one of the things that we're encouraging guests to do is to get engaged with our app and use our GLAM LAB to do a virtual try-on. It's really, I'd say, pretty state of the art and allows the guests to really explore a lot of different looks virtually, digitally, which is pretty cool. 
 In store, and I talked about this a little bit earlier, we've taken some steps. I mean certainly, our guests' health and safety and that of our associates is really is our top priority. We've been focused always on really cleanliness of stores, but what we've done is increase sort of some of the protocols there. We've also, as I mentioned, temporarily suspended services that are touching the face, makeup, skin and brows services. And really, I guess, doing more of a coaching, no-touch kind of approach. We're starting that right now in terms of helping our guests. 
 Having said that, hair services based on expert advice that we're getting, we're going to continue to do hair services and just continue to implement additional protections as needed. So I think that -- the other thing I would say is extra attention is being placed on things like testers and telling our guests, if you want to use a tester, if you want to see how somebody looks, go to GLAM LAB virtual try-on or an associate can help you and we'll sanitize that first. 
 So these things are fluid. We're exploring a number of options, and we'll adjust as necessary. We see our guests wanting to shop in person for beauty, and we want to accommodate them in every way that we can. But we'll stay fluid and pay close attention, obviously, make adjustments if needed. 
 I guess the other part is -- when somebody signs off now, we can't say -- I can't ask them to clarify the second question, but you did ask, Oliver, about a potential recession. And now certainly I'll just touch on that, which is that we think as a category, right, we are in a good category to be in. And that beauty is, in some ways, essential, very essential in people's lives, replenishable, kind of an affordable indulgent -- indulgence. Our business model, while it could moderate like others during a recession, our category will, we think, perform better than others in retail as we've seen historically. And of course, our model, we're able to flex based on consumer preferences. So having a broad range of price points and categories allows our guests to really have a lot of options in terms of how they spend their money. We also have a strong margin profile that allows us to invest in driving traffic. And I'd say most importantly, we've got a strong team in place that knows how to be operationally and financially disciplined. So good communication and visibility in what's occurring, flexing to meet consumer demand, that's how we're going to lead through this. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Erinn Murphy of Piper Sandler. 
Erinn Murphy: My on one question is around the loyalty program. I believe you've said there are 34 members now in -- 34 million members now in the program, which I think would be flat relative to the third quarter. So as that program matures, how do you think about the ongoing potential for transaction growth, particularly given that we did see it kind of ticked down in this quarter? Just curious on that. 
Mary Dillon: I'll let Dave take that one, Erinn. Thank you. 
David Kimbell: Yes. So I'll start with saying that we continue to be really excited about the power of our loyalty program. It did grow 8% for 2019 to 34 million, which we believe makes it one of the leading loyalty programs certainly in our space in the country and a powerful tool for us to continue to drive our business. 
 You did highlight that in the fourth quarter, growth versus the third quarter was a little slower than some of the recent trends. We would look at that as both -- as the program gets bigger, we did anticipate that it would moderate somewhat in growth, but also as we were lapping some of the strong traffic driver and new guest driver activity of some of the launches that we've talked about also made our overlap a little bit tougher as it relates to that. But we're optimistic about our opportunity to continue to reach beauty enthusiasts across the country and continue to grow that. 
 But having said that, you are right that we also see an important growth opportunity over an extended period around spend per member, and it's a big focus for us. Really, everything that we're doing is focused on continuing to find new and engaging ways for our guests to participate in Ulta whether it's the new brands we're bringing in, credit card program, innovation and loyalty services. And then of course personalization is, we believe, one of the biggest opportunities ahead of us, and we've been investing heavily in that to make sure that we can continue to find ways to delight our guests. 
 Mary and Scott both highlighted some of the things that we've been doing that we believe will drive personalization. Our app and innovation and refreshes of our app both in 2019 and more to come, we think, will drive more personalized connection. Our integration of augmented reality or virtual reality with GLAM LAB. GLAM LAB continues to get better, and we expand that across new formats like foundation and skin tone. We have skin quizzes. And we continue to get better and better on product recommendations, new member engagement, replenishment reminders, all these things, we think, will contribute to the growth that we've seen -- continue the growth that we've seen on spend per member. So both sides of the equation we are optimistic about, and we'll continue to drive that. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Steph Wissink of Jefferies. 
Stephanie Schiller Wissink: Scott, I have a question for you about the operating margin guidance. I believe you quantified about 60 basis points of the drag year-over-year from incremental investments. So a 2-part question. One is just what are you looking for to kind of justify those returns to maintain that level of incremental investment? And is it something related to market share disruption that you're watching for or that you think an opportunity exist to take incremental share in the near term? 
Scott Settersten: Yes, I would just say we look at it in a very balanced and pragmatic kind of way. So the things that we called out in our prepared remarks around the investments that we believe we need to continue to move ahead on, including the big international opportunity, again, long-term sales and margin dollar driver for us over the long term, personalization is something again that we've been working on for some time but continue to ramp up and see results now, I mean these things are helping drive sales for us today, and we think there's a lot more opportunity for that over the longer term. Salon optimization is another big one. 
 Again, we're -- it's a bit of a headwind in the first half of 2020 until we anniversary some of the start-up initial cost there, but we expect to get benefits out of that over the long term. So I mean you could just all -- these are all market share opportunity levers, and that's the way we're looking at it. And we think these are, again, the right things to do for investors for the long term. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Joe Altobello of Raymond James. 
Joseph Altobello: I guess, first, the comp impact from the suspension of makeup, skin and brow services. I don't know if you guys quantified that, but that'd be helpful. 
 And then maybe a quick one for Scott. The pace of share repurchases this year, is that going to be ratable throughout the year? Or is it more front-end loaded? 
Mary Dillon: Yes, I'll start. No, we have not quantified that yet. That was today's decision. But I would say that, certainly, one of the things, for sure, our associates that would perform those services will be actively in stores also selling products and servicing guests, right? So we hope to keep our associates engaged, and we'll see how this plays out. We'll quantify that at some point, but it's just an early decision. So we haven't done that yet. 
Scott Settersten: And the repurchases, I think for modeling, you should just assume kind of a ratable kind of run rate throughout the year. Again, I'll remind folks that we were opportunistic last year when we saw a disruption in the stock price midway through the year. We took opportunities there where we thought it was appropriate. Again, in light of what's going on with the market right now, again, we would take a very pragmatic approach. This is something that's always top of mind with us, with our Board of Directors and something that we're in constant communication on. So you can, whatever, expect us to be very measured in our approach here, right, and not put the company at risk. 
Operator: Next question comes from the line of Paul Trussell of Deutsche Bank. 
Paul Trussell: Good fourth quarter. I would want to just dig into the puts and takes around gross margin, both in regards to the up 10 basis points in 4Q and the outlook. If you can just give a little bit more color on what you're seeing in terms of the promotional environment. You called out shrink and then obviously the EFG contribution that we can expect moving forward. 
Scott Settersten: Yes. So there's a lot to unpack there. So just going back to fourth quarter, give you a little bit more color on that. So again, in our prepared remarks, I mean there's always a lot of different factors that go into the outcome of any particular quarter. So the GM, gross margin, expansion in the quarter, we're happy with the result. It was roughly in line with kind of what our expectations were. So EFG was a big component of that. We've been talking about that consistently through 2019. So that theme continues into 2020. There was definitely benefits captured there through a lot of hard work by a lot of our teams, and that's something that's a benefit that's going to produce good results for us in years to come as well. 
 The post-holiday, we called out, the events in the hair and the Jumbo Love events were great, executed well, both in-store and online, were beneficial to us. Promotion, while it was a bit higher than last year as we expected, it was a little bit less than what we had forecasted when we were looking ahead to fourth quarter. Credit card continues to deliver great incremental benefits for us. And again, that's another lever that's going to be a multiyear contributor overall to the gross margin expansion. And so those benefits were enough to offset the mix headwind, the e-commerce channel shift that we've been talking about for many years now and some of the shrink -- tougher shrink results that we had in the quarter. 
 Again, shrink, by and large, was flattish to last year, which is the good news, but it was a little bit tougher than we were expecting. All right? And so we're seeing trends there, not unlike many across the retail world. I mean you've probably seen this referred to in other places. And so this is something, again, we haven't spent a lot of time talking about with investors over time because the pendulum does swing back and forth a bit like whack-a-mole, I guess you could say. Our teams are doing a great job managing shrink. We're focused on things that we can control around processes and tools, but this is a trend that we think is going to be tougher in 2020 than we were expecting as it's probably going to mitigate some of the gross margin expansion that we were hoping for. 
 As we look ahead to next year, again, EFG helps. Shrink, a bit of a headwind. Salon optimization is going to be a bit of a headwind in the first half of the year but will moderate in the second half, and hopefully, do better than we have planned. Fixed store cost, I would say, flattish in 2020 compared to good leverage that we saw last year. Again, most of that is due to a lower comp expectation for the full year. Supply chain, doing well overall. Mary mentioned our facilities are being optimized and producing better results than expected. A little bit of pressure in supply chain late in the year. The new FFC, we start ramping up activities there. 
 One thing I would call out on the gross margin line is BOPIS. So again, we just rolled that out late in the second quarter. Really, we're just getting our hands wet with that, I guess you could say. So there's a lot of learnings that we captured during the fourth quarter, and so I think that's an area where we could see some upside potentially to help maybe drive gross margin in 2020. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Ike Boruchow of Wells Fargo. 
Irwin Boruchow: So I guess my question, going back to the corona impact on the business. Maybe just at a higher level for Mary or Scott, can you maybe talk about what percent of your makeup transactions do you believe carry some kind of in-store trial components and maybe combined with the service component of what you guys offer? And I guess where I'm going with that is I'm just trying to understand important customer trial and in-store behavior is to the sales model. 
Mary Dillon: Yes. I mean it's a good question. I would say, certainly, services in total are much, much -- it's a very small part of our business compared to what we sell at retail, right? So in general -- and most of that is hair services. So the thing is that -- and that part of the business, we're going to continue as planned. 
 Certainly, the notion of being able to try things is an important asset of how we serve up beauty, but it doesn't happen in every transaction. It really just doesn't. And also, we have the ability for our associates to still help our guests in multiple ways, right? So they can take a tester, sanitize it, put on somebody's hand to show them a color. We can use our GLAM Street -- our GLAM LAB app, which is really very realistic. And so it's early stages, but we don't really think that's something that is going to prevent people from making great transactions and decisions. We're going to do everything we can. We've got a skin match tool also on our app. So we've got tools that we think will allow that kind of consumer behavior. But we'll -- as we look at this, we'll learn more and quantify more. But if -- I mean there's no question it's the right decision to make right now in the short term, and your question is a good one about -- and this may not last for that long. We'll just have to see. But we'll do our level best to make the shopping experience online and in-store for our guests just as immersive as we can, if that makes sense. But we feel like it's fine, it's going to be the right thing to do, and guests would expect it. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Anthony Chukumba of Loop Capital Markets. 
Anthony Chukumba: So I just had a real quick question on Buy Online, Pick Up In Store. If you can just give us just a little bit more color on that now that you've been doing it for a few quarters. Just particularly in terms of penetration or just any learnings that you've gotten from doing that. 
David Kimbell: Yes, I'll take that. We're just really thrilled with the performance. Probably first and foremost, executionally, our store teams picked up this new capability and delivered it with excellence, and we're really excited about being able to offer this to our guests because our guests responded very favorably to it. As you know, we rolled that out to all stores in midyear last year, and we saw very strong adoption across the entire chain. Every store had transactions, of course, some more than others, but every store participated. Our guest was interested across small markets, big markets and everything in between. 
 We're -- it's still -- despite the success we had over the end of the year last year, it's still a relatively small part of our e-commerce business, and we're getting learnings. We're trying to understand the incrementality of BOPIS. We believe it's there, but we still have some learning to really understand what's the longer-term behavior. One thing we do know is the average ticket for our BOPIS orders is somewhat lower than a full regular e-commerce order, in part suggesting -- using that capability to avoid shipping costs or to be able to pick up items with certainty that same day. 
 So the last thing I'd say is we're seeing a nice attachment level -- attachment rate in-store, meaning those that are coming to pick up their BOPIS orders, many of them are also picking up additional items while they're there in the store. So overall, pleased but early, and we're looking forward to learning even more about ways to leverage this with our guests through 2020. 
Mary Dillon: Thanks, Dave. I'd just like to wrap up by thanking our more than 44,000 associates. We're staying focused on delivering -- serving our guests and delivering really solid results in 2019. I am very excited about the future for Ulta Beauty. I believe our business model, our strategy and our talented team will continue to drive success and create significant shareholder value. And we look forward to speaking with all of you again in May when we report our first quarter results. Thank you. 
Operator: This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.

===== 2019 Q3  (2019-12-05 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Greetings, and welcome to Ulta Beauty's Third Quarter 2019 Earnings Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. 
 It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Ms. Kiley Rawlins, Vice President, Investor Relations. Thank you. You may proceed. 
Kiley Rawlins: Thank you, Devin. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today for Ulta Beauty's Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. Hosting today's call are Mary Dillon, Chief Executive Officer; and Scott Settersten, Chief Financial Officer. Dave Kimbell, President and Chief Merchandising and Marketing Officer, is also with us today.

 We'll begin this afternoon with prepared remarks from Mary and Scott. Following our prepared comments, we will open the call for questions. [Operator Instructions] Now I'll turn the call over to Mary. Mary? 
Mary Dillon: Thank you, Kiley, and good afternoon, everyone. The Ulta Beauty team delivered another quarter of solid top line performance, gross margin expansion and EPS growth despite the current challenges facing the U.S. beauty category. 
 Our differentiated model is winning in the marketplace. We continue to gain market share across all major beauty categories, and we're extending our leadership position by creating stronger connections with our guests and engaging them in better and more exciting ways.
 Our financial performance for the quarter was generally in line with our internal expectations. To recap, total sales grew 7.9%. Comp store sales increased 3.2% on top of 7.8% growth in the third quarter of last year. Gross margin expanded by about 40 basis points, and diluted earnings per share increased 3.2%.
 As we discussed on the last earnings call, we believe the makeup category in the U.S. is experiencing a down cycle. Like other consumer categories, makeup has experienced a number of up and down cycles. The most recent growth cycle began in 2014, driven by new application techniques in looks like contouring, highlighting and brow styling and new products, such as palettes, minis and travel sizes. The rise of social media influencers, video tutorials and selfies also contributed to strong growth in the category.
 After several years of robust growth, the category began to decelerate in 2017 and turned negative in late 2018, resulting from a lack of engaging newness and incremental innovation. This negative trend has continued through 2019 with further deceleration in the most recent quarter.
 Now makeup looks and trends are constantly evolving, driven by industry innovation, fashion and pop culture. And while we've seen sales decline in the U.S. makeup category this year, consumers are still buying and wearing makeup. For example, we're seeing interest in a more natural look, which is different than bare face, and actually requires multiple products to create a neutral and glowy look.
 Alternatively, some popular culture influences are leaning into bold, unconventional applications of color and adornments like sequins and pearls. And at the spring 2020 fashion shows this fall, we saw a variety of looks ranging from natural and glowy to embellished brows, glitter and sequined eye shadows, and graphic eyeliner. 
 We know it will take time to bring newness and innovation to the category, but we're confident that the makeup category will emerge from this down cycle and return to growth. Longer-term growth drivers, such as demographic trends, remain favorable. 
 For example, Latinas are one of the fastest-growing population segments in the U.S. and they overindex in makeup usage. And Gen Z consumers who are already highly engaged in beauty, are expected to increase their usage of makeup as they age and enter the workforce, as we saw with millennial consumers.
 In addition, our proprietary research confirms that beauty enthusiasts are still passionate about makeup, use makeup as a tool for self-expression and enjoy expressing themselves with multiple looks. In the near term, we're collaborating with our brand partners to identify trends in white spaces in the category, and we're actively working on these efforts to drive incremental category innovation to reignite growth. And while it's difficult to predict the exact timing, we're confident that these efforts, combined with favorable demographic trends, will result in a return to growth for the U.S. makeup category. 
 In the meantime, we're leaning into categories that are experiencing stronger growth. For example, the skincare category is seeing nice growth in both the prestige and the mass segments. The category has experienced meaningful newness in brands innovation in terms of new brands, new products and new routines. And we're seeing that the Gen Z demographic is more engaged in skincare than other cohorts were at the same age, which bodes well for longer-term growth for the category.
 We're taking a number of actions to ensure we fully capture the opportunity of these skincare trends. For example, this year, we've added more than 30 new skincare brands to our assortment, increasing our offering across mass and prestige. And we're increasing the focus on skincare in our marketing campaigns as well as leveraging flex space in stores to highlight key brands and newness in this growing category. 
 In addition, we've expanded our multibrand Skin Bar model into 100 more stores. An important differentiator for Ulta Beauty is our ability to connect product with services to create deeper customer engagement. Almost every Ulta store offers a full array of skincare services and has a licensed esthetician onsite to provide guests with personalized recommendations. 
 About 20% of our stores feature our multibrand  Skin Bar model, which offers guests the opportunity to experience quick services like a 10-minute express facial or a 20-minute mineral infusion and to interact with different brands, including Dermalogica, Murad and Kiehl's. And the configuration of the Skin Bars frees up an average of 12 additional feet of retail space for skincare products and demystifies the skin service experience as services are performed directly on the sales floor. As a result of all these efforts, new brands, increased marketing and expanded skin services, we've continued to increase our market share of the U.S. skincare category.
 To wrap up what we're currently seeing in the U.S. beauty market trends, the skincare fragrance and hair categories are expanding, growth in the overall U.S. beauty industry continues to be constrained by softness in the makeup category. We continue to believe that the headwinds facing the makeup category are largely cyclical, resulting from a lack of incremental innovation and compelling newness. 
 We remain confident the makeup category will return to growth but recognize that it will take time. The Ulta Beauty model is winning within the beauty space, and we remain confident that our differentiated business model, our strategic investments and our highly engaged associates will enable us to drive further market share gains, positioning us well for when the makeup cycle recovers.
 Now I'd like to give you an update on the progress we've made this quarter on our strategic imperatives. Beginning with our efforts to strengthen the Ulta Beauty brand at increased loyalty, I am pleased to share that we continue to make great progress in both of these areas. From an overall awareness standpoint, our aided brand awareness remains strong at 92% and unaided brand awareness increased 2 points to 57% compared to the same period a year ago. 
 Our integrated marketing campaigns, including fall refresh, 21 Days Of Beauty and our Gorgeous Hair event all help keep us top of mind and draw engagement with guests while celebrating the emotional and inclusive power of possibilities at Ulta Beauty. I'm particularly proud of our fundraising campaign for the Breast Cancer Research Foundation, in which we brought to life stories of how donations can lead to life-changing medical advancements by featuring researchers alongside breast cancer survivors through print, in-store, digital and social media. 
 We continue to expand our social media capabilities, focusing on creating moments and spaces to drive meaningful conversations and connect with beauty enthusiasts in relevant ways. Reflecting this strategy, we've launched our first-ever TikTok campaign to support the launch of Florence by Mills, a new beauty brand from Millie Bobby Brown. Using this rising platform to showcase that the possibilities are beautiful, we ran a campaign using #BeautyIs that encouraged users to define and showcase beauty on their terms, a powerful message that Millie's brand shares. As a result of this and other social media campaigns and conversations launched this year, I am really proud to say that Ulta Beauty recently earned the #1 spot in Engagement Labs ranking for social influence amongst top Beauty & Personal Care brands in the U.S. 
 On the brand loyalty side, we've seen tremendous growth in members and engagement since converting our loyalty program to Ultimate Rewards in 2014. at the end of the third quarter, we had 33.9 million active members in our Ultimate Rewards loyalty program, an increase of 11% versus the third quarter last year. Sales from loyalty members continue to represent more than 95% of our total revenues. And importantly, we continue to see growth in average spend per member. 
 In addition to converting new members to our program, our team is focused on driving strong member engagement, especially among our new and second year members as well as reactivated members who have lapsed. To ensure we're creating a strong first impression, we've revamped our communications on the welcome to provide enhanced education about benefits of our program with personalized relevant content, along with targeted promotions to drive frequency of purchase and engagement. As a result of these efforts, we've seen positive improvement in our member retention trends.
 Recognizing that the group of new members will naturally slow as the program matures, we're increasingly focused on how we can drive greater spend per member. We continue to test and optimize personalized e-mail and push recommendations and replenishment reminders based on previous transaction activity. And we've just started to test targeted recommendations based upon other guest behaviors to improve the relevance of our recommendations to our guests.
 Expanding participation in the Ultimate Rewards credit card program is another key strategy to drive higher spend per member as we know that members who participate in the credit card program shop us more often and spend more with us. And in the third quarter, we again saw strong growth in our credit card portfolio. 
 Now moving on to our strategic imperative to delight guests with a one-of-a-kind world-class beauty assortment, the new and exclusive product launches we brought to market this year are delivering results. In the third quarter, newness drove about 25% of our total comp, driven primarily by new brands and products in skincare and haircare. From a category standpoint, we saw strong comp sales growth this quarter in skincare, fragrance, accessories and haircare. 
 Skincare continues to be one of our strongest growth categories with prestige, mass and sun care all delivering double-digit comps again this quarter. Much of this growth is a result of strong brand and product innovation as well as new skincare routines. In prestige skincare, newer brands like Kiehl's and TULA Life continue to drive strong guest engagement, while more established brands like First Aid Beauty and Dermalogica benefited from strong product newness. Recently launched brands, Sunday Riley and Kylie Skin also performed well. 
 In mass skincare, we saw strong growth across a number of brands, including The Ordinary, which we launched in select stores early in the quarter. Dermatologist-recommended brands, such as CeraVe, and newer natural brands, such as STAREs and Derma E, also continues to drive great guest engagement. Sales in sun care were strong again this quarter, driven by self-tanning and sun protection products. 
 Fragrance delivered high single-digit comp growth this quarter, driven primarily by the launch of exclusive fragrances by Ariana Grande, Jennifer Lopez and KKW Fragrance, as well as newness from luxury brands, YSL, Dolce & Gabbana and Versace.
 In the haircare category, we saw a mid-single-digit comp growth reflecting the success of our Gorgeous Hair event and the impact of new brands like IGK and Pattern, a new brand by Tracee Ellis Ross for curly, coily and textured hair available exclusively at Ulta Beauty. Sugarbearhair vitamins also continue to drive growth in the mass hair category. 
 As expected, the overall makeup category was down slightly this quarter, driven by a low single-digit decline in prestige cosmetics. Despite the challenging headwinds facing the U.S. prestige makeup market, Ulta Beauty continued to capture significant market share gains. During the quarter, we saw strong growth from our iconic prestige brands, partially driven by the expansion of these brands to additional doors. 
 Clinique and Lancôme, in particular, experienced nice growth, even after excluding gains related to distribution growth. Newer brands, including Kylie Cosmetics and KKW Beauty, also delivered nice growth in the quarter. These gains were more than offset by solid performance of other established brands in the portfolio.
 Now looking forward to the fourth quarter, we've launched 2 exciting new prestige brands just in time for the holiday season. First, we're offering an assortment of pure items by Laura Mercier on ulta.com. Our Platinum and Diamond members have premium access to the new assortment now, which will be available to all Ulta Beauty guests next week. We've also just launched an exclusive capsule collection with Thrive Causemetics, a digitally native brand founded by entrepreneur and beauty product developer, Karissa Bodnar. 
 Thrive sales products at our vegan, cruelty free and without parabens, latex and sulfates, and for every product purchase, the company makes a product donation to help women. Ulta Beauty is honored to be the exclusive retail partner to Thrive Causemetics and delighted to offer our guests the opportunity to discover and explore the products in-store for the very first time. The capsule collection includes a number of Thrive's most notable products, all for a compelling value. Look for more to come from both of these brands in 2020.
 Although the U.S. mass cosmetics markets continued to experience sales declines, our mass cosmetics division delivered a mid-single-digit comp increase in the quarter, reflecting growth from our exclusive brick-and-mortar brands, including Morphe, ColourPop and Juvia's Place. Recently launched Florence by Mills, a new brand created by Millie Bobby Brown, also performed well.
 Now shifting to our imperative to transform the in-store and beauty services experience, I am pleased to share that we're seeing a nice strengthening of our salon business, driven primarily by growth in color and texture treatments. Last quarter, we completed the rollout of our services optimization program in all stores. And as a result of these investments, we're delivering better trends in comp sales, average ticket, guest retention and satisfaction, and product attachment. We're also seeing increased stylist retention as well as stronger recruitment of experienced stylists with an established book of clients.
 We continue to implement new ways to make the shopping experience easier for guests. In the second quarter, we completed the rollout of buy online, pick up in-store to all stores, and we continue to be very pleased with how our customers are responding to this new convenience. And this quarter, we expanded our mobile pilot point-of-sale to 100 store -- higher-volume stores, which will enhance the guest experience by reducing checkout wait times, especially important during the busy holiday season.
 Now turning to real estate activity in the quarter, we opened 28 net new stores, relocated 2 stores and remodeled 3 stores compared to 39 net new stores, 1 relocation and 4 remodels in the third quarter last year, ending the quarter with 1,241 stores. New-store productivity remained strong with first year sales trending ahead of plan, and we remain on track to open 80 stores this year. 
 We also executed a number of refreshes this quarter, expanding the distribution for our iconic prestige brands, which include Benefit, Clinique, Lancôme, MAC and Estée Lauder, to more doors. Today, almost all Ulta Beauty stores carry the Clinique and Benefit brands, more than 90% of stores carry Lancôme, slightly more than half of the chain carries Estée Lauder, and nearly 1/3 of stores now carry MAC.
 Turning now to some highlights in our reinvent digital imperative. We continue to make progress in creating a more seamless omnichannel experience that meets the guests wherever they want to engage and shop. This quarter, we refreshed the Ulta Beauty app to incorporate more personalization and a stronger linkage to ultimate rewards to reinforce the value of our loyalty program. The new version includes a prominent loyalty dashboard that makes it easier for guests to track the value of their loyalty points, shows how points can add up and be more valuable, and features a fun birthday module to highlight the benefits of their birthday month. 
 We've also combined our message center and offer hub, making it easier for members to activate target offers and quickly access eligible offers, and we've added new replenishment reminders and handpicked recommendations. Both are powered by our in-house artificial intelligence engine, Waze. 
 We also continue to leverage augmented reality and artificial intelligence to create compelling beauty experiences for our guests to drive stronger brand loyalty. Within the Ulta Beauty app, guests are using GLAM LAB to virtually try on makeup for eyes, lips and cheeks, and we recently added a foundation option to help them navigate the wide variety of available shades by virtually trying them on. 
 To further extend the reach of virtual try-on experiences beyond the mobile app, this quarter, we began to experiment with try on capabilities on ulta.com. We also continue to experiment and learn as we create more virtual beauty advisers. In addition to the existing skincare adviser, we recently launched a foundation finder and a mascara and lash adviser to help our guests find what works best for their needs. 
 And late in the third quarter, we launched Afterpay as another payment option at ulta.com. Popular with millennials and budget-focused consumers, Afterpay allows shoppers to receive products immediately and pay for them in 4 installments. We're very encouraged by the early response and enthusiasm for Afterpay, and we're excited to have it in place for the holiday season. 
 We've made a lot of progress this year in pursuit of our strategic imperative, all of which position us well to drive growth in the fourth quarter. To recap, heading into the fourth quarter this year, buy online, pickup in-store is available on ulta.com and through our app, and pickup is available in all stores. Afterpay is available on ulta.com and in our mobile app. 
 We've refreshed our Ulta Beauty apps to serve our best guests better with more personalized experiences and easier access to their Ultimate Rewards benefits. We've completed services optimization in every store. We have more loyalty members and enhanced personalization capabilities. We have a lot of newness across the box, including exclusives from Millie Bobby Brown, Tracee Ellis Ross, Thrive, KKW Beauty, and Kylie Cosmetics, as well as a great collection of exclusive holiday gift sets curated by a merchandising team and brand partners. 
 And we have a great talented team of store associates who are prepared and excited to serve our guests this holiday season. We kicked off the 2019 holiday season with a new in-store event in mid-November we called the Ulta BeautyFest. Our goal is to create an immersive event across our 1,200-plus stores to engage our guests and associates. With tremendous support from 60 of our key brand partners, our store teams hosted 2 days of demonstrations, influencer activations and giveaways. The event generated a lot of traffic to our stores, and I'm pleased with how our teams executed our plan. 
 While we certainly have identified opportunities to improve the event. Overall, the guest response was positive with many of our guests making it a fun family event.
 The holiday season is in full flow, and our teams are executing well. Our holiday campaign this year reflects the diversity of our guests and honors all the reasons to give, chances to gather and ways to glow. We've elevated our Beauty Blitz program, work collaboratively with our brand partners to create new exclusive items and kits for gifting and glamming, and simplified the flow and presentation in stores and online to make it easier for guests to find gifts. We expect the beauty category will likely be more promotional this holiday season, but I'm confident that our holiday marketing campaigns and our merchandise exclusives, combined with new strategic capabilities, position us really well to deliver a successful holiday.
 In closing, while we've refined our full year guidance to reflect the year-to-date performance, our expectations for fiscal '19 have not materially changed since our last earnings call. We are working through our 2020 planning process and prioritizing our investment agenda for a year that's likely to remain challenged from a top line perspective, given the headwinds facing the cosmetics category. We'll make thoughtful choices regarding the pacing of investment as we look to deliver earnings growth in the short term, while also protecting longer-term growth potential.
 While we haven't finalized all of our decisions, we have decided to delay the opening of our Jacksonville fast fulfillment center until 2021. We've also decided to maintain our investments to build international capabilities, which would support our entry into the Canadian market. We intend to provide more detail about our expectations for 2020 on our year-end call in March, as we normally do. 
 And with that, I'll turn it over to Scott to discuss the drivers of our third quarter financials and outlook for the fourth quarter and full year in more detail. 
Scott Settersten: Thank you, Mary, and good afternoon, everyone. As Mary said earlier, today, we reported results for the third quarter that were generally in line with our internal expectation.
 Starting with the income statement. Top line growth of 7.9% was driven by a 3.2% comp, strong new-store productivity and robust growth in other income primarily driven by continued growth of our credit card program. The total company comp of 3.2% was composed of 2.3% transaction growth and 0.9% average ticket growth. Despite softness in the cosmetics category, we were pleased to see a modest increase in store traffic during the quarter. 
 From a category standpoint, cosmetics was 51% of sales, down about 200 basis points from last year while the skincare, bath and fragrance category increased 200 basis points to 21% of sales. As a percent of sales, haircare products and styling tools decreased about 100 basis point to 18% of sales, while the services category was flat at about 6% of sale. Although we no longer break out e-commerce growth specifically, ulta.com growth was at the low end of our expected range of 20% to 30% growth, driven by traffic.
 Gross profit margin of 37.1% improved 40 basis points year-over-year from 36.7%, driven by stronger merchandise margin and leverage of rent and occupancy expense. This was partially offset by investments in our services business, while our supply chain operations were roughly flat as a percent of sales.
 Merchandise margins were higher year-over-year, reflecting ongoing benefit from our efficiencies for growth, or EFG, cost-optimization program and lower promotional activity as compared to last year, which more than offset headwinds from category and channel. While promotional activity was lower as compared to last year, largely because we anniversaried the impact of last year's clearance event, promotional activity in Q3 this year was higher than we initially planned. Many of these incremental promotions were targeted using data from our loyalty program.
 SG&A rate of 26.7% deleveraged by 140 basis points compared to the prior year's rate of 25.3%. We experienced corporate overhead deleverage primarily related to anticipated investments in growth initiatives, including our efforts around digital innovation, such as omnichannel and personalization and international expansion. We also saw deleverage in store labor and benefits versus last year primarily due to continued investments to support the guest experience. This was partially offset by lower incentive compensation expense, reflecting our current financial performance as well as lower stock price. We saw leverage of marketing expense as we lapped the investments from a year ago related to the launch of our new marketing campaign.
 Operating margin of 10% of sales was down 80 basis points. Diluted GAAP earnings per share grew 3.2% to $2.25, which included a $0.02 per share benefit primarily due to an increase in federal income tax credit compared to $2.18 reported for last year's third quarter, which included a $0.02 per share benefit due to income tax accounting for share-based compensation.
 Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. We continued to manage our inventory well, improving inventory productivity while maintaining strong in-stock positions. Total inventory grew 8.9% and increased 2.1% on a per-store base, nicely below the comp rate due to an increase in net new stores and the timing of inventory shipments ahead of the holiday season. We continue to focus on investing inventory in our top sellers, new brands and product launches and ensuring that we are in a strong inventory position going into our peak holiday season.
 Capital expenditures were $89.9 million for the quarter driven by our new-store opening program, investments in IT systems, and store remodels and relocations. We ended the quarter with $208.8 million in cash and equivalents. Taking advantage of a lower share price, we repurchased more shares this quarter through our stock repurchase plan than initially planned. 
 In the quarter, we repurchased 529,000 shares at a cost of $128.6 million, leaving $388.8 million available on our $875 million authorization as of quarter end. We continue to expect to repurchase approximately 70 million of shares in fiscal 2019. 
 Turning now to guidance. Our expectations for fiscal 2019 have not materially changed since our last earnings call. For the full year, we continue to expect to open approximately 80 new stores, all of our traditional 10,000 square-foot prototypes. We plan to remodel 12 stores and relocate 8 stores and execute 270 store refreshes or mini remodels to enable the addition of new brands and improvements to overall fixturing. 
 We anticipate driving top line growth of approximately 10% with total company comparable sales planned in the 4.7% to 5% range compared to the previous guidance of 4% to 6%. We continue to expect e-commerce to grow in the 20% to 30% range. We expect to deliver diluted earnings per share in the range of $11.93 to $12.03 with approximately 60 to 70 basis points of operating margin deleverage. This compares to previous guidance of $11.86 to $12.06. Our updated EPS guidance includes the $0.02 of income tax benefit earned in the third quarter and a narrower range, reflecting the fact that there's only one quarter remaining in the year.
 We continue to expect to deliver gross profit improvement for the year, driven by merchandise margin expansion, rent and occupancy expense cost leverage and the benefits of our credit card program. These benefits will be offset by SG&A deleverage due to investments in store labor, growth initiatives and digital innovation. 
 We now plan to spend between $305 million and $315 million in CapEx. The reduction from previous guidance primarily reflects our decision to delay the opening of our fast fulfillment center in Jacksonville until 2021. We now expect full year CapEx will include approximately $170 million for new stores, remodels and merchandise fixtures; $90 million for supply chain and IT; and about $50 million for store maintenance and other. Depreciation and amortization expense is expected to be approximately $300 million. 
 We expect our tax rate for the year to be approximately 23%. This projected tax rate does not include any estimate for the potential Q4 impact of share-based compensation or federal income tax credit. 
 The fully diluted share count for the year is expected to be approximately 58 million. Our plan assumes share repurchases in 2019 in the $700 million range. 
 And now I'll turn it over to our conference call host to moderate the Q&A session. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Michael Binetti with Credit Suisse. 
Michael Binetti: Congrats on a nice quarter. I want to ask about, I guess, on the gross margin, you mentioned third quarter were -- was lower. The promotions were a little lower on the clearance but a little above your expectations. I'd love any help you could offer us on how to connect that to the fourth quarter. Do you still think the fourth quarter gross margin will be positive? I think the fourth quarter embeds EPS growth of about 1.5% to 4%, so maybe a little bit below the mid-single digits you were talking about previously. 
 I'm just trying to see if you could help us on whether that's a little bit more conservatism on the gross margin or on the SG&A line? 
Scott Settersten: Sure, Michael. So looking back at the third quarter, I would say, overall, we're happy with the results. I would -- as we said in our prepared remarks, we were lapping that large clearance event last year, so we got some natural leverage there year-over-year. And we were slightly more promotional in the end than we had anticipated back in August when we last spoke to you. And as we look out here towards the fourth quarter. We're guiding now to gross margin overall being flattish versus what we said back in late August, which we thought we could be a little better than flat, even at the low end of the guidance, and really, the biggest change there is just looking at the overall retail universe, so to speak. 
 I mean we expected it to be more promotional in the beauty space. And I think we communicated that to a lot of folks we've talked to over the last few months. But what we've seen with the ratcheting up really in the overall retail environment right now with the kind of the compressed shopping season. We're starting earlier. We've got deeper discounts across the board. And I'd just remind everyone that, in holiday season, unlike in the rest of the 3 quarters of the year, we compete with everyone in retail for wallet share, right, in the gift-giving period. 
 So this is a critical time for us. We're driving a lot of new guests to our stores. We've got roughly 80 new stores versus last year and a much larger e-commerce business with engagement there. So it's critical for us to make sure we keep healthy traffic driven to both -- through both of those channels, and we're not going to be deterred on that. We'll spend some margin right there if we need to, and we're being prudent, I would say, with our outlook here based on all the facts and circumstances here as we speak today. 
 So again, merchandise margin, a little weaker in the fourth quarter than we anticipated. And that's really the only change with the gross margin flat outlook year as we look ahead. 
Michael Binetti: Okay. Could I just follow that with a quick follow-up? I think, a year ago, you had us out for an Analyst Day. You gave us the rough framework of how you were thinking about the next few years. You just mentioned to us they pushed out some spending on Jacksonville. Does that -- do the expected efficiencies that you we baking into the multiyear plan on the margin change at all as we think multiyear out through our model because of that -- does that change at all on Jacksonville? 
Scott Settersten: So our EFG program, again, efficiencies for growth, we're seeing benefits. You're seeing benefits in the P&L right now. We're seeing them in the merch margin line item, we're also seeing them in fixed store costs there around real estate. That's helping drive some of the leverage that we're seeing there year-over-year. 
 So we're still confident in that 150 to 200 range that we shared last year. We're still confident there. We're in the early innings there. We explained then that it's a multiyear kind of program, and it starts out slow, and there's lots of different levers there. Some delivers faster, some delivers slower. So we still feel confident with what we've got in front of us and that we can execute against that. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Christopher Horvers with JPMorgan. 
Christopher Horvers: Mary, you mentioned that the industry growth slowed in 3Q relative to 2Q. Curious how you would characterize the growth since the falloff in August that you described to us last quarter. Has the industry growth been relatively flat since August, down in that, I think it was like low double digits. And have you seen any variation in cosmetics versus skincare? And all related to that, how's your market share capture evolved against the changing industry trends? 
Mary Dillon: Yes sure. Well, first of all, I'd say within the category, the issue about lack of growth is really about makeup, right? So other categories, skincare, fragrance, hair, all positive, and we've seen really strong comps in all of those categories. Makeup has been -- it was a little bit sort of bumpy around August, I'd say, big picture, Q2 was negative, and then Q3 was slightly more negative than that. 
 So not as bad as the double digits that we're seeing at the time that we have the call, so we were anticipating it will continue to be pressured. And basically, we're right, the data supports that. And it's -- again, I'll just reiterate. I -- it's tough to be in a cycle, but the cycle in the U.S. feels very much about innovation. Not just being as incremental to categories that has been in prior years. 
 And you can imagine, we're working very closely with our brand partners, big and small, and this should really bring back strong growth, and we believe the category will return to growth. There's always shifting preferences, but demographic trends really continue to be favorable for us, and our brand partners are very laser-focused on white space innovation, category growing opportunities. 
 So tough to predict when that'll turn, but we feel confident it will. Our market share capture continues to be, I think, one of the strongest parts of our story. So -- and it's a little easy to get distracted by the short term. Our long-term view is that we have the winning model, and we are, I think proven by the fact that we're driving market share growth, new guest to our loyalty program. And for us to continue to do that in this time is really important. It sets us up, we think, really well for the future. 
Christopher Horvers: So do you think then as you sort of -- given that the category growth has been relatively consistent, albeit bumpy, do you think that, as you look ahead, it's just going to be a function of, get us to July, August next year and things will sort of flatten out from a market growth perspective? 
Mary Dillon: I wish I could give you that exact timing. It's pretty [indiscernible] today. So nice try, though. But I mean we feel good about that it will turn. And I don't want to give a specific time frame. But you can imagine everybody in the industry in makeup would like to see this get improved, and it will. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Dana Telsey with Telsey Advisory Group. 
Dana Telsey: As you think about the marketing that you're doing this year as compared to last year in the holiday season, especially given that Kylie launched last holiday season, how is it different this year? And as you head to 2020 with the issues with Colour Cosmetics, how are you thinking about the marketing game plan and what you allocate to it relative to sales? 
David Kimbell: Yes. We were very positive about our total impact in the marketplace through marketing and the innovation that we're bringing into the marketplace, new brands. In marketing, specifically, we are continuing the campaign that we launched last year, Possibilities Are Beautiful. It's had a very strong reaction in the marketplace. Consumers have seen it very positively. As Mary mentioned in her remarks, our awareness continues to grow, and we're confident that we'll continue to see that success through the fourth quarter and into 2020. 
 We did have some big launches last year. You mentioned, Kylie, but we continue to bring new brands across the store this year. Mary mentioned a few of those in haircare, brands like Pattern with Tracee Ellis Ross, IGK in skincare, many of the brands that are coming in and driving growth and in makeup as well. 
 So we're working hard to continue to evolve the assortment to drive growth and reach our guests in new and compelling ways behind our Possibilities Are Beautiful campaign. So we're optimistic with that, are seeing the results, and we'll continue to drive that through 2020. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Mark Altschwager with Robert W. Baird. 
Mark Altschwager: So just wanted to ask about the updated comp guidance. I mean it doesn't still imply a strengthening in Q4 despite the tougher compare. Maybe update us on the drivers you see there to the strengthening sequentially. And then, just given the backdrop you're expecting the makeup category to remain under pressure. I mean to the extent that you're able to deliver those -- that level of comp in Q4 despite the backdrop, I guess, what changes as we get into next year, just as we think about the comp growth algorithm? 
Mary Dillon: Well, we're not guiding for next year right now, so I understand the question. I'd say, as we think about the fourth quarter, I guess, the guidance that we gave at the midpoint is moderately better than Q3. But you're right, we have a lot left that we're lapping. But I think as Dave just described, we feel like we've got a really good array of tools from the offerings, the marketing, the promotions, et cetera. And we feel like we're off to a good start. 
 And so as I said also in my call -- I mean, in my comments, there's quite a few things we have this quarter or this year that we didn't have last holiday. I think BOPUS might be one example of that. The buy online, pick-up store capability is something that we did not have last year, and it's off to a strong start for us this year. Stronger, I'd say our Ulta Beauty app is even better than before in terms of the ease of execution -- the ease of understanding what your points are and how they add up. 
 Afterpay is another one that we have this year that we didn't have last year. Our service optimization has been rolled out now across every store, and a lot of newness in the box. And again, there's Millie Bobby Brown, Tracee Ellis Ross, Thrive, KKW Beauty. There's a lot of things that are incremental to a year ago. So we look at it and feel confident that the way we're guiding is as accurate as we can make it. And coming up against a big quarter last year, I think is -- we're in a good place to do that. 
Mark Altschwager: And then just maybe quickly following up, I mean, I understand that we don't want to get into specifics for next year, but to the extent that we remain in a slower-growth mode, maybe speak to some of the areas in SG&A that you have the ability to pull back and you're comfortable pulling back on? I know you mentioned that the DC -- that any other kind of bigger buckets we should think about as we try to triangulate that leverage point. 
Mary Dillon: Actually, before -- maybe, Scott, you can take that, but I'll add because I forgot you had a second part -- a tricky 2-part question. But when you ask about that, well a little color on 2020. As I said, we would expect that the makeup category headwinds are with us for a while. That said, we are in a great position because we operate, I think everybody knows this, but across so many categories of beauty, and we have the ability to flex, and we are flexing. We had talked a lot about skincare as a category in our comments, more brands, more space, more activation. 
 So we think that, while even with the headwinds of beauty, of makeup, and that will create some tough top line environment for us in 2020, we have other categories that we're going to continue to grow well in. 
Scott Settersten: And as far as 2020 is concerned, I guess, I would just add that we've talked to a lot of investors here over the last couple months, and our communication, I think, has been consistent that we're not taking this lying down. I mean we're -- it's all hand on deck here looking at the business now in a new -- what we expect to be a lower-growth environment here for the foreseeable future. So we're looking at any and all levers on the business to see what we can do to control cost in a new kind of operating environment. 
 So we're being realistic about the current operating environment and competitive threats, but we continue to strongly to believe in our ability to drive long-term profitable growth. So as we are building our 2020 plans, we've got an eye towards balancing short-term top line pressure with the need to reduce cost in our business while also ensuring that we position Ulta Beauty to continue to win in the long term. 
 Jacksonville is just one example of something that came up that we made a decision here on recently, and there's many more of those in the queue right now that we're talking with our Board about and thinking through all the pluses and minuses, weighing the strategic benefits and the cost implications. 
 And we'll have more to say about that in our March call. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Ike Boruchow with Wells Fargo. 
Irwin Boruchow: A question for Scott. I was actually surprised and pleasantly surprised that you guys were able to get leverage in the fixed cost component of your cost of goods sold. Could you kind of tell us what's going on there? I know there's been a lot of investment and some deleverage. But on a 3% comp to get some leverage, can you just explain this to us, Scott, what exactly is going on within the fixed costs? 
 And then is that kind of -- like, is that sustainable? Should we think that way going forward that, if you can comp a 3, you can get leverage within COGS? 
Scott Settersten: Ike, there's a lot of variables that roll through any one quarter through that line. So the number, quality and timing of store openings, lease renewals, depreciation. Things we've been talking around, the EFG initiatives that we have. So the team's making great progress on that, and we're seeing some of that roll through 2019. 
 So we're very happy with what we were able to deliver on the third quarter. We're going to stay focused on EFG and optimization, and all those things are working. Our real estate team is doing a great job working with our landlord partners to make sure we got fair economic deals as we look across a 1,200-plus store fleet. So we still think there's good progress to be made there. 
 And I just want to -- just to remind people, again, as we continue to look at how we can manage our business in a lower top line environment, this is a good example of things that we can do. Again, it's not necessarily going to be a straight line or a hockey stick up and to the right, Ike, but it shows that we're flexible, and we can manage the business. 
Irwin Boruchow: Got it. And this is a quick one for Mary. I'm going to give this a shot. So you guys said you expect the makeup headwinds to stay there for a while, lower-growth environment for the foreseeable future. I guess, what I'm asking -- I'm not asking for guidance, but Mary, would you expect this 3% comp to kind of be the trough of the business? Or is it just impossible to tell at this point? I just figured I'd ask you that. 
Mary Dillon: A second nice try. I like that. Yes. I guess, I just want to be clear though, I mean, I hope this comes through, that we feel very strongly that our business model is working, and we're no less confident in the long-term attractiveness of our business model at all. We're outperforming the rest of the market in terms of gaining market share. I feel very good about our capabilities, our brand awareness, our omnichannel capabilities, which are so important right now, right? Our digital capabilities, we're the destination preferred for teens. That's really important as we think about the future of the business. 
 And so, everything from services to how we operate in store, I think, are just really exceptionally well-executed right now. So being a little patient and taking a long view on the category is an important stance for us and not getting ahead of our skis on this. 
 And so if we could call it better, we would. We don't have control of everything that happens in this industry, obviously, but we've got great partners that are working hard with us to make sure that we continue to bring this back to growth. 
 So -- but I think, as Scott said, we were, I think, taking a realistic and cautious look or view of the current operating environment and planning for that. I think that's the most pragmatic thing for us to do as we plan for 2020. But I don't -- so in terms of what that number looks like, we'll talk more about that when we get to March. But that's how we're viewing this. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Goldsmith with UBS. 
Michael Goldsmith: In response to the deceleration in cosmetic, how have your conversations with suppliers evolved? Have they been more willing to provide more support than they have in the past? Are they taking a more collaborative view on innovation? Are they talking about their product pipeline and introductions any differently? And then also, are you seeing any signs of stabilization from the prestige business? 
David Kimbell: Yes. I would say our brand partners across the board are very engaged and very focused as we are in both understanding and turning around the challenges in the makeup category. And so their level of engagement has always been high. What I'd say is different now than what we've been experiencing over the period of growth over the last few years is much deeper effort to understand consumer behavior, a much more robust focus on driving new forms of innovation that'll really be incremental to really uncover new habits and behaviors for consumers. 
 So we're seeing that across the board with our end partners, and we're very -- feeling very positive about the engagement that we're getting, the level of focus that they have because they're obviously very incented to drive return to growth in this category. So we feel good about it. I think as both Mary and Scott has said, it's hard to predict exactly when the category is going to turn around, but we're working hard every day. And we have a lot of bright spots that, while the category is challenged, the work we're doing to bring in new brands to bring in exclusive brands, brands like Morphe, Juvia's Place, new launches like Thrive, KKW. 
 So even in a tough market, we're gaining share because our strategy is working by both partnering with new brands and then returning to growth with existing brands. So everybody is working hard on this, and we feel confident that the category will return to growth. And we're working to make sure that's as soon as possible. 
Michael Goldsmith: And just following up on that point, it seems like outside the deceleration in cosmetics, other categories were generally steady, maybe fragrance accelerated a bit here -- decelerated a little, but is there any risk in the reduced interest in cosmetics could bleed into other categories and start to drag them down? 
David Kimbell: Well, we do feel -- continue to see strength across the nonmakeup parts of our business, and that's a great part of our overall model because we do have all things beauty all in one place. So strength in hair and skin and bath and sun and fragrance. And as we mentioned, traffic was modestly positive. So consumers are absolutely still coming into store. We're gaining new members. So we had strong new member growth because they're attracted to the whole portfolio. 
 So we're not anticipating a big impact on the other parts of the business. If anything, as consumers are maybe slowing in their engagement and makeup to a moderate extent, we're certainly seeing greater growth and focus on skincare and the merging of those categories in some ways as brands are looking for ways to drive new growth. So no, we don't think that will have a long-term impact. And as I said, we're optimistic that makeup will stabilize and get back to a growth spot over time. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Adrienne Yih with Barclays. 
Adrienne Yih-Tennant: Mary, I was wondering if you could talk about the purchase -- Coty purchased a majority share of Kylie Cosmetics. How does that impact your exclusive relationship? And then if you could also talk maybe, David, about the KKW launch in the third quarter? When did it launch? And then in terms of SKU count, was it same, larger than the Kylie launch last year? 
 And really, really quick one. Scott, can you give us any color on areas where you could cut SG&A or in the EFG program for next year. 
David Kimbell: So yes, let me start with your question about Coty and Kylie. So Kylie -- we've had a fantastic relationship with the Kylie business and the Kylie team. It has certainly contributed to our comp growth. We're pleased with the brand. It's been driving excitement and new guest, and so we're really happy with the overall performance. 
 And the Kylie-Coty partnership is new and still being finalized, but we have a great relationship with Coty, and we anticipate a lot of positive opportunity to continue to grow those brands together going forward. So we're really positive about that. 
 KKW has been a nice addition to our business. We launched it in all stores on a customized end cap late in the third quarter, and we're very pleased with the results, and again, the partnership we've had with that brand. It's a different assortment. Kylie, if you remember, when we launched, was a limited assortment, predominantly lip kits and some individual lip that's expanded over time. 
 KKW has a broader assortment across different segments of makeup. And so it is a different assortment and a different approach, reflective of the different strengths of each of those brands. So again, glad to have KKW in our portfolio and feeling good about the early results of that business. 
Scott Settersten: Yes. So with respect to 2020 in SG&A. I know that's at the top of everyone's list, is what does 2020 look like? And we -- it's still a little just -- it's too early for us to give too much detail on that. But when we think about SG&A, the types of costs that are in there and roll through our SG&A line are store labor, variable store expenses, corporate overhead people costs, and then innovation investments, right, that roll through there that are long term in nature that are going to help us grow our business. 
 So when we think about EFG, EFG sprinkles all through the P&L. So there's a lot of work underway there to try to optimize the business, whether it's in the gross margin line through some of the merchandise margin things we've talked about with transitions and even the clearance event that we mentioned that we're getting a benefit of this year. I mean that's part of EFG as well. I mean we're doing a lot of work on how the transitions work in our stores so that we have less clearance items at the end of the day that we have to take markdowns on. 
 So it's going to be a balanced view. I would tell you that EFG applies equally on the margin -- gross margin line as it does on SG&A, and we're just going to be very thoughtful as we think about what the right balance is for 2020 and beyond. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Omar Saad with Evercore ISI. 
Omar Saad: I wanted to follow up on some of the commentary around color, makeup and cosmetics. I know you guys are focused on it. You're working with your brand partners, all different levels. It sounds like the whole industry is really focused on this issue. 
 Is there anything that you can see in your, obviously, robust data stream that gives some insight into the behavior around this category? Are there certain types of customers where you're seeing that spend and that category slow, whether it's age or regional or demographic? Or is it pretty much across the board? 
 And I guess, I'm ultimately asking the question, is there any change in behavior as new generations come of age and enter the category in terms of how they're consuming the category? 
Mary Dillon: Yes. I'm happy to take that. First of all, let me step back and say, we're all showing a heck a lot of makeup still. It's not like people aren't wearing makeup. I think that's really important that this is about growth versus year ago, really, at that most macro level. It's really about -- our main thesis is that there just isn't as many items that people are adding to their basket that are creating -- that are new rituals like things like contouring or doing your brows. 
 So people are buying lots of makeup, and we'd say, engagement in the category is still quite high but just not at the level it was with the kind of newness that we'd seen for a few years. That's all solvable. That's around finding new consumer insights around white spaces and whatnot. So I think that that's kind of at a macro, what we think is happening. 
 The -- when we think about it, there's also, I think, some misnomers about Gen Z. I mean all of our data on Gen Z show that they're very engaged in the category. And in fact, the good news, too, is that they're also getting engaged in skin at a younger age than people did with older consumers when they were at that age. That means they'll carry that habit forward. As they get into the workforce, they start wearing and using more makeup. So that, we think, is a positive factor. And as we also said, just looking at other demographic trends, we feel very positive about the ability that we don't see people turning away from makeup. In fact, we see them turning more to it. 
 The other thing I'd say is that there's always been a segment of women in the U.S. that don't wear makeup and aren't engaged in the category. That's not new. We've never counted on that segment. It's a small segment. We never counted on that segment for growth for our business model. We focus on the beauty enthusiast, which represent 77% of sales in the U.S. in terms of beauty, and that's -- and we still only have 1/3 of them in our Ultimate Rewards program. 
 So we've got lots of potential. We think it's 77% of spend, beauty enthusiasts out there for us to continue to grow with. So we think that, as the category and the industry gets back to more incremental type category growth, we'll see this begin to change. 
Omar Saad: Is there anything that you can read into this natural trend that's informative for the color trend, Mary? 
Mary Dillon: Yes. And I've mentioned this in the script, too. Certainly, a more -- we see -- I'd say it's almost like a bifurcation of things. We see a natural -- more natural look, for sure, but anybody who wears makeup knows that, that requires, sometimes, quite a few products to achieve that. It's not a bare face. You might look tomorrow and see celebrities out there taking barefaced selfies. If everybody looked like that, we'd be having a different conversation, but that's not -- so even a barefaced more natural look is really about using products that create that look, a dewy look, a more neutral eye, et cetera? Conversely, if you look at what's happening in the Paris fashion shows in the spring, there was some very cool extreme eye makeup looks, too. 
 So it all kind of -- not everybody does one thing, I guess, is the best way to think about it. And even a more natural look presents plenty of opportunity for product innovation. 
Operator: And ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back over to Mary Dillon for any closing remarks. 
Mary Dillon: Thank you. I'd just like to close by thanking all of the Ulta Beauty associates across our stores, distribution centers, and our headquarters for delivering another quarter of solid financial results, at the same time, executing against our longer-term strategic imperatives and working really hard to get our stores, website and DCs ready for this busy holiday season. 
 So we look forward to speaking with all of you again in March, and we'll be reporting our fourth quarter results then and hope you all have a happy holiday. 
Operator: This concludes today's teleconference. You may now disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation, and have a wonderful day.

===== 2019 Q2  (2019-08-29 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Greetings, and welcome to the Ulta Beauty Second Quarter 2019 Earnings Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.
 It is now my pleasure to introduce you to your host, Ms. Kiley Rawlins, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please proceed.

We'll begin this morning with -- or this afternoon with prepared remarks from Mary and Scott. Following our prepared comments, we will open the call for questions. To allow us to accommodate as many of you as possible during the hour scheduled for this call, we ask that you ask one question only during the Q&A session. 
 Now I'll turn the call over to Mary. Mary? 
Mary Dillon: Thank you, Kiley, and good afternoon, everyone. The Ulta Beauty team delivered another quarter of solid top line performance, gross margin expansion and double-digit earnings growth. To recap our financial performance for the quarter, total sales grew 12%; comp store sales increased 6.2% on top of 6.5% growth in the second quarter of last year; gross margin expanded by 40 basis points; and diluted earnings per share, excluding the tax benefits, increased 11.5%. 
 Looking forward, however, we've adjusted our expectations for the second half of 2019 to reflect the headwinds and volatility we're currently seeing in the U.S. cosmetics market, and we'll share more with you how we're thinking about the current sales environment. But let me reiterate, our differentiated model is winning in the marketplace, and we continue to invest in building the long-term capabilities that will further expand our leadership position in the dynamic beauty industry.
 Year-to-date, we've continued to expand our market share across most categories, increased our brand awareness, delivered double-digit growth in active loyalty members, increased traffic and delivered double-digit growth in almost every key merchandise category. I will also add that our salon business is showing real comp strength as we're executing on our optimization strategies. 
 That said, the cosmetics category at Ulta, which is roughly 50% of our business and one of our highest margin categories, has only delivered in the low single-digit growth year-to-date, well outperforming the market, but below our expectations. So let me explain more. 
 Ulta Beauty continues to drive meaningful market share growth in makeup across mass and prestige, but it's clear that cosmetics in the overall U.S. market is challenged. After several years of very strong performance, growth in the makeup category has been decelerating over the last 2 years, but recently turned negative. Based on the latest track data, the cosmetics category in the total U.S. market has experienced mid-single-digit declines through the first 6 months of 2019 and has been more volatile in recent weeks. 
 Notably, when we look at sales growth by brand, we see that most of the top brands across both mass and prestige are negative year-to-date. We'd expected this trend to stabilize and improve as we move through 2019, but we now believe that the softness we've seen so far in 2019 will continue through the remainder of the year. 
 We believe that the main issue driving this softer cycle in cosmetics is that the newness and innovation that have been the focus of most brands this year has just not driven the kind of incremental growth we've enjoyed for some period of time. Over the past several years, we've seen strong growth in cosmetics, driven by new rituals and application techniques, like contouring and brow styling, and innovative new product formats like liquid lip, palettes and minis. This innovation resulted in new makeup routines requiring new products which drove strong incremental growth. The most recent cycle of innovation has just not driven those behaviors, resulting in a soft cycle for the cosmetics category in the U.S. as innovation and newness brought to the market has not driven the expected growth.
 By contrast, as I mentioned earlier, we're seeing very strong growth in every other category. In the case of skincare, category and brand innovation is driving new rituals and incremental purchases, thus driving strong comps. And we're continuing to drive market share gains in the category, but of course, skin care is a smaller part of the business. 
 We believe the industry-wide challenges in the makeup category will continue in the near term, and as a result, we've adjusted our outlook for the rest of 2019 to reflect ongoing volatility in the category. 
 Leveraging our guest insights, we are working very closely with all of our brand partners to ensure that the innovation pipeline pivots to more exciting incremental innovation. We are optimistic the cosmetic category in the U.S. market will move back to growth, but we need more time to move through this innovation cycle. 
 In the meantime, our team is laser focused on the exceptional execution and guest experience that we know our team delivers in-store and online. We'll continue to build on our momentum in non-makeup categories while we work to stabilize growth in makeup categories. To that end, we have a number of exciting new and exclusive product launches planned for the second half which I'll discuss in more detail in a little bit. 
 Despite the near-term headwinds, we remain confident that our differentiated and diverse business model, our commitment to our strategic investment, and our highly engaged associates will continue to drive market share gains and deliver strong returns for our shareholders. Let me give you now an update on the progress we've made this year on our strategic imperatives.
 Our first strategic imperative is to drive growth across beauty enthusiast segments, and we're making good progress. Reflecting data for the February through July period, Ulta Beauty now represents 24.5% of the prestige beauty market, as tracked by NPD, an increase of 210 basis points from a year ago. 
 We continue to expand our brick-and-mortar footprint. In the second quarter, we opened 17 net new stores, relocated 4 stores and remodeled 8 stores compared to 19 net new stores, 1 relocation and 7 remodels in the second quarter of last year, ending the quarter with 1,213 stores. New store productivity remains strong, with first year sales trending ahead of plan, and we remain on track to open 80 stores this year. 
 Now turning to our second imperative, to deepen love and loyalty for the Ulta Beauty brand, our brand awareness continues to grow, and our "Possibilities are Beautiful" campaign and inclusive positioning have been very well received and very effective as measured by our marketing analytics tools. Unaided awareness grew by 5 points to 56% compared to the same period a year ago, and our aided awareness increased to 91% from 90%. 
 Importantly, we continue to strengthen our connection with consumers across the spectrum, including the increasingly influential Gen Z segment, where we've been recognized as a leader among beauty retailers. Guests also continue to respond well to the compelling combination of our loyalty, credit card and gift card programs, resulting in double-digit growth in all 3 programs for the second quarter. 
 Our Ultamate Rewards loyalty program has grown to 33.2 million active members, an increase of about 13% since the second quarter of last year. We continue to see nice growth in the number of guests who achieve platinum and diamond status, our most engaged guests as well as growth in overall sales per member. 
 Our loyalty members account for more than 95% of sales, and we're using insights about preferences to create more personalized recommendations, replenishment reminders and unique offers, all to drive deeper engagement and increase spend per member. We're making nice progress on this effort as the number of guests receiving these personalized recommendations and replenishment reminders continues to grow. 
 We've also begun to use artificial intelligence in our effort to drive promotional effectiveness. By leveraging data, we're identifying guest responsiveness to different types of offers and using these insights to help us determine the best offer to present to each guest with the goal of building a larger basket and driving incremental sales. 
 Our marketing events in the second quarter were anchored by omnichannel campaigns, including our Gorgeous Hair event, our new Summer Splash campaign and our semiannual Jumbo Love event. We augmented these multiweek events with a number of new smaller events, including Mascara Bonanza and National Lipstick Day. 
 Now turning to our imperative to deliver a world-class beauty assortment. Our merchant team is doing a great job curating a highly differentiated omnichannel offering across all of our categories. Newness drove about 20% of our total comp this quarter, driven primarily by new items in skincare and cosmetics. 
 From a category standpoint, we saw strong sales growth this quarter in skincare, hair care and personal care appliances. Skincare continues to be one of our strongest growth categories, with prestige, mask and sun care all delivering double-digit comps this quarter. As I mentioned earlier, this category strength is being driven by strong innovation, supported by new ingredients like moisturizers with SPF and sunless tanners and new skincare rituals like serums and masks. 
 Mask skincare delivered strong comps driven by growth from both new and core brands. We implemented our mask skincare reset in July and added several new brands for assortment such as ACURE, a clean skincare line; and a brand called Naturally Good For You, which includes both skincare and supplements in the regime. We also launched The Ordinary, a skincare collection founded to offer results-driven products at an affordable price point. We initially launched The Ordinary on ulta.com and recently expanded the brand to 400 stores. Sales in suncare were also robust driven by an expanded selection of self-tanning products and sun protection options. 
 In prestige skincare, newer brands like Kiehl's and Tula Life drove strong guest engagement, while more established brands like Dermalogica benefited from strong product newness. In addition, new exclusive emerging brands, including Awake, Fountain of Truth and Cannuka all contributed to the strong growth in the second quarter. And earlier this month, we launched a favorite indie brand Sunday Riley in all stores, and later this quarter, we'll extend our exclusive partnership with Kylie Cosmetics with the introduction of our full line of Kylie Skin also in all doors. 
 Haircare delivered another quarter of strong high single-digit comp growth, reflecting the success of our Gorgeous Hair and Jumbo Love events and supported by the reflow we completed in the first quarter. Fragrance delivered solid mid-single-digit growth this quarter, driven primarily by Ulta Beauty exclusive as well as newness from luxury brands YSL and Versace. We have some exciting new exclusives coming in fragrance this quarter, including Thank U, Next, a fragrance from Ariana Grande. Personal care appliances delivered strong double-digit growth driven by strong demand for Dyson products and the Revlon One-Step Volumizer Hair Dryer as well as new one-step products from Bed Head and Hot Tools. 
 Now as we discussed earlier, the cosmetics category overall at Ulta delivered low single-digit comp for the quarter, reflecting double-digit growth in mass cosmetics and low single-digit growth in prestige cosmetics, including ICONIC brand. This performance was in spite of weak category trends in the U.S. market, as I mentioned before, especially in prestige. Due to the strength of our business model and ability to secure some important exclusives, we continue to drive significant market share gains in the category.
 Mass cosmetics continued to benefit from the reflow we completed earlier this year which allocated additional space for exclusive or limited distribution brands. In addition, newness continues to drive strong growth in traffic, especially with our exclusive brick-and-mortar brands such as Morphe and Juvia's Place. In addition, we continued to deliver newness and innovation through the Ulta Beauty Collection. In the second quarter, we partnered with Frida Kahlo Corporation to launch an exclusive makeup line within the Ulta Beauty Collection, and guest response to the collection has exceeded our expectation. 
 And earlier this month, we debuted the exclusive Girls United collection, created by 6 talented African-American young women through a special mentoring initiative with ESSENCE magazine. Prestige cosmetics was mixed. We continue to see strong growth from our iconic prestige brands driven primarily by the expansion of Clinique and Lancôme to additional stores. 
 In addition, prestige cosmetics sales benefited from strong growth from new brands such as Kylie Cosmetics, and newness, including the introduction of Tarte's Big Ego Mascara, which launched [ versatile ] to Beauty, and the expansion of a collection of vegan and cruelty-free lashes for multiple brands, including Tarte and Velour. These gains were offset by soft performance in a number of other established brands in the portfolio. 
 Looking forward to the second half of the year, we have a number of new exclusive product and brand launches planned, which we believe will have a strong appeal for our guests. In prestige, we have an exciting new exclusive brand launch planned this quarter. KKW Beauty by Kim Kardashian West is coming to Ulta Beauty. With more than 146 million Instagram followers, Kim is one of the strongest forces in pop culture, and we are very excited to extend our partnership with her. 
 The new collection will launch with 67 SKUs and include products that are most iconic to Kim, including contour and highlight kits, new lip and versatile eye looks. And for holiday, we'll offer our guests 2 exclusive holiday kits available only at Ulta Beauty. 
 We also have some exciting news to share in mass cosmetics. We just unveiled the launch of Florence by Mills, a collection created by Millie Bobby Brown, star of a Stranger Things. Millie is an influential voice within her generation, and has more than 27 million followers on Instagram. Exclusive to Ulta Beauty, Florence by Mills offers a fresh, fun approach to clean beauty with a universal range of both skincare and makeup products that will appeal to all guests, especially Gen Z. 
 In addition, we have a number of new Morphe collaborations with key influencers in the pipeline for the second half. The first collaboration launched just this week with Jeffree Star, one of the most prominent social media influencers in beauty today, and offers guests a collection of makeup and accessories. 
 As we've discussed on previous calls, emerging brands and digitally native brands are driving new growth within the beauty channel. At Ulta Beauty, we have a strong track record of successfully working with digitally native and emerging beauty brands. And our footprint of more than 1,200 stores and more than 30 million loyalty members positions us very well to be a great partner to these brands as they evolve and expand their reach. 
 To support this effort, last year, we created a new dedicated team within our merchandising organization to focus on identifying smaller or emerging brands across all beauty categories and working with them closely to ensure they're successful in a retail environment. Year-to-date, this team has launched more than 30 unique new brands. 
 To showcase these brands and give guests the opportunity to discover, explore and play with new emerging brands, we debuted Sparked at Ulta Beauty at Beautycon earlier this month. Sparked at Ulta Beauty is a new platform designed to feature a curated, ever-evolving selection of emerging brands across all categories in select stores and on ulta.com. 
 While we're optimistic that these exciting makeup initiatives will enable us to continue to gain market share throughout the remainder of the year, we believe the U.S. cosmetics category will continue to be soft in the second half, driving further declines in several leading brands and pressuring total makeup results at Ulta. 
 Now moving on to our imperative to transform the in-store and beauty services experience, we've completed our services optimization program at all stores, and we are very encouraged by the improving trends we're seeing across the board, in staff recruitment and retention, average ticket and guest engagement. As a reminder, this effort is both associate and guest-facing. 
 To attract and retain top talent, we've implemented a more compelling compensation structure and a newly formed field-based leadership team to support industry-leading training and education programs. For the guests, we've simplified our service menu, introduced new services and made our pricing easier to understand. 
 We continue to leverage our highly influential Pro Hair team, which is made up of industry-leading educators and platform artists, which helps us attract top talent. This talented and award-winning team is creating excitement and raising awareness of Ulta Beauty's brand within the beauty industry through participation in national and local events that highlight the artistry and opportunity that exist at Ulta Beauty.
 In addition to optimizing the services business, we're also integrating our services business with more of our marketing campaigns and larger merchandising strategies. In conjunction with our Gorgeous Hair event, we launched a new blowout program, introducing 5 new looks created by the award-winning Ulta Beauty Pro team. And we continue to leverage back bar takeovers to introduce new brands like Living Proof and ELEMIS to guests and to drive add-on purchases.
 Now I'll turn to our fifth strategic imperative, to reinvent beauty digital engagement. During the second quarter, we successfully completed the rollout of buy online, pick-up in store to all stores. While it's still early, guest response to this convenient omnichannel experience has exceeded our initial expectations. We know our omnichannel guests are our best guests, and we believe this capability will make it even easier for guests to seamlessly shop between our online store and our physical stores. In conjunction with the launch of BOPIS, we also enhanced our mobile site and app with an improved product detail page that has a cleaner look and feel, including better visibility to in-store inventory availability. 
 We continue to leverage augmented reality and artificial intelligence to create compelling beauty experiences for our guests. During the second quarter, we updated GLAM LAB, our virtual try and experience, to include live try on for Android devices. We also began testing our skincare virtual beauty adviser online, which is powered by AI and AR, and provides guests easy ways to get skincare advice.
 Lastly, I'd like to announce 2 partnerships in the digital space. First, we recently announced a new exclusive partnership with Samsung and Revieve to provide beauty enthusiasts with access to personalized skincare diagnostic information, targeted product recommendations and the ability to quickly purchase products from ulta.com directly through Samsung's virtual assistant, Bixby Vision. 
 And second, later this year, we'll offer our guests the ability to use Afterpay on ulta.com. We know that some guests, particularly younger ones, are sensitive to accumulating personal debt. Afterpay allow shoppers to receive products immediately and pay for them in 4 installments without taking out a traditional loan or paying upfront fees or interests. Afterpay's "buy now, pay later" option will offer guests more freedom and flexibility without the wait. Underpinning and fueling our strategic imperatives are our ongoing efforts to deliver operational excellence and drive greater efficiencies. We continue to enhance our supply chain investments, including a recent end-to-end optimization of our store shipment categories, which both improve DC processing efficiency and reduce sorting time for products in stores. In addition, our store on-time delivery trend continued to improve this quarter delivering 80 basis points of improvement over last year. 
 And finally, we continue to make progress toward our goal of 2-day e-commerce shipping by 2021, with the successful conversion of our Romeoville distribution center to an e-commerce fast fulfillment center. The team completed the transition seamlessly and was able to leverage much of the existing infrastructure for the new operation. The facility began fulfilling guest orders in early August and is currently fulfilling about 10% of our total e-commerce volume.
 With that, I'll turn it over to Scott to discuss our second quarter financials and our updated outlook for the rest of the year in more detail. 
Scott Settersten: Thank you, Mary, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll start with the income statement. Sales growth of 12% was driven by a 6.2% comp and strong new store productivity. Increased traffic drove the majority of our comp for the quarter, with transaction growth of 5.4% and ticket growth of 0.8%. Although we no longer break out e-commerce growth specifically, I can share that ultra.com growth was towards the high end of our expectations of 20% to 30% growth, driven by traffic. 
 Looking at trends through the quarter. We began to see more volatility in our sales trends in July and pulled a number of levers to drive traffic and deliver healthy top line growth. On the gross profit line, margin of 36.4% improved 40 basis points year-over-year from 36%, driven by leverage of rent and occupancy expense and stronger merchandise margin, partially offset by investments in our services business. 
 Our supply chain operations were roughly flat as a percent of sales as leveraging our DC operations was offset by growth in e-commerce. To provide more color on our merchandise margin, we continued to benefit from efforts related to our efficiencies for growth, or EFG program. This goodness was offset by increased promotional activity to drive traffic as well as ongoing mix headwinds. 
 SG&A rate of 23.6% deleveraged by 90 basis points compared to the prior year's rate of 22.7%, reflecting planned deleverage and corporate overhead related to investments in growth initiatives, including our efforts around digital innovation, including omnichannel and personalization, and our recently announced Canadian expansion. We also saw deleverage in store labor versus last year, primarily due to continued investments to support the guest experience. 
 Operating margin of 12.5% of sales was down 50 basis points. Given our investment agenda, we had planned for operating margin deleverage for the quarter. The effective tax rate for the quarter decreased to 23.1% compared to 23.9% in the second quarter last year primarily due to an increase in federal income tax credits. Diluted GAAP earnings per share grew 12.2% to $2.76 compared to $2.46 reported for last year's second quarter. Adjusting for the $0.04 of tax benefit this year and the $0.02 tax benefit last year, EPS increased 11.5%.
 Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. Total inventory grew 7.9% and was flat on a per-store basis. We continue to manage our inventory effectively, investing in key growth areas while reducing unproductive inventory to hold average inventory per store flat to last year while delivering a 6.2% comp increase. 
 Our in-stock position also remained strong through Q2 as we focused on investing inventory in our top sellers, new brand and product launches and key promotional events. Capital expenditures were $79.3 million for the quarter, driven by our new store opening program, investments in IT systems, and store remodels and relocations. We ended the quarter with $327.4 million in cash and short-term investments. 
 We repurchased 791,000 shares at a cost of $270.9 million through our stock repurchase program. $517.3 million remained available on our $875 million authorization as of quarter end. We continue to expect to repurchase approximately $700 million of shares in fiscal 2019, but as always, we have the flexibility to modify the cadence of repurchases in response to market conditions.
 Turning now to guidance. As Mary indicated, we have updated our outlook for the remainder of the year to reflect our expectations for ongoing challenges in the makeup category. 
 Before I get into specifics, I'd like to spend a moment giving you a little color on the bridge between our initial 2019 guidance and our updated view. As we put together our fiscal 2019 plan, we assumed a strong mid-single-digit comp based on an expectation that we would see strong performance for makeup overall and an improving trend in prestige makeup, which would contribute to both sales and margin improvement, with an acceleration in the second half of the year. These gains would be partially offset by necessary strategic investments to support healthy long-term growth. 
 Based on second quarter results and more recent trends in the U.S. cosmetics market, it has become apparent to us that we will not see the improvement we had expected in prestige makeup and that we will likely also see moderation in the mass makeup sales trend. 
 As a result, we have lowered our sales and gross margin expectations for the second half of the year. We are adjusting controllable expenses where appropriate but will continue to invest in initiatives that drive long-term growth, such as digital innovation, our salon services strategy, expanding our omnichannel capabilities, IT security and infrastructure, and initiatives to enhance the guest experience. 
 Specifically, for fiscal 2019, we continue to expect to open approximately 80 new stores. All are traditional 10,000-square-foot prototypes. We plan to remodel 12 stores and relocate 8 stores and execute 270 store refreshes or mini-remodels to enable the addition of new brands and improvements to overall fixturing. 
 We anticipate driving top line growth between 9% and 12%, with total company comparable sales planned in the 4% to 6% range compared to previous guidance range of 6% to 7%. We continue to expect e-commerce to grow in the 20 to 30 percentage range, contributing approximately 200 basis points to comparable sales. Although we are no longer providing precise quarterly guidance, we expect comparable store sales growth in Q4 will be stronger than Q3 as we benefit from holiday newness within the assortment. 
 We expect to deliver earnings per share in the range of $11.86 to $12.06, with approximately 60 to 70 basis points of operating margin deleverage. This compares to previous guidance of $12.83 to $13.03 and approximately 10 to 20 basis points of operating leverage.
 We continue to expect to deliver gross profit improvement for the year driven by merchandise margin expansion, rent and occupancy expense cost leverage, and the benefits of our credit card program, albeit lower than our previous expectations. These benefits will be offset by more SG&A deleverage than initially planned due to the lower sales expectation, which will increase deleverage of store labor and investments in growth initiatives and innovation. 
 Thinking about the flow of earnings in the second half, we are planning for EPS in the third quarter to be flat to lower as compared to the third quarter last year. While we continue to expect gross margin expansion in Q3, our lower comp expectations will result in more SG&A deleverage in the quarter. For Q4, we are planning for EPS growth in the mid-single-digit range, reflecting our higher expectations for Q4 sales.
 We plan to spend between $340 million to $350 million in CapEx compared to previous guidance of $380 million to $400 million. This includes CapEx of approximately $170 million for new stores remodels and merchandise fixtures; $130 million for supply chain and IT, including new fast fulfillment centers; and about $50 million for store maintenance and other. 
 Depreciation and amortization expense is planned to be approximately $300 million compared to previous guidance of $315 million. We expect our tax rate for the year to be 23%, which does not include any estimate for the impact of share-based compensation. The fully diluted share count for the year is expected to be approximately 58 million, and our plan assumes share repurchases in 2019 in the $700 million range. 
 And with that, I'll turn it back over to Mary. 
Mary Dillon: Thank you, Scott. Before we begin the Q&A session, I'd just like to take a step back to recap our perspective on the quarter, our current challenges and the strength of our differentiated business model. 
 While the second quarter results were solid, as Scott said, we've updated our guidance to reflect our best assessment of second half performance based on our expectations for the U.S. makeup category. We are doing our level best to both set realistic short-term expectations and ensure that we work with our brand partners to stabilize and then grow the important color cosmetics category. I am confident we can do that. 
 Our unique business model, representing all of the major categories of beauty, a range of price points and access to many exclusive and digitally native brands, is enabling us to drive growth and market share gains in spite of headwinds in our largest category. 
 We've expanded our gross profit margin, increased our brand awareness, driven traffic growth, expanded our loyalty program and exceeded new store performance targets. We are relevant to a large and diverse set of beauty enthusiasts, and we're focused on attracting growing demographic groups like teens, millennials, Latinas who all over-index in beauty. We have a powerful and increasingly personalized loyalty program with strong guest engagement. We're also driving strong momentum in our salon business based on our actions to optimize the experience. And I'm proud that we have a team that continues to deliver operational excellence and exceptional guest experiences every day. 
 That said, we are not immune to macro cycles like what we're currently seeing in the makeup category, but I am optimistic and committed to ensure that we'll move through these near term headwinds. And I believe we have the right strategy, the right business model and the right team to continue to grow and win over the long term. 
 And now I'll turn it over to our conference call host to moderate the Q&A session. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Steph Wissink who's with Jefferies. 
Stephanie Schiller Wissink: Mary, I'll ask you this one first and I have a related question for Dave. So if you could help us think about the comp guidance for the back half, what component is category versus your relative outperformance to the category? So asked another way, how much of that is purely macro or backdrop? And do you expect to kind of retain share and follow the backdrop? Or do you expect to see some of that share advantage released? 
 And my question for Dave is on the comments that you made on mass versus prestige. I think you indicated mass cosmetics up double digits, prestige up low single digits. Anything in your data that would suggest the consumer is trading down from prestige into mass? 
Mary Dillon: Hey, Steph, thank you. At the risk of reiterating, I will just say that I think your question's spot on. We're very confident that our business model is working, and it's going to continue to work. We are outperforming the rest of the market. We believe we're going to continue to do so because of the many assets that we have from a brand that's known and loved, our loyalty program, our omnichannel capabilities, digital capabilities, a lot of the exclusives that we have in our assortment. And the fact that we've got the ability to work across all categories really works for our advantage, right? Because we've had very strong growth at all the categories right now, except for makeup. 
 But yes, the makeup category is challenged. We're winning. I'd say we've hit -- the category has hit a bit of a speed bump, and we're working with our brand partners, big and small, really to pivot this. And so to us, as we look at the second half, it's really about -- we've talked about this for several quarters, that after years of very strong growth -- cosmetics has been growing but at a somewhat slower rate than it had been. But really, I'd say trends deteriorated further late in the second quarter and even more recently into this quarter. And so we would say as we look at this, we figure, okay, it's going to stay for a while until get through this cycle. But I'm confident that our ability to drive share gains will continue. I don't see anything in our business model that makes me feel otherwise. 
 And Dave, do you want to comment about the other question? 
David Kimbell: Right. On mass cosmetics, so as both Mary and Scott said, our mass business did perform somewhat better than our prestige business. In both categories, we gained share and we think we outperformed the total industry significantly, which allowed us to continue to grow our business. 
 In the mass side of the business, we probably had a bit more advancement in shifting our assortment away from brands -- broad brands into brands that are a bit more limited and exclusive distribution at Ulta Beauty. So our business has been stronger, but we believe in what we see in the marketplace that the mass total U.S. makeup -- mass makeup category is equally as challenged relative to prestige. 
 So we don't believe there's a shift between prestige and mass as much as an overall malaise driven by the innovation trends that Mary pointed out. We're confident that the innovation that we're bringing in both mass and prestige will allow us to continue to gain share, but the softness in the total cosmetic, both mass and prestige category, will provide these headwinds that we've described. 
Operator: Next question comes from Erinn Murphy who's with Piper Jaffray. 
Erinn Murphy: I guess just to follow up to that question, as we think about the comp cadence of 4% to 6% now for the year, and you're 1 year into your Analyst Day, which was 5% to 7% long-term guide, I guess what gives you the confidence? Or do you believe that you should be reaccelerating to 5% to 7% beyond this year, I guess if the slowdown in cosmetics from what you can see just temporarily to the back of this year? And then I guess, Mary, you commented -- or I guess, Scott, both of you commented on a little bit more promotional activity in the back half of the quarter. What are you expecting for the holiday season from a promotional perspective? 
Mary Dillon: Okay. So I'd step back and say -- and I want to be really clear, we're really no less confident about the attractiveness of our business model, our growth potential. We do see the current dynamics as a speed bump. Certainly, it's a speedy speed bump up, right? But we're confident cosmetics category will return -- will continue to return to growth. The timing is a little unpredictable. 
 But there's been in the past, cycles that affect different categories, and makeup was very strong for many years, and it's going through a tough cycle. But as we look at demographic trends, as we look at engagement in makeup, as we look at the white space that we believe exists, and I know our brand partners' commitment to getting this back to growth, we feel that we still stand by that guidance. 
 I'd say we're not -- today, we're not talking about a long-term outlook. Now it's prudent for us to plan in the near term for this potentially lower growth environment, and we're thinking about that. But we have not changed our optimistic views of the future. 
 On the promotional end, I mean holiday is always a promote -- a highly coveted time for everybody to get traffic into their stores. So Scott talked about promotion. I'd say, the good news is we have a lot of levers that we have, and we use those levers at different times. As everybody, I think, understands we've gone to much more targeted types of promotions over the years versus more broad-based. And with our loyalty program being kind of the core of what we do, it's going to be, I think, a competitive second half because everybody who's in beauty would be facing these same headwinds. So we feel we are well set up for holiday. 
 Obviously, that's a key focus area for us. But we're going to continue to I guess, I'd say, drive traffic, make sure that we capture guests into our loyalty program and not cede that to competitors at a time that will be competitive. But at the same token, I think again we're pretty smart about how we use the levers, and we have more efficient levers than ever. 
Operator: The next question comes from Steven Forbes who's with Guggenheim Securities. 
Steven Forbes: Mary, maybe a follow-up on that previous question, right, given that the comp revision is based really on the [ stool ] of a comp, right, versus the e-commerce growth, given you reiterated that -- the 20% to 30%. Can you discuss sort of the mature store comp outlook for the back half, and whether the recent performance impacts -- whether it's the saturation targets or unit growth outlook through 2021 that was provided during last year's Analyst Day? 
Scott Settersten: We're happy overall with new store performance. I think we mentioned that in our prepared remarks. So we haven't seen anything in there that would give us any concern on the longer-term target of 1,500 to 1,700 stores. 
 The recent, over I would call, the rolling 12-month period, we saw new stores performing well in the low to mid-single digit kind of range, again, vis-à-vis what we saw high-single digits in the years where we were delivering double-digit comps. So they have moderated somewhat. 
 As we looked at Q2 in absolute terms, the comps in the older cohorts were lower. They were in the low -- very low single-digit range, as you would expect when you do the math on the overall comp makeup. 
 Again, when we look at cosmetics, color cosmetics overall, and what were -- the dynamics we're seeing in the industry, they effect all stores equally. There's nothing special that stands out with the new stores compared to some of the older stores in the fleet. So again, very happy overall, doesn't change our outlook on the long-term store build-out here in the U.S. 
Mary Dillon: And I think I would just add that I think you might have inferred in your question about did it affect channels differently, and I'd say no. Obviously, e-commerce is growing faster than stores. It has been for a while, but that channel is equally affected by the headwind. 
Operator: Your next question comes from Simeon Gutman who's with Morgan Stanley. 
Simeon Gutman: A little bit of a follow-up, right? You have this medium- to long-term outlook out there, mid- to high-teens EPS growth. Obviously, the operating deleverage in the back half would stand as a disconnect to that. 
 I guess if you look at 2020, which I realize we're not talking about yet, is the deleverage that you could see, let's say if you do a 3% to 4% comp, is it going to look -- it could look similar to what we're seeing in the back half of this year? Or is there more flexibility on the margin side such that, that could get you back to your outlook? 
 And just within that, I know you talked about the makeup market being soft and you need some time to cycle through it. What is your going assumption on this? Like, Mary, I don't know if there's conversations you're having with executives who sell this product as well, but when do you think this -- we cycle it in the market to get soft in the early part of last year, even though you were outperforming it. So do we cycle it beginning of the early part of 2020? 
Mary Dillon: Yes. Do you want me to start with that one, Simeon? Yes, I don't exactly have a crystal ball on this because there's a lot of moving parts in different brands that participate. I can tell you everybody is focused on this. North America, makeup market's important for everybody, and it needs to improve. I'd say it's going to take some time because part of the -- what we think is driving it is the innovation, while good and exciting innovation -- good innovation hasn't really driven incrementality. 
 I mentioned this in the script, some previous forms of innovation that would be like, oh, I'm going to contour. I need 3 products for that, right? I'm going to do my brows now with 2 products. So what we're focused on is pivoting to white space that will drive incremental and exciting-type innovation, and that doesn't happen overnight. And frankly I'd say, it takes a while to assess incrementality. So it wasn't obvious probably until recently that some of that innovation, you have to go through a trial repeat cycle to see if they're going to be incremental. 
 So categories pivot in certain ways. We're very focused on that with our brand partners. And I don't have exactly a time frame, but I think it's going to take some time to work through it. But I feel that by second half 2020, at least, we should be in a better place. But again, I'm not holding to that. I hope it's sooner, but I think it does take some time to cycle through. 
Scott Settersten: And those who know us well understand makeup, right? It's a huge part of our business and it's very high margin for us. So when there's disruption there, it creates a lot of ripple effects across the business. 
 So we believe over the long term, there's still opportunity to expand operating margin, Simeon, through -- primarily through EFG initiatives that we've talked about before and the 4 work streams, along with scale over the long term. 
 It's just, we think it's too early to reconsider modifying our long-term guidance outlook in any significant way here. We need a little time to let things shake out a little bit, and of course, we're looking to manage our investments and expenses and everything here really closely, and assuming -- we're thinking about this actively. Assuming we're going to be in a lower growth environment here in the near term and adjust our priorities accordingly. 
Operator: The next question comes from Rupesh Parikh who's with Oppenheimer & Co. 
Rupesh Parikh: So first on the tariff side, we've seen some more mass companies talk about taking price. I was just curious just given some of the noise out there, I want to get your thoughts on what you thought the consumer acceptance of the price increases are. And then second, Scott, you mentioned that you expect Q3 comps to be lower than Q4. I would have expected potentially stronger comps in Q3 just given the easier compares in Q3 versus Q4. So just want to get your thoughts on that. 
Scott Settersten: Yes, so maybe we'll start with the tariff question. So again, at this point for us, we've talked about this over the last few quarters, it's kind of difficult to predict what the impact is going to be in beauty products overall. Again, we're not seeing any significant step up in pricing, negotiations or issues with any of our vendors. We expect to be able to manage our way through that and navigate that as best we can. And so yes, we're managing that as best we can through supplier relationships today, and we would expect to continue overall. 
 As far as the comp stack year-over-year, I know we can look at 2 or 3 years in trends and what you would expect. That's not the environment we're in right now. I mean the disruption we're seeing in the prestige and color makeup overall is a step-change in the normal flow of the business year-to-year. And that's really what's driving our outlook. 
Operator: The next question comes from Beth Kite who's with Citi. 
Beth Kite: We have a question about your skincare exposure. And given the pressure in color cosmetics, especially prestige, if you've considered a bigger move into skin, more brands, more shelf space, more space in-store, if you will? Have you entertained those conversations to shift the skincare exposure in a greater way, more quickly? 
David Kimbell: Yes. Well, we are already experiencing strong growth in skincare, both on the mass and prestige side of the business. And we've made moves to continue to emphasize that part of the business through both the brands that we've been bringing in and partnering with, with strong innovation that Mary described earlier, and further amplification within our -- both our store and our e-commerce and app business. So for sure, we've been emphasizing and driving that part of the business as well as the other categories that have been driving growth, hair and fragrance, our personal care appliances. So absolutely emphasizing that. 
 Having said that -- and we are always on the move -- on the effort to continue to try to optimize our assortment and look to lean into areas that are demonstrating the most growth. 
 Having said that, even though makeup is going through this tougher cycle, we still are confident in the long-term growth prospects of this category. So we're not anticipating a dramatic shift away long term from makeup. We'll continue to try to continue the strong share growth gains that we've had, bring new brands in, partner with our key brand partners to get those brands back on track because the demographic trends in makeup are still strong. Everything we're seeing around millennials and Gen Zs, Latinas, all the growth drivers, we're confident in. 
 We're working through this innovation cycle that Mary has described, but we believe we'll come out of that. And so we'll continue to maintain a strong makeup business, but absolutely emphasizing the growth categories like skin and others across our store. 
Beth Kite: In the volatility in July through now, was that primarily color? Or did that impact your other categories? 
David Kimbell: Yes. It was primarily color that we're seeing this -- that as we've talked, there's been a disruption in the makeup category, a slowdown in the makeup category for a little while now. But in many measures and our tracking and view of the category, there was more disruption more recently over the last several weeks. 
Operator: The next question comes from Christopher Horvers who's with JPMorgan. 
Christopher Horvers: So a couple of follow-ups. First, in terms of the comps that you're implying for the third quarter, are you basically assuming the current trend that you've seen sustained? Or are you expecting 21 Days Of Beauty in September to improve the trend? And following up on the fourth quarter, you're lapping James Charles, you're lapping Carli. So are you sizing the newness factor bigger this year? Or is there something else on the common terms of newness that hasn't been announced? Or are you assuming investment in merch margin to try to drive the comp overall? 
Mary Dillon: Yes, I'll start, and then I'll see if Dave wants to add anything. We're not going to get that granular in the quarter right now. Obviously, I'm just -- we're trying to do our best to sort of call it like we see it. And I'd say it is a combination of our view of category trends, and as we size newness and also all the things that we have in the fourth quarter just in terms of holiday promotion. So it's our best call right now with a range around that. Okay? 
Operator: The next question comes from Michael Binetti who's with Credit Suisse. 
Michael Binetti: I was wondering maybe if you could just give us a little more color on the magnitude of the issues in July and into August. The magnitude of the guidance cut is quite heavy, and it seems like it's based on a fairly short period in time. And obviously, you still have big thing -- you've described 2Q as less informative seasonally about the underlying trend in your business. You've still got big things like 21 Days Of Beauty, Mary. And the [indiscernible] was very clear all over the commentary. You expect cosmetics to improve. I'm just trying to figure out why cosmetics will improve. You said the incrementality hasn't worked. What's driving the comp improvement in 4Q versus third quarter based on those comments, especially [ while having ], obviously, the bigger compare? 
Mary Dillon: Yes. I mean I'd say the first part of your question is just that it has been the category data that we have access to sounds like more recent than what you would see has shown more recent deceleration, I guess. So that's sort of part of why the shift and more dramatic change. 
 Again, we just try to call -- kind of we take multiple views of how we build up our volume forecast. And so our Q4 is a combination of all the things, thinking about category trends not necessarily dramatically improving, but thinking about what we have coming and giving our best shot at both Q3, Q4 cadence of promotional events and launches. 
Michael Binetti: So I guess to follow that, I think you started first calling out slowing prestige cosmetic trends in mid-2017. You've done a really nice job of gliding your business slower for almost 2 years now. I feel like -- I just want to ask you like what do you think is happening in the industry? I feel like I'm missing something on why was that change lower so suddenly here recently? 
Mary Dillon: Well, if I had the answer to that, I would have fixed it already. I mean honestly, I think it's a combination of factors. And you're right. I mean I'd say our business model, we're proud about the fact that we can flex across categories in order to drive market share growth and carry a lot of fantastic exclusive brands. 
 But as we look at it, it's a combination, we think, of just innovation not really -- the cycle of innovation that we're in right now doesn't compare to what we've seen a few years ago. And it's easy to say that now. It's hard to know it prospectively that, that's going to be the case, right? So we think it's a combination of what are -- we bet on and what our brand partners have bet on just wasn't driving that kind of incrementality that we've seen in the past. So that's at the highest level, probably the biggest factor. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Mark Altschwager who's with Baird. 
Mark Altschwager: Could you walk us through just a little bit further the puts and takes on the updated EBIT margin guidance for the back half of the year? How much of the change in expectations is on merchandise margin versus greater fixed-cost deleverage? Just any help on the gross margin versus the SG&A cadence over the next couple of quarters would be great. 
Scott Settersten: Yes, I guess we can talk directionally for the back half of the year. I'm not going to -- we're not going to get into specifics quarter-by-quarter. We're trying to move away from that, Mark. I appreciate question. 
 So look, I think we stated in our comments that we still -- merchandise margin, right, we still expect to expand that. So that's the good news. Our EFG efforts are working. We're making progress on that. Unfortunately, it's going to be masked a little bit by the downward pressure we have in prestige, right, and the mix overall of the business. 
 So we're happy with margin expansion overall. Blended up for the back half of the year is what we expect to see. SG&A is heavier. I mean again, we pointed to these -- these are necessary long-term investments for the health of the business that we're not going to back away from right now with some knee-jerk reaction. 
 So again, SG&A deleverage is going to be heavier in the second half of the year than what we expected. I guess I would say there, it's probably a little heavier weighted to third quarter than it is fourth quarter because fourth quarter, we're kind of shut down and we're all on all-hands-on-deck for holiday. 
 So also, I would say third quarter maybe you're kind of at peak with fixed cost. While it's leveraging year-over-year, there's less of that in the third quarter because we're getting a fuller load of new store openings and things like that weighted towards the back half of the year this year. So that's probably about as much color as I want to give on specifically the quarters themselves. 
Operator: The next question comes from Michael Goldsmith who's with UBS. 
Michael Goldsmith: What are you assuming about the company's level of market outperformance in the cosmetic category in the back of the year? And does that represent a change from what we've seen in the last couple of quarters? And given the market share gains achieved over the years, does that make it more difficult to pick up share in the category going forward? 
Mary Dillon: Yes, I'd say that we are expecting continued similar share gains for the rest of the year, is probably the easiest way to put it. 
Michael Goldsmith: And then going forward? 
Mary Dillon: I wouldn't comment on that yet today. But still -- we still see plenty of share for us to gain that is out there in other channels, that we've been successfully with our business model attracting new guests and share. So we see that playing out for a while. 
Operator: The next question comes from Ike Boruchow who's with Wells Fargo. 
Irwin Boruchow: Mary, I understand there's a lot going on right now, and I do apologize to go back to Simeon's question. But less than a year ago, there was a multiyear plan that was laid out, and it did call for 5% to 7% comps, and it specifically called out for margin expansion in 2020. 
 I understand that there's no crystal ball right now, but I guess what I'd ask is given what's taking -- or given it sounds like this is going to take some time to work through and looking at the comps and deleverage you're guiding to in the back half, should we consider that plan stale at this point? 
Mary Dillon: I think it's really too soon to say that. I mean part of what we need to do is sort of work through this cycle. We've not put our plan for 2020 together yet. We still feel very confident about the business model, and we can make choices about ceasing of what we spend in terms of investment. We've been pretty aggressive, this goes back for a lot of investments this year, that are multiyear, important long-term investments for us. 
 And so as prudent planners, we would say, okay, if we want to plan for maybe a different comp cycle for part of the year, how do we then think about -- how do we stage the investments and deliver the appropriate return? 
 So I think it is -- I mean I think Scott said it well. This is not a time to have a knee-jerk reaction about the long-term prospects of the business. I don't believe that. But we're also being prudent in how we think about how we do this kind of planning and stage investments. 
Operator: The next question comes from Dana Telsey with Telsey Advisory Group. 
Dana Telsey: As you think about the go-forward, how do you think of what type of comps that you need to leverage expenses given the new trajectory of sales growth and category growth? And also, as you think about mass and prestige, has there been a difference in the cadence of mass and prestige in terms of how they're performing most recently? 
Scott Settersten: Yes. So the first part of the question I guess I would say to Mary's point she just made, the business has been very healthy for a long period of time. And we've been riding a wave, so to speak, on makeup, makeup in general, right, across both mass and prestige, which has allowed us the flexibility to be more aggressive on the investment front, right? 
 So there was a time before that phenomena where [indiscernible] operated very effectively and very well, performed -- produced some really great financial results on much lower comps. So we're no stranger to operating in a tougher, lower-growth kind of environment, and that's just the kinds of things that we're pivoting towards right now. So again, we don't have all the answers as we sit here today, but you can bet that we're actively managing with that thought in mind. 
David Kimbell: And on your second question about mass and prestige, just to reiterate, we are seeing in the total U.S. market weakness, softness in both mass and prestige. At Ulta Beauty, specifically we are gaining share in both categories due to the strategies and the brands that we've brought in and the focus we've had in that category. But as I've mentioned earlier, mass has performed better than prestige in the recent quarters as that business has been a bit stronger for us. 
Operator: This concludes time allocated for questions on today's call. 
 I would now like to turn the call back over to Mary Dillon for any closing comments. 
Mary Dillon: Yes, I would just like to close by thanking our very hard-working more-than-44,000 associates for delivering another quarter of solid financial results and great guest experience every day. And we look forward to speaking with all of you again soon. 
Operator: This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.

===== 2019 Q1  (2019-05-30 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Greetings, and welcome to the Ulta Beauty First Quarter 2019 Earnings Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Ms. Laurel Lefebvre, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please proceed. 
Laurel Lefebvre: Thank you. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us for Ulta Beauty's First Quarter Conference Call. Hosting our call are Mary Dillon, Chief Executive Officer; and Scott Settersten, Chief Financial Officer. Also joining us is Dave Kimbell, President and Chief Merchandising and Marketing Officer.
 Before we begin, I'd like to remind you of the company's safe harbor language. The statements contained in this conference call, which are not historical facts, may be deemed to constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual future results may differ materially from those projected in such statements due to a number of risks and uncertainties, all of which are described in the company's filings with the SEC.
 We make references during this call to non-GAAP earnings growth adjusted for the impact of income tax rates due to accounting for equity compensation.
 During the Q&A session, please ask one question only to allow us to accommodate as many of you as possible during the hour scheduled for this call. I'll now turn the call over to Mary. 
Mary Dillon: Thank you, Laurel, and good afternoon, everyone. 2019 is off to a strong start with solid first quarter financial performance. Total sales increased 12.9%, and we achieved a 7% comp on top of an 8.1% comp in the first quarter of 2018. These top line results reflect a healthy balance of traffic and ticket growth as well as continued double-digit comp across growth in mass category, skincare and fragrance, tempered by mixed performance in prestige cosmetics. We're driving stellar growth with expansion brands like Clinique, MAC, Lancôme, Estée Lauder and NARS. But this isn't yet sufficient to offset the continuous softness in several large established prestige cosmetic brands.
 Gross profit leverage was a highlight during the quarter, benefiting from progress with our Efficiencies for Growth initiatives and stable promotions year-over-year, which helped to offset ongoing channel, category and brand mix headwinds. Continued progress on our strategic imperatives drove our performance during the quarter, and I'll give a brief update on each one.
 Beginning with our strategies to increase loyalty and evolve our brand. Our Ultamate Rewards loyalty program grew to 32.6 million active members, representing member growth of 14% on a rolling 12-month basis. Our store associates continue to do a fantastic job in bringing new guests to the program. We're also seeing healthy increases in Diamond and Platinum members. Credit card account growth was above plan, and we are maintaining the nearly 50% increase in incremental spend from guests once they become cardholders. Gift card sales increased 32% in the first quarter, continuing to benefit from the expansion of our third-party distribution partnerships.
 Brand awareness continues to reach new highs at 56% for unaided awareness compared to 53% last year and 92% for aided awareness compared to 90% a year ago, reflecting the ongoing success of our Possibilities Are Beautiful campaign and more broadly, our strategies to make a more emotional connection with our guests. 
 We're making good progress driving awareness across age groups and ethnicities, and we're maintaining a position of strength relative to competition. Our marketing activities during the quarter focused on our spring trend promotion, our signature 21 Days Of Beauty event, the launch of our exclusive Tarte Sugar Rush brand, which is targeted to Gen Z beauty enthusiasts, and Mother's Day. This year, we enhanced our Mother's Day efforts with the launch of a new in-store program in partnership with Save the Children. We invited our guests to donate to the Ulta Beauty Charitable Foundation at point of sale in support of Save the Children's early childhood programming and disaster relief efforts in the U.S., raising more than $1.1 million. We continue to advance our brand purpose with our Girls United partnership with Essence, supporting and empowering young black women through mentorship.
 Moving on to the strategic imperative to delight our guests with a merchandise assortment, where innovation, differentiation, exclusivity, relevancy and speed-to-market are key. Our merchant team is focused on curating a highly differentiated set of offerings across all categories. We continue to gain share across all major categories in both mass and prestige, with Ulta Beauty again driving all the growth in the prestige beauty industry year-to-date based on NPD data. We're very pleased with the performance of fragrance, mass cosmetics, prestige iconic brands, prestige skincare, Pro Hair, suncare and PCA. However, prestige cosmetics is still quite a bit softer than the rest of the portfolio, with spring newness generally underperforming our expectations. However, late in the quarter, we set several promising new collections, including highly anticipated launches such as Urban Decay's Game of Thrones collection, a Disney Aladdin limited edition collection by MAC, a line of NARS limited edition blushes and lip products and Tarte's Big Ego mascara. Also we're encouraged by the pipeline we see for the rest of the year.
 Kylie Cosmetics continues to drive traffic and incremental sales with new products, including eyeshadow pallets and the Kris Jenner Momager palette. We plan to add blushes, highlighters, bronzers and a birthday pallet, which will be flown into stores in a few weeks. 
 In April, we launched UOMA Beauty, a new makeup line inspired by African beauty, which is exclusive to us. UOMA is an innovative bold product line with a focus on diversity and unity and offers vivid color and inclusive shades for all women. The centerpiece of the brand is a line of foundations with 6 custom formulas, including skincare benefits offered in many shades. We continue to roll out Clinique, Lancôme, Benefit and MAC in additional stores, adding a total of 50 new doors during the quarter. Performance was strong across the board, with MAC leading the pack. We plan to add several hundred expressions of these 4 brands this year in various formats, including boutiques, gondola runs and wall presentations. The majority of the rollouts throughout the remainder of the year will be in presentations without dedicated payroll. 
 Mass cosmetics continue to perform very well following a significant reset earlier in the year. This reflow further differentiated our mass cosmetics assortment with additional space dedicated to exclusive or limited distribution brands that are preferred by younger consumers, including Morphe, Revolution Beauty, BH Cosmetics, e.l.f. and ColourPop. We plan to continue to invest in fixtures and labor to execute more frequent reflows to keep our vibrant unique assortment fresh and compelling for our guests. 
 Prestige skincare delivered double-digit comps, helped by the success of our new and loved curated assortment highlighting guest favorite brands. Kiehl's has a dozen of their top sellers in all Ulta Beauty doors in this section, and the brand will be in more than 100 doors with a broader assortment by year-end. We're bringing a focus on wellness to the forefront in our prestige skincare assortment, with clean-ingredient brands like TULA, Kopari, Little Barn Apothecary, Trilogy and The Better Skin Co. While new brands were the key driver of our performance in skincare, we also drove impressive growth in a legacy brand like Philosophy by running a special event which highlighted the brand in our services business.
 Fragrance, despite tough comparisons from last year, was the best performing major category during the quarter, delivering a high-teens comp and significant market share gains. New fragrances from Ariana Grande and Versace led the growth in this category.
 Haircare delivered strong high single-digit comp growth, aided by a reflow that improved the assortment and shopping experience for color and texture. These categories significantly improved our comp trends following the reflow.
 Smaller categories were also very robust, with accessories and suncare delivering double-digit comps. Personal care appliances were bolstered by strong demand for Dyson hairdryers and the Revlon One-Step Volumizer Hair Dryer.
 In the bath category, we're responding to consumers' growing interest in wellness and clean beauty and are launching a new wellness assortment in 350 stores. This will expand to 700 doors later this year and features 8 brands. Many of the 80 items in the assortment are exclusive to Ulta Beauty, including the Ulta Beauty essentials oil -- essential oils collection.
 Our emerging brands team launched 8 brands in the first quarter across multiple categories, including Cannuka skincare with CBD, Black Moon Cosmetics, DHC skincare, that brings together Japanese innovation and botanical ingredients, Grande Cosmetics, Sara Happ lip products, Nurse Jamie skincare products and tools and Erborian skincare, that combines sophisticated Korean technologies with high-quality ingredients derived from herbs found in traditional Korean medicine. More than 20 additional brands are planned to launch in the second quarter, including many online-only brands.
 So next, an update on our services business. Our services team drove strong performance across all major categories, color, cut and style, blowouts and skin treatments. After launching the ability to redeem loyalty points on services, we saw a meaningful increase in loyalty members using the salon for the first time as well as an increase in overall active members using the salon. We also drove new guest acquisition through events like our Galentine's promotion, offering $30 blowouts when guests booked with a friend and received a gift with service. We are now rolling out our services optimization program to the full chain. As a reminder, the components of the program are compensation designed to attract and retain top talent, industry-leading internal training and education, simplified menus, transparent pricing and an updated skill team focused on business and technical training in each district.
 We train district managers and general managers on the new program during the spring, and in-market training is taking place across the country, with all regions planned to be rolled out by the end of June. We're seeing significant improvement in stylist retention in regions that were converted to the new program last year, and this is an important metric since tenure of our salon associates has the highest correlation to our best-performing salons. The program is also driving a significant increase in product sales in the high-margin professional haircare category. Ulta Beauty's Pro and Design teams had a big presence at America's Beauty Show in Chicago, hosting demos during this key industry event, which welcomed over 65,000 salon service professionals. Hundreds of attendees were excited to submit applications on site to join the Ulta Beauty salon teams. Through events like this one, we continue to focus on hiring and retaining great talent and elevating Ulta Beauty's profile in the salon industry.
 And now turning to store growth. We opened 22 new stores in the first quarter compared to 34 net new stores last year, ending the quarter with 1,196 stores. New store productivity remains very strong, with first year sales trending ahead of plan as well as IRR sales hurdles. We're on track to open 80 stores this year, the majority in suburban strip centers and power centers.
 And now I'd like to share some exciting news about our growth plan. While we have years of attractive domestic growth ahead of us, we've been evaluating the potential for growth beyond U.S. borders for some time. Today, we're announcing our decision to expand internationally and establish Ulta Beauty as a global brand with our first market entry in Canada. International expansion represents an attractive and incremental long-term growth platform, which extends our core capabilities and leverages our value proposition. Over the past few years, we've extensively studied the market opportunity in multiple countries and evaluated various operational models. 
 We believe that the Ulta Beauty value proposition is very relevant and differentiated in multiple geographies around the globe. And Canada is an attractive and logical place to start. We're planning to launch stores and e-commerce in Canada, but we won't be sharing a lot of details yet for competitive reasons. We can say that we're planning to start small but are prepared to scale quickly as we learn and see success. The startup investment to support the Canada launch is expected to put modest pressure on the P&L this year, but we still expect to deliver financial results within our guidance range. Our Canadian business is not expected to be material to sales or income for the next few years as we thoughtfully build a foundation to become a global beauty retailer over the long term.
 Now moving on to an update on our progress in our digital experience and innovation. We continue to invest in omnichannel capabilities to enhance the guest experience and support our buy anywhere, fill anywhere strategies. Our save-a-sale program called store-to-door, where store associates assist guests with ordering products online when they aren't available in store is performing well. It's improving guest satisfaction, particularly as we expand our assortment of emerging and digitally native brands that are frequently offered in limited doors. Store-to-door demand increased about 20% versus last year during the first quarter. We're also seeing growth in awareness and usage of buy online, pick up in store, currently operating in 47 stores. We redesigned the find-in-store functionality on our website to support the upcoming full chain rollout of buy online, pick up in store to improve and simplify the guest experience. We've also rolled out enhancements to the mobile app, including an improved order history view to make reordering or replenishing more efficient and improved usability of our GLAM LAB, live try-on function driven by our recently acquired GlamST subsidiary. We're launching live try-on for Android next month after launching the iPhone version back in January.
 Augmented reality innovation includes testing in in-store Ulta digital stylists in 6 pilot stores. This tool, intended for our associates in the salon or brow bars to show possibilities to guests in the store, offers virtual try-on for hair color, makeup and eyebrow-shaping. From an AI innovation perspective, we launched the skincare virtual beauty advisor on ulta.com, enabling guests to explore our skincare assortment by concern or by product. The virtual beauty advisor asks a series of dynamically generated questions and presents a set of personalized recommendations that can be further reviewed and then purchased. This user-friendly interactive experience is another great example of how last year's strategic acquisitions are adding value.
 Our e-commerce team recently partnered with guest services and IT to deliver our first production chatbot experience on our customer conversation platform. These initial experiences automate our communication with guests in response to frequently asked questions about loyalty points or birthday e-mails.
 And lastly, I'll recap our supply chain performance. We delivered excellent in-stock levels in the first quarter with a rapid recovery following better-than-expected Q4 sales and post-holiday out-of-stocks. With good control of overall inventory levels, inventory turns improved and came out -- came in ahead of our goal. Our transportation team continues to focus on service-level enhancements and costs and improved on-time store delivery by about 40 basis points in the first quarter. We're also collaborating closely with our brand partners to measure and improve performance and compliance with our supply chain requirements. Since implementing the program in the fall of last year, we've seen a 200 basis point improvement in fill rates. As part of our omnichannel strategy, buy online and pick up in store will be deployed chain-wide this summer, and we'll begin testing ship-from-store capabilities in 5 stores this fall. 
 Our Fresno distribution center continues to ramp up and is now serving 245 stores and fulfilling 22% of e-commerce orders. The conversion of our Romeoville distribution center into an e-commerce fast fulfillment center is underway and on track to open this summer. The second FFC is planned to open in the summer of 2020 in Jacksonville, Florida. FFCs serve e-commerce orders only and are designed to fill up to 30,000 orders per day during peak times. These facilities are part of the infrastructure plan we're executing to attain our goal of 2-day e-commerce shipping by 2021.
 Now before I turn it over to Scott, I want to share with you that this will be Laurel's last earnings call as she has decided to retire after 7 years at Ulta Beauty and a long and successful career in Investor Relations. She's been a value partner and resource to me, our leadership team and our Board of Directors, and we're grateful for her many contributions to the company. So while we're very sad to say farewell to Laurel, we are delighted to welcome Kiley Rawlins, who's joined us to succeed Laurel and lead our Investor Relations function. Many of you already know Kiley, who has more than 25 years of experience building and leading Investor Relations for retail Fortune 500 companies. She has served in Investor Relations and Communications leadership positions at Michaels, Family Dollar Stores and Dollar General, demonstrating her ability to proactively manage investor relation programs and engage with internal and external stakeholders to serve as an effective spokesperson to the investment community. Kiley holds a Bachelor Degree in Commerce from the University of Virginia and is a CFA. You can anticipate a seamless transition as Kiley joins Patrick Flaherty, our Senior Manager of Investor Relations, to support our mission to provide high-quality service to analysts and shareholders. I know you'll be joining me in congratulating Laurel on her well-deserved retirement and in welcoming Kiley to the Ulta Beauty team.
 And with that, I'll turn it over to Scott to discuss in more detail the drivers of our first quarter financials and the outlook for the rest of the year. 
Scott Settersten: Thanks, Mary. Good afternoon, everyone. Starting with the income statement. Our top line growth of 12.9% was driven by a 7% comp in strong new store productivity. Traffic was healthy, with transaction growth of 4.3% and ticket growth of 2.7%. While we are no longer breaking out e-commerce growth specifically, I can share that ulta.com growth was in line with our expectations of 20% to 30% growth driven by traffic. The retail comp was balanced between transaction and ticket growth.
 On the gross profit line, margin of 37% improved 70 basis points year-over-year from 36.3% driven by strong merchandise margin and leverage of rent and occupancy expense, offset by investments in supply chain and our services business. Merchandise margin benefited from early gains from our Efficiencies for Growth program.
 SG&A rate of 23.1% deleveraged by 70 basis points compared to the prior year's rate of 22.4%, reflecting planned deleverage in corporate overhead related to investments in growth initiatives, including store labor, offset by leveraging marketing and variable store expenses. Operating margin was flat year-over-year at 13.6% of sales. 
 Diluted GAAP earnings per share of $3.26 grew 20.7% compared to $2.70 reported for last year's first quarter. Adjusted for the $0.18 of benefit from a lower tax rate associated with equity compensation accounting, the underlying earnings per share of $3.08 were up 14%. EPS rose 17% on a like-for-like basis, adjusting for the tax rate benefit in both years, which includes a $0.07 benefit in Q1 of 2018.
 Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. Total inventory grew 10% and was up 1.8% on a per-store basis, well below comparable sales as we continue to gain efficiencies from improved systems and processes. Capital expenditures were $69 million for the quarter driven by our new store opening program, supply chain systems and merchandise fixtures. 
 I'd like to touch on a new lease accounting standard and how it impacts Ulta Beauty's financial statements. We adopted a new accounting standard on February 3, 2019 using the modified retrospective approach. The adoption of this standard resulted in the recording of operating lease assets of $1.46 billion and lease liabilities of $1.84 billion as of the beginning of the year. There's no impact on our income statement or cash flows. Our Form 10-Q, which was filed this afternoon, includes comprehensive disclosures related to our adoption of the new lease accounting. We ended the quarter with $521.8 million in cash and short-term investments. We repurchased 318,000 shares at a cost of $107.4 million through our 10b5-1 program. $788.2 million remained available on our $875 million authorization as of quarter end. We continue to expect to repurchase approximately 700 million of shares in fiscal 2019, but as always, have the flexibility to modify the cadence of repurchases in response to market conditions.
 Turning now to guidance. We are maintaining our previous view for the remainder of the year and are flowing through the $0.18 of earnings per share benefit related to the lower tax rate in the first quarter. We are on track to open approximately 80 new stores. All are traditional 10,000 square-foot prototype. We plan to remodel 12 stores and relocate 8 stores and execute 270 store refreshes or mini-remodels to enable the addition of new brands and improvements to overall fixturing. We anticipate driving top line growth in the low double digits, with total company comparable sales planned in the 6% to 7% range. We expect e-commerce to grow in the 20% to 30% range, contributing approximately 200 basis points to comparable sales. We expect to deliver earnings per share in the range of $12.83 to $13.03, with approximately 10 to 20 basis points of operating margin expansion. We expect to improve gross profit rate driven by merchandise margin expansion, rent and occupancy expense leverage and the benefits of our credit card program. These benefits will be offset by deleveraging SG&A due to store labor and investments in growth initiatives and innovation. 
 Areas such as digital innovation, our salon services strategy, expanding our omnichannel capabilities, IT security and infrastructure, personalization efforts, our strategy to pursue emerging brands and initiatives to enhance the guest experience and now our investments ahead of launching operations in Canada are the factors driving corporate overhead deleverage. We reiterate our previous comments on the cadence of earnings per share throughout the year, excluding the tax rate benefits from the first quarter, with EPS growth slightly weighted to the back half, with more of the benefits of our Efficiency for Growth cost optimization program occurring later in the year. Excluding the Q1 tax rate benefits, we expect low-teens EPS growth and modest operating margin deleverage in the first half of the year and high-teens EPS growth and modest operating margin leverage in the second half of the year. We plan to spend between $380 million and $400 million in CapEx. This includes CapEx of approximately $190 million for new stores, remodels and merchandise fixtures, $140 million for supply chain and IT, including new fast fulfillment centers, and about $60 million for store maintenance and other. 
 Depreciation and amortization expense is planned to be approximately $315 million. We expect our tax rate for the remainder of the year to be 24%, which does not include any estimate for the impact of share-based compensation. The fully diluted share count for the year is expected to be approximately $58 million. Our plan assumes share repurchases in 2019 in the 700 million range, contributing about 4 points of earnings per share growth.
 And with that, I'll turn it over to our conference call host for Q&A. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Rupesh Parikh with Oppenheimer. 
Rupesh Parikh: So first, congrats to Laurel on your retirement and also welcome, Kiley. I guess one of the questions I had is just going back to Mary, your comments on the mix of prestige cosmetics backdrop. So it seems like we've continued to have challenges on some of those larger, established cosmetic brands, so I just want to get a sense of what you think is actually weighing on those brands and any sense in terms of how long this can continue. 
Mary Dillon: Well, it's a -- I mean the good news is, with our model, that we offer a lot of different brands and categories, et cetera. So we have discussed this before. Prestige cosmetics category have struggled in '18, and some of the brands continue to struggle in terms of comping over some strong growth in previous years. We've continued to gain share in all the track channels, which is great. We also -- not all the data that you see is measured in all the -- or the marketplace is not all captured in tracking reports, so a lot of growth happening from digital and native brands, and we're obviously participating in that well. So we continue to see the category as healthy overall. We're going to continue to add new brands and work with our brand partners to continue to drive innovation pipelines and balance, I guess, the risk of that with the other great newness that we bring into the box. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Oliver Chen with Cowen and Company. 
Oliver Chen: And Laurel, best regards. We're going to miss you a lot. Regarding of the Canada opportunity, which sounds really promising, what are your thoughts on the size of the box and also as you think about the assortment architecture and pricing, just considerations there? And if you could brief us on why it makes sense now and how your competitive set may or may not be different. 
Mary Dillon: Sure. Thank you, Oliver. As you can imagine, I'm going to stay very high-level on this in terms of we're not -- we don't want to disclose a lot, to folks about what we're doing exactly, okay? But we do -- we're very excited about the opportunity. I mean we've got years of domestic growth ahead, but we do see this as a next step in our long-term growth journey. I would say we've done a lot of diligence in the last couple of years understanding consumer categories, competitive dynamics, just like you're asking, not just in Canada, but in other key geographies, studying success and failure, precedence and learning. And bottom line is that we do believe whitespace opportunity exists for the Ulta Beauty proposition because it's differentiated, right, in terms of experiences in-store and online, breadth and depth of offerings in what is an important and growing category. So it's incremental growth for us. I guess back to your question, I would think about it more of leveraging our core competencies, but also being open to some modifications and local adaptations as needed. So how that plays out relative to offerings, you can imagine that or a real estate model, but overall, we plan to stay true to the Ulta Beauty business model. We know it's working, and what we have studied and believe is the opportunity is something that's pretty close to that. 
Oliver Chen: And just related to that, as a quick follow-up, how well is the consumer awareness build in Canada and your thoughts in terms of like how the awareness is in that market now versus how you'll leverage the marketing programs to build your unaided awareness in the market? 
Mary Dillon: Yes, lots more details to come, but you can imagine, I think, that we feel good about our ability to create the Ulta Beauty brand and that's obviously behind our list of important priorities from the start. So that's all I'll say now. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Ike Boruchow with Wells Fargo. 
Irwin Boruchow: And I will bid Laurel farewell. We will miss you. Congratulations on the retirement. I guess my question -- 2 questions, actually, really real quick to Scott. Scott, I don't mean to nitpick, but I'm going to have to do it anyway. I think you said on the first half, the EPS, ex the tax benefit, low teens, I think that would imply like a low double-digit EPS growth for Q2. I'm kind of making sure we're thinking about that the right way. 
Scott Settersten: No. You got the message that, that was the signal we were -- we intended to send for folks without being too literal about things. There's still a fair amount of investment that's embedded. I guess I would just back up and say that the gross margin leverage you saw in the first quarter, I think, directionally is what you can -- how you can think about it for the rest of the year. But there is a fair amount of investment that -- in the plan, all the things we started last year around innovation and personalization that we accelerated last year. We won't start lapping that until the back half of 2019. And then we have some incremental things that we kicked off this year, most notably the Canada thing that we just announced here recently. So there is a fair amount of corporate overhead deleverage that's coming in, in the second and third quarter. 
Irwin Boruchow: Got it. And then just a quick follow-up for Mary. Just on the prestige business, I understand the softness just kind of persists, and sounds like you're confident in the pipeline. I just feel like we've heard confidence in the pipeline for a while, and the business has been great, but that prestige business hasn't really -- doesn't seem like it's really picked up any real momentum. Do you have visibility in that category for yourself, or is this just kind of your best guess at the moment? I'm just trying to understand what kind of visibility you have. 
Mary Dillon: Yes, I'll make a couple of comments. I'll ask Dave to add more to this because he obviously is quite expert in this arena as well. But I would say this is not a factor for all brands in prestige, right, so it's really like a few large prestige brands that are having a tough time comping over some amazing growth they have had for a couple of years. We have many prestige brands that are doing quite well. So we do our best, level best as can be, and be as direct and transparent as we can about how we feel about the pipeline. But of course, it's in partnership with our brand partners, and like I said, the fact that we have an array of choices that we can make in the marketplace work to our advantage given our box. So David, anything else you want to add on the prestige question... 
David Kimbell: I'll just say, as we look at the total prestige makeup business, many of the things that Mary talked about are critical to us compensating for some continued struggles that the bigger brands that have been in our store for a while are going through. So continuing to focus on digitally native brands, but driving exclusivity with both new brands and existing brands, such as Tarte, Double Duty Beauty and Too Faced, with Tutti Frutti and other elements like that. On the existing brands, yes, we -- they are going through many of them, as Mary said, not all of them, but many of them, and including some of the biggest brands that had been driving growth over some time at Ulta are continuing to struggle. 
 There's a transformation in the makeup business right now. The category remains healthy, but there's a shift in consumer preference on brands. What we know about these brands though is there are equities in all of our studies and understanding remain strong and healthy, that we're confident in the teams that are driving these businesses. They're focused on driving innovation and adjusting to evolving market conditions. We do have visibility to their innovation throughout the rest of this year and even into the first part of next year. And then we see some positive things, but time will tell on some of these. So we're not -- as we look forward on our business, we're not anticipating these -- some of the big brands that have been a drain turning around immediately, but we're confident over time that these brands will regain their fitting -- footing and get back to growth. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Christopher Horvers with JPMorgan. 
Christopher Horvers: Laurel, it's been such a pleasure working with you all these years, going back to your time in Framingham, and certainly, a top-notch job the whole time and best of luck in the next phase of your career. Kiley, welcome. Clearly, some similarities to Laurel as well, given both of you made a great trade, a comely transition, in your career in coming to Ulta. So... 
Mary Dillon: I love it. I wish you could see their faces. That's good, and thank you. 
Christopher Horvers: I'm sure you've talked about that. So can you talk about -- a couple of questions, I'll put them all in one. Can you remind us what caused the deceleration in last year's second quarter comp relative to the first? And then in the gross margin, how did that come in relative to your internal plan with the investment expense versus the March margins? How did that shake out? And then the last one, of course, topic du jour tariffs, what are your comments there? 
Scott Settersten: Yes, I can take a swing at last year's second quarter. And just it's a -- it's part of the cycle of the business, I would say. Second quarter's just been a little bit tougher for us the last few years. The 21 Days Of Beauty phenomena, I guess, is probably what's driving the first quarter, and then we do it again in the fall and that's really a great event for us that drives healthy business in a lot of -- in a variety of ways. So it's probably really just the impact of that. And as far as margins and business overall results versus the forecast, we're very happy with gross margin leverage that we had in the first quarter. I mean I would say we're right on target. Coming through the first quarter, we had a similar conversation with the Board earlier this week. We're right on plan, kind of right where we thought we would be. The leverage on the gross margin line is where we thought we would be and then the investment cycle here. So again, heavier maybe than what some of you were modeling or were expecting, but kind of right in line where we thought we'd be at this point in the year. 
Mary Dillon: And I'll add lastly on that tariff question. So -- and we've said this before. We're certainly less exposed than other retailers. Most cosmetics, fragrance, haircare, liquids were made in North America and Europe, but we have some in Ulta Beauty Collection, some things that are made in China. But we're -- it's small. We're managing it through supplier relations and pricing, if needed. So we consider that a pretty small impact for us. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. 
Xian Siew Hew Sam: This is Xian Siew on for Simeon. We want to ask about D&A. It looks like guidance of $315 million was reiterated, but the Q1 run rate is a little bit lighter than that. Is there anything around timing there? 
Scott Settersten: Yes, I would attribute that primarily to the investment notion that we've been talking about, Canada kind of plays heavily into that. So there's a lot of things coming around systems, upgrades and things like that and a lot of that is expense-related. I'm not sure if you're familiar with the way some of the new pricing is working with SaaS solutions and things like that, so it's more of an immediate hit and there's more of that back-half weighted. 
Xian Siew Hew Sam: Got it, so back-half weighted D&A? 
Scott Settersten: Correct. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Erinn Murphy with Piper Jaffray. 
Erinn Murphy: Congrats to Laurel on your retirement. It's very well deserved. Look forward to working with Kylie as well. I guess my question is either for Mary or Dave, you guys have brought in a lot of newness over the last year. And I think last quarter, you talked about it driving 400 basis points of contribution to the comp. Could you just share with us what the benefit was in Q1? And then Mary, you talked about a lot of initiatives within wellness in particular, I'd love to just hear you talk about what the opportunity is in that category as you start to really play that up in the future. 
Mary Dillon: How about we tag team. I'll take the newness one and then I'll give Dave the other question, which is great. I would just say, yes, newness is really obviously continues to be really important to our business and to our guests. In this quarter, we saw a strong contribution from some categories like prestige skincare, [ EOS ] and Tula, mass cosmetics, the refill I talked about, those are the exclusives. We saw strong contribution there, I'd say, somewhat less on prestige cosmetics. There are some tough comps versus year ago on some of that. So overall, I'd say, not a significant in terms -- relative to Q4, we had some pretty high profile launches, but still obviously, very important key strategy and we continue to feel good about the continued cadence of newness that's coming. 
David Kimbell: And on wellness, yes, the broader idea of wellness or clean, we're seeing the positive effect of that really across the entire store. Most categories are benefiting from a elevated engagement from consumers, elevated awareness. So we're seeing brands, organic, natural, gluten-free, vegan, cruelty-free, ethically traded all across the board, a number of brands that either have had those attributes for a long time or are newly created brands that are focused on clean or natural wellness beauty are driving a lot of growth. But in some of the brands that where we see benefiting from that, Tarte certainly has been a leader in that they have launched new brands, much of which are new sub lines, many of which are exclusive to Ulta, that's been driving growth, bareMinerals, Origins, Juice Beauty, Peter Thomas Roth, and a number of new brands. We launched an endcap in a few hundred doors in Q1 of vegan impact -- endcap that featured a number of brands that are 100% vegan, 100% cruelty-free, and we plan to expand that to more doors throughout the year based on the success. We have a wellness section in the bath category that's in about 350 doors, that we'll plan to roll out to more doors throughout the year. Mary highlighted some of the brands that are part of that. And in our broader communication to our guests through all vehicles, our magazines, our social media, digital efforts, our app highlighting wellness and clean brands and some of the efforts that we're bringing into that space and it's being received very well. So definitely a strong trend across all categories and one that we see driving growth for some time to come. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Goldsmith with UBS. 
Michael Goldsmith: Congratulations, Laurel. The new store productivity, as we calculated it, it looks like it was a bit lower than what we are accustomed to. First, is that right? And if so was there anything unique from a timing perspective for the markets that you entered during the quarter? And should we think about this in the 70% range going forward instead of maybe the 80% we've seen in the past couple of years? 
Scott Settersten: Yes, I don't know that we could say anything specific on the 70% to 80% range modification, but we didn't really see anything in new store productivity. I mean it may be a function of a fewer less stores right open in the first quarter this year. I think it was 22 versus 34 last year. We look at the comp waterfall. We look at historical basis of the whole fleet every quarter in detail, something we keep a close eye on. We didn't really see anything, any material changes overall in the business. 
 New stores, I think Mary pointed out in her remarks, we're happy with productivity there and how they've come out of the gate so far this year, and so we're still very confident in our 1,500 to 1,700 range in new stores in the U.S. over the long term. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Adrienne Yih with Wolfe Research. 
Adrienne Yih-Tennant: Nice quarter, and congrats, Laurel. My first question is for Mary. Can you talk about the promo environment? It seems to have abated somewhat, and we haven't seen a lot of these sort of vendor-based promos, so what's the opportunity as the year goes on, to continue to pull back on those promos? And then Scott, a housekeeping question on the legacy distribution center that's going off-line. Can you remind us which quarter that occurs and if there is any notable margin impact from that? 
Mary Dillon: Sure. I'll start with the promotional question, Adrienne. I would say that certainly the beauty market remains competitive and offering a strong value proposition is always going to be important for us. So we haven't seen -- I guess, I'd say material increases in competitive promotions, but it as intense as ever, I guess, I'd say, and it's evolving. We're going to continue to evolve. Our promotion level for the quarter was pretty consistent year-over-year. So obviously, we always look for opportunities to sort of optimize how we think about using promotional levers and that's not going to change. So we prioritize our loyalty and our CRM platform in getting more and more -- able to be more personalized offers obviously that's a kind of Holy Grail. We continue to test and learn behind the scenes there's a lot happening that is hard to track but testing different circs and values and reminders and durations, so all those in the spirit of optimizing return on that investment. So I think we've got the right track, the tools to drive traffic and sales and deploy them in a balanced way and will continue to, as we do all the time, keep a very close eye on the competitive environment as well. 
Scott Settersten: Yes, and then specifically on the question, so that was our Phoenix DC and that's behind us now. That was completed early part of the first quarter of 2019. And I'll just give you a little color, so we're not quite lapping Fresno opened last year, right, so there is some moderate deleverage in the first quarter for Fresno that kind of moderates here once we lap that in the second quarter. And so second and third quarter pretty flat, I guess, I would say, overall in supply chain. And then fourth quarter, a bit of deleverage with -- as we stand up the FCC for Romeoville here and then are deeper into the planning stages for Jacksonville, which is coming early part of next year. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Steve Forbes with Guggenheim Securities. 
Steven Forbes: I wanted to focus on the refresh program, so maybe if you can, just how many did you complete in the first quarter? And then bigger picture, can you sort of give us some color and expand on what expressions maybe you're most excited about, right, as you head into the back half of the year here given some of the commentary about prestige cosmetic trends and just the industry in general? 
Scott Settersten: Yes, so I can start on that one. So the refresh, I think they'll go on throughout the course of the year. It's really just kind of getting off the mark in the first quarter, Steve, so percentage-wise, I'd say, somewhere in the 10%, 20% range of the total 270 we have planned for the year, was completed in the early part of the year. So the best is yet to come, so to speak, and impacts from that. And then overall, the assortment in the store, so again, it's more of those, I guess, we call them, growth brands in the script today, but have historically referred to them as the iconic brands, right? So again, those will go in stores. Those will be the biggest newness as part of the refresh program. And again, those will go in a variety of presentations, right, not the historical boutique square footage allocation that you're familiar with but in a number of endcaps, in line runs and things like that across those 270 stores. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Steph Wissink with Jefferies. 
Stephanie Schiller Wissink: Thanks, Laurel, for all your help over the years. And this question is actually for Dave. Just curious, Dave, as you look at your CRM and maybe some of the business analytics or insights that you're able to glean from that with respect to the decline in prestige cosmetics, are you finding that some of your core customers in that category may be navigating over into prestige skincare and pairing it with some of the initiatives you have had in mass cosmetics? Is there wallet share kind of shifting across the store? 
David Kimbell: We'd -- well, I'd answer that in a few ways. One, we are definitely seeing strong growth across skincare. Our mass cosmetics business is healthy. And even with, though -- but even with the struggles that we've had on some of the brands in prestige cosmetics, we're still growing in prestige cosmetics. That business is still positive comping even though some big brands have been a challenge for us. So we're still attracting new consumers in that. In some cases, there are big existing brands that we've launched exclusive lines such as Tarte and Too Faced, new brands that are coming in, attracting new guest, brands like Beauty Bakerie, Kylie and others, so we're definitely still seeing a healthy consumer engagement in prestige. It just isn't growing at the level that we had seen in the past and that we think it can grow in the future. 
 But having said that, there's -- we're really pleased with the overall consumer engagements. One of our best opportunities to continue to gain wallet share to gain spend per member is to get our guest to shop in multiple categories across the store. It's a big focus for us. And you mentioned our analytic and CRM capabilities, as we advance our personalization and AI efforts, a big focus for us will be to help our guests migrate into different categories, still keep them engaged in, say, prestige cosmetics, but if they're not shopping in skin or in hair or in bath or fragrance to help them see other parts of the store. That has been working. We're having a lot of success with that and that will be a focus for us going forward. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Simeon Siegel with Nomura Instinet. 
Simeon Siegel: Congrats, Laurel. Wish you only the best in the next chapter, and welcome Kylie. Mary or Dave, as the gift cards in Kylie grow, are you seeing any notable shopping differences in the customers that are brought in from them versus the others? And then can you talk to your expectations for the trajectory of just channel an product mix from here with kind of thought to any underlying impact to gross margin with those shifts? 
David Kimbell: On Kylie, as we discussed, I think, last quarter with the launch, we're again really pleased with that partnership. Kylie and her team had just been great partners with us from the time -- moment we launched it, and we did see early on and at a sustained strong engagement from our existing guests, but also new guests coming in, in particular younger guests, more diverse guests and so we're really pleased with that, and we would anticipate that continuing. As we've seen with other new digitally native brands across the store, it's helping us attract new guests and contributing to the new guest growth that we've experienced in Q1, so we'll drive -- we'll continue to drive that part of the business, and we'll see that success coming. On the margin piece, Scott? 
Scott Settersten: Yes, so a lot of the headwinds or crosswinds that we talked about with channel in category and brand mixes, I mean those are in the first quarter. We've talked about that historically that we expect those, we anticipated that and that we were still planning through and again, [ you got G ] this quarter, to be able to mitigate much of that and just running our business smarter, so that's what you see in the gross profit leverage in the first quarter, and we feel good about where we are and plan to see more of that as we move into the future. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Binetti with Crédit Suisse. 
Michael Binetti: Let me add my congrats to Laurel and welcome, Kylie. And congrats on a nice quarter. I just wanted to ask you one nitpicky question as well. On the gross margins, I think when we talked last quarter you were thinking first quarter would be the weakest gross margin quarter of the year. It came in above how we were thinking this quarter. It sounded like though in your earlier comments that it was closer to actually being in line with your plans. I'm wondering if you sounded directionally like you didn't think it was going to be above that the rest of year. I'm just wondering if anything has changed on the rest of year outlook for gross margin to flag at all. 
Scott Settersten: Yes, so I guess we'd kind of walking a bit of a tight rope here. We'll try not to give -- be too specific on guidance by quarter, right, for the rest of the year. We're trying to move away from that a little bit. I would say we got better traction on the reflows, so again we're pointing at the EFG and being smarter about the reflows that we rolled out here in the first quarter. They just -- they took off faster, right, than maybe we would have anticipated, so that's great news. And again, directionally, as you're thinking about the rest of the year, I mean gross margin leverage directionally should be consistent with what you saw in the first quarter, and actually, we might get a little -- a bit stronger in the second half of the year as more of the EFG initiatives are scaled up across the business. 
Michael Binetti: Okay. Let me back up and just ask a bigger picture. Mary, you made some comments, it sounds like maybe there is a bit of a pivot in the prestige boutiques format to some formats without a dedicated payroll, anything you would want to call out there? Is that -- I don't know if that's just something to be able to push these further into some of the lower volume stores and things like that? 
Mary Dillon: Yes, and -- so we talked about this last quarter as well. So it's an evolution, I guess, is the way I think about it. They are brands that have a service component, like Benefit Brows and MAC makeup artistry. We'll continue to have dedicated labor in most stores. Other brands, Clinique and Lancôme should be rolling them into all of our stores with various expressions that make sense to the store from -- could be a full boutique as we know it today with labor or could be a gondola run, a wall presentation. So we're working with our brand partners to really optimize the best way to do that for both us and for them. 
Michael Binetti: Okay. If I could sneak one more in you've seen, with Canada, I know -- a couple of U.S. retailers have gone off to Canada. And I think the results have been fairly mixed. But one thing that's been a tougher thing to figure out is how much they can lean on U.S. infrastructure versus building discrete assets to service Canada. I know, you don't want to get into the competitive aspects here, but on the back end, do you think there is an opportunity to leverage your U.S. assets? Or do you need to put discrete assets in Canada? And maybe any of the case studies that you've looked at, as you think about that market and obvious similarities that you could emulate or some clear misses from strategy you've seen from these closures, didn't have such [indiscernible]? 
Mary Dillon: Yes, and today is not the day I'm going to get into details on this, but I can assure you that we've studied this intensely for a long period of time deeply. And that includes case studies around success and failure. So I think we're fully aware and trying to take into consideration everything that we know and have learned and take it, like I said in the script, sort of start small but be prepared to scale aggressively if we see success, so I appreciate the comment. Understand that fully, but all those things are things we'll talk more about as we get further down the pike. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Mark Altschwager with Robert W. Baird. 
Mark Altschwager: Congratulations, Laurel. Scott, I was hoping you could elaborate a bit more on the progress with efficiency initiatives. I guess, what are the primary areas where you're seeing savings this year? Any updated thoughts on how you see those savings building over the planning horizon? And of the bigger buckets you outlined at the Analyst Day, I think from CPI and direct procurement and others, just any big themes that are emerging this year as you've been ramping up those initiatives? 
Scott Settersten: Yes. No, I mean we're kind of right on track with where we thought we would be overall, again, kind of rolling back to Analyst Day and we talked about the various buckets, the major pieces being procurement and real estate and around our core merchandising, inventory management practices. So really, it's the core processes, again, probably not the easiest or the sexiest to talk about and describe to people. But what we saw in the first quarter, so again, EFG takes many forms and shapes as we think about it across the business. But in the first quarter, and one that we're really counting on is making smarter merchandising decisions. So it's executing -- first of all, determining what brands, what the space allocation is, what the profit profiles are on those brands and making sure we're driving good economic outcomes for the business overall, making sure that it's balanced right with other challenges and opportunities we have across the assortment, and then executing that. So we call -- talk about transitions, making sure we got the teams ready, we got the right labor, we got the right products and marketing and all the other things that go along with that at the right place at the right time and just making sure we're taking out as many inefficiencies out of that process as we can. So I mean that was the big driver in first quarter. And all of that kind of activity is something that's a long-term driver for the business because we do a lot of this day in and day out in our business. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Mike Baker with Deutsche Bank. 
Michael Baker: Scott, maybe this gets too close to that quarterly guidance that we're trying to get away from. And if so let me know, but should the same store sales follow that same trajectory of the earnings, i.e., a little bit less growth in the second quarter? And maybe a second way to ask that, as you said that the second quarter has been tough for you for the reasons that you outlined with the 21 Days Of Beauty, is that sort of an expectation that we should think about for this year second quarter as well? 
Scott Settersten: That's fair observation overall. Again, we try to give you a little bit of color on the ins and the outs and the deleverage points as we go through the year. Maybe I can just give a little more color on that, right? So on the gross margin line besides the great positive outcomes on merchandise margin, we also last year, started doing some clearance activity. You'll remember that, it started late in the first quarter and ran pretty heavy through the second and third quarters. And again, we're not expecting to repeat that this year, so that will be helpful. 
 Fixed door cost leverage, I think, was stronger in the first quarter this year than it was a year ago. And again, the store sequencing, right, the cadence this year is a little bit different, so just keep that in mind as you're looking at the rest of the year. It's helpful in the first half of the year, less so in the back half of the year, as we put more stores in line in the third quarter this year. 
 Salon is kind of a headwind all year, heavier in the first part of the year as we roll out services optimization, but then we expect to get traction, and we're going to drive sales and productivity in the stores in the second half and I think I already described supply chain and how we see that kind of playing out through the rest of the year. So again, I would just maybe clarify for folks, we're really happy with the gross margin leverage, but a lot of that's driven by investments in the SG&A line, right. So there is people, there is process, there is tools, there is D&A that goes along with that to help drive productivity improvement in our stores. But again, over the long term, we expect that to pay for itself, right, and that SG&A deleverage will moderate over time. 
Michael Baker: Makes sense. And my part here by saying congratulations, also to Kylie and Laurel. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Dana Telsey with Telsey Advisory Group. 
Dana Telsey: Congratulations on the results. Laurel, bravo, what a great career and wonderful success on your next chapter. I'm sure whatever it will be, it'll -- you'll be terrific at it. And Kylie, look forward to working with you and welcome to the Ulta team. Mary, Dave and Scott, as you think about the opportunities on AR and AI and what you're learning there, it seems like there is an increased emphasis on what it's doing to drive sales. What should we be looking at through the year? And how do you see that rolling out? 
Mary Dillon: I'll start high level, and I'll open it up to David, if he wants to add more. But yes, Dana, thank you. This is one of those things that I would say, it's not going to be like a flip of a switch, where all of a sudden, you'll be able -- we'll be able to sort of feel this dramatic impact. It's going to build over time. I'm really excited that we have got a strong start. 
 And that the acquisitions that we made last year, the team is integrated exceptionally well with our team, digital innovation to drive our top line and other efficiencies will be a key theme really for us, I guess, forever. I don't think that ever changes. So I use a few examples on the -- in the script that are ready live now. And I think a great example is our GLAM LAB, which is live tryout functionality. It works really well and that's a big improvement to what it was before with the static photo, many examples. So I guess we -- behind the scenes, we're constantly measuring, testing and measuring and seeing impacts, and we're confident that this is going to continue to drive growth for us. 
 Is there any other color you want to add to this, Dave? 
David Kimbell: I'll just add one more example of the type of impact that our advancements in this area can have on the business and that's around our new member onboarding and we're actively testing and experimenting with different programs to take the millions of new guests that we've been acquiring every year and making sure they stay engaged with us. We have a high retention rate to begin with, but we think it could be higher. So it's a good example by exploring a lot of different communication techniques, programs, offers to new guests and then leveraging our AI capabilities, we're already seeing positive response in doing that. And we think over time, it will take a little time, but we'll just get smarter and smarter and smarter through the capabilities that we have. So as Mary said, it will take time, but it's exciting frontier for us for sure. 
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the call back over to Mary Dillon for closing remarks. 
Mary Dillon: I'd just like to close by thanking all of the Ulta Beauty associates for a strong start to the year and delivering solid financial results and operational excellence across the enterprise while everybody's been working very hard to also lay the foundation to realize our many future growth opportunities. So we look forward to speaking with all of you again soon. Thank you. 
Operator: This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.

===== 2018 Q4  (2019-03-14 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Greetings. Welcome to the Ulta Beauty Fourth Quarter 2018 Earnings Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this conference is being recorded. I would now turn the conference over to your host, Laurel Lefebvre, Vice President, Investor Relations. Miss Lefebvre, you may begin. 
Laurel Lefebvre: Thank you. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us for Ulta Beauty's Fourth Quarter 2018 Conference Call. Hosting our call are Mary Dillon, Chief Executive Officer; and Scott Settersten, Chief Financial Officer. Also joining us is Dave Kimbell, Chief Merchandising and Marketing Officer. 
 Before we begin, I'd like to remind you of the company's safe harbor language. The statements contained in this conference call which are not historical facts may be deemed to constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual future results may differ materially from those projected in such statements due to a number of risks and uncertainties, all of which are described in the company's filings with the SEC. 
 We make reference during this call to non-GAAP sales and earnings growth, adjusted for the impact of the 53rd week and one-time tax-related items in Q4 of 2017. During the Q&A session, we remind you to ask one question only to allow us to have time to respond to as many of you as possible during the hour scheduled for this call. 
 I'll now turn the call over to Mary. 
Mary Dillon: Thank you, Laurel, and good afternoon, everyone. The Ulta Beauty team delivered excellent results for the fourth quarter. This performance reflects an acceleration in the retail comp, primarily driven by traffic, continued strength in mass cosmetics, boutique brands, skincare and fragrance, and stable performance in prestige cosmetics. We're gaining significant share across all major categories, particularly with digitally native brands that our guests are highly engaged with and where Ulta Beauty is often the only point of distribution in brick-and-mortar. 
 Solid execution of our holiday plans by our merchandising, store operations, e-commerce, marketing, supply chain and systems teams drove a successful holiday period across multiple metrics: sales, in-stocks and guest experience. 
 To recap our fourth quarter financial performance. Total sales increased 9.7%, or 16.2% adjusting for last year's 53rd week. We achieved our best comp sales performance of the year with a 9.4% comp on top of an 8.8% comp in the fourth quarter of 2017. The strong performance was driven primarily by transaction growth, with meaningful improvement in the retail traffic trend. 
 Diluted GAAP earnings per share of $3.61 grew 6.2% compared to $3.40 achieved in last year's 14-week fourth quarter, or 31.3% excluding the benefit from tax reform-related items in the fourth quarter of 2017.
 We delivered these results by executing on our strategic imperatives. And I'll provide an update on each, starting with our strategies to increase loyalty and evolve our brand. Our Ultamate Rewards loyalty program remains one of our most valuable assets. Membership at the end of the year reached 31.8 million active members, representing active member growth of 14.4% compared to 2017. Our store team's sustained focus on conversion benefited from robust store traffic during the quarter. As we anniversaried the launch of our Elite Diamond tier, we are pleased to see the number of guests that attained Diamond level was ahead of plan, with very high guest engagement. 
 The latest loyalty program benefit was launched at the beginning of the new fiscal year with the new perk offering our guests the ability to use points on all skin, brow, makeup and hair services, and guests are loving it. 
 We've been talking about personalization as the next frontier in loyalty. We're currently focusing our efforts around personalization by incorporating relevant product recommendations and replenishment reminders across digital channels, with much more in the works in concert with our acquisitions of QM Scientific and GlamST last fall. I'll cover more on this topic in a moment when I discuss digital innovation. 
 Our credit card program exceeded expectations in 2018, with penetration of credit card sales reaching double digits. Success here was driven by outstanding store associate engagement, effective acquisition campaigns such as gifts with applications, seamless integration into the loyalty calendar and strong support from internal and external partners. 
 Gift card sales grew 24% in the fourth quarter, and this 
 healthy growth helped fuel strong post-holiday sales. Increases in our third-party distribution network drove much of this growth, with the total third-party door count now surpassing 50,000 distribution points. 
 Benefiting from our holiday marketing campaigns, Q4 brand awareness maintained all-time high levels reached throughout 2018 at 55% for unaided and 90% for aided awareness. Brand awareness showed momentum across all generations, with particular strength among Gen X and Gen Z shoppers as well as progress with our Latinas and African-American beauty enthusiasts. We also continue to drive a stronger emotional connection to our brand as a result of our marketing and public relations efforts to advance our new brand purpose, The Possibilities Are Beautiful. 
 Next, I'd like to share an update on our strategy to delight our guests with our merchandise assortment, focused on innovation, differentiation, exclusivity and speed to market. Newness continued to drive traffic and share gains across all categories. Products that weren't in the assortment a year ago drove about 4 points of our total company comp. Top-performing categories were mass cosmetics, prestige boutique brands, fragrance and prestige skincare. Smaller departments like accessories and sun care also delivered double-digit comps. 
 The makeup category overall, through the lens of mass and prestige cosmetics combined, comped exactly in line with the [ house ]. Our strategy to be the partner of choice for digitally native brands like Morphe and Kylie Cosmetics are paying off. Both brands drove very strong traffic in stores, suggesting our guests are motivated to make more trips to the store to try these products in person. 
 Despite a tough comparison to double-digit comps in the fourth quarter of last year, mass cosmetics accelerated to be our best-performing category in the quarter, with Morphe, Revolution Beauty and e.l.f. leading the way. Building on the success of changes to the assortment we made a year ago, we just reset the mass cosmetics area again with more space dedicated to the fastest-growing brands. Morphe expanded to a larger footprint in most stores and is having great success with collaborations with mega influencers, Jaclyn Hill and James Charles. Morphe recently launched its Fluidity Foundation in 600 doors featuring 60 shades, and we also just launched a Morphe makeup fresh collaboration with Jeffree Star, another high-profile social media influencer with 11.5 million Instagram followers. We also expanded ColourPop to 250 more stores, now available in nearly 800 stores. Other brands that earned expansions to either more doors or more shelf space include e.l.f., L.A. Girl, Milani, Wet n Wild and BH Cosmetics. 
 [ Counts ] remained very healthy across Benefit, Clinique, Lancôme and MAC. We rolled out 692 prestige boutiques in total for 2018, and plan to expand the presence of these 4 brands in many additional doors in 2019 in various expressions in our stores, including presence in line, on wall presentations, on endcaps and in impulse fixtures. 
 In the rest of the prestige cosmetics portfolio, top performers included Estée Lauder, Kylie Cosmetics, NARS and Tarte. We have a lot of exciting newness across the portfolio that's encouraging for this category's performance in 2019. Key launches include Tarte face tape foundation, inspired by the iconic best-selling shape tape concealer; Sugar Rush, an exclusive sub-brand from Tarte, specifically created to target the Gen Z beauty enthusiast; a new brow program and makeup pallet from Urban Decay; and the launch of new brands, Smith & Cult and Grande lash. 
 We're also highlighting trends more visibly in our store with a focus on clean beauty, with a vegan beauty endcap, and the expansion of our hottest-in-beauty section in-store. This was launched last fall as an endcap, showcasing new, hot digital brands like Lime Crime, Ofra and Sugarpill, and is moving in line this quarter. 
 To update you on Kylie Cosmetics, which launched in mid-November, we experienced very strong sell-through on the 28 lip products we offer and were essentially out-of-stock for a few weeks at the end of the quarter. This popular brand clearly drove store traffic and new customer acquisition, with an uptick in younger, more diverse guests. Product began flowing back into the stores in late January and we're currently in a much better in-stock position. 
 This week, several new items are setting to add to the original assortment, including eyeshadow palettes and some additional lip products. 
 Fragrance had a banner year, capped with a strong fourth quarter performance that drove double-digit comps. These results were underpinned by our holiday marketing and gift-with-purchase programs as well as the success of our Fragrance Crush program, which highlights a fragrance each month. KKW FRAGRANCE, launched exclusively in brick-and-mortar at Ulta before holiday, was a standout in the portfolio. YSL, Versace and Ulta Beauty exclusive Ariana Grande fragrances were also among the leading brands driving our growth in fragrance.  
 The prestige skin category delivered solid growth, led by strength from Mario Badescu, First Aid Beauty and proactiv. We're broadening our brand portfolio with the addition of new brands like Urban Skin Rx, a line of clinical skincare products designed for women of color; Fountain of Truth, a clean, cruelty-free line developed by Giuliana Rancic; My Clarins, an exclusive line of vegan skincare products from Clarins; and Cannuka, a skincare line infused with CBD and honey. We've also added a curated assortment of Kiehl's products in all doors in our impulse fixtures, and all new stores we open this year will offer the full Kiehl's product line. 
 The overall haircare category also delivered solid growth, with broad-based strength across core professional haircare brands and a successful promotion featuring jumbo sizes of Pro Hair products. Consumer interest in Sugarbearhair vitamins was a highlight in the mass hair category. 
 In summary, the team has done a fantastic job evolving our offerings across the entire box and making sure we have the right brands and products to delight our guests [ to ] create constant newness. 
 Now let me update you on our services business. Salon comp sales rose 6.2%, driven by average ticket increases. Total salon revenue increased 4.7% compared to last year's fourth quarter with an extra week of sales. The salon teams benefited from the healthy traffic in our stores and drove strength across all the major service categories, including color, cut and style, blowouts, hair treatments and makeup. We're seeing encouraging results from the regions that have rolled out our services optimization platform and plan to implement this program for the entire chain in the second quarter. The hallmarks of the services optimization program are our compensation designed to attract and retain top talent, industry-leading internal training and education, simplified menus, transparent pricing and an enhanced field team focused on business and technical training in each district. 
 We continue to test our new salon appointment booking tool in partnership with technology startup Spruce, which has developed an enhanced tool for booking appointments for all services, including hair, skin, brows with the Benefit Brow Bars and makeup with MAC artists. We expect to roll out the booking tool with further enhancements in 2019. 
 Our Ulta Beauty Pro team won the prestigious NAHA, or North American Hair Award, for the Salon Team of The Year for the first time this year. Both the Ulta Beauty Pro team and the Ulta Beauty design team were nominated in this category. This type of recognition highlights Ulta Beauty as an industry leader and authority in salon hair care, raising our profile and helping us attract high-quality stylists. 
 Now I'll turn to store growth. We opened 11 net new stores in the fourth quarter compared to 16 last year and ended the year with 1,174 stores. New store productivity remains very strong. We plan to open approximately 80 stores this year, the majority in suburban strip centers and power centers. 
 The 2019 plan anticipates about 3/4 of the new store portfolio in existing shopping centers and 1/4 in new centers, with almost all stores filling in the existing markets compared to just a couple stores in new markets. Our real estate strategy is evolving to focus on portfolio management with heightened attention on lease renegotiation; evaluating repositioning, relocating or closing stores at the end of leases; and continuing to remodel and upgrade storefronts and pylon signs to ensure consistent branding and shopping experiences across the portfolio. 
 Moving to our e-commerce business. Ulta.com grew comp sales 25.1% on top of 50.4% in the fourth quarter of 2017, and contributed 240 basis points to our total company comp, driven by transaction growth. Total site traffic rose 33%, with mobile site traffic growth up 31% and mobile app traffic up 49%. We're driving healthy growth of our omni-channel members with loyalty members shopping both retail stores and Ulta.com increasing to 12.1% of guests for 2018 compared to 10.4% in 2017. 
 Our e-commerce growth rate was a bit softer than our guidance of mid-30s, which we attribute primarily to a reverse channel shift in light of our guests' avid interest in coming to the store to see and try makeup from digitally native brands like Morphe and Kylie Cosmetics. All of the moderation in our e-commerce growth rate came from the cosmetic category across both prestige and mass. We made the strategic decision to emphasize our in-store offerings with these newer brands with a broader assortment and more inventory allocated for highly anticipated launches like the James Charles palette. 
 As a result, the strength of these digitally native brands was even more concentrated in-store than we planned. Another factor in the top line moderation for Ulta.com relates to e-commerce's higher sensitivity to promotional offers. We saw the bigger impact to our online sales as a result of being less promotional year-over-year. 
 We continue to see strong guest adoption of our buy online, pick up in store initiative. We're expanding focus from the 47 stores that launched in late 2018 and plan to deploy to the full chain this summer. 
 Turning to digital innovation highlights. Following the acquisitions of GlamST and QM Scientific last fall, we're pleased to report that both teams are integrating very well into the Ulta Beauty team. We've migrated our personalization platform to Google Cloud and are bringing to life product recommendations and adding more data such as reviews and clickstream data to amplify our understanding of our guest behaviors. We're also working on conversational commerce and AI-driven communications to automate common guest service inquiries on topics such as birthday gifts and loyalty points. GLAM LAB, our virtual try-on app, recently launched live video on iOS, which will soon be available on Android devices as well. Previously, the app offered only static images. With advances in virtual try-on capabilities, we're mapping out linkages between AI and try-on apps that will have applications in areas such as skin diagnostics or finding the perfect foundation. 
 As a reminder, we won't be breaking out detailed quarterly e-commerce metrics starting in 2019, but we'll continue to provide color on e-commerce trends and its contribution to our growth. 
 Lastly, I'll provide an update on our supply chain strategy. Our supply chain team and operations performed very smoothly during the busy holiday season and delivered excellent in-stock levels while controlling overall inventory levels. Inventory per door grew 1.3%, well below the comp growth rate, as we leveraged core systems such as SWIFT to improve inventory productivity. 
 Our Fresno DC is ramping up more quickly than our previous DCs, now serving 235 stores and 21% of e-commerce orders. We're winding down our Phoenix distribution center, which will officially close later this month. The teams there have done an excellent job transferring inventories to our remaining network and wrapping up the facility closure with minimal disruption ahead of the lease expiration at the end of the month as well as assisting the smooth transitions of our associates into the local job market. We're excited to announce that we're in the process of converting our Romeoville, Illinois, distribution center into Ulta Beauty's first fast fulfillment center planned to open this summer. 
 A second FFC is in the works and expected to open in the summer of 2020 in Jacksonville, Florida. Fast fulfillment centers serve only e-commerce orders and will be able to fulfill up to 30,000 orders per day during peak times, increasing our network capacity and progressing toward our goal of 2-day e-commerce shipping by 2021. Another initiative to speed delivery to our e-commerce guests is our ship-from-store project. We plan to launch a test of ship from store in 5 locations around the country in the second half of the year. 
 So with that, I'll turn it over to Scott to discuss in more detail the drivers of our fourth quarter financials and outlook for 2019. 
Scott Settersten: Thank you, Mary, and good afternoon, everyone. Starting with the income statement. Our 9.4% comp, along with strong new store productivity and e-com growth, drove revenue growth of 16.2% adjusted for the 53rd week of the fourth quarter of 2017. The revenue recognition standard adopted at the beginning of 2018 contributed about $15 million of revenue. As a reminder, this represents the combined impact of income from our credit card program, gift card breakage and the timing of recognition of e-commerce sales, offset by the value of points earned in our loyalty program. We enjoyed the strongest traffic in several quarters with transactions up 7.1% and ticket up 2.3% for the total company. The retail-only comp of 7% was driven by 4.9% transaction growth and 2.1% ticket growth. Ticket was driven 2/3 by average selling price and 1/3 by increases in units per transaction. 
 On the gross profit line, margin improved 90 basis points year-over-year. The new revenue recognition accounting standard added about 60 basis points to the gross profit line and a comparison to last year's special bonuses for hourly associates helped by about 20 basis points. The factors driving the modest underlying gross profit improvement were fewer promotions overall, a lower-than-expected mix of e-commerce sales and strong leverage of rent and occupancy expenses on better-than-expected sales, offset by investments in our salon business and supply chain operations. 
 Turning to SG&A. We deleveraged by 90 basis points, including 90 basis points of impact from the revenue recognition accounting standard. Underlying SG&A expense was flat on a rate basis due to planned deleverage in corporate overhead related to investments in growth initiatives, offset by leverage in marketing and variable store expenses. Operating margin rose 10 basis points year-over-year to 13.3% of sales, including a negative impact of 30 basis points attributable to the revenue recognition accounting change. This was above the 20 basis points impact reported earlier in the year as our guests adopted to open their rewards credit card at a higher-than-expected rate. This, in concert with stronger-than-expected Q4 sales, resulted in guests earning more loyalty points, requiring us to defer more revenue. 
 Moving on to the balance sheet and cash flow. Total inventory grew 10.9% and was up 1.3% on a per-store basis, well below comparable sales as we continue to realize efficiencies from improved systems and processes. Capital expenditures were $319 million for the year, driven by new store opening program, supply chain, systems and merchandise fixtures. CapEx came in a bit below expectations due to some early savings on store fixtures resulting from the Efficiencies for Growth program as well as the timing of some planned IT and supply chain spending that will now fall into 2019. 
 We ended the year with $409.3 million in cash. We repurchased 2.464 million shares at a cost of $616.2 million, or an average share price of $250 for the full year, through our 10b5-1 program. 
 We stepped up our repurchases opportunistically in the fourth quarter to take advantage of our better-than-expected cash flow generation as well as market volatility late in the year. $46.1 million remain available under our $625 million authorization as of the end of the year. Today, we announced a new share repurchase authorization for $875 million, with plans to repurchase approximately $700 million in fiscal 2019. 
 Turning now to guidance for 2019. Our outlook for this year is consistent with the long-term outlook we provided at our November Analyst Day. We plan to open approximately 80 new stores, all our traditional 10,000 square-foot prototype. We plan to remodel 12 stores and relocate 8 stores as well as execute 270 store refreshes or mini remodels, generally entailing the addition of new brands and improvement in overall fixturing. We anticipate driving top line growth in the low double digits with total company comparable sales planned in the 6% to 7% range. We expect e-commerce to grow in the 20% to 30% range, contributing approximately 20 basis points to comparable sales. We expect to deliver earnings per share in the range of $12.65 to $12.85, with approximately 10 to 20 basis points of operating margin expansion. The underlying assumptions are to deliver gross profit improvement driven by merchandise margin expansion, rent and occupancy expense cost leverage and the benefits of our credit card program. These benefits will be offset by deleveraging SG&A due to store labor and investments in growth initiatives and innovation. Areas such as digital innovation, our salon services strategy, expanding our omnichannel capabilities, IT security and infrastructure, personalization efforts, our strategy to pursue emerging brands and initiatives to enhance the guest experience will, as a whole, contribute to corporate overhead deleverage. 
 In terms of the cadence of investments and benefits of these initiatives throughout the year, while we're no longer providing specific quarterly guidance, you can expect EPS growth this year to be slightly weighted to the back half, with more of the benefits of the Efficiencies for Growth cost optimization program occurring later in the year. You can expect low-teens EPS growth and modest operating margin deleverage in the first half, and high-teens EPS growth and modest operating margin leverage in the second half of the year. 
 In terms of capital, we plan to spend between $380 million and $400 million. This includes CapEx of approximately $190 million for new stores, remodels and merchandise fixtures; $140 million for supply chain and IT, including new fast fulfillment centers; and about $60 million for store maintenance and other. Depreciation and amortization expense is expected to be approximately $315 million. We expect our tax rate to be 24%, which does not include any estimates of the impact of share-based compensation. The fully diluted share count for the year is expected to be approximately 58 million. Our plan assumes share repurchases in the $700 million range, contributing about 4 points of earnings per share growth. 
 And with that, I'll turn it over to our conference call host for Q&A. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Erinn Murphy, Piper Jaffray. 
Erinn Murphy: I guess, my question, Mary, is for you. If you could talk a little bit more about how you anticipate some of the personalization efforts you have going on to really be that unlock to driving wallet share higher. Any examples you have there? And then, Scott, just a clarification on the guidance. You talked about the deleverage first half versus leverage in the second half. Is your same-store sales guidance of 6% to 7%, is that fairly similar throughout the year? Or is there a difference in first half versus second half? 
Mary Dillon: Sure I'll start with the loyalty program and I'll ask David to add a couple bits at the end, if he wants. But to give you a full answer, the -- I'd say, overall, the spend-per-member growth is going to be driven by a lot of things, personalization being one of them, for sure. But we're pleased with how it's been progressing. So really, things that we do today, like newness and the perks that we continue to innovate, the credit card program, the tiers like the newest Diamond tier, all are contributing to engagement and driving that spend per member. And as guests mature in the program, their spend just naturally grows over time as well. Personalization is -- I think, we're very much in the early innings on it, very excited about it, and it's really about driving more customized experiences. I guess, one simple example would be recommendations. So the smarter that we can get about a guest's past purchase patterns and infer her preferences or his preferences based on that, it gives us the ability to serve up recommendations that are even more relevant, for example. And if there's any other examples you want to add? 
David Kimbell: Yes, the other areas we're focused on, certainly, yes, product recommendation, replenishment reminders. We're adding into that additional customized co-purchase recommendations, site personalization. So customizing your site experience based on your previous behavior. For example, if we see that you're a first-time visitor, you'll get a different experience than if you're a frequent visitor. Your homepage might change, we'll do product finders in unique ways. Really, the purchase -- the acquisition of both QM Scientific and GlamST was to accelerate our personalization efforts, and we're really excited about the progress and results to date and feel like we're going to take a big step towards that goal in 2019. 
Scott Settersten: As far as the comp cadence for the year, I would say, generally speaking, it's a pretty consistent 6% to 7% throughout the whole year. Although I would say, maybe the fourth quarter, you might take a little bit more conservative approach on as we'll be comping over some great kickoffs here with Kylie and James Charles here this last fourth quarter. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Christopher Horvers, JPMorgan. 
Christopher Horvers: So I'll slide my 2 questions into 1 as well. So first on the digitally native brands, really impressive in terms of how it drove that traffic and retail comp acceleration. So maybe diagnose, was that more Morphe? I mean, it's in more stores. Kylie had a smaller assortment. There's 18 SKUs or something like that, and it's sold out. So sort of how would you assess that? And would you expect the Kylie piece to accelerate now that the assortment is starting to expand and presumably will expand further over the year? And my second question is for Scott also, which is you gave a lot of color on cadence. Curious on the first half versus back half, how much of that is gross margin versus SG&A? Is gross margin -- as we continue to scale over salon investments, is that the sort of pressure point in gross margin and would you expect that down in the first half? 
Mary Dillon: Possibly 3 questions in 1. Listen, we're excited about the momentum on the business, digitally native brands being a part of it, but frankly, really not the only and most major part. I mean, we had, as I discussed in the script, really strong growth across a lot of -- most of our categories and share gains across almost every single category. And strong double-digit growth across many places. So really, I would say that think about those as definitely big launches. Morphe, we had already launched. The James Charles palette was a nice, good addition because he has a strong following. And of course, Kylie was new and a pretty small assortment. So you can expect that -- I've already said, we're expanding that assortment. That's happening right now. And I'd like to think about it as a plethora of ways that we're going to continue to be the source, I think, leader for growth in the category by participating across categories with the many brand partners that are both existing and new. So I think about it as, I guess, sort of we're all really focused on what are our guests looking for at the end of the day. And if we can make sure to offer that to them, I think we're going to continue to be in a good place. 
Scott Settersten: Yes, so as far as color on the year goes, so we're transitioning into this new sphere, right, this new zone of guidance and annual guidance and whatnot and updating on the quarters. But I know everyone has this question, Chris, so you got to the buzzer first. So when we look at the year... 
Christopher Horvers: That was my goal. 
Scott Settersten: The modest operating expansion for the full year, it's going to come on the gross margin line, it's what we expect, and it's going to come through better merchandise margin overall. I think I could point to the clearance event in that second, third quarter time period this last year. We wouldn't expect to have to do that again in 2019. That's not in our plan. You mentioned salon. Yes, that will be a headwind but it's not the biggest driver in there. So that will be some deleverage on the gross margin line. DC leverage in the first half of the year is heavier because of Fresno, right? We won't lap that until the middle of the year. And so supply chain will kind of moderate in the second half. And then, we've got some good occupancy leverage in there throughout the year, but there's a slight shift quarter-to-quarter just because the new store program sequences a little bit different in 2019. SG&A then, it's a net deleverage for 2019 and it's primarily coming out of the investments we're making, right, to drive long-term healthy sales and earnings for the business. So the M&A things we did, right, turning to OpEx now, there's a lot of other innovation. Mary went through a long list of things that we're doing to drive the business, and primarily, those things fall in the SG&A. Corporate overhead is really the primary culprit there, so to speak, on the deleverage. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Stephanie Wissink, Jefferies. 
Ashley Helgans: This is Ashley Helgans on for Step Wissink. We wanted to know, are you seeing a shift in purchasing from prestige to masstige as you continue to add more masstige brands? 
David Kimbell: Hi, Ashley. We are -- frankly, we're seeing strength across the whole makeup category. Certainly, there's brands across all price points that are doing very well, and there's others that are struggling. So I wouldn't say it's a strength. And one of the -- it's a shift. I will say, one of the strengths that we have at Ulta Beauty is what we call mass migration and bringing a guest in -- a segment of guests in through mass brands and introducing them into prestige brands. That is still continuing. That's quite healthy. It's a unique aspect of the Ulta Beauty experience since we're the only ones that carry brands across all price points. That behavior is still quite strong. And so brands at all price points, from entry-level price points such as e.l.f., all the way up through our most prestige brands, whether it's Lancôme or Chanel, are performing quite well. We are seeing strength. This masstige area of brands with price points kind of in between is a growth area, but it's not really at the expense of any specific part of the business. It's just attractive right now as some of those brands are stronger at this moment. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Simeon Siegel, Nomura Instinet. 
Simeon Siegel: Scott, just recognizing that you lapped that one-time bonus. Just any help in terms of thinking through the SG&A dollar growth? I think you called, or I think you mentioned wage, so just any thoughts there? And then, are you guys seeing -- I don't know if you had mentioned it. As you think about the digital natives and as those grow, is there any difference in terms of the in-store versus e-com performance relative to the rest of your portfolio? 
Scott Settersten: Yes, so we don't really characterize or describe SG&A in dollars growth year-over-year. I know others in the department store and other spaces do that. But just color on SG&A overall, again, it's going to be a net deleverage point for the full year. Heavier maybe the first part of the year as we still got some of the investments that were late starting in 2018, right? We had heavier deleverage in corporate overhead in the second half of 2018, and some of the investment and growth initiatives kind of we got out of the gate a little bit slower in 2018 than we had planned to do. So that will continue into the first half of 2019. Store labor, we'll continue to make investments there to drive growth strategies there. But I think that gets neutralized a lot by some marketing leverage we expect to close on in 2019. So yes, so we're in a good spot overall, we believe, well managed and doing the right things for the business for the long-term. 
Mary Dillon: And then, to your other question, Simeon, I would say, it sort of -- it depends. Overall, digitally native brands are performing well, both online and we're bringing them into the store. So maybe what we just saw on the last quarter, it's a little bit about how we choose to play it, frankly. As we went into this quarter, we emphasized those 2, Kylie and James Charles, launches more in-store, frankly, and it really drove a lot of in-store traffic. They're also doing really, really well online. But we had a bigger assortment in-store. And so I would say that we also have brands that we sell only online that did quite well. So for us, it's about -- I think it actually is a good proof point about the basic thesis of our business, which is that the physical experience of trying on -- trying products in person really appeals to a lot of our guests, and then she also wants to be able to buy it online and be convenient as well. So it's an interesting time for us to say how do we kind of meet the guest where she is, think about how -- what's best for our business, but I don't see any reason why we can't be successful in both channels. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Steve Forbes, Guggenheim Securities. 
Steven Forbes: So I wanted to focus on the refresh program, right, because I believe 270 is a slight step up versus the trend line over the past couple of years here. So maybe just touch on what the store-level needs are? I know you mentioned, right, new merchandise and fixtures and et cetera, but maybe just focus on what the store-level needs are that are driving this ramp and what the typical refresh will include as it relates to that merchandise focus? 
David Kimbell: Yes, the primary purpose of this year's refresh program is really to continue to expand some key brand partners that we have. As we go into these stores, we'll, in some cases, address opportunities to enhance or improve or repair certain parts of the store. But we see a big opportunity for us to continue to expand with key brands. And what's going to be a bit different maybe this year versus years in the past when we think specifically around some of our brands like Clinique and Lancôme is we'll be expanding them into a variety of different expressions. In some cases, in a boutique, as you've seen and come to know at Ulta Beauty, but in many cases, in different expressions, whether that's in gondolas, on walls, on endcaps, in other parts of the store. So that's the primary focus of that -- of this year's rollout and improvement with our stores. 
Scott Settersten: And Steve, just from a quantitative standpoint, if we think about it in terms of the total fleet investment, so if you compare new store, 100-plus last year, the 80 next year, the remodel boutique kinds of activities that we have and the merchandising fixtures in general that we're always refreshing our stores, right, in one fashion or another. I think it's actually a step down in net CapEx year-over-year, if you look at it that way. So again, it's a key focus for us. Keep that store fleet looking fresh all the time, keep it inviting and making sure we're delivering the best guest experience that we can. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Simeon Gutman, Morgan Stanley. 
Simeon Gutman: My question is on traffic and ticket. It looks like during the year, ticket actually decelerated and traffic increased. You mentioned in the fourth quarter this reverse channel shift. Can you talk about it for the rest of the year in '18? Should we expect the reversal of that? And then, just as a second part, what's embedded in the 6% to 7% as far as AUR growth for 2019? 
Scott Settersten: Yes, so as far as the traffic trends go, I mean, we know we struggled a little bit and we had some headwinds early in the year, and we picked up momentum. We saw that. We're on it. We're -- the merchant team and all their support partners are working hard to make sure we bring the best that we can, that our guests expect from us and that's going to generate excitement, whether it's in-store or online. So again, going into every quarter, going into every year, our expectation is to drive a healthy balance between traffic, transactions and ticket growth overall with no, I wouldn't say, any one specific expectation for any one of those elements, right? So again, earlier in the year, some of the newness didn't deliver, right? Didn't drive as much excitement in either of the channels as we'd hoped for. We found more winners in the back half of the year, right? And that drives traffic, whether it's online or in-store. 
Simeon Gutman: And the AUR part, can you -- because I think, in the fourth quarter, you mentioned that AUR was about 2/3 of the ticket growth, and I don't know if there's a number you can share with us that you expect in 2019, sort of I think of it almost as a head start as part of that 6% to 7% comp outlook. 
Scott Settersten: Yes, I think, sometimes, we try to overengineer our financial models. Again, it's always a healthy balance, whether it's ticket versus traffic or it's units versus average selling price. Again, at the end of the day, these products get hot and things happen that you can't control, right? The guest is going to determine how they want to spend their money. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Adrienne Yih, Wolfe Research. 
Adrienne Yih-Tennant: Mary, my question is on the loyalty program. I was wondering if you can share with us the percent of Platinum clients that are actually converting to Diamond? And then, are you seeing a replenishment of the Platinum membership? And then, really quickly, for Scott, inventory has been growing slower than sales for the past 4 consecutive quarters. I'm wondering if that's a sustainable spread go forward? 
Mary Dillon: Thank you, Adrienne. We don't really break that out specifically. I'll tell you, we feel really good about the Diamond tier launch. It's ahead of -- I guess, I would say, it's ahead of what we expected so far, which is fantastic because these folks are our best guests in terms of being omnichannel guests, services guests, high share of wallet, et cetera. And we're seeing overall, throughout the loyalty set of folks, as they mature, they spend more, and so we're going to have more of them moving from Platinum into Diamond. And our job is to continue to entice them to spend more through everything that we do every day. And I think all that is working really well. So as I mentioned, whether it's newness; new perks, we just started with being able to use loyalty points on services and that seems to be very appealing; credit card growth; and then the additional ability to use personalization tools. I think we feel good about where we are. 
Scott Settersten: As far as inventory goes, I think we addressed some of that at Analyst Day here back in November. So yes, we expect that we're still in the early stages. I mean, I think it's evidenced, the metrics you referred to. And now, again, I don't know that I'd be able to draw a line, right, and continue in perpetuity some of the performance we've seen here most recently, but we believe we've got the tools and the capabilities in place now to definitely do a lot more by way of optimizing our inventory over the long-term and margin results, right, that are coming from being able better to control the flow, far more automated kind of markdowns, doing better with our transitions and our assortment decisions. So we still think there's a long way to go there. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Michael Goldsmith, UBS. 
Michael Goldsmith: So you mentioned that newness drove about 4 points of the comp. Can you help quantify how much of an acceleration that was in past periods? Is this level sustainable? And then, on the channel shift to the real stores this quarter, does that change the way you think about product and brand launches in the future? 
Mary Dillon: Yes, on the -- I don't know if we would break out in the past, Laurel. You can help me with that. 
Laurel Lefebvre: We have broken it out in the past.  It was maybe 1/3 or maybe a little bit higher than that, so not a dramatic increase, but it's definitely accelerated, some of the new James Charles and some of the Kylie products. 
Mary Dillon: And the goal is to always drive as much comp as we can. So I mean, I can't -- we can't predict that would be a continued trend. I mean, that was a bit of a -- it worked great, but I wouldn't say that we'd expect it to be ongoing at that level. But our merchant team is constantly out there. There's all sorts of newness all the time and that's what our guests really want, and I think we're doing a good job of delivering that. And as for the channel shift, I guess, in some ways, we're kind of learning as we go. As I said, we're being very direct about the fact that the e-commerce growth was somewhat different than we expected this quarter because it's sort of a high-class problem to have, we have more people shopping in the stores. And I think it's interesting, again, proving the thesis that the in-store experience is extremely important sometimes as well. So I think we'll just continue to be strategic and tactical about how we think about launches. And it's going to vary. There won't be any one formula, I think I'd say, but I think it's good that we have options. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Michael Binetti, Crédit Suisse. 
Michael Binetti: So you guys came out of the quarter with good momentum in the comp and it looks appropriately conservative to us. But I guess -- the outlook looks appropriately conservative. But I guess the margin break in fourth quarter was a little different than we thought, SG&A flow-through was a little lower on a lot more revenue. I guess I'm just trying to think forward a little bit related to leverage rates given that the guidance you just gave us sounds like it has some investments in the base right now that are leading to a little bit more margin expansion later in the year. But if you do -- with the momentum today, means you're going to have better sales than what you have in the same-store sales guidance this year. How should we think about you guys approach how much flows through to the bottom line this year versus dialing up the investments even more? 
Scott Settersten: Yes, I'd say what we've been through, we've been investing for a long time, right, Mary? I mean, for multiple years now and it's a moving target, Michael. You know that. Retail is a very dynamic environment. So we talked -- I think I referenced supply chain and maybe a little bit less deleverage in the back half of the year, but we're still making big investments through fast fulfillment centers and other tools and things we're putting in place to help our teams perform better day-to-day. So the investment never ends, right? In air quotes, I guess I would say. So -- and we're pragmatic. Whenever we're looking at the quarter and we see sales strength, there's an opportunity to pull back on promotional cadence and things like that. So we're just -- every quarter and every year presents its own unique set of elements that we try to navigate through and just deliver the best overall result. 
Michael Binetti: If I could ask a quick follow-up, Scott. So I think you guys -- I think one of the most interesting parts of the quarter was the changing language on the merch margin. And today, it sounds like the plan is for that to be positive. I think, more recently, the plan was to manage towards a flat merch margin, and frankly, at times, it sounded like that was going to be an aspirational goal. Would you mind telling us what's changed and what you've seen that's giving you the confidence saying, hey, we can actually guide to and manage to a little bit better merch margin than we've spoken to more recently? 
Scott Settersten: Yes, I'd say the primary driver is around Efficiencies for Growth or EFG. So again, we haven't spoken to that directly today. But that's an umbrella over the whole enterprise, right? And so there's a lot of benefits to that, that are going to flow through both the gross margin line and the SG&A line. It's going to help us offset cost pressures that you see all retailers talking about, whether it's innovation things or digital things or wage rate pressures or freight pressures. I mean, there's a whole list of things that we are navigating our way through here. So EFG, I think Adrienne asked a question here earlier about inventory. So that's a key piece of what's going to help merchandise margin. It's not just the out-the-door selling margin, it's how we work with our vendors more efficiently and optimize a lot of the, what I call, the core processes internally around the merchandise assortment and how we transition our stores and how much store labor gets incurred to execute some of those things and the partners we work with and all the economics that go along with that. So that's really it that's driving our assumptions around better merchandise margins here in the foreseeable future. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Mark Altschwager, Robert W. Baird & Company. 
Mark Altschwager: You highlighted how Kylie essentially sold out later in the quarter and it took some time to replenish. And I'm wondering, is that sellout or scarcity going to become a bigger component of the model as you lean in to these -- to the digitally native brand strategy? And if so, how should we think about the implications for merchandise margins longer-term? And then, separately, I'm just -- I'm wondering what percent of your assortment today you would say is unique to Ulta and where you see that metric headed over the next 1 to 2 years? 
David Kimbell: Yes, Mark, on Kylie, I guess I wouldn't say that there is a one-size-fits-all solution to that. I think, with Kylie, we anticipated potentially having out-of-stocks late in the quarter. It actually happened a little bit earlier as reaction -- consumer reaction was a bit more positive than we anticipated. And it's not our ideal scenario, but it was one that we had planned on for this specific launch. As we look forward with other brands that are in our portfolio, that's not -- we're not experiencing out-of-stocks on a consistent basis and that's not something that we would certainly want to make a practice or a habit. But there will be instances on brands, as they're either building their capacity or the timing makes sense, that we may experience that. But I wouldn't think of that as, now, that's the new normal or a new way for us to approach it. So that in and of itself shouldn't have an impact going forward. As far as the percent exclusive, we talked in the past in the 6% to 7% range. We'll continue to try to grow that over time. I think as we bring in new brands like Kylie and that becomes a bigger part, a big focus for us as we look at new brands, whether they're larger existing brands or new emerging brands, is to drive as much exclusivity as we can. Our guests respond favorably to that. So whether we're the absolute only place or it's in very limited distribution, that's a focus for our merchant team and one we're having a lot of success on, so we plan to continue to grow that number going forward. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Omar Saad, Evercore ISI. 
Omar Saad: Stepping back at a high level, most of my detailed questions are answered already, but going back at the high level here, you've got such kind of broad-based strength in your business. You seem to be hitting on a lot of cylinders. You've got a lot of great things in the pipeline. You seem to be really managing that balance between online and off-line. Is it -- as you gain more -- I imagine this is giving you a lot more confidence in the business. As you gain more confidence in the business, does it help you think maybe a little bit earlier, looking ahead towards longer-term opportunities such as international as you just get better and better at what you've been doing? Or is it really still there's so much to do here in the North American market and the U.S. particularly, that remains your focus? 
Mary Dillon: Omar, thank you. That's a great question and certainly something that we work on all the time, thinking about both the short-term, literally the next day, the next quarter, and 10 years from now. So I'd say, first and foremost, I think there's a lot of things for us to do to continue to drive growth in our core business model and that's what we're really, really focused on. So we've got a lot of stores to build, a lot of stores to remodel. We're focused on, frankly, what should the experience of the future be like online and in-store. And in some ways, we've gotten started but there's a lot more that we can and will do there because we don't rest on our laurels, no pun intended. But we fully would expect that what guests would expect in the future in terms of a retail experience is just going to continue to change. So I'd say a lot of what we're focused on is continuing to do what we do well today and then think about how to invent the future of our core model with confidence. I mean, I do feel that we feel that if we play our offense, which is really deep understanding about our guests, really treating our associates well with a culture that seems to be working, and positioning Ulta Beauty as a really inclusive beauty retailer and everything that goes with that, we think we're on the right path. So at the same token, we're absolutely thinking about what does the longer-term future look like to continue to drive shareholder returns, and there's many ways to think about that. So that hasn't changed. We're not announcing doing anything differently today, but that's a fair question and one that we work on. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Michael Baker, Deutsche Bank. 
Michael Baker: I guess I'll ask this one. Gross margins, you went through a number of drivers. I don't remember -- forgive me if I missed it. Did you talk about mix towards e-commerce as a potential drag? I don't think you did. In the past, you have. And so is it that that's no longer going to be a drag because the margins there are catching up? Or it's just offset by other things or too small to matter? 
Scott Settersten: Yes -- no, that's built in there. When we're talking about merchandise margin expansion, 2019 specifically, I mean, we're -- nothing's really changed there, the underlying economics of that channel of the business. So again, pressure on the gross margin line. But on the EBIT line, you're right, stores in e-commerce are much -- it's a much closer horse race overall. So again, what we saw in the fourth quarter, right, a little bit more moderate e-commerce growth is good news on the EBIT line, right? So stores still drive a better variable contribution overall. But again, back to the big picture, we have to do both well. We're going to -- we'll take whatever margin characteristics come from either and try to drive the best result we can. 
Michael Baker: Okay. Understood. And since I waited this long, I'll try to slide in a second one, if I could. Just on the competitive environment, a couple -- at least one of your big suppliers and even a competitor talked about slowdowns in the fourth quarter. You clearly didn't see it, so you're taking share. Can you just describe the different channels within the competitive environment, department stores, drugstores, online, et cetera, what are you seeing? 
David Kimbell: Yes, we're -- we feel really positive overall. And obviously, in the fourth quarter, we're very pleased with our results. As we look across the competitive landscape, again, we talked about this in the past, beauty is a very attractive category. We are very respectful of our competitors and they're all doing some really interesting things. So we watch across all of them and they're all, whether it's in the mass segment or prestige or online competitors, are certainly formidable and driving changes. We've -- as we look across the marketplace, there have been some shifts in reported metrics around the category. Fortunately, at Ulta, we feel like our collection of products, the balanced assortment that we have across categories and price points, the guest experience that we deliver was able to kind of navigate our business through any changes in the broader marketplace and frankly, be a leader in that. And that's what we're focused on continuing to do and play offense as we deliver a great experience to our guests going forward. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Daniel Hofkin, William Blair & Company. 
Daniel Hofkin: Just a couple of quick questions, quickly on the gross margin. If we kind of correct for the channel shift, exclude that factor, it kind of seemed like the promotional backdrop was fairly steady and maybe your merchandise margin also was pretty steady, again, correcting for the channel shift. Is that a reasonable interpretation and kind of your view on that in the near term? And then, secondly, if you could just update us on your thoughts on kind of the urban store opportunity over time, it'd be great to hear any thoughts you might have on that. 
Scott Settersten: All right. So as far as margin characteristics, I think that's a fair way to look at it. I mean, we didn't get into much in the details here, I guess, in the Q&A on margin. But I mean, mix always plays a significant role in what the financial outcomes are. So product mix, fragrance and mass color, we pointed out was stronger. We're taking share there. Those are slight rate headwinds for us overall. But again, we'll take that any day of the week, right, with the sales increases that we saw. And then, we just mentioned the channel shifts. So e-com was a little bit more moderate than what we expected. And actually, that's good news in the short term. So we get a little bit of a tailwind on that on the EBIT line. Merchandise margin target. So we pulled back on promotion, right? We talked about that. Again, people get a little bit overly focused on that 20% off coupon, but there was add back. There's the loyalty points. Don't forget, we called that out in our remarks, right, that, that hurt us a little bit more than we were expecting. But again, that's fantastic news, great for long-term investors. People are engaged in our credit card and our loyalty program and they earned more points than we expected, which hurt rate a little bit in the short-term, but all those guests are coming back in the next few months, right, to use those points in our stores or online. So we think that -- again, we think that's a fair trade. 
Mary Dillon: Yes, and I'll just jump in, Dan, on the question on urban stores. It kind of depends on how you define urban, there's a lot of different ways to describe it. So the vast majority of the stores that we have planned to build, I guess, you'd consider sort of non-urban, more in our traditional kind of power centers. But we have plenty of urban stores or city stores that we like and that do well. I'd say, the addition of more -- I wouldn't call them flagship, more high-profile stores, like the Manhattan Upper East Side and Michigan Avenue, has also been great in terms of just expanding awareness and presence of Ulta Beauty as a retailer. But those kind of things have a different cost scenario in terms of how to run them. And so we're just going to continue to be really selective. And there's going to be spots where we like the footprint, we like the parking, we like the -- what's around us, and they'll be few and far between, I think, because really, our model tends to not be super urban and does fine. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Ike Boruchow, Wells Fargo. 
Irwin Boruchow: Just a quick question for Mary or Scott. Just I think, 2, 3 years ago, you guys targeted 10% of sales for your e-com business. You're above that now but it looks like the growth rate is also starting to change. The quick 2 questions is, can you give us an update of where you think that penetration ultimately should go over the next couple of years? And then, more specifically, if you are in a situation where the e-com growth rate is decelerating a bit while the store comps are actually accelerating, Mary, to your point earlier in the call, does that change your view of the ultimate margin of the business, meaning getting more sales out of a higher-margin channel for Ulta versus the e-commerce channel? I guess those are my 2 questions on e-com. 
Mary Dillon: Well, I would say, first of all, the e-commerce, the way we guided for this year is consistent with roughly where we're feeling as we looked at our longer-term plan, that we're off a very big base and that we'll be pushing $1 billion in sales. And so we naturally expected that to moderate. And so I don't -- I think the fourth quarter may have been a bit of an anomaly. We'll see in terms of that dynamic. But again, I think, our job is to just stay smart and flexible with the levers that we have and understand the dynamics that's happening from a consumer behavior perspective. There's no way, shape or form that the importance of e-commerce as a channel is going to diminish, it's only going to grow. And so we need to continue to make sure that we're a great omnichannel retailer as well as a great brick-and-mortar retailer. I think it's kind of the best way to answer it. And then, the... 
Scott Settersten: Yes, I don't really think there's anything, my crystal ball out here on the table, as far as margin characteristics over the long-term. Again, I'm a conservative person by nature. I'd say there's inherent headwind built into that piece of the business, right, regardless of the scale, at least the scale that we're talking about here as a specialty retailer. And so, again, we're working hard every day with tools, with our supply chain, road map, build-out of facilities, to get closer to customers, maintain maximum flexibility as things continue to evolve there and just hoping that we make smart decisions along the way. 
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of the question-and-answer session and I would like to turn the call back to Mary Dillon for closing remarks. 
Mary Dillon: Great. I'd like to wrap up by thanking our 45,000 associates for delivering an excellent 2018 and teeing up 2019 to be another year of strong top and bottom line growth. I think our team is really well positioned to execute on a host of growth and efficiency initiatives to drive the long term success of our business and create significant shareholder value. So I look forward to speaking with all of you again soon. Thank you. 
Operator: This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.

 I'll now turn the call over to Mary. 
Mary Dillon: Thank you, Laurel, and good afternoon, everyone. 
 Ulta Beauty's strong performance in the third quarter reflects continued market share gains across all major categories, acceleration in our overall comp, driven by healthy traffic, excellent new store productivity and robust e-commerce growth. 
 To summarize the headlines. Total sales increased 16.2%. We delivered 7.8% comp sales growth on top of 10.3% comps in the third quarter of 2017. Diluted earnings per share of $2.18 grew 28%. 
 We just shared a lot of news at our Analyst Day last month, and today, I'll reiterate some of the information we discussed about each of our strategic imperatives, which position us to deliver industry-leading financial results. 
 I'll begin with our effort to drive loyalty and to take our brand to the next level. We grew our Ultamate Rewards loyalty program to 30.6 million active members at the end of the third quarter, a 15.3% year-over-year increase. Loyalty member sales now represent more than 95% of our total revenues. We continue to benefit from the high engagement of our platinum- and diamond-level guests, garnering more than 40% share of wallet from these 2 tiers combined. These guests are over 3x more likely than our average guests to be omnichannel shoppers and take advantage of our services offering. They also have extremely high retention levels at more than 96%. 
 Going forward, we expect to increase our focus in driving higher sales per member, and personalization is the next major tool for growing share of wallet. Our vision is to make every guest touch point personalized and relevant, building tools and capabilities to develop a closer connection to our guests so they feel even deeper loyalty to the Ulta Beauty brand. We're just in the early innings of personalization, and we're building expertise, both internally and through acquisitions to bolster our capabilities in this area. More on this topic in a bit. 
 We also continue to grow our credit card portfolio and see a sustained lift in sales for our guests who hold the Ulta Beauty credit card. Sales of gift cards grew 35% in the quarter, driven by expanding distribution in other retailers this year, as well as strong growth in our own stores. We continue to grow awareness of the Ulta Beauty brand, now reaching all-time highs at 55% for unaided and 92% for aided awareness for the quarter. These milestones are supported by significant improvement on important brand attributes such as being considered exciting, fun, inspiring, experts in beauty and on trend. 
 Last quarter, we discussed the launch of our new brand's purpose, "The Possibilities are Beautiful." This is a new articulation of our brand platform, celebrating the emotional and inclusive power of possibilities at Ulta Beauty. We believe we've moved past the point of driving awareness of the concept of Ulta Beauty, All Things Beauty, All in One Place, to one of being able to create a true emotional connection with our current and prospective guests. This is how great brands create loyalty and drive growth over the long haul. 
 To support the launch, we commissioned a consumer study to understand beauty standards and perceptions of beauty today in order to facilitate this important discussion. We brought this to life with the partnership with NBC Universal's platforms, including NBC, E! and Telemundo, which garnered millions of impressions and engagement with our brand. 
 As part of our efforts to connect more closely with the key consumer segments of millennials, Latinas, Gen Z and African Americans, we've launched specific efforts to drive awareness with each group. For example, we're partnering with Essence and Girls United to increase academic potential, confidence and leadership of young women aged 12 to 17, and leveraging partnerships with influencers and media partners that are most relevant to these consumer groups. 
 In addition to our new brand equity campaign that launched a few months ago, we began running new holiday commercials with the theme, Shine Brighter, in early November, focused on the Ulta Beauty as the destination for both glamming and gifting. 
 Let me turn now to an update on our merchandise assortment, focused on innovation, differentiation, exclusivity, relevancy and speed to market. During the third quarter, we benefited from double-digit comp growth in mass cosmetics, prestige skincare, fragrance, prestige boutique brands and sun care. Prestige cosmetics showed modest improvement in comp sales performance compared to the prior quarter, suggesting encouraging stabilization of our largest category. 
 We positioned Ulta Beauty as the partner of choice for brands across the beauty spectrum, from classic brands to established indie brands to new and emerging brands, but we believe there's significant opportunity to grow with each of these groups in multiple expressions and formats. In fact, we've recently launched an emerging brands team focused on identifying new and [ offering ] digitally native brands. This team has developed customized processes to onboard and incubate smaller or emergent brands with partnerships with all areas of our business in order to ensure successful launches of these brands which are often not accustomed to a retail environment. 
 We're excited to be participating in the rapid rise of influencers' celebrity-driven brands. Kylie Cosmetics is off to a strong start, with 28 SKUs launched in-store on November 17 and a more curated assortment online. We also announced the introduction of 4 Kim Kardashian-West fragrances for holidays, which launched in-store only. Both brands have been very supportive of these launches with the series of social media posts by Kylie and Kim, who each have 120 million Instagram followers. Kylie also made a personal appearance at one of our Houston stores the weekend of the launch. 
 Other examples of influencer-led brands are the launch of the Beauty Bakerie, Juvia's Place and the expansion of Morphe. Morphe is now in 10 feet with an elevated presentation at all stores, and we launched an exclusive collaboration on November 16 with James Charles, an influencer with over 10 million Instagram followers. 
 Our holiday plans have been well executed by the teams with many exclusive products and kits, elevated gift with purchase offerings for fragrance and a strong Black Friday, Cyber Monday offer as well as our early December Beauty Blitz program. Combined with the new holiday television and radio creative and in-store marketing, we're confident that we have implemented a comprehensive merchandising and marketing plan to position Ulta Beauty as a compelling destination for holiday shopping. 
 Now touching on our services business. Salon sales grew 10.7% and comped 3.5%, driven by average ticket increases and benefiting from increased traffic in our stores. 
 To update you on the rollout of our service optimization program. Our new services model is now in over 30% of the chain. We continue to see encouraging results and will continue to roll it out to additional markets in early 2019. This program was built to attract and retain top stylists who provide exceptional services. The components of services optimization are: compensation designed to retain top talent; industry-leading internal training and education; simplified menus; transparent pricing; as well as dedicated field teams focused on business and technical training to support our 8,000 stylists. 
 We continue to roll out the Skin Bar at Ulta Beauty, and now has this format at 174 stores. We plan to have 188 stores with the Skin Bar by year-end, and 50 of them will be multi-branded, offering services with brand partners Dermalogica, Murad, Kate Somerville and Kiehl's. Early results are promising for increased product sales as well as guest satisfaction. 
 We're now testing a new salon appointment-booking tool, in partnership with technology startup, Spruce. We developed an enhanced tool for booking appointments for all services, including hair, skin, brows and makeup. The booking tool is faster and easier to use and elevates guests' engagement. We expect to roll the booking tool out through 2019, with further enhancements to the platform teed up for next year. 
 And now let me turn to real estate. We opened 42 stores in the third quarter compared to 48 last year, and closed 3, ending the quarter with 1,163 stores. 
 New stores continued to deliver sales ahead of expectations, and we recently updated our new store model to reflect the strength of the new store portfolio, with year 1 stores achieving sales of $3.5 million on average and ramping to $5 million by the fifth year of operation. 
 With increased confidence in the next several years of store growth, we've narrowed our U.S. store target range of 1,500 to 1,700 and will slightly moderate new store openings in the next few years, with plans to open 80 stores in 2019, 75 stores in 2020 and 70 stores in 2021. This moderation is planned in tandem with the greater focus on portfolio repositioning as a large number of store leases is coming up for renewal in the next several years. 
 Moving on to our e-commerce sales and our recent efforts to create an innovation ecosystem. Ulta.com sales grew 42.5% and represented nearly 11% of total company revenue. E-commerce contributed 340 basis points to the total company comp, driven by transaction growth. Total traffic growth rose close to 36%, with mobile traffic up 44%. We continue to see strong demand for our store-to-door or save-the-sale program, and we're now testing buy online, pick up in-store in 47 locations. 
 Now I'd like to recap some of the important announcements we made at our Analyst Day in November. We described how we're building an innovation ecosystem with a series of partnerships and acquisitions. We recently invested in a multiyear strategic partnership with Iterate, a technology solutions company and workflow platform. Iterate helps large companies harness the best digital innovations and allows us to tap into technology talents in Silicon Valley and Colorado as well as share knowledge across industries. Iterate tracks trends, provides research and curates technology partnership opportunities. And for Ulta Beauty, it enables rapid prototyping and gives us access to startups that would be most suited to our needs. 
 In addition to this important partnership, we're also accelerating innovation by building internal capabilities. For the first time in the company's history, we made acquisitions of 2 small tech startups, GlamST and QM Scientific, to support our digital experience roadmap and develop an innovation pipeline. We welcome these entrepreneur founders and their teams to the Ulta Beauty family. We're excited to work together with these teams to unlock personalization in a differentiated way. 
 GlamST has been our partner for the past few years behind the development of GLAM LAB, our virtual try and experience in our mobile app. Bringing these capabilities in-house will allow us to move faster in developing our augmented reality offerings. They combine AR, AI and machine learning capabilities and focus on virtual makeover solutions, image processing, graphics and effects. 
 QM Scientific is an artificial intelligence startup, recognized as a disruptor in the retail space. Their capabilities include artificial intelligence, recommendations, computer vision, natural language processing and visual search. 
 Both GlamST and QM Scientific bring technology leadership, guest experience focus, capabilities and the right cultural fit with Ulta Beauty. Connecting these strategic relationships and partnerships start to frame up our approach to digital innovation, an ecosystem where we rely on capable technology partners, work closely with Iterate as an innovation workflow partner, and as an extension of our Ulta Beauty team as well as invest in assets and bring in-house technologies and talents that are core to our future. We view this structure as an efficient way to accelerate our digital innovation capabilities on our path to deliver world-class digital experiences, including much greater personalization. 
 And now turning to an update on our supply chain operations. Strong in-stock levels, coupled with good control of inventory per door growth were the highlights of our supply chain team's performance in the quarter. Our newest distribution center in Fresno is ramping quickly, now serving 173 stores and 21% of e-commerce orders. In concert with the continued ramp of our 3 newer buildings, we are reducing activity in our Phoenix DC in preparation for its closure next year. 
 We see a significant opportunity to improve working capital in the years ahead. As part of the efficiencies for growth cost optimization program, we're launching an SKU-rationalization project. We're also benefiting from better inventory visibility and markdown tools. Over time, we'll get the entire supply chain network on a common operating model as well as continue to drive end-to-end process improvements. As a result, we expect to see modest inventory turn improvement each year over the next several years, with the goal of 50 basis points of improvement over the next 5 years. 
 So with that, I will turn it over to Scott to discuss in more detail the drivers of our third quarter financials and outlook for the fourth quarter and the full year. 
Scott Settersten: Thanks, Mary. Good afternoon, everyone. I will begin with the income statement. 
 Top line growth of 16.2% was driven by a 7.8% comp in strong new store productivity. The revenue recognition accounting standard adopted at the beginning of the year added $10.5 million of sales from the combined impact of income from our credit card program, gift card breakage as well as e-commerce revenue now being recognized upon shipment, offset by the value of points earnings in our loyalty program. 
 As a reminder, our retail comparable sales growth is not impacted by the revenue recognition accounting change. 
 Traffic strengthened compared to the prior quarter, with transactions driving the majority of the comp. Total company transactions increased 5.3%, and ticket increased 2.5%. The retail-only comp of 4.4% was balanced between traffic and ticket. Ticket growth was driven by increases in average selling price, with units per transaction flat. Including the salon comp of 3.5%, the combined retail and salon comp was 4.4%. 
 Turning to gross profit. Margin was flat year-over-year. The new revenue recognition accounting standard added about 50 basis points to the gross profit line, so the underlying 50 basis points of deleverage were a bit more than we were forecasting going into the quarter. Some of the factors driving this deleverage were the same dynamics we've been experiencing all year, including the mix of e-commerce sales, the mix of lower-margin prestige brands, investments in our salon business and supply chain deleverage, driven by the Fresno distribution center opening as well as higher freight costs, which weighed on the P&L by about 10 to 15 basis points as we called out at our Analyst Day. 
 Overall, promotions were fairly flat year-over-year, with lower circulation of some of our print catalogs and newspaper inserts and 3 weeks of our postcard 20% offer this year compared to 4 weeks of the same offer last year, offset by increased digital marketing. The primary driver of the delta between the original plan and our actual results was the clearance of that, that began at the end of the second quarter and continued into the first several weeks of the third quarter. It took us longer than expected and we took deeper markdowns than expected to sell through the discontinued inventory to clean up our backrooms to get our stores ready for all the great new launches ahead of holiday. 
 While the clearance event did pressure margin rate more than planned, we're happy with the end result and are in great shape for Q4. The margin rate headwinds that I described were partially offset by planned leverage of rent and occupancy expenses. 
 Moving on to SG&A. We deleveraged by 140 basis points, including 70 basis points of impact from the revenue recognition accounting standard. The remaining 70 basis points are due to deleverage of store payroll primarily related to the prestige brand expansion as well as deleverage of marketing expense. This was due to timing of advertising spend for our new campaign, and we anticipate marketing expense to be flat as a percentage of sales for the full year. These pressures were partly offset by slight leverage in corporate overhead. 
 Operating margin was 10.8% of sales and was down 130 basis points from last year's Q3 operating margin of 12.1%, with 20 basis points attributable to the revenue recognition accounting change. Diluted EPS grew 28% to $2.18, with about $0.02 of earnings due to a lower-than-expected tax rate related to equity compensation. 
 Turning now to the balance sheet and cash flow. Total inventory grew 10% and was flat on a per-store basis, well below comparable sales growth, as we continue to benefit from improved inventory systems and processes as well as the clearance event that began at the end of the second quarter and ran through the first few weeks early in the third quarter. 
 Capital expenditures were $115 million for the quarter, driven by new stores, investments in systems, prestige brand rollouts, merchandise fixtures and supply chain investments. We ended the third quarter with $296.9 million in cash. We repurchased 451,000 shares through our 10b5-1 program at a cost of $119 million during the third quarter. $283 million remained available on the $625 million authorization as of quarter end. 
 Turning now to guidance for the quarter and full year. For the fourth quarter, we expect sales to be in the range of $2.085 billion to $2.103 billion versus $1.938 billion last year. Recall that last year's fourth quarter included an extra week worth $108.8 million and about $0.14 of earnings. 
 We expect comparable sales to increase in the range of 7% to 8% versus 8.8% last year. Our comparable sales will compare weeks 40 through 52 this year with the same period last year. So the 53rd week drops out. 
 E-commerce sales are expected to grow in the mid-30s percentage range compared to 60.4% last year or 50.4% on a comparable 13-week basis. 
 We plan to open approximately 11 new stores in the fourth quarter compared to 16 in Q4 last year and remain on track to open 100 net new stores this year. Q4 preopening expense is expected to be slightly lower as a rate of sales compared to last year. 
 Diluted earnings per share are expected to be in the range of a $3.50 to $3.55 versus $3.40 last year on a GAAP basis or $2.75 adjusted for a lower tax rate, the impact from the revaluation of deferred taxes and related onetime bonuses last year. 
 Operating margin is planned to deleverage, including the roughly 20 basis points related to the revenue recognition accounting standard, consistent with the impact we've seen so far this year. 
 The tax rate for Q4 is expected to be 24%. This does not include any assumptions for the tax rate impact of share-based compensation accounting which is difficult to forecast. 
 Our fully diluted share count is estimated at 60.3 million.
 For the full year, we are maintaining our outlook for comparable sales and earnings per share which we updated at our Analyst Day a month ago. We plan to open 100 new stores, all approximately 10,000 square feet. We'll complete 15 remodel and relocation projects. We expect to grow e-commerce approximately 40%. We anticipate top line growth in the low teens, including the impact of the 53rd week last year. Total company comps are expected to be in the 7% to 8% range. We expect to grow diluted earnings per share in the low 20s percentage range, including the extra week in 2017. 
 We anticipate capital expenditures of approximately $375 million. Depreciation is forecasted at approximately $290 million. We expect to repurchase shares in the $500 million range for the year, and the annual tax rate for the remainder of the year is expected to be 24%. 
 As you know, we provided a long-term outlook at our Analyst Day last month, targeting mid-to high-teens earnings per share growth, 5% to 7% comparable sales for the next 3 years, and modest margin improvement each year. We plan to provide specific annual guidance for 2019 on our Q4 call in March as we normally do. 
 And with that, I'll turn it over to our conference call host for Q&A. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question here is from Ike Boruchow from Wells Fargo. 
Lauren Frasch: This is Lauren on for Ike. Scott, could you maybe provide a bit more color around Q3 gross margins? Maybe help us understand the dynamics between fixed cost and merchandise margin and how the clearance event played into that? Also anything that may have surprised you in the quarter and how that helps you think about Q4 gross margins as well. 
Scott Settersten: Yes, thanks for the question. I know this is a little complicated, so let's give you a couple of points of reference. So versus last year, what you guys may have been expecting or looking for in your models -- so benefits versus last year included lapping the hurricanes. Of course, we had to promote a lot last year to capture lost sales, right? We said I think it was about 100 basis points of comp of impact last year. And then stronger rent and occupancy leverage versus last year. So we're lapping over a number of what we'd call higher-cost stores, Manhattan and Michigan Avenue and a number of others that we installed last year. Those benefits were offset by salon optimization investments that we've been talking about all year. The Fresno DC, again, new in the second quarter. That's caused a bit of deleverage year-over-year. And then the mix things we've been talking about in the business, the prestige brand mix and then the e-commerce mix, all right? So that's versus last year. Versus our expectations, we called out transportation being 10 to 15 basis points at Analyst Day, so there's been some upward pressure there all year for us. On the sales mix side, Mary called out fragrance and mass doing really well in the third quarter. So again, fantastic market share gains, but those 2 categories do have slightly lower margins overall than the house. And then it was primarily we called out the clearance event. It was really the bigger surprise for us versus our plans. So like I said, we had to go longer and deeper to move those items out of the store. But it was the right thing for us to do, and we feel really good where we are prepared for holiday. 
Operator: Our next question is from Simeon Gutman from Morgan Stanley. 
Simeon Gutman: So one question and just a couple of parts. Scott, can you quantify to us how much more did to the extra clearance or the extending of the clearance hurt your gross margin? And I guess I would have presumed that by the time you gave your second quarter call, you had some idea of this at the time. And then I just want to reconcile this, Sephora called out a more promotional environment. You didn't really -- you didn't say that. I mean, it was all -- sounds like this clearance event. But just if you can talk about the posture of the industry and if it feels more competitive. 
Scott Settersten: Yes, so maybe I can start with the promotional environment. So again, we feel like it's relatively stable year-over-year as we look at things. So again, it seems like overall, there's a bit more buzz about things. And the competitive environment, this is a tough space. It always has been, and we expect it to continue to be. So as we're looking ahead now, specifically to the fourth quarter, we feel like we're in a pretty stable place overall. As far as the clearance event goes, not quantify it for you, but directionally, I would tell you it's primarily -- it's the biggest driver by far of the surprise versus where we thought we were headed for the third quarter. So we talk a lot about the boutique strategy and the remodeling efforts that have been underway here over the last 18 months really in an accelerated pace. So when we're updating those stores, one of the biggest changes is our fragrance fixtures. And we've really pared back the assortment there as we upgrade the fixturing and the presentation in the store. And it was -- there was a lot of excess fragrance that had built up in the system overall. And while we've been trying to, I'd say at the margins, kind of sell our way through that in clearance sections in our stores, it just got to the point where we thought we needed to be more aggressive and that's what we did. So we wanted -- it was playing its way through, and then in the third quarter, we just needed to put our foot on the accelerator to get it out of the stores. So again, overall, it was a little more expensive than we were hoping, but was the right tactic for the business. 
Operator: Our next question is from Joe Altobello from Raymond James. 
Joseph Altobello: So I guess my first question is on the comp guide for the fourth quarter, up 7% to 8%. It sounds like it's kind of consistent to what you saw in the third quarter. I'm curious, your base period gets easier by about 150 basis points. You've got the introduction of Kylie this quarter. So why would we see a comp acceleration sequentially quarter-over-quarter? 
Mary Dillon: Yes. I mean -- Joe, it's Mary. I would say that we guided the best we can with the information that we have. I feel really good about what we have in place for holiday, whether it's like -- you mentioned the brand launches off to a strong start, our holiday marketing, our exclusives, our gift with purchase, they're all -- we're lined up really well, I'd say, to be competitive and have a strong quarter, but really, this is just our best estimate at this point. 
Scott Settersten: And I would just add, not to forget, fourth quarter is a different animal for us, right? This is a place where we compete with all the retail, not just the beauty competitors. So we go into the quarter, we think in a -- with prudent guidance, right, recognizing and feeling good about where our plan is, but just making sure that we don't get too far ahead of ourselves. 
Operator: Our next question is from Anthony Chukumba from Loop Capital Markets. 
Anthony Chukumba: We talked a little bit about the fact that your unaided awareness and your aided awareness still continue to increase. Do you have any sense for what's been driving that? I mean, is that just increasing your store presence and some of the shifts that you've made in terms of your marketing? Is it the loyalty program? I'm just -- I guess I'm just wondering what you think is driving that and where do you expect those numbers to trend going forward? 
Mary Dillon: Sure, Anthony. And I won't say this is Mary because I bet you could guess this is Mary. But anyways, I'm going to start. I'll let -- ask Dave to add more color. I'll tell you, this is something that we've been at now for multiple years, right, just the opportunity to put the brand of Ulta Beauty on the map literally and figuratively. And that's driven by a whole lot of factors, and we've been measuring it. It's not even just about, do people know us, but is there a meaningful understanding of what we are about. And I do believe that this next level of creative that we've launched is going to deepen not just to people who know about Ulta Beauty, but do they understand what we stand for? But maybe you can add some color in terms of the tactics. 
David Kimbell: Yes, absolutely. We have, Anthony, dramatically adjusted our marketing approach, really revamped it in a significant way to make it more current and relevant and motivating to our consumers, and that's driven a much greater connection. Really, as we've done that over the last 3 years or so, we've seen this dramatic increase in awareness. So marketing, for sure, but you mentioned some of the other things. Certainly, we've been opening new stores, and that's been helpful as we've entered into some new markets. Our loyalty program, as we combine that to one program about 4 years ago, that gave us the opportunity market that and make that a deeper connection. And that helped us drive greater connection with our guests, but more word-of-mouth. Our assortment has improved dramatically over the last several years. So those things have come together. And you asked about what comes -- where we think it's going from here, we're really pleased with the growth we've had in awareness. It's just been a critical -- it was a critical opportunity, but we see more to come. We're one of the leading unaided awareness retailers, #2 in the market right now. We think we're on path to become the #1 unaided retailer in beauty. The campaign that Mary described in her comments is the next step of that to make a more purposeful effort to connect with our guests in a more meaningful way. And so far, we're off to a good start with that. 
Operator: Our next question is from Rupesh Parikh from Oppenheimer & Co. 
Rupesh Parikh: So on the Kylie cosmetics launch, it sounds the launch so far is off to a strong start. So was just curious how it's trending versus your expectations and if there's any surprises in terms of the customers bringing into your stores? 
David Kimbell: Yes, great question. Yes, we'd say, first, it's early. It's been less than a month, just a couple of weeks, but we're really pleased with results. Certainly, it's generated a lot of excitement. It is -- our existing guests have responded very favorably to it. It also -- it's done a nice job driving in some new guests, in particular, younger and diverse consumers. So we're really pleased with the effort overall. Kylie and the Kylie Cosmetics team has done a really nice job helping communicate this launch, get their fans excited about it. So overall, we're pleased with it. I think as far as the assortment, we're seeing strength across the line. It's a relatively narrow assortment, but we've been really happy with the performance. We just launched an exclusive holiday kit, and that's been received very well. And that's available only at Ulta, not on kyliecosmetics.com. Our teams are working really hard to keep the stores replenished. We have anticipated through Q4 kind of being tighter around inventory through the quarter. So it's possible as we move into holidays that we'll sell out in some cases, but we're working hard to continue to replenish and evolve the assortment going forward. So overall pleased, but a long road ahead of us as well. 
Operator: Our next questions from Oliver Chen from Cowen and Company. 
Oliver Chen: The QM Scientific deal is great and awesome. We're curious about the AI-powered customer engagement in terms of how you see that manifesting across different opportunities within the ecosystem. And also, in the context of AI, how do you juxtapose that with the beauty enthusiast who often likes new products versus driving an optimized, personalized recommendation system? And would love your thoughts -- and the QM Scientific team has a lot of experience with robotics, and we're seeing a lot more retail robotics as well as conversational commerce. How do you see that manifesting in what you're building over time? 
David Kimbell: Yes, Oliver. Great question. We, too, we share your excitement about having QM join Ulta Beauty. We're just really optimistic about what that team has already brought and will be bringing us going forward. You hit some of the highlights, but I'd say, of the things that we're looking forward to drive with them. But I'd say overall, as Mary mentioned in her comments, this is first and foremost about personalization, leveraging their capabilities to understand our guest in a better way and manage our connection to them. The first phase with them is really getting them engaged and onboard, which they are. We've been doing that over the last month or so and getting them fully up to speed and connected to our business. As we look forward over 2019, I'd say it's a mix of some foundational elements that they're bringing, and say, helped us assess our capabilities. We'll be looking across kind of our personalization platform, our data foundation and make sure that, that's as strong as it can be. I shared some of that at the Analyst Day, and they're going to play a key role in strengthening our foundational capabilities. The first areas that we we're going to be tackling, things that we've already been doing, but we'll see -- we think we can move faster and in a bigger way around elements like recommendations, as you've mentioned, dynamic content, personalized homepage. Computer vision is a capability that they have that we see that integrating in as we get further in with them over the next several months. That allow us to have product and image recognition. They will also connect to our GlamST acquisition to integrate virtual try-on data with our personalization platform. So those are the big areas that we're focused on, and we see -- we're really -- we're off to a great start with them. The team is really strong, and we're really pleased to have them on board. 
Oliver Chen: Okay, just a follow-up. With the store of the future, what do you really envision in terms of making sure that you link a lot of the innovation you're conducting digitally and with AI into the shopping -- the physical experiential shopping experience? And as you use this incubation innovation lab to look at ideas, how should we think about how Ulta thinks about M&A versus organic innovation? 
Mary Dillon: Well, these are deep questions. I'll start, and just say a couple of things. Well, the store of the future, we talked a bit at the Analyst Day. It's early. And our thinking, we're not going to share a lot of the direction. I'd say, high level the notion of the ability to be very experiential and lead our guest where they are is going to be critical, we think, and important in the beauty category. We think Ulta Beauty will be able to do that, serve that need really well. But to your point -- and underpinning technology through everything we do. So these investments in these companies, we see as ways to drive a personalized experience across all touch points, and that would be an underpinning. I think, in the future, we would imagine not surprisingly, that there's less and less friction in the transaction happening in-store, right, more time -- less time tasking and checking out, and a lot more time spent consulting and just having fun with beauty. So we see them all as working together. And frankly, the place that we can play the best is to bring together ease and convenience with discovery and a true human experience that's both physical and emotional. And that -- and just kind of in a big picture ways how we think about our, not just store but experience in the future. 
Operator: Our next question is from Simeon Siegel from Nomura Instinet. 
Simeon Siegel: Mary, sorry to belabor the clearance conversation, but just can you speak to why you think it happened? Just, was it internal buying, planning? Or was it more a function of the external environment? Just basically can you speak to your comfort around this not being a go-forward necessity? And then Scott, sorry if I missed it, what are the gross margins embedded in the Q4 guide that you guys gave? 
Mary Dillon: So yes, on the third, I would say, just a combination of factors, but more about the fair number of remodels and expansions of brands that happened in the quarter and a lot of new brands coming in that just -- we make a call. Clearance is not something that's -- it's not like we never do this. This happens periodically. So in this instance, it was bigger, it was an opportunity, we thought, to really clear out inventory and get us set up for the holiday. It's not something that we expect to repeat at that scale in the fourth quarter for sure. But it's just one of those business calls that we made that we think were right for the business at the time. 
Scott Settersten: Yes. And as far as margin for the fourth quarter, just a little bit of color on some of the levers there. So Fresno, less of a headwind in the fourth quarter as that building continues to scale up and, of course, higher volumes, overall. Rent and occupancy will -- lever will be stronger in the fourth quarter than it was in the third. Again, we had 42 new stores in the third quarter. We got half -- a dozen, I think, in the fourth quarter. So that will be better overall. We'll be lapping those stores again from last year that were in 2017, those higher-cost stores. So we'll see some nice benefits there. I mentioned earlier the promotional environment overall, we think, is pretty stable right now. So again, it's a competitive environment. Make no mistake about that, and holiday is more so than the rest of the year. So we're prepared for that, but that's baked into the plan. When you get down to the SG&A line, labor, so we'll see -- get leverage there, unlike earlier in the year. Again, you got higher volumes there that help with some of that. The mix assumptions are all baked in there now. Freight, we mentioned earlier today, that's in there. Although I will say there's been some upward surprises there as we've kind of marched through the course of the year. But again, that's not a major driver overall. So feel good about where we are and the plan we have in place for the rest of the year. 
Simeon Siegel: Great. And then just high level for a second. So congrats on the awareness, obviously, keeps getting better. Did you -- would you expect to accelerate the store productivity curve as that happens? I mean, I guess, as you open up new stores, should that ramp happen quicker? 
Scott Settersten: Yes, I mean we're keeping an eye on that. I mean, we did update our store model here at Analyst Day just a few weeks ago. So we are seeing stronger productivity there. And it's a mix of things, and Dave alluded to it earlier. Assortment's part of it, awareness is part of it, better guest experience in the store, the payroll investment we're making are a part of it. So again, it's kind of hard to break it down individual basis. 
Operator: Our next question is from Steph Wissink from Jefferies. 
Stephanie Schiller Wissink: I just have a follow-up question on your prior comment, Scott, on labor leverage. I'm wondering if you can break the deleverage you saw in Q3 in store payroll into the boutique and skin bar investments relative to wage rate pressure overall? It sounds like you're levering the fourth quarter. Does that imply that those boutiques and those skin bars hit a level of sales volume that allows you to lever there as well? 
Scott Settersten: Yes, I think big picture, that's the answer. I mean, as we install these fixtures throughout the course of the year, right, we're kind of building to a crescendo here. And so you get maximum benefit from that in the fourth quarter when you got much larger sales volumes overall. So again, I would just remind people when we're talking about payroll deleverage, it is largely around investments that we're making for the guest experience, which a lot revolves around these boutique brands that we're installing in our stores. So all good for the long term, exactly the thing -- the way we think we should be playing it. 
Operator: Our next question is from Christopher Horvers from JPMorgan. 
Christopher Horvers: Correct me if I'm wrong, but did you say e-commerce would grow in the mid-30s in the fourth quarter? So that would be about 100 basis points less on comp contribution. So you're expecting to -- the store to accelerate in the fourth quarter? And can you talk about your thoughts around that and how you think of the drivers of that are? 
Scott Settersten: Yes, I guess we're trying to avoid a detailed breakdowns of the comp by business unit here. But yes, we did. So I can confirm, we did say mid-30s for e-commerce in the third quarter. So again, it's just natural to kind of assume some moderation in that, again, when you do the adjustment for the 53rd week last year as part of the math as well. So again, we're off, we feel good about the plan overall. We think the guidance is strong. We feel like the business is well positioned. And so we just want to be a little bit prudent with what we're forecasting for the public at this point in time because there's a long way to go between now and Christmas, right? It's the longest period, right? Start to finish, I think, 31 days between Thanksgiving and Christmas. So we're just playing it wisely, we believe. 
Christopher Horvers: Understood, understood. And then just 2 clean-up questions on the gross margin front, questions that we've been getting. So earlier this week, there was a coupon, some people thought it was an extra coupon. Just wanted to get your thoughts on that. And then in terms of 4Q, the clearance, which sounded like it lasted a few weeks into the fourth quarter, what sort of headwind are you expecting in 4Q gross margin around the clearance? 
Scott Settersten: Well, let me start there first to be clear. So that clearance event is behind us now. So that was, Mary mentioned as well, we would call pretty extraordinary. So I think it was some catch up for us, right, to get through that. And we accelerated it in the third quarter so that we could clear out the backroom so we didn't have to struggle with it in the fourth quarter. So that's kind of off the table. Again, there's always a bit of clearance floating through the margin line, right, but not to the extent of what we just saw over the last 2 quarters. And then as far as the coupon is concerned, again, I tried to do this earlier in the year to tell people not to try so hard trying to track individual coupons that hit their e-mail box, right, because there's a lot of factors that influence how many times do we ping you, what you do with your open rates and redemption rates and all those kinds of things. So again, I would just reassure investors that we're pragmatic in our approach. We're doing the best that we can to deliver the best overall result for the quarter, and that includes promotion levels. 
Operator: Our next question is from Dana Telsey from Telsey Advisory Group. 
Dana Telsey: As you think about this fourth quarter, and obviously, a lot of the discussions points on gross margin coming up, what about inventory levels as you're heading into the season? Flat per store? How do you see yourself positioned for the holiday with flat per store inventory levels? 
Scott Settersten: Well, we feel great about our inventory position. So again, we alluded to, Mary did in her comments about the tools and process improvements and things that we're doing. Part of that is just improved capabilities in our distribution centers, part of it is behind the scenes investments in tools for our merchants and support teams here at the home office to help us just manage inventories better overall. So taking out excess weeks of supply in our supply chain network and reinvesting a lot of that into our best-selling [ schnooze, ] the As and Bs and making sure we're always in-stock on the things that our guests are looking to us for. So again, overall, managing it. And we're guiding to, again, our long-term guidance, 50 basis points of inventory productivity improvement here over the next 5 years. So this is -- we've been promising and talking about this for a long time now, I know. But now, you're starting to see the fruits of our labor manifest themselves, and we're really happy about where we are and what we have in front of us. 
Operator: Our next question is from Mark Altschwager from Robert W. Baird. 
Mark Altschwager: It's encouraging to hear that prestige cosmetics saw some sequential improvement, and obviously, you have Kylie coming in Q4. But bigger picture, can you talk about your outlook for category growth. In the past years, we've seen the acceleration in skincare but a deceleration in cosmetics. Just based on the trends in the innovation pipeline you see, do you think we're beginning to see an inflection back in favor of the cosmetic category? 
Mary Dillon: Yes. So this is a crystal ball moment, right? And Dave and I can tag team with [indiscernible]. What I would say in the prestige, we're encouraged as well that, that's an encouraging sign about stabilization of that side of the -- that part of the business. It's big. It's very important to us. But it really is sort of like a tale of different brands. There are some brands that had huge 2015 and '16s that are still struggling a bit with kind of matching that kind of growth and others that are seeing stellar growth. So in total, that sort of mutes, I guess, a little bit, but it's still a healthy segment. Use of cosmetics and innovation in all aspects of color is continuing to be huge out there, and of course, there's the channels that aren't -- the brands that aren't measured in our traditional channel. So there's a lot of growth and innovation for us to participate in that we feel good in. I feel good about what's happening with the other segments of the business with prestige skin, as you said, mass cosmetics, fragrance, all with double-digit comps for us. So anything you'd add to that, that I missed on that, Dave, [indiscernible]? 
David Kimbell: Just to reiterate. Yes, we really are optimistic about makeup. There certainly is a strengthening in skincare, but we feel that our consumers remain very engaged in makeup. All the demographic trends continue to be very positive. One of the -- that's one of the reasons, though, we've been focused on digitally native brands and expanding that part of our portfolio. So certainly, a brand like Kylie, but also Morphe and ColourPop, Juvia's Place, so a number of brands that we think will play a role. At the same time, continuing to drive growth on some of our big, established brands like Tarte and Benefit and Anastasia and L'Oreal and Maybelline on the mass side. So well-rounded, and we're positive about where -- the future of makeup. 
Mark Altschwager: And just a quick follow-up, it looks like the transaction component to the equation did reaccelerate this quarter even if it gets a tougher compare. Were there any callouts there, drivers on the marketing side this quarter, and learnings you can leverage for the holiday quarter? 
David Kimbell: I'd say, from a marketing, we were -- we felt really good about our marketing approach. Yes, we had some activity throughout the quarter as we made adjustments to make sure we were driving traffic and transactions. And so the mix, we felt, was -- ended up in a solid place. But certainly, as we continue to look forward in the fourth quarter and into 2019, driving traffic is obviously critical. And our new advertising campaign, we think, is front and center of doing that. And all the other changes that we're making, we think, will continue to drive strong growth across all aspects of the business. 
Operator: Our next mission from Erinn Murphy from Piper Jaffray. 
Erinn Murphy: I was hoping you guys could talk a little bit more about the mass category and the performance during the quarter. And then how are you thinking about that as you go into '19. I know you're lapping your major reset this year. And then, I guess, Mary, if you think about the emerging brands team and just the opportunities that they can kind of now look through, is there more coming down the pipeline in mass or prestige? 
Mary Dillon: Go ahead, Dave. 
David Kimbell: Yes. So on the mass side, we're very pleased with the results this year, and we're really optimistic about the future. We'll share more as we get into it, but we're going to continue to expand and grow brands that have been doing well for us. So there's still opportunity to make them bigger parts of our portfolio. There's some core foundational brands, including Ulta Beauty Collection, but also L'Oreal and Maybelline and some of the bigger established brands that have been doing well, and we see -- we're positive and optimistic about the future there because of the innovation pipeline that's ahead of us. We'll continue to find emerging brands. I mean Juvia's Place is a recent example of a brand we launched early but off to good start, and that's in our mass cosmetics space. So as much success as we had this year, we have a large share opportunity. It's huge category, and we feel like we've got a lot of runway ahead of us to continue to try to drive growth in that space. 
Mary Dillon: Yes. And I would just add, Erinn. I think that with the emerging brands, it's really across the board that we'll see innovation, right? So across categories and price points, not just mass. 
Erinn Murphy: Okay. And then just the ticket growth was the lightest we've seen year to date. I'm just curious, is that just tied to the clearance event being extended? Or was there any other puts and takes for the ticket which came in a little bit lighter than we thought? 
Scott Settersten: Actually, that's probably the primary driver there. So again, the clearance event wasn't much of a sales help overall for the quarter. So yes, that would be something that I would attribute a good piece of that, too, as well. 
Operator: Our next question is from Michael Goldsmith from UBS. 
Michael Goldsmith: It looks like your e-commerce and your mobile traffic decelerated sequentially, but your e-commerce sales accelerated. So are you seeing an improvement in conversion online, and what would be driving that? 
David Kimbell: Yes. We -- well, a couple of things I'd say is we're continuing to be pleased with traffic. You talked about mobile, that's a big part of the business, a growing part of the business. And we're pleased all around with all aspects of that. The business traffic is strong and healthy. What we see in mobile is conversion in mobile is a little bit less than desktop because mobile is used often as an aid to shopping either in-store or to find stores. So there's other reasons to use mobile than maybe you're not using a desktop. So conversion shifts a little bit there, but when we look across [ AOB ] conversion, traffic, all pointing in the right direction and contributing in a meaningful way to our e-commerce business. Then we think we continue to grow across all aspects of that business going forward. 
Operator: Our next question is from Brian Tunick from Royal Bank of Canada. 
Brian Tunick: I guess 2 questions. One, just curious, on the 20% off coupons, maybe can you talk -- are you still using them to acquire new guests? Or has your philosophy around the returns that you're seeing on those coupons changed? And then maybe secondly, Scott, on merchandise margin expectations we look at next year or so, maybe talk about any mix shift within prestige growing, versus mass growing again. Maybe just give us some sense of how you think merchandise margins will play out going forward. 
Mary Dillon: Sure. I'll start on the promotion question. I would reframe it. It's really not that any one tactic is about that. I'd say, if you step back, we have a wide variety of tools in our toolkit, I guess, I'd call it, to drive traffic, to drive share gains, to make our guests very excited and happy. And the 20% off is just actually one of many tools that we do. Everything is designed to do -- to get new guests and increase share of wallet for existing guests. And increasingly, I'm really proud about the fact that our teams have, over the past several quarters and years, really created a much more sophisticated set of tools that involve everything from the ability to invest in awareness to our loyalty program. And as we just talked about, the investment in these new capabilities that we have to really use that in a more personalized way. So it's all in a journey of how do you make sure that you're excited for the guests, you're competitive, you drive a profitable growth and driving market share gains. And there's -- you'll continue to see a whole array of ways that we do that. 
Scott Settersten: And as far as gross margins are concerned, I mean, Brian, you've been following us a long time. It's a very dynamic category. I mean, Dave described, I mean, a mix of products that come in and out of our box, and now, online, to a great degree. Every year is kind of like a new story, right? What's the hot product, what's the hot SKU, what's the newness look like? So again, we're not expecting -- we never have, I guess, really to expand "merchandise margins" in any significant way in the foreseeable future. I mean, we just -- we are looking for market share gains, profitable market share gains over the long term and finding products that excite our guests that drive traffic in our stores and online, and that's what we're focused on delivering. And then we've got -- so we've talked about EFG during the course of the year a little bit and more explicitly at the Analyst Day. So that's a lever for us, again, a back around a lot of our core processes and other places in the business where we feel like we've got good opportunities to find savings to mitigate some of those headwinds if they present themselves. So again, trying to balance all elements of the business to deliver those -- that long-term algorithm that we laid out clearly at Analyst Day. 
Operator: Our next question is from Michael Binetti from Crédit Suisse. 
Michael Binetti: So I know you normally wouldn't comment on quarter-to-date trends, but given the -- both the excitement and the significant stock moves we've seen around the last few times you've made Kardashian announcements. Would it be safe to -- can we make an assumption that current trends are above the 7% to 8% guidance for the comp? 
Mary Dillon: Yes, we're not going to comment on the current quarter. I feel like, as I said earlier, really good about what our teams have put in place from a merchant side, the product offerings, the marketing, our store teams, our distribution teams are performing at exceptional levels. So I think we're in good shape, but I'll leave it at that. 
Michael Binetti: Okay. Is there -- and then just one more clean up on that. Is there anything so far to make you think the right e-comm growth rate is mid-30s in fourth quarter? 
Scott Settersten: Our forecast, when we look at the business, when we lay out the days, when we look at what we're -- the events we're comping against and the newness that we have to drive our business, that's kind of -- to Mary's earlier point, we keep it current right up to the last minute here to make sure we get our best thinking when we put our guidance together. 
Michael Binetti: All right. Fair enough. And Scott, as I think about the detailed guidance you gave at the Analyst Day and the algorithm for the next 3 years and I look at 2019 [ year ] model, you mentioned to us that some of the efficiency initiatives wouldn't be linear at the Analyst Day. One could assume that you'd be implying EPS growth rate then can maybe start at the low end of the mid- to high-teens range to start the 3-year plan? Is that the right way to orient ourselves as we think about the puts and takes of the multiyear plan? 
Scott Settersten: I appreciate your question, Michael, but we're not going to get into that today. So we're going to -- we'll lay out our plan for '19. Again, I think I explained at the Analyst Day that we're in the midst of our planning process here, there's still a long way for us to go and a lot of decisions to be made. So we'll share more with you on that in March. 
Operator: This concludes the question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the floor back to Mary Dillon for any closing comments. 
Mary Dillon: Thank you. 
 I would just like to close by thanking our 40,000 associates for delivering another strong quarter as they're working hard to get the stores, website and DCs ready for the busy holiday season, all while continuing to elevate the guest experience. 
 So I look forward to speaking to all of you again, and happy holidays. Thank you. 
Operator: This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you again for your participation.

===== 2018 Q2  (2018-08-30 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Greetings, and welcome to the Ulta Beauty Second Quarter 2018 Earnings Results Conference call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. 
 It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Ms. Laurel Lefebvre, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please proceed. 
Laurel Lefebvre: Thank you. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us for Ulta Beauty's Second Quarter 2018 Conference Call. Hosting our call are Mary Dillon, Chief Executive Officer; and Scott Settersten, Chief Financial Officer. Also joining us is Dave Kimbell, Chief Merchandising and Marketing Officer. 
 Before we begin, I'd like to remind you of the company's Safe Harbor language. The statements contained in this conference call which are not historical facts may be deemed to constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual future results may differ materially from those projected in such statements due to a number of risks and uncertainties, all of which are described in the company's filings with the SEC. [Operator Instructions] 
 I'll now turn the call over to Mary. 
Mary Dillon: Thank you, Laurel, and good afternoon, everyone. The Ulta Beauty team delivered strong performance in the second quarter, reflecting rapid growth in prestige boutique brands, mass cosmetics, skincare and fragrance, offset by continued moderation in the growth rate of a few of our large color cosmetics brands. Our flexible business model continues to support healthy retail comps, excellent new store productivity and high growth for ulta.com, resulting in significant market share gains across categories. 
 To recap our financial performance, total sales grew 15.4%. We drove 6.5% comp sales growth on top of 11.7% comps in the second quarter of 2017, with balanced traffic and ticket growth overall. Diluted earnings per share grew 34.4%. We continue to deliver our results by executing on our strategic imperatives. I'll give you a progress report in each one starting with our effort to drive loyalty and differentiate our brands. 
 We grew our Ultamate Rewards loyalty program to 29.5 million active members at the end of the second quarter, representing a 15.5% year-over-year increase. As we've seen over the past few quarters, we expect the absolute growth in members to continue to moderate but still exceed square footage growth. Going forward, we expect to increase average sales per member to complement member growth. These gains will come from multiple sources, including the maturation of loyalty members who buy more over time, the addition of new brands, the benefits of our platinum and diamond tiers to increase share of wallet, higher penetration of our credit card program and greater personalization of our communications and offers to our guests. This combination is expected to drive continued healthy revenue growth. 
 Our guests continue to respond to the powerful combination of our loyalty, credit card and gift card programs. In the second quarter, we saw continued momentum with both climbing of platinum and diamond members of our Ultamate Rewards loyalty program, where we continue to innovate with the new tier, enhanced rewards, and increased personalization. 
 Our Ultamate Rewards credit card program continues to exceed our expectations, driven by great execution from our shore teams and ongoing marketing efforts. Sales of gift cards grew more than 40%, driven by expanding distribution in other retailers this year as well as strong growth in our stores. We're maintaining the very high levels of brand awareness we obtained earlier this year through our marketing efforts around events and promotions, including Mother's Day, our Gorgeous Hair event, our sale on jumbo-sized hair care products as well as our programs targeting distinct guest segments, such as Latina, millennials and teenagers. 
 We continue to grow awareness of Ulta Beauty as a beauty destination and authority in many ways: digital partnerships, which utilize influencers; social media; and high-impact display placement. And these include POPSUGAR, Refinery29 and Bustle as well as new Hispanic media partnerships with [ Mafias ], H Code, Hola and CafeMedia. We also continue to invest in network radio and streaming audio with Spotify and Pandora. 
 We'll continue to drive awareness and further differentiate the Ulta Beauty brand as we evolve our positioning and deepening emotional connection we have with our guests, beginning with inspiring new television advertising campaign launching next week in which we'll bring to life our new brand statement, "The Possibilities are Beautiful." We will share more of this topic at our upcoming Analyst Day, plus this new positioning which will be infused through all of our marketing communications and partnerships, will unveil a new chapter for our brand celebrating the emotional and inclusive power of possibilities at Ulta Beauty. 
 Turning now to an overview of how we are continuing to differentiate our merchandise assortment. We continue to gain significant market share in prestige beauty as evidenced by NPD data from February through July this year. U.S. prestige beauty sales for the industry were up 6.4%, and we grew more than 2.5x as fast. Ulta Beauty has gained 210 basis points of share in prestige beauty so far this year and now represents almost 23% of the prestige beauty market as tracked by NPD. Our share gains year-to-date were the strongest in the makeup category, up 360 basis points, as Ulta Beauty grew prestige cosmetics in the mid-teens compared to the total market growth of 1%. 
 More broadly, during the second quarter, we benefited from strength in mass cosmetics, prestige skincare, fragrance, prestige boutique brands and sun care. Each of these categories drove healthy double-digit comps with particular strength in fragrance and boutique brands. These gains were offset by continued softness across a few large brands of prestige cosmetics. We're seeing excellent growth in the expansion of brands that are not present in all doors such as NARS, MAC, Clinique, Lancôme, Estée Lauder, Morphe and Chanel Beauté. And we anticipate that these rollouts will be an even bigger benefit in the second half of the year. We are also encouraged by the amount of newness in the pipeline ahead, both new brands and new products from existing brands. 
 We're delighted to announce the addition of Kiehl's Since 1851, the prestige skincare brand known for naturally derived ingredients inspired by their apothecary roots. This brand will launch in a small number of doors in the second half of the year and will be part of the Ulta Beauty express skin bar offering in these doors. The brand will then launch online in early January. We plan to roll out Kiehl's in a more significant number of stores starting early next year. The product lineup will include Kiehl's skincare, body and men's products. 
 On the mass cosmetics side, we're excited about the addition of Juvia's Place. This digitally-native brand was founded just a couple years ago by a Nigerian-born woman inspired by the beauty of African queens. The line offers rich, vibrant, highly-pigmented and affordable collection of colorful eyeshadows as well as make-up tools and beauty essentials. Juvia's Place recently launched online and will set in 500 stores later this year. These wins like Kiel's and Juvia's Place, to name just those 2, reflect Ulta Beauty's status as a partner of choice for a wide range of brands, from digitally-native, vertically-integrated brands to large, iconic brands. 
 In terms of new items from existing brands, much more newness is untapped for the second half of the year, giving us confidence for an improved comp trend. In many cases, these brand expansions or new product launches are exclusive to Ulta Beauty or we have an early lead on must-have products that the beauty enthusiast wants to be the first to own. 
 The Tutti Frutti collection from Too Faced is expected to be a big hit with our guests. This is a fruit-scented assortment of lip, eye, cheek and highlighter products with mega influencer Kandee Johnson partnering with Too Faced as the face of the collection. Launched online in mid-August and set in stores just this week, this collection is only available at Ulta Beauty and toofaced.com. Recently launched digitally-native brand, Morphe, will be expanding to 10 feet at all doors in just a few weeks, and the new Vault 4-palette collection with influencer Jaclyn Hill had a very strong launch just a couple of weeks ago. We're the only brick-and-mortar outlet for this brand. 
 NYX just launched exclusively with Ulta Beauty their Can't Stop Won't Stop long-wear foundation with a broad shade range. Other recent major product launches include equally anticipated items like the Norvina Palette from Anastasia; the newest NARS mascara, where in both cases Ulta Beauty had an early lead for the launch. Other new products include Clinique's Dramatically Different Hydrating Jelly; Tarte Creaseless Concealer; Urban Decay Aphrodisiac palette; Dose of Colors limited edition collaboration with influencer, ILUVSARAHII; Benefit Brow contour pen; and Clinique My Happy Splash fragrances designed for layering. 
 Now the last thing I want to mention is some breaking news. We are thrilled to confirm our exclusive partnership with Kylie Cosmetics, which will be launching in all stores and online later this year. Kylie Jenner is a highly influential force in the beauty industry. This brand addition is yet another example of successful digitally-native brands valuing a brick-and-mortar partnership with Ulta Beauty to extend their reach with consumers. We'll share more details about this launch at a later date. 
 Now moving on to our services business. Salon sales increased 8.8%, and comp sales rose 1.7% due to growth in average ticket. Skin services were a top performer, helped by strength in microderm services. The express skin bar continues to roll out in new stores with about 40 stores now offering this new model. These stores are already showing increases in prestige skincare sales compared to the prior model. This program offers our guests quick services on the sales floor with licensed skincare experts focused on helping guests choose a skincare regimen that addresses her concerns. Select locations will begin offering facial services from Murad, Kate Somerville and Kiehl's, in addition to Dermalogica, our long-standing skincare partner across the chain. We're on track to roll out 180 express skin bars by year-end, and 50 of these will offer multi-brand skin services. 
 During the quarter, we completed training in California in preparation for their conversion to our new services optimization program, a model that improves and simplifies the guest and associate experiences with changes to pricing, training and compensation. Our new stores in Hawaii opened with this program, joining the Central region, as well as the DC and Denver districts, which were launched in the first quarter. Early results indicate higher guest retention, and our stylists have received the new program very favorably. We plan to introduce this model to additional regions in 2019. 
 We continue to focus on gaining awareness within the salon industry. We participated in Premiere Orlando, attended by over 57,000 beauty professionals, and we hosted the first-ever Ulta Beauty show at the North American Hairstylist Awards in Las Vegas. NAHA represents the most prestigious hair industry awards in North America, viewed by over 200,000 people and garnering 5 million impressions. 
 Last quarter, we mentioned that the Ulta Beauty Pro Hair team have received 9 nominations across multiple hair categories, and we're pleased to update you that one of our team members took home the award for Hairstylist of the Year. Events like these establish Ulta Beauty as a great place to work for stylists and help us to continue to attract top quality talent. 
 And now turning to real estate. We opened 19 stores in the second quarter compared to 20 last year, and closed 2, ending the quarter was 1,124 stores. Our growth and development team has done a great job getting stores opened earlier in the year with 53 stores opened in the first half compared to 38 last year. We opened our first store in Hawaii, on Maui, in the second quarter, and have opened another Hawaii store early in the third quarter, with plans to open 2 more on Oahu during Q3. Our Hawaiian stores are off to an excellent start. We'll also be entering Vermont later this year to reach the milestone of opening -- of operating stores in all 50 states. 
 New store productivity continues to be very strong. We continue to study new store productivity and observe cannibalization to be stable and well within our expectations, so we feel very comfortable with our network strategy in reaching our target of 1,400 to 1,700 stores in the U.S. over the next several years. 
 And now turning to an update on ulta.com. E-commerce sales grew 37.9% and represented 9% of total company sales. This moderation relative to the first quarter was expected, as we're comping over 72% growth last year when we benefited from the MAC launch and high growth from several online-only brands. Ulta.com contributed 250 basis points of the total company comp, driven by transaction growth. Total traffic rose close to 40%, with mobile traffic up 50%. We continue to drive significant growth with online-only brands and online-only promotions. 
 Our store-to-door program that allows guests to order online in our stores and have products shipped to their homes continues to exceed expectations, particularly with brands that aren't available in every door such as ColourPop, MAC and several digitally native brands that are in high demand but in limited distribution. Ulta.com recently launched a foundation finder. We're continuing to see success in enhanced content programs like our monthly fragrance crush, and we just launched a new program focusing on a key skincare trend each month called Skinfatuation. We're also testing personalization initiatives in several areas. 
 Omni-channel customers now represent 10% of loyalty members and the shopping behavior of these guests continues to reinforce our view that e-commerce sales are largely incremental. The guest shopping on ulta.com continues to shop more frequently in stores than retail-only customers. This guest is our most engaged loyalty member, demonstrating interest in new brands and products and a low incidence of replenishing exact items. 
 And finally, I'll update you on our supply chain operations. Ulta Beauty's supply chain operations continue to mature in the first half of 2018, supported by investments in capabilities that support growth, deliver a great guest experience and enable network efficiencies. Our in-stock position throughout the second quarter was consistently strong, particularly for our top selling items. We effectively managed our inventory position throughout the quarter with our inventory per store well below comp growth and inventory turns slightly ahead of our goal. 
 We've made several improvements to our logistics network over the last several months to better serve our retail and e-commerce customers, and so far the results have led to improved performance and reduced costs across both channels. We also recently implemented an order management system that enables future omni-channel capabilities such as buy online, pickup in store. 
 Our newest distribution center in Fresno, California went live in July, serving both e-commerce and retail operations. This DC is planned to ramp quickly with a more aggressive first year build than Greenwood and Dallas. Fresno is currently serving nearly 100 stores and about 20% of our e-com volume. In the fall, Fresno will ramp to about 170 stores and maintain its share of ulta.com sales. And after the holiday season, Fresno will ramp to serving more than 200 stores and more than 20% of our e-commerce sales. Overall, we're pleased with the strong performance of our supply chain operations, in-stocks and decreases in inventory per door. 
 This year, we've implemented improved processes with a large number of inventory transitions we execute as a result of our growing access to new brands and products. At the end of the quarter, we ran a special clearance event with extra discounts in inventory resulting from the major planogram reset we've executed recently. The event was designed to sell through inventory no longer on a store's planogram and clean up our back room, setting us up for a great 21 Days of Beauty and strong holiday season, and is proceeding on plan. 
 Now before I turn it over to Scott, I'd like to give you a preview of our upcoming Investor and Analyst Conference. Scheduled for November 8, near Chicago, this will be our third biannual investor conference. And similar to prior events, it's an opportunity to get to know the management team, learn about our latest thinking on our market share gain opportunities, our consumer targets, our brand positioning, get an update on our loyalty program and share of wallet potential, hear about the outlook for newness across our merchandise portfolio, learn more about the salon services optimization program, see how we're investing in technology and innovation to enhance the guest experience, get a refresher on our supply chain capabilities, learn more about our efficiencies-for-growth program and get a current view on our capital allocation. So lots to cover, and we hope you'll join us in November. 
 And with that, I'll hand it over to Scott to talk in more detail about our second quarter results and share our outlook for the second half. 
Scott Settersten: Thank you, Mary. Good afternoon, everyone. Starting with the income statement. Revenue growth of 15.4% was driven by a 6.5% comp and continued strength from new store sales. The revenue recognition accounting standard implemented at the beginning of the year added $9.4 million of sales. As a reminder, this represents the impact of income from our credit card program and gift card breakage moving up to the revenue line as well as e-commerce revenue now being recognized upon shipment date instead of delivery date to the customer. These items are currently offset by the value of loyalty points earned now treated as a reduction of net sales. Our retail comparable sales growth was not impacted by the revenue recognition change. 
 Traffic and ticket for the total company was fairly balanced with a 3.1% increase in transactions and a 3.4% lift in average ticket. The retail-only comp of 4.1% was made up of 1.1% traffic and 3% ticket growth. Ticket was driven by modest increases in both average selling price and UPT. The combined retail and salon comp was 4% which included the salon comp of 1.7%. 
 Turning to margins. Gross profit deleveraged 40 basis points. The new revenue recognition accounting standard was a benefit of about 60 basis points to the gross profit line, so the underlying roughly 100 basis points of deleverage was attributed to several primary factors. About 1/3 was from supply chain expense, reflecting the cost of opening the new Fresno distribution center. About 1/3 was investments in our salon operations as we roll out our salon optimization program. And the remaining 1/3 was related to ongoing pressures from the mix of e-commerce sales, prestige brand boutiques and mass cosmetics relative to higher-margin categories as well as the clearance event that we ran at the end of the quarter that Mary already referenced. This event focused on selling through inventory that was no longer being sold in certain stores, where we've had a series of significant reflows and planogram resets across multiple categories this year. 
 While we typically have smaller clearance events throughout the year, this one reflected more aggressive markdowns and more items featured overall to make sure we cleared the stores ahead of the holiday season and major launches of fall newness. This event is ongoing and will wrap up in a few weeks. Aside from this exceptional activity, promotional levels were stable year-over-year. Finally, we did see modest leverage in rent and occupancy expenses to partially offset these factors. 
 Turning to SG&A, we deleveraged by 70 basis points, reflecting 80 basis points of deleverage from the revenue recognition accounting standard. The 10 basis points of underlying SG&A leverage was a bright spot considering we deleveraged store labor expense, primarily in support of our prestige boutique strategy and also deleveraged advertising expense slightly, while expecting this line item to be flat for the full year. Offsetting this pressure was strong leverage in corporate overhead, reflecting good expense management, and early savings from our cost optimization program as well as timing of some budgeted G&A costs that will be incurred later in the year. 
 Operating margin was 13% of sales and was down 100 basis points as expected from last year's Q2 result of 14%, with 20 basis points of the decrease coming from the revenue recognition accounting change. Diluted EPS increased 34.4% with the upside to our guidance primarily due to corporate overhead savings and timing of expenses. 
 Moving on the balance sheet and cash flow, total inventory grew 6.5%, but decreased 4.3% on a per-store basis, well below comparable sales growth and a strong outcome in light of the investments in inventory to start operating our new Fresno distribution center during the quarter. This excellent performance reflects the new tools and systems we invested in to manage inventory as well as the more significant clearance activity at the end of the quarter. Capital expenditures were $68 million for the quarter for new stores, investment in systems, prestige boutiques, merchandise fixtures and supply chain activities. We ended the quarter with $386.1 million in cash and short-term investments. We repurchased 512,000 shares through our 10b5-1 program at a cost of $127 million during the second quarter. $402 million remain available on the $625 million authorization as of quarter-end. 
 Turning now to guidance for the third quarter and full year. For the third quarter of 2018, we expect sales to be in the range of $1.550 billion to $1.563 billion versus $1.342 billion last year. We expect comparable sales to increase in the range of 7% to 8% versus 10.3% last year. E-commerce sales are expected to grow in the 40% range. We plan to open approximately 40 new stores in the third quarter compared to 48 in Q3 last year, and remain on track to open 100 net new stores this year. Q3 preopening expense is expected to be slightly lower as a rate of sales. 
 Diluted earnings per share are expected to be in the range of $2.11 to $2.16 versus $1.70 last year. And operating margin is planned to deleverage, including the roughly 20 basis points related to the revenue recognition accounting standard, consistent with the impact we saw in the first half of the year. The tax rate for Q3 is expected to be 24%. This does not include any assumptions for the tax rate impact of share-based compensation accounting which is difficult to forecast. Our fully diluted share count is estimated at 60 million. 
 For the full year, we are maintaining our outlook for full year 2018 to reflect some of the timing we mentioned with planned expenses occurring later in the year. We plan to open 100 new stores; all are our 10,000-square foot standard prototype. We'll complete 15 remodel and relocation projects. We expect to grow e-commerce approximately 40%. We anticipate top line growth in the low teens, including the impact of the 53rd week last year. Total company comps are expected to be in the 6% to 8% range, with retail comp in the mid-single digits. We expect to grow diluted earnings per share in the low 20s percentage range, including the extra week in 2017. We anticipate capital expenditures of approximately $375 million. Depreciation is forecasted at approximately $290 million. We expect to repurchase shares in the $500 million range for the year, and the annual tax rate for the remainder of the year is expected to be 24%.
 And with that, I'll turn it over to our conference call host for the Q&A. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Brian Tunick from RBC Capital Markets. 
Brian Tunick: I guess the first question, with a little more help maybe from Scott on the third quarter, obviously, there's some comparisons on the hurricane issues and some SG&A initiatives. Can you maybe help us parse out how you're expecting gross margin versus SG&A to play out in the third quarter and maybe in the back half, just the different components first? 
Scott Settersten: Sure, Brian. So I guess on the gross margin line, we would expect a bit of a pivot here as we look ahead to the second half of the year. So the third quarter, I think you'll probably well remember we're going to be anniversarying over some hurricane activity last year. So we had some pretty significant, what I would say, merchandise margin investments in late last year to try to mitigate against some of the sales softness that we saw as part of the hurricane impact. So we'll be lapping that, so we feel good about where we are. So I think you would expect to see gross margin above -- show good leverage above the accounting change impact that we saw here, that 20 basis points in the first half of the year. So I guess that would be the first thing I would say. On the SG&A side, more deleveraged than we saw on the first half of the year. So I think that's where you'll find equilibrium there for the back half. So we've got some projects again. Some things we're doing for the first time, some of these new technologies that we're implementing across the business. So some of our initial time lines were just a little bit slower, off the line, I guess I would say on that, but we feel good about. We're going to get everything completed in the second half of the year and position ourselves well for 2019 and beyond. 
Brian Tunick: And then maybe could Mary talk a little about the larger prestige color cosmetics that you're talking about here? How big of a portion of the business is that? Has the company gone through a similar period before from either lack of newness or cadence of product introductions? Maybe just talk about what the company has seen before through this kind of period? 
Mary Dillon: Well, obviously, it's sort of a -- it's a mix story, I guess, I would say. We continue to drive solid growth in prestige cosmetics overall. We continue to have great market share gains. We've seen through our boutique brands, they're growing very nicely, and many of our prestige brands are growing with strong innovation and social media presence. But a few of our major prestige brands are not lapping the newness, I guess I'd say. So that's putting some pressure on the model. This is what we do I guess all the time. Our merchants are constantly evaluating and working with our brand partners to continue to strengthen the pipeline. We feel really good about the pipeline. First of all, our overall business model, I think, is -- it shows the strength and flexibility at a time where you might have a segment that's not as strong but delivering strong results across many categories. And we're working with -- closely with our brands. And maybe, Dave, if you want to add a little bit about we feel really good about the pipeline of newness and innovation from the second half. 
David Kimbell: Yes, we really do, really, across the store. I'll reiterate what Mary said. We're really happy and excited about the whole mix and the assortment in all categories: haircare, skincare, fragrance and cosmetics. And we're seeing some nice growth in the entire store. Although as Mary said, some of our largest prestige brands have had some challenges. But as we look forward, we're really optimistic. We've been working closely. They certainly -- the brands themselves are focused on driving growth. I'll give you a couple of examples of things that we're very optimistic and excited about. Tarte is one of our largest brands, and it's been driving actually strong growth all year long in part because of the Double Duty Beauty line that's exclusive to Ulta Beauty. And that's been successful all year, and we have seen some nice innovation and expansion of that business that will continue to drive growth through the rest of the year. Too Faced, Mary mentioned, just launched an exclusive line only at Ulta Beauty, Tutti Frutti, which is off to a strong start early, but we're excited. That has a long -- that brand has a long history of growth and success at Ulta Beauty, and we're optimistic. IT Cosmetics, a brand that really grew up in many ways at Ulta Beauty, has recently launched some new lines, including a 48-shade concealer line, Bye Bye Under Eye concealer, that also is off to a strong start. And Benefit, we've had a long partnership with Benefit, including a unique brow partnership, brow service partner -- Brow Bar service partnership. And they've had a steady stream of innovation, and we're optimistic about what's coming, including a strong holiday. So across the board, as Mary said, we see ups and downs naturally in our business, but as we look forward, we see a lot of good things coming. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Simeon Siegel from Nomura Instinet. 
Julie Kim: This is Julie Kim on for Simeon. I was just wondering about the salon segment, if you could provide any color there. I believe comp slowed down sequentially, so just curious on what trends you're seeing. And given the expansion of the skin bar, what your thoughts are on – longer term for opportunities. 
Mary Dillon: Yes. Well, we're very invested in the services part of our business. It's a critical differentiator. It's -- that salon guest, any service guest is really one of our best guests because they shop and spend much more. They spend almost 3x what somebody who's not using services does. So our salon business continues to outperform the market. We have exceptional talent. We do see that -- we believe we can reinvent it to make it even better, and that's why we're doing this services optimization work. Early results are very encouraging, and it's really about optimizing menu, pricing, training, hiring kind of across board. So you'll expect that to show fast results quickly, but that early results are actually very encouraging. And also, as we start to roll out the skin bar with these quicker services, that is off to a very strong start as well. And it's very much just being responsive to what our guests want and need from us. They care a lot about skincare. They don't have maybe as much time to have a long service, but they're very happy to start participating in these quicker services. So a lot of new brand launches, a lot of innovation there, and we feel good about where it's heading. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Steph Wissink from Jefferies. 
Stephanie Schiller Wissink: I'll ask a question on Kylie Cosmetics. I'm wondering if you can talk a little bit about that partnership, what the timing is of the expected rollout. Mary, I think you indicated back part of the year, but will that be in stores for holiday? And then how should we think about that in tandem with your new marketing campaign in terms of the possibilities at Ulta? 
Mary Dillon: Well, it's a new possibility at Ulta. Yes, so we're not going to -- we don't really have details to disclose today, but know that it will be all stores and online by holiday. We're really excited about it. It's going to be, I think, a fantastic partnership for us. And I'll see if you want anything more. I'll just add, as we start our new advertising, which starts September 2, so it's right around the corner. Really proud about, I think, the work, and we pretested the works so we feel good about how consumers are going to react to it. It's just the next evolution of our brand and really elevating to a more emotional level in a way that's very consistent with how people want to see Ulta Beauty talk about beauty. So more to come on that, but I think bakes it very nicely together. 
Stephanie Schiller Wissink: And Scott, can I just follow up on an earlier question regarding the third quarter. I think you mentioned that the investments are largely going to be in technology in the SG&A line. Can you maybe extrapolate a little bit more around what's left within the investment cycle that you still need to focus on here over the 6 to 12 months? And how should we think about that equalizing over the course of the next several months, kind of as you pass through Q3 and into back half and then onward into '19? 
Scott Settersten: Yes, so a little more clarification on that. I mean, typically, the third quarter is the toughest for us on a margin expansion kind of quest over the long term. So you got peak new store implementation, you got peak boutique and labor component with that implementation in the third quarter. This year, on top of that, you've got the Fresno DC, which is at peak deleverage in the P&L there, as that kind of gets off the starting line, so to speak. So there's a lot of things at the core that kind of pile up in the third quarter that make it a challenge for us. And then in addition to that, we laid out earlier in the year some of the incremental investments that we have, right, as part of the tax reform work in our business. So a lot of those projects, the test and learns and other things that we have queued up, are just taking a little bit longer to get implemented than we initially thought earlier in the year. So again, the majority of that falls into the third quarter. So when we're talking about shifting of expenses, that's a big piece of it as well. And then advertising and marketing is a little bit more on top of that. So with the new advertising launch here in the fall, we move some of the spending from the first half of the year into the second. So again, just trying to take advantage of making sure we're optimizing from all focus points. So third quarter, you're going to see more deleverage on the SG&A line than maybe we were thinking last quarter when we spoke with you. But again, as we roll it forward through the fourth quarter, with sales, Fresno up and running, working towards, as Mary mentioned, a quicker ramp than we've seen in the past, we expect a lot of that to moderate in the fourth quarter. So again, for the full year, we're right on target with our 50 to 70 basis points of deleverage on the operating margin line, and then feel like we're really in a good spot setting ourselves up well for 2019 and beyond. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Christopher Horvers from JPMorgan. 
Christopher Horvers: Can you talk a little bit about the 7% to 8% guide for the 3 -- for the third quarter? It's been interesting. Your comps haven't really bounced on easier comparisons, but clearly, you've got a lot of self-help coming here in the third quarter. So I guess my question is, is the 7% to 8% more anticipatory of the lift that's ahead? Or is there something that you're seeing in the month of August that is giving you the encouragement to guide this way? 
Mary Dillon: Well, thank you for the question. I'm not going to comment on the quarter that we're in, but we really try to give our best guidance. We do expect to see acceleration against some easier comps in the second half. And as, I think, we've talked about a couple times, the continued rollout of some of our high-growth brands, newness from existing brand partners, new advertising, 21 Days of Beauty, which is always a great event for us. So we just believe that and see the ability for our comps to strengthen as we get further into the year. 
Christopher Horvers: Understood. And then in terms of the boutique rollout, you've accelerated that over the past few years. In the past, you've talked about the boutiques sort of mature over a 3-year time frame. It's tough for us to lay out sort of that math. But as you think about the lift from the boutique additions that you've done over the past few years and this year, does the -- is the benefit from that boutique rollout accelerating here into the back half of 2018 and into 2019? 
Scott Settersten: No, I wouldn't say there's an acceleration. I'd say overall, we're very happy with the performance of those boutique brands. Again, they're a big contributor to our comp performance here in recent quarters. Again, everything's got to stay in balance, right? So very happy with the top line performance of those boutiques and our investments there, but it does create a little bit of a headwind, as we've discussed in the past, on the margin rate line. So again, trying to balance it all for an optimized result overall. So I wouldn't call it an acceleration. Although I would point out this year, Mary mentioned the new stores, so we did kind of sequence our field construction program a little differently this year. We pulled ahead, I guess, the new store rollouts. So we're further ahead on new store week, so that's a good thing. Getting those stores open further in advance of the holiday season, so the store teams are more seasoned and ready to go. We think that's going to be a benefit. And some of the new boutique installs are kind of dragging later in the year than they have the last couple of years. So again, that's another comp driver that we think gives us confidence on the second half of the year. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Mark Altschwager from Baird. 
Mark Altschwager: And just to clarify, Scott, I think if I heard you correctly, you said you do expect gross margin to be up in Q3 even before the accounting benefit. Is that accurate? And then what is the merchandise margin expectation that's embedded in that? I think merch margin was the primary driver to the gross margin decline last year. So just trying to get a sense of a reasonable expectation in terms of recapture. 
Scott Settersten: Yes, I don't think I can quantify it in basis points for you, Mark, but you hit it -- the nail right on the head. That's exactly what we're expecting. So that'll be the pivot point in the third quarter. I mean, again, I don't recall exactly what we stated, but it was significant basis points investment last year. I mean, those hurricanes really hurt us last year. And so we made a decision to invest and rate to drive sales through incremental promotional events, and so we made the decision. We made the right decision for that point in time, and now, this year, as we cycle that, we expect to see a bounce back on that. And based on the early reads here, we're feeling very confident where we're headed. 
Mark Altschwager: And it seems like a lot of moving pieces on the SG&A front this year. Is there a way to think kind of, as you get beyond 2018 and a lot of these kind of one-time expenses on the supply chain front, what's a normalized level of SG&A growth that's needed to sustain the strength in the business? 
Scott Settersten: Yes. I don't think I can again quantify for that specifically year-to-date. Maybe that's something we can queue up for Analyst Day a little bit differently than maybe we've looked at it in the past. But again, this year, we've got a significant reinvestment, right, of those tax reform benefits that accrue to us this year. So again, a lot of that -- a lot -- trying to quantify what's recurring and what's one-time kind of thing. I mean, we're in a very dynamic environment here in retail, and there's things that we just need to do to make sure we sustain a healthy business for the long term, and that's what we intend to do. So we'll keep you updated. Again, we talked about guidance for '19 that we're feeling pretty good about right now. And when we see you in November, we'll give you a view of how we're thinking about the longer term. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Adrienne Yih from Wolfe Research. 
Adrienne Yih-Tennant: Mary, I was wondering if you can talk a little bit about sort of the promotional backdrop. It seems like year-to-date the department stores have done a little bit better and, therefore, may be aren't as aggressive on the promos? And then if you can comment on recently there was an article about CVS rolling out this beauty experiencing in collaboration with Glamsquad. And then finally, Scott, as you talk about 2019, in order for margins to expand, do you need comp -- the store comp to accelerate from that kind of 4%-ish level? Or will the fixed cost breakeven point come down to that level because you're going to have some of these investments rolling off? 
Mary Dillon: Okay, a 3-parter. So on the promotional strategy, I will just say that it's -- we've been consistent year-over-year in the quarter. There's -- I would say the overall environment is always competitive. We're not seeing any major shifts I would say in the promotional environment, it's stable, but pretty promotional environment. I feel really good about the model that we have. We've worked hard over the last 5 years to really diversify our, I guess I'd call them demand levers and tools. And we always have the ability to pull different levers with an increasing focus on using our loyalty program, our CRM program, more personalized over time. So and it's allowed us to really balance in this and invest in things like advertising and PR and social media. So I think we've got that, we flex as we need, but we don't see that as being necessarily very different right now, I guess, than it's been. Your other question, competition. Everybody is interested in the beauty business, and so, yes, we're aware, pay attention to everything that's going on. We, I think, have a real strong lead as it relates to having a differentiated model, whether you're talking about competing with mass, where we've got obviously very differentiated assortment in mass the arena or mass-tige arena, plus services, plus our loyalty program. So I love what we're doing as it relates to digitally-native brands across prestige and mass. And so we look at everything as game on, but not -- doesn't keep me up at night, I guess, I'd say. 
Scott Settersten: I mean, as far as the outlook for '19 and how the algorithm might work, so we would -- I'd say we take a reasonable, prudent view of what the top line might look like, right, and we build our cost infrastructure to match that. And then we hope we do better on the top line, right, with some of the newness that we have in our sight. So you used the term fixed cost and variable cost. I mean, things we talked about, our efficiencies for growth initiative that we kicked off here earlier this year, so that'll be a big piece of it. So we see cost efficiencies across the business. Very happy with where we are in that. The DC, again, we got Fresno this year that'll drop off, right. So you won't -- we won't have another one in '19. At least that's not planned now, so we'll get some benefit there. And then the investments we're making. The tax reform investments that we're investing in this year, we expect to get benefits out of that, right, in '19 and beyond. So maybe that would be a way to think about it. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Erinn Murphy from Piper Jaffray. 
Erinn Murphy: Mary, my question is for you. You talked about, in your prepared remarks, the opportunity for spend per loyal consumer to further increase. Can you just share with us what you're learning about the platinum and the diamond-tiered customers, whether it's frequency into the stores, spend per customer? And then I guess secondly, just on the second quarter, did the stores that overlap at the Bon-Ton, can you just talk about how they performed, and if your second half guidance implies any share gains from Bon-Ton's closure? 
Mary Dillon: Loyalty, we are careful not to break out a lot of detail about the various performance of the tiers. But I will tell you is that, obviously, we consider it a successful and a strong tool for us. But if you step way back, today, we have just under 30 million members in our loyalty program, but they still represent only 1/3 of the beauty enthusiasts in the U.S., and we only have about 1/3 of the wallet share. So I look at that as a continued source. We're very focused on how we're going to grow both that, the number of members as well as wallet share. And the tier -- I mean, the innovation that the team has put in place in the program are really working. So the diamond tier, really strong move for us; credit card, increasing personalization engine and recommendation engine. So as well as really strong focus by our teams in-store on driving awareness and conversion of the program. So we see that as a core asset for us and feel really good about how we're going to continue to innovate to drive growth. On Bon-Ton, I would just say we're certainly paying attention to everything that's happening competitively. And we're obviously reaching out, making sure customers who are looking for a place to shop for beauty in those markets, know about Ulta Beauty. When -- I would say our guidance assumes we're going to continue to gain share across from several sources, we don't predict that precisely down to an individual competitor. But we see closure impact the stores. Can have kind of a plus or a minus, but generally built into our expectations. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Rupesh Parikh from Oppenheimer & Co. 
Rupesh Parikh: So on your mass cosmetics business, the performance really stands out versus your peers this quarter. So I was just curious, as you look at the reset that you've this year-to-date, have there been any surprises versus your expectations? 
David Kimbell: Yes. We are very happy with our mass cosmetics business in a lot of ways with our makeup business overall. But yes -- no, I think the things that we set out to do, we're feeling good about accomplishing them. Some of our biggest, more established brands like our Ulta Beauty Collection, L'Oréal, Maybelline, are playing an important roles, but a lot of newness has come in to really excite guests and engage her in new ways. In particular, brands that are exclusive and only found at Ulta. Morphe is one that Mary mentioned in her prepared remarks has been one that's been driving a lot of growth. The recent Jaclyn Hill palette launch just a couple of weeks ago was quite successful, and we've had continued expansion with that brand. Makeup Revolution, also exclusive in the United States to Ulta, has grown quite well and plays a very important role in our overall assortment. The addition of ColourPop, one of the stronger influencer-led, digitally-native brands has also been a nice complement to our overall portfolio and driven a lot of growth. So we're really pleased with this performance. We see a lot of growth in that space and continue to focus on all of makeup, and anticipate more growth in mass space, in particular. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Daniel Hopkin from William Blair. 
Daniel Hofkin: Just wanted to see if you could just kind of briefly -- I may have missed it, but are older stores in this type of an environment -- are your older stores still comping positive or breakeven? Kind of where does that stand at this point? 
Scott Settersten: So the fleet looks healthy overall, again, as you would expect with a mid-single digit comp in the retail side. The older stores, 5 years and older, are low single to mid-single digit comps. So again, we're not seeing anything unusual there. Oftentimes, we might see some sales transfer or cannibalization, but oftentimes we do that to ourselves, right. So we're trying to make sure we got best positions in the market, and we're in it for the long term. We're in it for total dollars on the top and bottom line. So feeling good about -- as Mary said, feeling good about new store productivity and our long-term target. 
Daniel Hofkin: Okay, great. And then if -- any update on just kind of the major urban store locations that you've opened in the last year, Chicago and Manhattan, and kind of what you see the early going as the potential incremental opportunities there? 
Mary Dillon: Yes. Those stores are performing really well. We're thrilled that we opened them. I think they're giving us great brand awareness and also really performing very nicely for us. So I think going forward it'll still be a small-ish part of what we do. Obviously, the cost around those businesses is a lot higher than an non-urban store, but we love what we're seeing in those. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Matt Fassler from Goldman Sachs. 
Matthew Fassler: My first question, primary question relates to your prestige market share numbers. You quoted some nice increases on an aggregate basis. Can you give us a sense of how that's transpiring on the same store basis? And also what direction that trend has gone for you in terms of your prestige market share trajectory? 
David Kimbell: Yes, so I'll jump in. And yes, our prestige market share overall has been growing significantly for -- well, for several years and the first half, second quarter of this year was no exception. I think the main drivers of that growth -- and that's happening certainly as we've added new stores, but for sure, within our comp stores. Even the brands that we've talked about today that -- in the prestige space that haven't been performing to our expectations are still performing largely better at Ulta than perhaps at other places across the market. So the drivers of that growth are really a combination of continuing to expand some of the brands that are in limited distribution that are rolling out into more stores. That's a significant contributor to our market share growth, brands like MAC and Estée Lauder, Clinique, Lancôme, really across the board, NARS. The addition of new brands like Flesh, as an example, recently has been an addition in adding growth. And then some of these exclusive lines that I talked about earlier with Tarte Double Duty Beauty now, Too Faced Tutti Frutti are significantly driving growth and are -- because they're exclusive, are driving strong share growth as well. So it's a multi-tiered level, and we're definitely seeing it in comp stores as well as new stores and excited. The last thing I'd say with that, though, is digitally-native brands are certainly having an impact on the total prestige market and total makeup market. That's why we're really focused on driving these brands, brands like Morphe, ColourPop that we've added, and now, as Mary mentioned, confirming the launch of Kylie will play an important role in continuing to make sure that we're driving shares well into the future. 
Matthew Fassler: And very briefly on Kylie, obviously, a new piece of news, your guidance is, as it was. Should we consider that new brand addition to be included in the present guidance for the rest of the year? 
Mary Dillon: Yes, Matt. I would say yes. Think about it like that. It comes quite late in the year, and so we factored that into our thinking. And it's like any new brand. It's really hard to predict exactly how it'll play, but think about it as included in the guidance, yes. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Binetti from Crédit Suisse. 
Michael Binetti: Can I just ask a quick model question? Is the -- I might have missed this, but is the plan still for the merchandise margin to be flat this year? And I guess related with the planogram change that you discussed that resulted in the clearance activity contemplated in the initial guidance for merch margins flat? 
Scott Settersten: Yes, I think directionally flat is the way to think about it for the full year. And clearance work or the clearance event here at the end of second quarter is not going to have any significant impact on that. 
Michael Binetti: Okay. And would you mind helping walk us up to how you're thinking about, I guess, gross margins for the fourth quarter, which has obviously been a very promotional quarter. But there's some noise last year in the compare in the fourth quarter with the 53rd week, I think. Maybe just help us think about how you're building up to your gross margin expectation in the all-important holiday season? 
Scott Settersten: I think the way I'd describe the third quarter, the pivot point here where we expect gross margin to leverage in the third quarter, is consistent with the fourth quarter as well. So again, to your point, some usual -- unusual activity last year. The DC ramp up here. Fresno is going to give us a less headwind, I guess, I would say as we look into the fourth quarter. So efficiencies, the company, the enterprise overall continues to get more efficient. So you take the newness, coupled -- better sales trends there coupled with the efficiencies that we're building every day, feel like we're going to be able to expand gross margins in the fourth quarter as well. 
Michael Binetti: Okay. Mary, maybe one more, just a little more fun to think about it. Obviously, you said the growth rate of the loyalty customer will mature just given the size of that program for you. But -- so to the earlier question, would you mind sharing any kind of numerical examples or KPIs of the wallet share metrics that you're seeing that accelerate, that drive the confidence in the comments you said and your thoughts on gains from the share of wallet for the customer, please? 
Mary Dillon: Yes, which as I said earlier, just -- and broadly, we've got about 1/3 of the share wallet of our loyalty members overall. So we don't really break that out in any more level of specificity, but you can imagine some that are more highly engaged. We have a higher share of wallet than others, but on average it's 1/3. So our focus, as we think about the future, is just really we've got everything the beauty enthusiast wants and loves, and we're going to continue to offer her everything she needs and wants. And so for us, it's about continuing -- but you'll also -- we'll never have 100% of her wallet share because people shop in different places sometimes. But we think that between increased levels of personalization of our offers and just innovation in the program and also innovation of what we offer, we're going to continue to focus on how we can even drive more of that wallet share growth over time. But it doesn't move overnight. It takes a while, but that's a key area of focus for us. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Oliver Chen from Cowen and Company. 
Oliver Chen: Regarding the planograms, what are your thoughts about what the new planograms will do for you? And how will you ensure that this is a good step just in front of the all-important holiday selling season? And Mary, I would love your thoughts on what we're seeing with the bifurcation of the larger brands versus some of the newer brands? Do you expect that, that will be a trend that will continue in terms of just the reality of the pace of newness that you're seeing and how the industry dynamics have changed? 
Mary Dillon: Well, maybe I'll start with that, and then Dave, you can talk about the planograms. But I just think it's actually, it's a really exciting and interesting time for innovation in entrepreneurialism in this industry. And the great thing is that we can participate across all that, and I'm proud about how our team is building partnerships. But I'll tell you, some of the largest, most iconic and well-known brands are doing really well with younger guests as well. Estée Lauder is a great example of a classic iconic brand that millennials have rediscovered. Of course, then there's lots of brands that are starting up as entrepreneurial, direct-to-consumer. So I think that is certainly going to continue to be the dynamic going forward, and our goal is to bring our guests really everything that she wants across the spectrums. But I -- it doesn't mean that any one is going to win for the long term. I think it's the mosaic of being in all of those sectors of the market. 
David Kimbell: Yes. And as far as the planograms, of course, newness has -- plays a really important role in our overall business. So we're always updating our assortment, and all that goes back to some of the things that we've talked about today about our optimism about the newness that's coming. And so we feel really good about the planogram. We think we've got the stores in a good place to present this new product and ready for 21 Days of Beauty, which starts on Sunday, and then going into the obviously important holiday season. So a lot of newness, stores are well prepared to accept that newness and present it in a really compelling way to our guests. 
Oliver Chen: And just lastly, in inventory management and the SWIFT system and how you're thinking about the line of communication between you and vendors as well as accuracy in turns. What are your thoughts about where you are versus where you want to be in order to get the goods at the right place at the right time at the right place and be right? 
Scott Settersten: Yes. So I'll just remind you that SWIFT is just one element of a complete -- we call it complete rebuild of the behind, the merchandising support, infrastructure, I guess, I'll say. So there's space planning tools that are -- that have been built and implemented over the last couple years. SWIFT is a key piece of that. But there's also a lot of are going on in our distribution centers, right, the old legacy centers, and the new centers, with new operating models and so on. So they all are working in unison, right. And so you're -- we're only in the early innings I guess I would say. You've seen the last couple of quarters, our inventory productivity improved. We're taking excess inventory out of the system while keeping in-stock levels very high. So feeling good about where we are, and we're on a path, right, a multiyear path to continue to see that. And inventory optimization is going to be a significant driver of operating margin improvement in '19 and beyond. 
David Kimbell: And to your point about -- just a quick add on the brand partners. We've worked very closely, particularly, over the last couple of years, to fully integrate more with our brand partners. And that's been working well. There's more opportunity there, but they're overall very engaged and I think generally pleased with the success that we've had in improving the efficiencies and in-store presentation. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Goldsmith from UBS. 
Michael Goldsmith: I wanted to speak on the performance of prestige cosmetics. Was it the same brands within prestige outside of the boutiques that were soft in 1Q that were soft again in the second quarter? And did they decelerate during the period? And then on the newness, is that coming from brands that have been growing slower and having them rebound a bit? Or is that coming from other brands? 
David Kimbell: I'd say, generally speaking, and I'm not going to get real specific on any individual brand, but generally speaking, some of the brands that were not performing to our expectations in Q1 carried through Q2, with some exceptions. But overall, there's a few brands that have hit a bit of a lull. The ones that I called out earlier, IT, Tarte, Too Faced, Benefit are brands that have either been performing well all year or we're excited about and seeing promising results on key innovations. So those brands, we're working closely on -- with them to make sure that they're getting back on track. And as I said, for many of them, we're seeing some positive signals. And then the other brands that we're bringing in are complementing our overall assortment. Our guests are responding well to them. So collectively, both existing brands and new brands, we think, will get that key part, our prestige cosmetics part of the business back to where we'd like it to be. 
Michael Goldsmith: Great. And then you spoke about the growth in e-commerce, and that's come from brands available only online or in limited distribution in the stores. So what's the online sales mix between these products and those that are in the stores? And then how do you expect that to evolve over time? 
David Kimbell: Well, I mean, think it really varies. Obviously, there's a group of brands that we've mentioned that are online-only that we haven't brought into stores yet. We use that often as a testing ground. I'll give you one example, Dose of Colors, that started online, so obviously 100% online, and now, we're rolling that into hundreds of our stores and it's seen nice success with that. Brand like MAC, which we launched last year, because of the pace of the rollout into stores started out heavier as a percentage online. But as more stores have grown, of course, that has gone to a different balance. So it varies across the board, and there isn't one kind of specific model. It really depends on the brand and its history and how we're rolling it out across our channels. 
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back to Mary Dillon for closing remarks. 
Mary Dillon: Great. I'd like to wrap up by thanking all of the Ulta Beauty associates. They delivered another solid quarter and executed a number of complex projects to enhance our guest experience to set us up for a strong second half of the year. So I look forward to speaking with all of you soon. Thank you. 
Operator: This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.

===== 2018 Q1  (2018-05-31 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Greetings, and welcome to the Ulta Beauty First Quarter 2018 Earnings Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Ms. Laurel Lefebvre, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please proceed. 
Laurel Lefebvre: Thank you. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us for Ulta Beauty's First Quarter 2018 Conference Call. Hosting the call are Mary Dillon, Chief Executive Officer; and Scott Settersten, Chief Financial Officer. Also joining us is Dave Kimbell, Chief Merchandising and Marketing Officer. 
 Before we begin, I'd like to remind you of the company's safe harbor language. The statements contained in this conference call which are not historical facts may be deemed to constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual future results may differ materially from those projected in such statements due to a number of risks and uncertainties, all of which are described in the company's filings with the SEC. We make references during this call to non-GAAP earnings growth and margin rates in Q1 of 2018, adjusted for the impact of the lower tax rate and the new revenue recognition accounting standard. [Operator Instructions] I'll now turn the call over to Mary. 
Mary Dillon: Thank you, Laurel. Good afternoon, everyone. 
 2018 is off to a strong start with better-than-expected sales and earnings growth, reflecting our highly differentiated business model that continues to drive healthy retail same-store sales, excellent new store productivity and continued outperformance of our e-commerce business. 
 To recap our first quarter financial results. The Ulta Beauty team delivered 17.4% top line growth. Comp sales growth was 8.1% on top of 14.3% comps in the first quarter of 2017. This performance was driven by balanced transaction and ticket growth, the successful reset of our mass cosmetics assortment and continued strength in skincare, fragrance and prestige boutique brands. 
 Diluted earnings per share of $2.70 grew 31.7%. These results reflect continued market share gains across all major categories as well as steady progress on our strategic imperatives. 
 I'll update you on some of our key accomplishments, starting with our loyalty program and brand awareness. At the end of the first quarter, the Ultamate Rewards loyalty program boasted 28.6 million active members, up 17% year-over-year. The loyalty program continues to grow rapidly as we add benefits and enhance our CRM capabilities to make it even more relevant and personalized while our store teams remained focused on converting new guests into highly engaged members. Results from the newer elements of our loyalty program, including the elite diamond tier and our credit card program, continued to exceed our expectations. 
 Our gift card sales increased by 45% in the first quarter driven by strong sales in all channels, including rapid growth through third-party distribution. In 2018, we expect continued growth in gift card sales as we add about 15,000 more doors of distributions through our third-party partners. This continues to be an area of emphasis for us because our analysis demonstrates that gift cards are driving significant incremental sales and margin dollars. 
 During the quarter, our marketing team focused on programs to support the Ulta Beauty Collection, spring newness and our signature 21 Days Of Beauty promotion. We leveraged digital partnerships and PR to elevate and position the Ulta Beauty Collection as a contemporary and trend-right brand. This included partnering with Cosmopolitan to execute a new first-to-market video series with Cosmo editor, Carly Cardellino, and Shoppable Facebook posts. 
 To celebrate spring newness, we increased our focus on digital and social, with partnerships with Bustle, POPSUGAR and Refinery29 as well as streaming audio with Spotify and Pandora. 
 For 21 Days Of Beauty, we launched a partnership with Waze, the crowdsourcing navigation app, and drove navigations to the store via branded pins and takeovers. We also partnered with Bustle's Instagram story series, driving 1.5 million views. Another innovation was to incorporate influencer tutorials with Shoppable content to promote 21 Days Of Beauty Daily steals through videos and GIFs paired with Shoppable products. 
 Overall, our media spend is shifting more into digital, streaming audio and streaming television to align with the beauty enthusiasts' digital-first lifestyle. Now these marketing programs are supporting the high levels of brand awareness we achieved last year. Aided awareness for the first quarter was at 90% compared to 87% a year ago, and unaided awareness rose 7 points to 53% compared to 46% last year. These levels jumped to 92% and 58%, respectively, for the month of April, in concert with our comprehensive marketing plan around 21 Days Of Beauty. 
 Now turning to merchandising. I mentioned strength in mass cosmetics, prestige skincare, fragrance and prestige boutique brands, but smaller categories such as sun care and bath also delivered robust growth. 
 Mass cosmetics, after a significant step up in its growth rate in the fourth quarter accelerated further in the first quarter, reflecting a major reflow of the categories completed earlier in the year. This reflow highlights several new brands including direct-to-consumer brands Morphe and ColourPop, which are available in a retail environment-only at Ulta Beauty. We plan to expand Morphe to all doors later this quarter from about half of our stores currently. 
 We have continued opportunity to expand other best-selling brands in additional stores throughout the year. We continue to drive very strong growth with the prestige boutique brands, which are contributing about 1/3 of our overall comp. We've added 132 of the planned 675 new boutiques featuring MAC, Clinique, Lancôme and Benefit so far this year. The performance of the prestige cosmetics category, excluding those 4 boutique brands is still a bit mixed with some brands overperforming while others had a more muted growth result. 
 The top performers include Tarte, which builds on success of the Shape Tape line with a strong foundation launch during the quarter, Estée Lauder and NARS, which continue to roll out into additional doors and benefit from guest interest in their classic products and their new launches, and Anastasia, which benefited from significant newness and the highest volume beauty steal during our 21 Days Of Beauty event. 
 One of the most exciting new brands is Chanel Beauté, which is off to a terrific start in the first few stores. We and the brand are so pleased with the early result that we're now planning to accelerate the number of stores this year compared to our initial expectation. 
 Another addition coming later this quarter to our prestige cosmetics assortment is a new brand called Flesh. This is a color cosmetics brand developed by Linda Wells, Chief Creative Officer of Revlon and Founder and Former Editor-in-Chief of Allure Magazine. Flesh is Revlon's newest foray into prestige beauty, and Ulta Beauty will be the first to exclusively launch this brand. Offering 40 shades of foundation, the brand stands for diversity and inclusivity. In addition to the wide shade range, this new line offers vibrant pops of color that encourage self-expression. 
 Both fragrance and skincare continued to comp above the house as well. Driving the fragrance business were newness, strength in men's fragrances and a successful Mother's Day Gifts with Purchase campaign. Prestige skincare also benefit from significant newness from Dermalogica, First Aid Beauty and Juice Beauty as well as stellar growth from Mario Badescu as social media buzz continues to propel that business. 
 We also continue to enhance our haircare assortment and rolled out Bumble and Bumble chain-wide in April and launched Keracolor online and in 800 doors, which is an innovative color-infusing conditioning cleanser. 
 New brands like Bumble and bumble, Drybar and [ Clash ], combined with high-growth brands like Pravana, Joico and DevaCurl, continue to support healthy comps and market share gains in the salon haircare category. Overall, we're encouraged by the opportunities we have with our brand partners to evolve our assortment and continue to add new brands and products to delight our guests. 
 Now moving on to our services business. Salon sales increased 10.1% and comped 3.2%, driven by average ticket increases. During the quarter, we rolled out our services optimization model to our central region. This initiative is designed to transform our services business by attracting, growing and retaining high-quality talent and delivering guest satisfaction better than ever before. This includes updates to our menu, pricing, career development and compensation models as well as additional education and support for our salon teams. We continue to see increases in sales, guest satisfaction, rebooking rates, associate satisfaction, improved hiring and reduced turnover. We plan to introduce the new model to additional regions in August and complete the rollout to the entire chain in 2019. 
 The salon team also participated this year in America's Beauty Show in April, which is one of the biggest events in the salon industry, and plans to participate in additional industry events to position The Salon at Ulta Beauty as the beauty destination for service and retail. These events help us attract top talent, create brand awareness and gain industry credibility. Also, our salon pro team entered the 2018 North American Hairstyling Awards and secured 9 nominations in the finals for multiple hair categories. These prestigious awards celebrate hair artistry and are very meaningful within the stylists community and help us attract top talent to the salon. This demonstrates our continued commitment to leading the industry in trend and motivating and inspiring our 8,000 stylists nationwide. 
 Turning to skin services. We've rolled out our latest skincare service model in 22 stores. This new model, called The Skin Bar at Ulta Beauty, offers quicker services and is designed to meet the demands of our guests' busy lifestyle. Our licensed skin therapists provide guests with skin diagnosis and personalized recommendations for a proper at-home skincare routine. The Skin Bar also expands its space for skincare brands by up to 12 feet of incremental retail space so we can continue to evolve our product assortment. We plan to roll out 180 Skin Bars this year in new and remodeled or refreshed stores. 
 And now moving on to store expansion. We opened up 34 stores in the first quarter and closed 1, ending the quarter with 1,107 stores. New store productivity continues to be very healthy, reflecting excellent site selection as well as the more significant presence of prestige brand boutiques in newer stores. And if you're calculating new store productivity for the quarter, note that we opened 6 of these 34 stores on the last day of the quarter. 
 Comps in older stores remained positive as many mature stores are benefiting from new brands like MAC and Clinique rolling out to refreshed stores. 
 Now to update you on our e-commerce business. ulta.com sales grew 48%, maintaining strong momentum and representing 10% of total company sales. E-commerce contributed 340 basis points of our total company comp driven by transaction growth. Total site traffic rose 38% while mobile traffic was up 52%. Better-than-expected growth came from strong response online to our 21 Days Of Beauty event, continued success of ulta.com-only offers like our weekly beauty breaks and programs like fragrance crush, spotlighting a favorite fragrance each month, and our newest program, Skin-fatuation, which focuses on a key skincare trend each month such as masks, oils and naturals. We also continued to see significant growth in e-commerce from brands that are available only online or in limited distribution in stores as well as from growing use of our store-to-door initiative that allows customers to purchase items online while shopping at our stores to be delivered to their home. Recent addition of online-only brands include Storybook Cosmetics, Sugarbearhair vitamin, men's line like Frederick Benjamin and Fatboy, Korean brands including Too Cool For School, TPSY, IPKN, Wish Formula and Touch In Sol, as well as influencer brands like Dominique Cosmetics. Our store, e-commerce, IT and supply chain teams are working very closely to launch a test of buy online, pick up in store later this year as we continue to enhance our omnichannel capabilities. 
 And lastly, we also improved our GLAM LAB try-on app to make it easy for guests to filter and sort by brand, color, finish and form factor. This capability helps guests find products to try on and purchase quickly and easily. 
 And finally, I'll touch on our supply chain operations. Our overall performance of our supply chain operations remained very strong as we continue to leverage recent investments and capabilities that support our growth and enhance the guest experience. While we invested in inventory to support comp growth, maintaining strong end-to-end stock levels and supporting brand expansions and new product launches, we were able to capture efficiencies within our network. Inventory per door was down 3%, reflecting improvement in inventory management from the systems and tools we've implemented recently, such as SWIFT, as well as a clearance event late in the quarter to sell through inventory related to seasonal items or transitioning planograms.
 Our newest West Coast distribution in Fresno is on track. We've completed all construction activities and have started to receive inbound shipments. We plan to start shipping outbound to retail stores and e-commerce guests this summer, which will help us achieve our goal of delivering orders in 3 days or less for more than 95% of our e-commerce sales by year-end. 
 Last quarter, we mentioned that among the investments we'll accelerate in 2018 was the optimization of our supply chain network. This entails, among other initiatives, the recently announced closure of our Phoenix distribution center next spring. Closing any facility that impacts our valued associates is never an easy decision but the right thing to do for our business needs. And we're proceeding with the closing with great care for our people. This step is part of our multiyear supply chain evolution as we continue to find ways to increase efficiencies, drive operational improvement and improve our overall supply chain to better serve our guests and meet the needs of our growing store base as well as the rapid expansion of our e-commerce business. 
 And with that, I'll turn it over to Scott to discuss in more detail the drivers of our first quarter financials and our outlook for the second quarter and the rest of the year. 
Scott Settersten: Thank you, Mary. Good afternoon, everyone. Starting with the income statement. Top line growth of 17.4% was driven by an 8.1% comp and strong new store productivity. The new revenue recognition accounting added about $14 million of revenue. This represents the impact of income from our credit card program and gift card breakage moving up to the revenue line as well as e-commerce revenue now being recognized upon shipment versus our previous accounting method whereby revenue was based on delivery of merchandise to the guest. These items are partly offset by the value of points earned in our loyalty program now deducted from sales. Note that our retail comparable sales number was not impacted by the revenue recognition change. 
 Traffic and ticket for the total company remained strong with a 5.1% gain in transactions and a 3 percentage increase in average ticket. The retail-only comp of 4.8% was made up of 2.1% traffic and a 2.7% ticket increase. Ticket was driven by average selling price with units lapped. Including the salon comp of 3.2%, the combined retail salon comp was 4.7%. 
 Turning to margins. GAAP gross profit leveraged 10 basis points. The new revenue recognition accounting added about 50 basis points to the gross profit line. So the underlying roughly 40 basis points of deleverage was attributed to a combination of higher mix of e-commerce sales, a higher mix of sales from prestige brand boutiques and mass cosmetics relative to higher-margin categories, investments in our salon business and modest supply chain deleverage as we ramp up Fresno, offset by leverage of rent and occupancy expenses. Retail-only margin rate was roughly flat year-over-year as we ran 1 postcard offer this quarter compared to 2 smaller events last year, and we ran a clearance event at the end of the quarter to exit with very clean inventories. 
 Moving on to SG&A. We deleveraged by 80 basis points, of which 70 were due to the new revenue recognition accounting. The remaining 10 basis points of deleverage were attributed to a higher store payroll expense, primarily related to the prestige boutique expansion, offset by corporate overhead and marketing expense leverage. This performance demonstrates solid expense management as well as the result of some planned dollars for investments in growth initiatives that were pushed later in the year. 
 Operating margin was 13.6% of sales, and it was down 70 basis points, as expected, from last year's Q1 result of 14.3%, with 20 basis points coming from the revenue recognition accounting change. The tax rate of 22.1% was lower than the expected 24% effective tax rate due to the impact from income tax accounting for share-based compensation. This contributed about $0.07 to Q1 earnings per share. 
 Diluted EPS increased 31.7%, with about 17 points of growth from the lower tax rate and 3 points from the lower year-over-year share count as we return value to shareholders through our repurchase program. Excluding $0.07 from the lower-than-expected tax rate due to the share-based compensation, earnings per share came in about $0.15 higher than the high end of our guidance. About half can be attributed to better-than-expected sales, both from comparable stores and new stores. The remainder is a combination of some planned expenses shifting into later quarters and a bit more favorability than usual from a number of smaller line items, such as a modest benefit from insurance recoveries from last year's hurricane-related losses. 
 Moving on to the balance sheet and cash flow. Total inventory grew 8.4% but was down 3% on a per-store basis, well below comparable sales growth. With the opening of the new DC in Fresno, we expect to see inventory per door growth step up the next couple of quarters as we ramp up inventory in the DC before it goes live in August. But we expect per door growth to be well below our comp for the full year. 
 Capital expenditures were $74 million for the quarter driven by our new store opening program, investments in systems, prestige boutiques, merchandise fixtures and supply chain. We ended the quarter with $469.1 million in cash and short-term investments. We continue to repurchase shares through our 10b5-1 program, buying back 618,551 shares at a cost of $133 million during the first quarter. $529 million remained available on the $625 million authorization as of quarter-end. 
 Turning now to guidance for the second quarter and full year. For the second quarter of 2018, we expect sales to be in the range of $1.475 billion to $1.488 billion versus $1.29 billion last year. We expect comparable sales to increase in the range of 6% to 7% versus 11.7% last year. E-commerce sales are expected to grow in the 40% range. 
 We plan to open approximately 20 new stores in the second quarter compared to 18 in Q2 of last year. Q2 preopening expense is expected to be relatively flat as a rate of sales. Diluted earnings per share are expected to be in the range of $2.35 to $2.40 versus $1.83 last year. And operating margin is planned to deleverage, including about 20 basis points from the new revenue recognition accounting, similar to what you saw in the first quarter. 
 The tax rate for Q2 is expected to be 24%. This does not include any assumptions for the tax rate impact of share-based compensation accounting, which is difficult to forecast. Our fully diluted share count is estimated at 60.7 million. 
 In terms of the full year, most of the elements of our full year guidance remain the same. But we are modestly raising our earnings per share outlook for the full year 2018 to flow through a portion of our better-than-expected EPS performance in the first quarter. We plan to open approximately 100 new stores. All are 10,000 square foot prototypes. We'll complete 15 remodel and relocation projects. We expect to grow e-commerce approximately 40%. We anticipate top line growth in the low teens, including the impact of the 53rd week last year. Total company comps are expected to be in the 6% to 8% range with the retail comp in the mid-single digits. We now expect to grow earnings per share in the low 20s percentage range on a GAAP basis, including the extra week in 2017, up modestly from prior guidance of approximately 20%. We anticipate capital expenditures of approximately $375 million. Depreciation is forecasted at approximately $290 million. We expect to repurchase shares in the 500 million range for the year, and the annual tax rate for the remainder of the year is expected to be 24%. 
 And with that, I'll turn it over to our conference call host for Q&A. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Rupesh Parikh from Oppenheimer & Co. 
Rupesh Parikh: So Mary, I was hoping to touch more on some of your comments on the prestige cosmetics category. As you guys look at the balance of the year, just want to get your thoughts on what you're seeing from a newness perspective and whether you expect any improvements on the underperforming brands that you called out during the quarter? 
Mary Dillon: Okay. Thank you, Rupesh, and I'm going to tag team this with Dave, since he's so -- that much closer to all the exciting things coming. I'll tell you, first of all, I would just say, this quarter, I think, is a good example of the strength of our business model, our team and our business model, where we were able to deliver the kind of results that we just described despite the fact that there was a lull in a few key brands within prestige cosmetics, which is a very significant category, and a lot of strength across all the other categories that we participate in. So prestige cosmetics is obviously very important to us, driving a large percentage of our business, so we're very focused on it. So I'll ask Dave to just add some more thoughts on the rest of the year. 
David Kimbell: Yes. We were confident about the rest of the year. We really look comprehensively across our portfolio to make sure that we're pushing on all angles. I think there's -- it starts with our biggest brands and some of them have been struggling. Mary mentioned a few that have been really working quite well. Tarte, Anastasia, being a couple of those, and we expect those to continue with great newness. But other brands, as we look at their newness over the rest of the year, we're confident and excited about some of the products they're bringing, including some exclusive lines that you'll only find at Ulta, and we'll be sharing more details about those as we get later into the year. We'll also be expanding door count on key prestige brands that Mary talked about. Our boutique brands, MAC, Lancôme, Clinique, but also NARS, Estée Lauder and a small increase in the number of doors of Chanel as well. So we'll see that contributing. Exclusive brands do play an important role for us, and we're excited about the amount of exclusivity that we'll see over the rest of the year. We've had big success with a few brands that we've already talked to you about like Tarte Double Duty Beauty, innovation within that portfolio already this year has had an impact. We expect that to continue throughout the rest of the year. And Mary mentioned a new line that we're launching later this quarter, Flesh, that is exclusive to Ulta. And then finally, I'd say the -- as we look across the prestige landscape, there's definitely changing dynamics as some of the big brands face new competitors from smaller independent brands, and we're having a lot of success with those and rolling those out across our portfolio. We see Dose of Colors being one brand that started small, and we're rapidly expanding that. Brands like Storybook, Beauty by POPSUGAR, Dominique Cosmetics, which is online-only right now, then also brand like Morphe, which kind of spans in between kind of mass and prestige from a pricing and engagement standpoint. So we're taking a holistic push across all aspects of the portfolio and are optimistic about the collective impact of those changes throughout the rest of the year. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Matt Fassler from Goldman Sachs. 
Matthew Fassler: My question, and I know you want to restrict this to one, relates to some of the new mass exclusives that you spoke about introducing and that we've seen in the stores. I guess my question relates to the economics of those ads. Can you talk about the margin of the mass-exclusive products. You talked about Morphe for example, talk about the margin profile of that product versus a prestige and versus your typical mass product. And also it's an exclusive but there's no boutique cost associated with it as you have from some of your prestige ads. So what impact as these grow presumably do you expect them to have in the profitability of the business? 
Mary Dillon: Matt, I'll just say, you're right that an example of like Morphe doesn't have a boutique associated with it. But we don't break out the margin of any specific brand. And really, it's kind of a mixture. I mean, some -- I think, in general, prestige products tend to have somewhat of a higher margin. There's plenty of exceptions to that as well as some -- we feel like we are very focused on the profitability of the total box when we think about brands that we bring in across every category. So there's going to be a mixture of profitability, but all we think adding to the profitability of the business. So can't give more color than that. But the great thing is that participating, as Dave said, across so many aspects of the beauty industry with innovation and newness and exclusivity is really driving great growth for us as well. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of David Schick from Consumer Edge Research. 
David Schick: Very quickly, just wanted to understand the wage outlook we're seeing in certain markets with a little more wage growth. Is anything changing in your outlook there over the next couple of years? 
Mary Dillon: Yes. I would say, I mean, we certainly see some wage pressures like everybody does on the coast and larger urban areas, and we would expect it to be sort of a modest headwind going forward. So we're competitive. We've taken some of the investments around -- from the tax reform to make our benefits and wages a little bit more competitive. But we look at this very closely. We look out, we factor it into our business model and expect that to play out as planned. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Binetti from Crédit Suisse. 
Michael Binetti: Quickly, can I make sure I understand the gross margin dynamics in the first quarter? I think you said that retail gross margin was flat. But you did have one less sale event in the quarter compared to last year. So I want to make sure that I got that right, and maybe -- I don't know if you can put any context to how big that impact was. And then I guess just the dynamics impacting gross margin as we go forward through the year. I think you pointed to e-com and the prestige brand rollouts as being headwinds. Are there points on the horizon where the inflection -- there's an inflection in the leverage on those? Or are those dynamics present as we go forward through the year? 
Scott Settersten: Yes. Thanks for the question, Michael. Well, maybe we'll just kind of step back and look at the bigger picture here. So again, there's a lot of things kind of flexing back and forth between the gross profit line and SG&A with the revenue recognition piece there. If I think about operating margin in totality for the year, I mean, we guided 50 to 70 basis points down, and we feel like we're right on target with what we expect for the full year. So Q1, the net 70 basis points down versus last year I think was a little better than we expected. Again, we had slightly stronger sales trends than we planned, and then we had some of the planned expenses that we pointed to in our remarks that got pushed back further in the year. So again, a slightly better result there than we expected. As we look out to the rest of the year, I would say you could probably plan for slightly higher deleverage point in the second quarter, not feeling quite as bullish with the sales in the second quarter, I think. 21 Days Of Beauty is our signature event. It was fantastic overall. So again, we don't have another one of those in the second quarter. Although we expect the events to perform as well as we look ahead, we're going to have the Fresno DC continue to ramp up here in the second quarter, so you're going to see a full expense load there. But we don't actually turn it on, so to speak, until August, which falls into the third quarter. So that will be a headwind as well. And then we'll see more of these tax savings ramp up the spend of those in the second quarter as the teams become more mobilized. So I'd say the second quarter is probably the toughest for us. And then as we look at the back half of the year, I would think the deleverage starts to moderate so it gets us back into that 50 to 70 basis points range for the full year. Dave spoke to the prestige, newness coming in the back half of the year that we're confident we'll hit well. Fresno impact will moderate as it starts servicing stores, and then of course, in the fourth quarter, we should get some sales leverage on those expenses as well. So there's always going to be a mix of things on the gross profit line in and out, quarter-to-quarter, we pointed to the clearance event that we ran opportunistically at the end of the first quarter. That was something that we just looked at, and we said we're better off in the long term to try to move through some of this inventory in a disciplined manner. So that would be my answer. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Steven Forbes with Guggenheim Securities. 
Steven Forbes: So you mentioned how some of the prestige cosmetics brands are facing greater competition. So maybe just touch on how your relationships with these vendors are evolving, especially as you start to better capitalize on the data from your membership base, right, your Ultamate Rewards membership base? And whether you foresee that translating into kind of a strengthening of that vendor-retailer relationship over time and then more kind of access to the exclusive lines as you look out to 2019 and '20. Is it something that we're early on as you think about that cycle evolving? 
David Kimbell: Yes. One, we take our relationships very seriously. We're proud of the partnerships that we've built over years, and I would call them very healthy and I think strengthening every day as our business continues to grow and we provide, I think, a great opportunity for brands to reach new consumers and to grow their business. So that's something that we work very hard on. You mentioned data and insights. And that's something that we're -- we feel like we're getting even better at providing and developing insights that both help our brand partners understand the dynamics of consumers within our environment but also help us identify growth opportunities, whitespace and new areas to evolve our assortment to make sure we're meeting the evolving needs of our guests. So insights, data understanding, is something that we're working hard on. And while we feel like we've accomplished a lot, there's a lot more we think we can do in there. As far as access to exclusivity, we've had quite a bit of that. It's an important part. It's not the only part. We have a lot of success with brands that are sold at some of our competitors. But exclusivity is important, one, because it does drive growth for us but our customers, importantly, our customers expect that from us. They get excited about it, and that's a real motivating reason for them to come in and discover what's new and only at Ulta. So we've had quite a few of those over the last few years. I mentioned a few just in my comments a few minutes ago, and I would anticipate us getting more of those over time as our environment evolves, our customer count grows and our contribution to brand growth continues to be strong. And so we see plenty more of that coming. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Joe Altobello from Raymond James. 
Joseph Altobello: So just want to try to understand, I guess, the comp guidance a little bit better and maybe more the comp cadence for this year. Obviously, for the full year, you're still up 6% to 8%, that's despite the outperformance in the first quarter. And I think the expectation coming into this quarter was this was the toughest quarter of the year for you and that we would see some acceleration throughout the year because of easier compares, because of merchandising activity, et cetera. So I'm just curious why are we going to see a deceleration in the second quarter and then an acceleration in the second half? Is it something that you guys saw in May that caused you to kind of take a step back for the second quarter? 
Mary Dillon: Joe, it's Mary. I'll give a start here, which is that, I guess, first of all, I'd say, as you said, we're guiding 6% to 7% in the quarter. We try to take a prudent view of sales. And we have some visibility into the quarter because we're in it. So we just try to really be prudent about what we expect and guide the best we can. We continue to see, of course, the strength that we just described in the first quarter in mass and prestige skin, prestige boutique brands, fragrance, excited by the pipeline of newness. But that is still somewhat offset by the persistent challenges in prestige cosmetics. So I feel -- my stance is let's wait until we see inflection in prestige in some key brands before we start to get more aggressive. You're right that we also have easier compares in the second half, but we'll get more aggressive if we think that's appropriate. 
Joseph Altobello: Okay. So there's nothing in May that caused you to get a little bit more nervous about the comp. 
Mary Dillon: No. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Steph Wissink from Jefferies. 
Stephanie Schiller Wissink: Our question, Mary and Scott, is regarding the supply chain progression. I think Mary, you mentioned that advances are strong. You're seeing some improvement in inventory per door. But can you talk a little bit about how we progress towards leverage on the warehouse and logistics network? Once Fresno comes online, does that inch us closer to a point of leverage? And then also on the e-com. Can you talk a little bit about closing that contribution margin gap over the next couple of years? 
Scott Settersten: Well, I guess we could start with the supply chain question. So again, I think we've shared with you historically that there's a multiyear road map that's been built very sophisticated by our supply chain team. And so it's a multiple-pronged driven program, Phoenix being a recent outcome of some of that planning. Fresno helps us get a lot closer to our end customers in the California market, which is a very important market for us. I mean, we expect that business to continue to grow at a high rate for the foreseeable future. So that's a key element of what we're planning. There's still a number of, what I'd call, older legacy facilities that we're running. So we're running 2 different IT platforms to execute in those buildings. So that's all part and parcel of what we're thinking about the long term and how we optimize the footprint and the network and all that goes with that over the long term. So we're nowhere near close to being finished with the plan, I guess, I would say on that. And then as far as the e-commerce contribution to the business overall and closing the gap there, profitability, again, I wanted -- this is a good place to remind folks, right, that we've talked about this, consistently talked about the geography challenge that we have with our e-commerce business. It is a headwind. Yes, we know that. We've communicated it clearly. Gross profit rate does get impacted with e-commerce business in a negative way, but we make up a lot of that on the SG&A line by leveraging some significant investments in technology and people that we've made over the last few years. So on a net basis, it's not that big of a gap between a retail sale and an e-commerce sale. And I remind folks that those e-commerce sales are largely incremental sales and margin dollars, right? So it's a good thing for our business. And we -- by building Fresno for example, getting closer to the end customer, helps transportation cost, helps the model overall. So we're confident that over time we're going to continue to close the gap there. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Oliver Chen from Cowen and Company. 
Oliver Chen: Regarding the future in terms of product categories. What are your thoughts on the mix that you'd like to see between cosmetics, skincare and hair as you look to really continue to build a really fortified, diversified model? And on the application on Ultamate Rewards, I think you've been really creative and personalized with a lot of the promotions and the connectivity with customers. What are your thoughts on the future use of data and how you can continue to innovate in terms of running interesting promotions that make sense for brand health and are engaging to customers and creative? 
Mary Dillon: Oliver, all that sounds like a very good idea. I agree. I mean, really, we're quite pleased with the Ultamate Rewards program on many levels, right? The size, the scope, the growth, the engagement that our guests have, how much is driving our sales, right? And I feel very good about our team's ability to leverage insights and data to get that much more personalized and relevant. And that's kind of what it's all about. Having said that, we absolutely understand that there's more to be done as it relates to AI capabilities that we're building and investing in and going to continue to, to make sure that we are as advanced as we can be in terms of being as relevant, personalized. It's all about how do you drive demand in a way that's as efficient as possible and personalization is what that's all about. In terms of categories, I guess we always like to kind of see where the customer will take us. So you mentioned cosmetics, skincare, hair. I mean, the core categories that we're in today, I believe, we'll always be in, right? The beauty of our model, this All Things Beauty, we are in the categories that guests care about. And even categories that are, I guess, smaller like sun care and bath are examples of categories we're driving innovation and profitability and share growth. So generally, I'd say the mix of sort of mass and prestige, if you want to say that, and I think that continues to evolve in terms of the way that guests look at it, the general mix is probably right and somewhat going to be the same. But the products, the brands and innovation, exclusives underneath that will continue to evolve. So that's how we would envision the model for many years to come. 
Oliver Chen: Should you acquire brands? Is that on the table in terms of priorities? Or is it not necessarily the right priorities relative to the opportunities you have? And the Ulta brand itself is interesting in terms of your own private label and what you can do there to make it more emotional and functional. 
Mary Dillon: Right. Oliver, I consider that the second or third question. Yes, Ulta Beauty Collection, really proud about that, and you're absolutely right. We continue to elevate everything about that brand, and we like how it's performing. Can we buy a brand? Sure. I mean, we could. We haven't. And I think for us right now, the focus is around partnering with innovators, companies large and small that want to work with us to drive distribution of their brands. So for now, that's our focus. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Mike Baker from Deutsche Bank. 
Michael Baker: The increase in gift cards, I presume, with the accounting but even under old accounting, you don't necessarily recognize gift card sales until people come in to redeem that. So can the big growth in gift card sales be thought of as a leading indicator for sales that are going to come later in the year as people redeem those gift cards? 
David Kimbell: Yes, we see -- we do think that that's going to continue to grow. Mary talked about just the distribution expansion. And yes, when we sell a gift card, we see her come pretty quickly within the next couple of months typically. And the great aspect of our gift card business is not only the redemption of the card value itself, but typically, we see her spend more than that in our stores. So not only do those sales today translate -- the gift card sales today translate into future sales, it tends to get her more engaged. And in many cases, it's introducing a new customer to Ulta Beauty, dependent on where that gift go. So a lot of positivity on that. We are really pleased with the performance. We expanded that quite a bit going into holiday and saw strong results coming out of holiday gift period. But we're seeing that continue and sustain and anticipate that being a positive driver of our top line sales throughout the balance of this year. 
Michael Baker: And I guess natural follow-up, part of the same question is, is that pick up that you just described included already in your guidance? 
David Kimbell: Yes. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Mark Astrachan from Stifel. 
Mark Astrachan: I wanted to ask just broadly on promotion. It seems like they've just sort of been increasing across the category where historically there just hasn't been as much promotion particularly perhaps in prestige. I guess curious how you think about levels of promotions going forward relative to the current base? And sort of related to that, if you could comment on just how you think about the transaction component of comp given the modest slowdown there, I guess sort of how those 2 pieces would fit together, that'd be helpful. 
Scott Settersten: Yes, thanks for the question. So let me start with this one because I want to make sure that we get this on the record. So we're talking about gross profit and operating margin deleverage here for the first quarter, operating margin specifically. But I just want to be clear that that's not being driven by product margins, right? So we pointed to retail product margins being roughly flat year-over-year. And that's 85% plus of our business, right? So we have to keep that in mind. Keeping it flat year-over-year in light of what's going on in the department stores sector right now and the dynamics in the prestige color business, we consider that a huge win for our enterprise overall. The clearance event we called out, that was one contributing factor but a very small one in the big scheme of things. And again, that was the best thing to do for the business in the long term. We believe that there's probably way too much time and attention being invested in attempting to track the number promotional offers each quarter and trying to read through that on the impact to gross profit. I mean, the fact of the matter is we see reports quite often that place a lot of weight on a very limited view into only one element of our overall promotional toolbox. And that being primarily the 20% off postcard, right? So you guys -- nobody's taking into account all the other promotional things that we do, that are part and parcel of our everyday business. Things around merchandising discounts and offers and our circulars and, of course, the loyalty program, right? That's another part of the discount equation that we use, right, to kind of mitigate some of these things. So we're always going into this with a very balanced view. And an important part of what makes Ulta unique in retail is the variety of tools that we have at our disposal and our ability to be very flexible and deploy those in a timely manner and in a very financially disciplined way. So looking ahead, we've talked about the long-term view for us is to focus more on loyalty and CRM and making sure that it's more personalized and targeted offers as we look ahead. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Goldsmith from UBS. 
Michael Goldsmith: It seems that a number of retailers from the mass players and the department stores are rethinking of renovating their beauty department. You have a unique app with a number of capabilities such as GLAM LAB, which is a differentiator. How do you think you stand in terms of what the customer is looking for in the customer experience in omnichannel retailer? Is there anything that you feel like you're missing? You called out buy online, pick up in store as a test later in the year. Is there anything else either in store or digital? 
Mary Dillon: Yes, I would say broadly speaking, you're absolutely right, that the beauty category is a pretty competitive one, right? So in some ways, we compete with a lot of players. In other ways, we really -- nobody does what we do. We call this All Things Beauty, All in One Place, our model. It's differentiated. It's distinct because of the variety of categories and price points. The fact that there is services at our store, right, so brows, skincare, makeup services and really robust e-commerce platform all supported by our loyalty program. And I think increasingly sophisticated use of data and use of social media and digital, our marketing campaigns have really continued to evolve in that way as well. So I guess we feel that we've got -- we're not perfect, and we're not complacent, but a relevant model. And the reason we think it's really relevant and it has lots of relevancy for the future is we're focused on the segment of shopper that we call the beauty enthusiast. And that shopper is a large and growing segment of beauty, and she's really focused on exactly what we offer, which is a lot of newness and excitement and experiences, and likes to shop in the way that we serve up the shopping experience. And that segment of shoppers is growing as we look at future demographics in growth around millennials, teenagers, Hispanics, so fast-growing segments of the population in the U.S. over indexed as beauty enthusiasts. And so we believe that our model is actually more relevant than ever for them, and our job is to really continue to innovate, think about what the shopping experience needs to look like 10 years from now versus today, right, because that's going to continue to evolve. And we feel really good about that. Full stop. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Ike Boruchow from Wells Fargo. 
Nancy Hilliker: This is Nancy on for Ike. Just a quick question. You mentioned you're prioritizing skincare and expanding that by, I think, 12 feet. Is there something that's taking the place of? Is that mass? Or is it other prestige items? And then also just a quick question. Are there any early learnings from your New York City store that you would share with us? 
Mary Dillon: Well, I'll just say the New York City store, we're really pleased with it. I'm thrilled that we have a store there. It's performing nicely. Lots of foot traffic in that store any time of the day or night that you go in there. So we think it was a really smart move for us. The skincare, I'm going to ask Dave to take it. I was referencing in my prepared remarks a skin express bar that we're putting into a small number of stores next year, and that's in those instances where the extra space will free up. 
David Kimbell: That's right. And that space comes from just a new layout of the skin bar that does free up more space for product. So your question what is it replacing? It's really just -- we're still offering skin services, but it's a more efficient use of that space and actually, we believe in the elevated experience in our store that we're really excited about. And as Mary said, it's in a limited number of doors today, but we're encouraged by the results of the skin bar. So then that extra space allows us to continue to expand our prestige skincare business. We've added a number of brands over the last few years, some big brands like Origins, Shiseido, proactiv. But also earlier this year, we launched several new smaller brands, Little Barn, Mamonde, [ Great Brays ], [ Cupari ] as well as a skincare -- men skincare brand, House 99 by David Beckham, and all of those are off to a great start. So a mix of both big established brands and new brands to fill that space. And there is -- and we're encouraged and positive about the results so far. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Erinn Murphy from Piper Jaffray. 
Erinn Murphy: My question is just following up on the competitive environment. On the Bon-Ton liquidation, can you speak to what you've noticed thus far for the stores that you have that colocate with Bon-Ton? And then is there anything baked into your guidance on potential share recapture once these stores close later in the year? 
David Kimbell: Yes. We're certainly watching that closely. We do have a trade area overlap with quite a few of their -- the stores that are closing. So we anticipate some opportunity there, and we're actually exploring different ways to reach that consumer that may be looking for a new beauty destination. And so we do see some opportunity. What we've noticed in other department store closings is yes, there is some opportunity there. But we're not anticipating an immediate flood of new customers. In some cases, store closings actually changed the dynamics of traffic, and so we'll adjust to that. But we're reaching out aggressively in those markets to make sure that we're seen as the best alternative. And in some cases, in some markets, we're really the only alternative for many of these brands. So yes, we do see opportunity. We would say that any upside there would be reflected in our guidance going forward, and we're looking to capture any upside in those markets going forward. 
Erinn Murphy: Okay. But any disruption on some of the liquidations? I believe they're promoting beauty roughly 10% to 15% depending on the location. So just curious on what you've seen thus far. 
Scott Settersten: Yes. We haven't seen any direct impacts to our business, but we're aware of that, and we're monitoring it. And we'll be quick to take action if we see any negative consequences. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Simeon Gutman from Morgan Stanley. 
Simeon Gutman: I'll be Simeon Gutman. My follow-up, Scott, is on the merch margin. If I heard right, you said that the retail merch margin came in flat, and I'm assuming that's excluding e-com both in terms of shipping and just the lower margin mix. I just want to clarify that. And then I guess did that play out as you'd expect? I think you said flattish for the year. I didn't know if there was any cadence that you had built in to your original guidance. 
Scott Settersten: No. I think you have the right take on it, Simeon. So the retail part of the business was flat. Yes, that excludes the impact that we see from the mix of the e-commerce part of the business but does include some of the other shifts that we're talking about, prestige versus mass versus some of the prestige brand boutiques. So again, we think we can manage that over the longer term. We've talked in the past about flattish merchandise margins in the assumption that over the long term in our plans, we're not expecting to see significant gains there. So we got headwinds that were -- that are a fact. We've got a lot of arrows in the quiver, so to speak, to try to mitigate a lot of that. It's private label kinds of things. It's continued benefits like we just saw on the first quarter with inventory, performance improvements to help drive leverage there over the long term. So we think we have a lot of nice tools to help us mitigate some of those challenges that we have. 
Simeon Gutman: And when you guided to merch margins flat, that was excluding the e-com business all along? Or was it including the e-com geography change? 
Scott Settersten: It includes it, primarily. We're looking at the business overall. So we're talking the long term, all of that's baked into the merch margin, definitely. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Christopher Horvers with JPMorgan. 
Christopher Horvers: So 2 quick ones. The other half of the $0.15 upside that wasn't driven by the sales beat, is that relatively balanced between expense items and the other items that you called out? And does most of that expense shift show up in the second quarter? 
Scott Settersten: I think it's a fair statement to say it's about 50-50. So let's call that $0.08. We said $0.15. Half was sales performance, call that $0.07. The other half just to be in the mix of unusual benefits that we saw come through in the first quarter and some deferred spending. So I'd say allocating that 50-50 is fair. I -- the timing of that, I mean, that's one place where we're trying to be purposely vague. So some of the deferred spending is on the innovation and marketing things. And we like to hold that in reserve and use it when necessary, right? So if it's not, we take it to the bottom line. But if it is, later in the year, we're going to use it as we see best. 
Christopher Horvers: Understood. And then just a follow-up on the retail product margins. As you look out into the back half of the year, you're going to anniversary some stepped-up coupon and promotions and such. Do you still expect that those retail product margins can expand in the back half? 
Scott Settersten: Yes. We're not counting on that. I mean again, to Mary's point here earlier, we're just being a little -- we're being prudent, which is what we always are. And let's see, I mean, prestige, the prestige color business is a big piece of the overall pie, and it has better margin rates than some of the other categories that we sell. So we want to see some improvement there, some marked improvement, before we get any more aggressive with our guidance. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Simeon Siegel with Nomura Instinet. 
Julie Kim: This is Julie Kim on for Simeon. Can you give color on the comp progression you saw in the quarter and if momentum has continued into Q2? Also if you saw any impacts from weather or the calendar shift in the quarter. 
Mary Dillon: I would say really no impact from weather and minimal impact on calendar shift. And the cadence was, as you saw, we had a balanced ticket traffic or transaction in tickets result for the quarter. We certainly see some increased movement around things like 21 Days Of Beauty and other events like that. So -- but pretty balanced, I guess I'd say throughout the quarter and consistent coming into this quarter as well. 
Scott Settersten: Yes. And we don't normally share anything about the current quarter that we're in. So we won't be able to provide any more detail on that. 
Julie Kim: And if I could just follow up, anything we should keep in mind looking for the rest of the year in terms of the calendar shift apart from Q4, of course. 
Scott Settersten: No, I guess we could clarify for folks, right? We're comparing weeks 1 through 52 last year, right, with 1 to 52 this year. So the 53rd week is kind of out of the equation. So just to be clear on that part of it. So again, for us, there's nothing really -- the way our events roll and the holidays roll into our calendar, there's nothing significant to be aware of. 
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back over to Mary Dillon for closing remarks. 
Mary Dillon: Thank you. And I just want to close by thanking our 37,000 associates. They've delivered a strong quarter, and the 2018 start is off very strongly. I have full confidence in our team's ability to execute our strategies and drive profitable growth in 2018 and beyond, and I look forward to speaking with all of you soon. Thank you. 
Operator: This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.

===== 2017 Q4  (2018-03-15 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Greetings, and welcome to the Ulta Beauty Fourth Quarter 2017 Earnings Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to hand over -- to introduce your host, Ms. Laurel Lefebvre, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please proceed. 
Laurel Lefebvre: Thank you. Good afternoon, and thanks for joining us for Ulta Beauty's Fourth Quarter 2017 Conference Call. Hosting our call are Mary Dillon, Chief Executive Officer; and Scott Settersten, Chief Financial Officer. Also joining us is Dave Kimbell, Chief Merchandising and Marketing Officer. 
 Before we begin, I'd like to remind you of the company's safe harbor language. The statements contained in this conference call, which are not historical facts, may be deemed to constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual future results may differ materially from those projected in such statements due to a number of risks and uncertainties, all of which are described in the company's filings with the SEC. 
 We make references during this call to non-GAAP sales and earnings growth in 2017, adjusted for the 53rd week, tax reform and one-time bonuses. [Operator Instructions] Also, we've gotten a few questions about our 2018 EPS guidance. And just to clarify, we expect to grow 2018 EPS approximately 20% off the 2017 GAAP EPS of $8.96. 
 With that, I'll turn it over to Mary. 
Mary Dillon: Great. Thank you, Laurel, and good afternoon, everyone. The Ulta Beauty team delivered excellent financial results in 2017 with an 11% comp on top of the 15.8% comp in 2016 and 37% GAAP earnings per share growth or 25% earnings per share adjusted for items primarily related to tax reform. However, the continued moderation in the growth rate of makeup, our largest category, made our fourth quarter a bit more challenging than expected. But nonetheless, we achieved strong sales and earnings growth in the fourth quarter while continuing to gain market share and make significant progress on our strategic imperatives. We grew the top line 22.6% or 15.7% adjusted for the 53rd week. Comp sales grew 8.8% on top of 16.6% comps in the fourth quarter of 2016, driven by positive traffic and ticket growth, a strong January and continued great momentum in e-commerce. Adjusted for tax reform benefits and onetime bonuses for hourly associates, earnings per share were up $2.75, up 23% compared to the fourth quarter of the prior year. 
 I'll be briefer than usual with our highlights for the fourth quarter in view of the complexity of tax rate impacts and our desire to provide a full discussion of the planned appointment of the benefits of the lower tax rate as well as the various cost pressures informing our view of 2018. 
 Starting with highlights on our loyalty program and brand awareness. The Ultamate Rewards loyalty program grew its membership 19% year-over-year to 27.8 million active members, driven by our store team's successful conversion efforts. We launched a new Diamond tier for our top guests who spend more than $1,200 per year with the goal of driving higher share of wallet with our best customers. The new program offers compelling benefits, including exclusive offers and even more points earned. The program launched 2 months ago and is off to a great start. 
 Our credit card program continues to perform well with new accounts at conversion above plan and ongoing evidence that we garner a higher share of wallet from guests who sign up for the card. We also drove rapid growth in gift card sales, up about 30% in the fourth quarter, in part driven by strong performance of our expanded Blackhawk partnership in supermarkets and other national retailers. 
 Our brand awareness metrics reached all-time high. We grew aided awareness to 91% compared to 86% a year ago, and unaided awareness rose 6 points to 55% from 49% last year. We are also proud to learn that Ulta was the most Googled beauty brand in 2017. 
 Moving on to merchandising. We continued to strengthen our partnerships with our brands and launched new and coveted brands across all of our categories. While the Black Friday, Cyber Monday period was very strong, the overall holiday period was a bit softer than expected, with the best monthly growth of the quarter coming in January. The standout performance of prestige boutique brands, MAC, Clinique, Lancôme and Benefit drove the best growth rate in the portfolio. Reflecting the strong performance, we're ramping up the roll-out of these boutiques faster than we initially anticipated. We now plan to add 675 boutiques in 2018, compared to 700 in 2017, with the openings more weighted to new stores this year with about 380 in new stores and the remainder in existing stores. This includes plans for roll-out more than 200 new MAC boutiques. 
 Our top line was also driven by strength in prestige skincare, prestige fragrance and mass cosmetics, all of which delivered double-digit comps. Skincare continues to perform very well, and we're adding several new skincare brands to take advantage of the growing trend in skin health, including The Better Skin Co., Crepe Erase, Mamonde, and House 99 by David Beckham, which is a men's grooming brand that is exclusive to Ulta Beauty. We are pleased to see a meaningful acceleration in mass cosmetics in the fourth quarter, driven by the success of popular new brands like Morphe. Ulta Beauty is this brand's exclusive brick-and-mortar partner. 
 We've just completed a major mass cosmetics reflow, making significant enhancements to further differentiate our offering in this category. This entailed a major expansion of brands like Morphe, e.l.f., Makeup Revolution and the introduction of new brands like Milani, FLOWER and Wet n Wild. We also launched ColourPop Cosmetics color cosmetics, a cult favorite in select stores and online in late February. This is a true fast beauty brand featuring trend-right and affordable products and is exclusive to Ulta Beauty. 
 Turning to prestige cosmetics. Similar to the third quarter, we saw this category slow from its stellar growth in 2015 and '16. While certain brands of makeup were very strong, others struggled to comp over significant multi-year increases. We're optimistic that we can accelerate growth in this category with encouraging newness in the pipeline. We're currently updating our prestige cosmetics assortment, including the launch of Beauty by POPSUGAR. And this is another Ulta Beauty exclusive inspired by POPSUGAR's network of 100 million beauty enthusiasts. We're adding high-growth brands, like Estée Lauder, NARS and COVER FX to dozen more stores, rolling out social media darling, Dose of Colors, to several hundred doors with an expanded assortment from its current small etagere. We're also excited about 2 recent Ulta exclusive foundation launches: Tarte's Shape Tape Foundation, which follows Tarte's best-selling concealers and IT Cosmetics' Bye Bye Foundation. 
 And finally, we're thrilled to announce the prestigious addition for 2018, Chanel Beauté. Following our long-standing partnership with Chanel, offering their iconic fragrances in hundreds of our stores, we are honored to introduce Chanel Beauté in a small number of Ulta Beauty doors this year. This will be an added assortment featuring a Chanel-branded makeup station, with the first Chanel store opening in Westport, Connecticut in just a few weeks. 
 With significant newness across all of our categories and particular focus in both mass and prestige cosmetics and amping up our efforts -- our offering of -- our efforts around exclusive products and brands, we are certainly planning for makeup to have a much better year in 2018. 
 Let me turn now to our services business. Salon sales grew 17.2% or 8.7%, excluding the extra week and comped 3.2% in the fourth quarter. We're encouraged by the early results of the test of our improved salon business model in 2 districts. And we're in the process of rolling out the new model to additional markets, including the entire central region of the country, with more markets planned to convert in the summer. Guests and stylists alike are very pleased with this new approach, which simplifies the menu for hair and skin services, offers better transparency, and provides increased training for stylists. We're also investing in a new model for skin services in all new stores and a number of remodels in 2018, which will impact 180 stores. The new model, called the skin bar at Ulta Beauty, is designed to improve our skin services offering and will feature a full-time skin expert with responsibility for both prestige retail sales and skin service sales. This will also add retail space to the skin area compared to our previous model. We expect this model to also drive higher productivity of the space dedicated to skincare. 
 Moving on to store expansion. We opened 16 stores in the fourth quarter, ending the year with 1,074 stores. The net cost to open a new store was about $1.6 million in 2017, up slightly from 2016, as expected in light of the increase in merchandise fixtures for boutiques. This cost is expected to be slightly lower in 2018 as we continue to gain efficiencies in new store construction. We're on track to open 100 stores in 2018, and we're very pleased with the quality of the stores that we've accrued so far. We continue to evolve our store format to respond to guests' rising expectations for an experiential environment. In addition to the new skin bar I just mentioned, the latest store model, our Level 10, features upgrades to the Ulta Beauty Collection ball, enhanced impulse fixtures and elevated prestige hair fixtures. We expect the average store rents for the class of 2018 stores to be slightly lower compared to the class of 2018 -- '17. 
 Now let me turn to our e-commerce business. ulta.com grew 60.4%, including the extra week or 50.4% on a comp basis in the fourth quarter, maintaining its strong momentum and representing 12.8% of total company sales. E-commerce contributed 460 basis points of our total company comp, driven by transaction growth. Total site traffic growth rose 54%, while mobile traffic was up 66%. Our recently rolled out omnichannel capabilities door-to-door is ramping faster than expected and satisfying strong demand for online-only brands like Ofra, Lime Crime and new additions like Storybook Cosmetics as well as brands like Morphe and MAC that are not yet available in every store. 
 And finally, to update you on our supply chain operations. Our supply chain performed very well during the quarter, operating at peak capacity for an extended period while maintaining high in-stock levels during the holiday selling period. In support of the higher e-commerce order volumes, our distribution teams continued to exceed their goals for processing time and in-home delivery speed during holidays. With e-commerce representing nearly 13% of total sales in the quarter, our supply chain was able to support this volume while reducing cost per order by about 10% compared to last year. Our investments in the new operating model allows the network to deliver record daily order throughput capacity at 10% above plan. 
 From an inventory perspective, the team maintained high in-stock levels during the holiday season and through the end of the quarter, improving on last year's strong performance and exceeding our inventory turn goals for the year. Our post-holiday inventory plan was well executed, allowing us to recover from the holiday selling season quickly and capture strong post-holiday sales. 
 So that wraps up my recap of the fourth quarter. And now I'd like to spend some time discussing how we're thinking about the future. As we began to plan 2018, we recognized several significant factors that will impact not just this year but the subsequent years as well and allow modifications to our original long-range planning assumptions. 
 First, the impact of tax reform. This changes the game and provides us with a unique opportunity to deploy a portion of the benefits to invest in our associates and make us more competitive. It also enables us to accelerate certain investments to drive growth and innovation. These will deliver clear benefits to our business, but any reinvestment, obviously, impacts our operating margin rate. We also have to adopt the new accounting standard for revenue recognition that boosts the top line but is expected to negatively impact operating margin by roughly 20 basis points this year. 
 Next, it's clear that our business will have a higher mix of e-commerce sales than previously anticipated. While it's good news that we reached our target of 10% e-com penetration 2 years ahead of plan, this does put modest pressure on the P&L from a rate perspective since gross margin for ulta.com is below that of our brick-and-mortar business. The great news is that e-commerce sales and margin dollars are largely incremental and represent additional share gains. The investments that we've made to enhance our digital and fulfillment capabilities position us to capture significant sales in e-commerce while providing exceptional experience for our growing number of omnichannel guests. 
 We're also not immune to the various cost pressures that most retailers are facing today, including labor, freight and health care. Labor cost is the most significant of these for Ulta Beauty, and we face 2 challenges: rising hourly wages, wage rates in many markets across the country; and increased competition for workers in our distribution centers and, more importantly, the ongoing aggressive roll-out that we're doing of our prestige brand boutiques with dedicated and highly trained staffing. 
 And finally, we're operating in a highly competitive marketplace coupled with the slowdown in the growth rate of cosmetics that has persisted longer than expected. While we remain optimistic that our differentiated model will continue to gain share in a very fragmented market, these category and competitive dynamics are likely to pressure margins in the near term. 
 Now these headwinds will be in part offset by a formalized cost optimization program expected to unlock savings later in 2018 and beyond. As we mentioned on last quarter's call, we believe there's plenty of opportunities to leverage our scale to reduce inefficiencies, and we've identified 4 major work streams to drive benefits in the areas of indirect procurement, end-to-end operational efficiency, real estate cost and merchandise margin improvement. 
 So taking all these factors into consideration, it's clear that for the long-term health of the business, it no longer makes sense to drive toward the 15% operating margin target on the timetable we set several years ago, and managing the business to obtain that target would require underinvestment in areas that we believe will drive robust, sustainable, long-term growth. We still expect to expand operating margin over the long-term. For 2018 however, we anticipate taking a small setback in the order of magnitude of 50 to 70 basis points. Going forward, rather than guiding to a precise operating margin target or time line, we will instead ask stakeholders to focus on how we create value through our very healthy earnings per share and margin dollar growth. 
 We're planning to invest a portion of the roughly $100 million tax rate benefit expected in 2018 in a variety of projects designed to further enhance our differentiated positioning and elevate our overall guest experience. First, we are making critical investments in our people, including employee benefit enhancements that will improve our position in a competitive labor market and increase retention. In addition, we plan to invest in a series of new initiatives that will accelerate customer-facing innovation across multiple touch points to drive growth and strengthen our competitive position. One area of focus will be our store experience, where we'll be innovating on the human, physical and digital aspects of the journey to ensure we're delivering a compelling, exciting and easy experience for our guests in every trip. We'll also accelerate our investment in AI and data capabilities to drive more personalization and one-to-one offers for our loyalty program members. In addition, we'll increase investments in digital innovation to drive guest experience enhancement designed to drive engagement and education as well as increased sales through our e-commerce business. We'll also enhance our capabilities to both identify and incubate new brand opportunities that will further evolve our assortment and take full advantage of the changing landscape of brand creation. And we'll accelerate our services strategy with the continued roll-out of the new salon model and the addition of the new skin services model. Finally from an infrastructure standpoint, we'll accelerate activities around supply chain network optimization as well as investments in supply chain systems that enable buy anywhere, fill anywhere capabilities. We are confident these investments will allow us to continue to deliver industry-leading sales and earnings growth while making us a more competitive employer, improving the guest experience and allowing us to invest in growth platforms to drive sustainable differentiation, exceptional market share gains and long-term success. 
 Before I turn it over to Scott, I'd like to address the topic of the recent lawsuits alleging that Ulta Beauty has resold used products. We are vigorously defending against these lawsuits and taking actions to ensure our guests continue to have the highest confidence in the integrity and quality of Ulta Beauty's products and packaging. Let me be clear: we do not sell used, damaged or expired products and have zero tolerance for any actions that would compromise the integrity of the products we sell. We are confident that our associates are following our policies regarding the handling of returned products. To fortify this policy, we're re-communicating and reinforcing with every associate across the country the proper procedures for processing returns. We have seen no indications that the publicity surrounding the allegations has negatively impacted our brand, our store traffic or our financial results in any discernible way. But we will remain vigilant and ready to take any necessary action to protect our brand and ensure we maintain the trust of our loyal guests. 
 Now Scott will cover in more detail the drivers of our fourth quarter financials and our outlook for the first quarter and fiscal year 2018. 
Scott Settersten: Thank you, Mary. Good afternoon, everyone. 
 Starting with the income statement. Q4 sales of $1.94 billion were driven by 8.8% comparable sales growth, strong new store productivity and the benefit of the 53rd week. The total company comp of 8.8% was composed of 6.2% transaction growth and 2.6% average ticket growth. E-commerce sales growth remained strong and contributed 460 basis points to the total comp. The retail-only comp was 4.2%, with traffic up 2.7% and average ticket growing 1.5%. Ticket was driven by an increase in average selling price, while growth in units per transaction was slightly negative. The salon business comped 3.2%, driven primarily by ticket growth. Gross profit rate decreased 50 basis points, including about 20 basis points from the onetime bonuses for hourly associates. The 30 basis points of remaining deleverage are attributed to modest pressure on merchandise margins and investments in our salon business, in part offset by leverage in fixed store costs. 
 Distribution expense was flat as a rate of sales year-over-year. Product margins continued to face some headwinds from channel, category and brand mix dynamics, with the mix of e-commerce sales the most significant driver. We were just slightly more promotional year-over-year largely due to the higher mix of e-commerce, which tends to be a more promotional channel. Preopening expenses leveraged about 10 basis points related to the timing and number of store openings in the quarter, with 16 openings in Q4 this year versus 25 in Q4 last year. SG&A expense deleveraged 60 basis points, including 40 basis points for the onetime hourly associate bonuses. Store labor was the most significant contributor to the remaining 20 basis point increase in SG&A by deleveraging about 50 basis points as we continue to invest in prestige boutiques as well as in more hours during the holiday season to deliver an optimal guest experience during peak shopping days. Corporate overhead leveraged about 30 basis points, benefiting from strong expense controls. Advertising expense deleveraged slightly. As a reminder, some of the upside we saw in the first quarter of 2017 came from shifts in the timing of some of the planned advertising expenses into the third and fourth quarters. 
 Operating margin was 13.1% of sales, down 110 basis points on a GAAP basis. Excluding the impact of the onetime bonuses for hourly associates, adjusted operating margin decreased 40 basis points at 13.8% of sales. 
 Turning to EPS. GAAP earnings per share grew 51.8% to $3.40, and adjusted EPS rose 22.8% to $2.75. The tax reform impact from both the onetime deferred tax remeasurement and the impact of the new lower effective tax rate starting January 1, benefited the quarter by $0.78. We made the decision to pay onetime bonuses to our hourly associates, totaling $12.3 million. About 1/3 of the expense impacted gross profit and about 2/3 impacted SG&A and, in total, reduced EPS by $0.13. The 53rd week was worth $109 million in sales and about $13 million in EBIT. 
 Moving on to the balance sheet and cash flow. Inventories were up 5.3% on a per-store basis, well below comparable sales, driven primarily by inventory for new brands and boutiques. This performance demonstrates that our new merchandise planning systems are working to drive improvements in inventory management. This is particularly positive in light of the lower-than-expected sales and volatility of sales trends throughout the holiday season. Capital expenditures were $441 million for the year, driven by our new store opening program, investments in digital capabilities, prestige boutiques and merchandise fixtures. We ended the quarter with $397 million in cash and short-term investments. 
 In terms of share buybacks through our 10b5-1 program, we repurchased approximately 266,000 shares of our stock at a cost of $58 million during the fourth quarter. The resulting lower share count added $0.07 to Q4 earnings per share. As of February 3, 2018, approximately $79 million remained available under the $425 million share repurchase program announced back in March 2017. Earlier this week, the Board of Directors approved a new share repurchase authorization in the amount of $625 million. 
 Turning now to guidance for the full year 2018 and for the first quarter. Our initial 2018 outlook is in keeping with our plan to deliver high-single digit comparable sales and earnings per share growth in the 20% range. But some of the drivers have evolved, as Mary just described. We expect to open 100 net new stores in 2018 and execute on 17 remodel and relocation projects. Our e-commerce business is expected to grow in the 40% range. Total top line growth is planned in the low teens, including the impact of the 53rd week in fiscal 2017. 
 Beginning in Q1 of this year, we'll be implementing a new accounting standard for revenue recognition. As a result, we expect to see a benefit to sales from credit card income and gift card breakage, which were previously classified in SG&A. This will be partially offset by the impact of the loyalty program reserves now being grossed up into sales. Since we have such a high customer engagement in our rapidly growing loyalty program, Ulta Beauty has a more significant impact from this accounting change than some other retailers. Adoption of the revenue recognition standard is expected to increase sales by about $50 million and reduce operating margin by about 20 basis points. 
 Total company comps are expected to be in the range of 6% to 8%, with the retail comp in the mid-single digits. We are planning for comps to strengthen throughout the year as comparisons ease and newness in our merchandise offering improves. We expect to grow earnings per share approximately 20% on a GAAP basis, including the extra week in the 2017 and the base. Excluding the impact of the extra week, EPS growth is expected to be in the low 20s. Earnings growth adjusted for the lower tax rate would equate to low double-digit EPS growth. 
 We anticipate capital expenditures of approximately $375 million. This breaks down to $175 million for new stores, remodeled and boutique expansions, $95 million for supply chain and IT, $80 million for merchandising, and $25 million for store maintenance and other. Depreciation is forecast at approximately $290 million. We expect to repurchase shares in the $500 million range for the year, and the annual tax rate is expected to be 24%. 
 One note I'd like to add related to Mary's comments about the recent social media allegations. This guidance does not include any actions we may take to protect our brand and reputation to ensure that our guests continue to have the highest confidence in Ulta Beauty. 
 As we look further out to 2019, the last year for which we gave long-term guidance at our Analyst Day in late 2016, we still expect to grow earnings per share in the 20% range and plan for modest margin expansion. We plan to host our next Analyst Day in the fall and expect to share our longer-term outlook at that time. 
 Turning to more specific guidance for the first quarter of 2018. We expect sales to be in the range of $1.506 billion to $1.519 billion versus $1.315 billion last year. We expect comparable sales to increase in the range of 6% to 7% versus 14.3% last year. E-commerce sales are expected to grow in the 40% range. We plan to open 33 new stores in the first quarter compared to 18 in Q1 of 2017. Q1 preopening expense is expected to deleverage slightly as a rate of sales. Diluted earnings per share are expected to be in the range of $2.43 to $2.48 versus $2.05 last year, with operating margin planned to deleverage. Recall that in last year's first quarter, we had meaningful tax rate benefits resulting from a change in accounting for equity compensation as well as earnings upside from a timing shift of expenses into the back half of the year. The tax rate for Q1 is expected to be 24%, and our fully diluted share count is estimated at 61 million. 
 We hope that our detailed press release and commentary today has been beneficial to investors in understanding the quarter and outlook that have a bit more complexity than usual. 
 And with that, I'll turn it back over to Mary. 
Mary Dillon: Thank you, Scott. And I'd just like to wrap up our prepared comments with some reflections on our overall 2017 performance. 
 We made significant progress on our strategic imperatives throughout the year. We attracted millions of new customers, adding 4.4 million net new loyalty members, and we achieved all-time highs in brand awareness. We gained market share across all categories, added dozens of leading brands to the assortment, successfully rolled out 700 prestige brand boutiques and significantly revamped our services offering. We drove impressive new store productivity. We delivered stellar growth in e-commerce sales and increased the percentage of omnichannel shoppers. We improved our infrastructure and supply chain capabilities. And really perhaps most importantly, we continue to grow and develop a workforce of passionate, highly engaged associates who create and sustain our winning culture. 
 All of these accomplishments give us tremendous confidence in executing our plans in driving sustainable, profitable growth in 2018 and beyond. Our business model remains strong and differentiated, and the investments we're making will continue to set us apart, support market share gains and make us relevant in the beauty industry for many years to come. 
 So now I'll turn it over to our conference call host for Q&A. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Christopher Horvers from JPMorgan. 
Christopher Horvers: So I wanted to ask about the promotional -- your promotional plan and your promotional posture. I think a big question in -- over the past few quarters is it looks like you added an incremental promotion to drive sales at the end. Which looked like you were trying to catch up to where you had guided The Street. So how do you think about those in retrospect? Do you think as a private company, would you have run those? And how are you thinking about 2018 differently, especially in light of some of the work you're doing around the Ultamate Rewards program? 
Mary Dillon: Thank you, Chris. Let me start just by stepping back and providing some context, which is that we have many different demand drivers, and we always are really striving to deliver a great value equation to our guests and one that's going to drive share gains and profitable growth. So some of those demand drivers are easy to see and track, and others are maybe less so because they're very targeted, and a lot of folks are consumer target, right. So what I would say is the great thing is that we can and do flex those tactics as needed given the time of year, category, competitive dynamics. So we set out -- I guess some more context, really over 4 years ago to reduce our reliance on broad price discounting and, as you said, increased targeted offerings through our loyalty program. We also significantly shifted spending out of price promotion tactics into awareness and brand building tactics. And we've done that. The business, I would say, is much healthier because of that. So our brand partners, they appreciate what we're doing with the data and the insights in the loyalty program. And I'm confident that these are the right levers. So to your point, at the end of the fourth quarter, we did have an incremental 20% off postcard, end of the quarter, drove traffic and share gains, slight headwind in margin rate. But as I said, we actually have many levers and we take a very holistic approach. So in fact, we're less promotional on other tactics that we're probably less visible. So net-net, it's only a slight increase in overall promotions. And really, that was largely driven by the higher mix of e-commerce in the quarter, which tends to be more promotional. So to your question about looking forward, I'd say more of the same. It's just constant -- how do we -- over time, we know that getting more and more one-to-one and personalized is the goal for us. Our loyalty program allows us to do that. Some of the investments I talked about do as well. But we'll continue to use an array of tactics and levers to drive the long-term growth and share gains of the business. 
Scott Settersten: And I would just like to add because I know this is a hot button for investors and we, of course, read all the weekly analyst reports that are tracking our every move on the promotional front. So one other fact I'd like to add is it's not -- this postcard in particular, it drove a lot of traffic to our stores, which helps us mitigate other potential gross margin risk to the business, right. So it helps us move through clearance products. In this case, it helps us move through some of the residual holiday products that's still in the stores. And so we were able to sell that at a profit with vendor support rather than sending it back to the vendor, right, where you have labor costs and potential shrink issues or, worst case, having to write it off at the end of the quarter. So those are both worst outcomes. So again, we try to be very thoughtful about the decisions we make and how we execute. 
Christopher Horvers: And I just want to throw in -- you mentioned potentially having to react to some of the -- these new stories about the used cosmetics potentially, seems to be foreshadowing -- maybe pulling one of those out to make sure you're defending the market share out there. And you also guided a more narrow range, 6% to 7% in the first quarter, so just trying to interpret that. 
Mary Dillon: Is that a question? 
Scott Settersten: Yes. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line... 
Mary Dillon: Look, we just found out [indiscernible] I'm sorry. I wasn't tracking if that was a question or not, a follow-on question, Chris. So... 
Laurel Lefebvre: Chris, can you repeat your question? 
Mary Dillon: Okay, he's gone. I'm happy to answer but I wasn't clear about it. 
Laurel Lefebvre: Okay, let's keep going. 
Operator: I'm sorry. The next question comes from the line of Simeon Siegel from Nomura Instinet. 
Simeon Siegel: Congrats on a strong year, guys. So Mary, can you just talk about how your new store openings are going? You did mention these stronger new store productivity. I'm just wondering as the brand continues to gain awareness, are you seeing a faster sales ramp? And maybe, is there any change to the maturity profile? 
Mary Dillon: Yes. I mean, I'm very encouraged as our new class of stores each year continues to ramp up stronger. Productivity continues to get better. The maturity ramp of the stores is a function of the overall comp rate. So that's going to flex based on the -- where we are in the overall comp. But what we are seeing in new store openings continues to be very strong and very encouraging and allows us to continue to drive more market share gains as we enter markets, even markets that we already have stores, right. As we're adding stores, we're continuing to build our market share and overall penetration. So it's quite strong. 
Simeon Siegel: Okay, great. And then just quickly, Scott, did you -- sorry if I missed it. Did you quantify or can you quantify what you expect mix shift to do to gross margins going forward? 
Scott Settersten: We didn't quantify it. I would tell you that merch margins in general, as we said now for quite some time, we expect to manage to flattish, right. That's what's been inherent in our long-term thought process. So -- but we believe there's opportunities over the long term. So again, e-commerce, it's pretty obvious that that's going to be a headwind for us. It has been in recent quarters and will continue to be. And so we're planning and we're looking at things. We have ways to mitigate that. Both our private-label offering might be a way, just getting smarter about our assortment and numerous decisions by making use of our new merchandise tools that we put in place over the last couple of years, better analytical tools as well, inventory productivity gains we think we have in our future. And of course, the DCs play a big role in this as well so there are better capabilities, better optimized performance overall. And with Fresno, we're making thoughtful decisions on where we place these to make sure that we're closer to our end customers there, so again helping with transportation cost over the long term. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. 
Simeon Gutman: A question for Mary. Ulta has been making a lot of investments while growth was robust. And now it sounds like we're still needing to make some investments at a time -- or I think some of us would think that you were relatively better off than your peers. So I know you'd mentioned some reasons why. Can we revisit that? And I don't know if I caught it, but within the margin guidance and, I think, the adjusted outside of the accounting change is down 30 to 50, how much of it is down to the extra investment outside of the e-commerce mix shift and some of the freight and the labor margin headwinds that you face? 
Mary Dillon: Okay, great. Thank you, Simeon. Now I'll start with the question, I guess, about why we feel we need to make investments. I'd say first of all, I think we've got a really strong track record of making smart investments that earn a great return. And we've, in fact, made really significant progress against the 5-year plan that we communicated back in 2014. We're well ahead on, I guess, every dimension you might measure from sales and profit, the comp performance, share gains and whatnot. I would say though that retail is rapidly changing and really more so than maybe we would have thought 4 years ago. So while I feel very good about the investments we've made, this is simply an opportunity now frankly with the Tax Reform Act to size up the opportunities that affords us to invest at an accelerated pace on some of the dimensions that I talked about and really investing from a position of strength. We're very confident about our business model and our growth potential, but continuing to invest and maybe doing at an accelerated pace allows us to adapt to the increased pace of change, I think, that's happening in guest expectations and retail. So if we only solved for margin, I think we would not maximize the opportunity that's ahead of us. So when we think about those investments, it's both in people as well as guest-facing initiatives. And really, it's more about imagining a future of this intersection of the digital and physical world that's more focused on experiences, on discovery, personalization and less on what you might think of like the friction of commerce. So for us, it's just about how do you pace that and do it in a way that continues to allow us to really be the leader in beauty that we are and believe we continue to be. So it's as simple as that. Do you want to take the second question? 
Scott Settersten: Sure. So the 50 to 70 basis points down for the year that we guided to -- I think you mentioned, Simeon. You caught the 20 basis points on the accounting change, which is kind of a onetime item, I guess, I would say, for the changing going from the cost method to the retail method for accounting for loyalty transactions. The remaining 30 to 50 primarily driven by labor, store labor, is a big driver of that, and that's connected to the boutique strategies. So we talked in the past a lot about cost implications there. So we're in a better position in '18 because more of the boutiques are going into new stores than they have historically. Historically, it's been going back into the comp base, which has been more of an expensive proposition for us through this accelerated depreciation notion that we've talked about in the past; so labor, the biggest piece with boutiques, which we say we're accelerating from what we had thought about earlier. And then the rest of it is really this tax benefit reinvestment, I would say, and most of that ends up in SG&A in the back half of the year largely, as does the store payroll as well is in the SG&A line. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Kelly Crago from Buckingham Research Group. 
Kelly Halsor: Mary, could you just talk about the prestige cosmetics category a little further? First, did you mention how that grew in 4Q? And then as we begin to lap some of the outsized growth in the category, what do you feel is an appropriate level of normalized growth? And what are some of your assumptions driving that outlook? And then just piggybacking on that,  it'd be great to hear your thoughts on the recent successes of celebrity-brand introductions, which you haven't necessarily been able to participate in. So do you expect this to be a sustainable trend? And if so, are you seeing any opportunities to get involved in a bigger way? 
Mary Dillon: Great. Thank you. I'm going to tag team this with Dave. So I'll start. And I guess I would say when I -- we think about our -- I'll really reiterate. We've continued to gain share in all the categories and all the channels that we're in, right. So we participate in a lot of different categories, All Things Beauty, All in One Place. So there's a lot of different irons in the fire that we have to drive our growth. And in prestige, for us, we comped around 10% last quarter. And a year ago, that was 20%. So that was still great growth, a little bit not as strong as it was the year before, but we had some brands that had great -- our prestige boutique beauty brands were really strong and continued to roll out. We had some other brands that had innovations that didn't work as well as the previous year. But we see our partners and new brand innovation very strong both in mass, which we can talk more about, and prestige. And I feel very confident that that's going to continue to be a strong segment of growth and really coming in a lot of different ways. So to your point about celebrity brands, that's just one of the many levers that are out there in terms of creation of brands, and we're participating across all of those. So I would not rule that out. I think there's a lot of ways for us to get innovation and we are -- so Dave, why don't you give a little more color on [indiscernible] 
David Kimbell: Yes, on our cosmetic -- on our makeup business. So yes, I'd just add to what Mary said by -- we really take a holistic approach at building our total makeup business. And while your question was about prestige, I want to talk about both mass and prestige because that's really unique for Ulta Beauty, obviously, and an important part of our strategy as we help introduce guests into opting into the mass business but then see them over time move into our prestige business. So they work very -- in a very integrated way. But I'd call out just a few core areas of how we're thinking about building our -- continuing to build our assortment and our growth and success in the makeup business. First and foremost, it is about strengthening the performance with our biggest brand partners, our established brands there. And we're seeing continued success with that. That drove some of the comps that Mary talked about in prestige and also in mass, so our Ulta Beauty Collection at the forefront of that going forward, as well as Maybelline and L'Oreal Paris on the mass side; brands like Tarte, Anastasia, IT Cosmetics, Too Faced driving growth on the prestige side. We're also rolling out, we've mentioned a couple of times, key brand partners that we've been establishing in more stores largely on the prestige side. We said 675 new boutiques across MAC, Lancôme, Clinique, adding benefit in new stores, but also NARS, Estée Lauder; on the mass side, e.l.f. rolling to all stores. So brands that have been successful in smaller subset of doors continue to expand out. Key exclusive brands are a big part of that. Tarte Double Duty Beauty has been a big success and a great partnership. IT Brushes for Ulta, Makeup Revolution on the mass side, an exclusive brand that is -- we're expanding and seeing a lot of success with. And then I'd say in the socially relevant, socially driven brands, we're seeing a lot of success and many of these brands are exclusive to Ulta. And we are seeing them already driving a lot of growth. On the mass side, Morphe launched late last year. We just launched ColourPop, Milani, Sleek, FLOWER; on the prestige side, Dose of Colors, Beauty by POPSUGAR, which is an exclusive line created by Ulta. Mary mentioned Storybook Cosmetics, which is an online brand. So we're seeing these influencer-led brands having a major impact in the marketplace. We've got many that we've brought in over the last 6 months and several that have just launched over the last few weeks. So we're very confident about the growth that we'll see there. And then the last thing I'd just reinforce is reflective of a holistic view that we see on the makeup business is the addition of Chanel Beauté, and we're very excited about that rolling into a small number of doors but another example of us driving growth in all aspects and all dimensions of the cosmetic business. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Mark Altschwager from Robert W. Baird. 
Mark Altschwager: So your prior long-range plan called for stronger comps in the early years, relatively lower comps in the out years. So I guess, the question is, would you expect your comp growth rate to reaccelerate as you accelerate some of these investments in personalization and store experience? Or would it allow you to at least sustain something in the 6% to 8% range for a longer period of time? Just I guess without previewing the Analyst Day this fall too much, it would be great to hear how you're thinking about the longer-term comp growth algorithm. 
Mary Dillon: Okay. Thank you, Mark. A way to get a little preview, I like that, which we can't do and don't have, but no -- I would think about it as sustaining really the healthy comps that we're talking about right now and that we would -- I would expect that the need to evolve any retail business is going to be -- it's out there for all of us. So when we think about these investments, it's really to continue to be just as strong as we are and may -- and sustain the kind of comps that we're talking about. So more to come on that. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Erinn Murphy from Piper Jaffray. 
Erinn Murphy: I guess, Mary, my question was for you regarding the loyalty membership. The growth was pretty strong, so in 2017, as you said, 27.8 million at the end of the year. I guess, first, how do you anticipate the growth of that to continue in '18? And then how are you thinking about the customer acquisition cost if you get up into that next 5 million to 10 million customers? 
Mary Dillon: Yes, I'll just start and then have Dave add some more to this. But I'm really thrilled with the kind of growth that we've had. We're at almost 28 million members, as we said, which is fantastic. And still, there's a lot of beauty enthusiasts out there that are not in our loyalty program. So we anticipate to be able to continue to drive growth albeit at a moderate pace over time. We've had really strong growth. We know we'll continue to grow it. So what would you like to add to that? 
David Kimbell: Yes. And I'd say as far as cost of acquisitions, we're not seeing a dramatic change. And then in fact, we're finding more efficient ways to drive our total marketing plan. And we really do take a comprehensive approach to drive new guests into our store. Mary mentioned in her prepared remarks the increased awareness, both unaided and aided, which we know contributes to our growth. We've got very strong marketing plans supporting both our total brand story as well as many of the new items that I've talked about. And then our stores have done a very good job improving their effectiveness at converting nonmembers into members, and we're anticipating that we'll continue to do that through 2018. So we're not expecting a real change in our efficiency of attracting new members into our program. 
Erinn Murphy: Okay, that's helpful. If I can sneak in one more just on the credit card. Is that still a drag on gross margin? Or is that neutralized now? 
Scott Settersten: Yes -- no. I'm trying to put into context the drag. So the credit card has been a spectacular success and has been a real tailwind for the business overall. I mean... 
Mary Dillon: The 20% offer that came with the launch [indiscernible] 
Scott Settersten: Yes, yes. So that's moderated, the 20% off, in case that didn't come through loud and clear. So the initial sign-up margin rate headwind with that initial purchase really had subsided once we got the program off the ground back the second half of last year, really hasn't been an impact overall when we're talking about margin rates here in recent quarters. 
David Kimbell: The net impact is very positive. 
Scott Settersten: Absolutely. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Dana Telsey from Telsey Advisory Group. 
Dana Telsey: As you're thinking about this category performance, makeup and what you're seeing with prestige, how do you see the growth rates of that in the future? And do you see any changes going on with skincare versus makeup that we should be looking forward to? And then just on the store base, any changes to the store base potential given the stronger-than-expected e-commerce build? 
Mary Dillon: Great. Thank you, Dana. I'll start with the store base. We obviously continue to look at that very closely and are thrilled with the productivity that we have, the real estate opportunity, the ability to take advantage of situations, I think, that are right for us in retail. So -- and we love the e-commerce growth because it's so incremental to the business, right. So it's not -- we don't have a shifting of purchases happening here. As you know, we look at that omnichannel guest closely and analytically. She continues to buy even more in-store and online and becomes the best guest. So -- but we look at it closely as we continue to build out the store base and make sure that we are picking the right spots and that we'll just keep watching that. But we feel very encouraged as I said we're going to open 100 stores this year. We're off to a very strong start already, and we think we're in the right place. On the -- oh, category stuff was the first question. Do you want to take that, Dave? 
David Kimbell: Sure, yes. I mean, on the category, on makeup specifically, the -- we're confident about both mass and prestige. They both slowed down in 2017 and -- but we're seeing through the -- some of the items that I talked about earlier, strong signs within our portfolio of growth. So we're optimistic at least within our business and our model that makeup trends will improve and we anticipate seeing that across the market. As far as skincare, I'm glad you asked because skincare has been accelerating. And we're very pleased with the results that we've seen on our skincare business again both on the mass and prestige side. Mary mentioned several of the new brands that we just recently launched actually last week that we're excited about but also continued strong performance with brands like Mario Badescu, Peter Thomas Roth, expansion of proactiv, Origins, Clarins. And then men's skin business, we think, will also drive some incremental growth, highlighted by House 99 with David Beckham. So we see a lot of growth in skin across the marketplace, and we're certainly, we think, leading the way and gaining share in that category as well. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Jason Gere from KeyBanc Capital Markets. 
Jason Gere: Mary, I might need you to go into that crystal ball again. 
Mary Dillon: Got it. 
Jason Gere: Just on the cost optimization program, I guess I wanted to get a little bit of color on that. Did you use outside consultants on some of the projects? Because you guys haven't really gone through -- I wouldn't call it restructuring, but this level of some of this detail. And then Scott, when you think about the 50 to 70 basis points that margin will be down this year, how much of -- I mean, the cost optimization program, I guess, will help offset in the second half of the year. How much is that going to contribute this year? What would be the full year run rate? And then how -- and this is the crystal ball question. How much of that gets reinvested when you think about going forward into next year? So I was just wondering. A lot of details about -- well, hopefully, I can get some answers. 
Mary Dillon: Thank you, Jason. I'll just start by saying a couple of things. One is I am thrilled that we're really in a formalized program that we're working on with dedicated internal leaders and a formal process in place, and we're doing it from a position of strength. So I think it's the right time for us to think about how do we take our growth and scale and identify opportunities to drive more efficiencies in the business, smarter ways to do business for many years to come. So we're fairly far down the path of identifying buckets of opportunities but way too early to start getting specific about what that's going to look like and when, but I feel really good about the progress we're making. 
Scott Settersten: Yes. I guess, I would just add that the executive team is committed to seeing this through. I mean, I think we're in a good spot in our maturity curve here to be working on this ahead of what you might have seen historically in other operations. So we're not going to share a lot of specifics, but there's hard targets in the 2018 plan and this is going to be a multi-year program and feeling really good about it at this stage. 
Jason Gere: Is it fair to say -- and maybe just to follow up, when you look at some of the other competitors out there, whether department stores who've kind of gone through this type of, I guess, cost-cutting efforts in the past that they're kind of near the tail end of those programs, you're at the beginning, it puts you in a competitive advantage as we think about the next couple of years? 
Mary Dillon: Well, I would hope so. I mean, the idea is that it really is the right time for us to think about short term and long term, the ability to continue to drive the kind of returns that our shareholders expect and want while continuing to invest in the business that has many, many years of growth ahead of it and the need for investment in a changing retail environment. So firstly, I think about it a little bit less of cost-cutting. I think about it more as driving efficiencies to invest in growth, and now is the right time for us to do that. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Brian Tunick from RBC Capital Markets. 
Bilun Boyner: This is Bilun on for Brian. I just wanted to ask about the ticket growth. I believe it's been around mid-single digits over the last 2 years and starting to slow a little here. So as you think about the comp sales from here, is it reasonable to assume a lower contribution from ticket growth? Or do you think there is still opportunities to grow the average ticket from maybe channel mix, product mix or anything that we should be aware of? And then secondly, I might have missed this but -- so the vendor participation for the different kinds of promotions, say the 20% off coupon, is that different than planned events, like the 21 Days of Beauty that you run almost every year? 
Scott Settersten: Yes. So maybe I can start with the comp deconsolidation. So when we think about the business, it's always with a healthy balance of traffic versus ticket kind of contribution. That's the way we plan our business. I mean, over the last couple of years, you've seen us outperform that especially on the traffic side of things. So again, it's a balance. The way we think about -- we wouldn't -- there's nothing out ahead of us that we would say we would expect anything materially different than that at this stage of the game. 
David Kimbell: And as far as brand partner support of our key promotional activity, I guess I won't get into specific details about each individual item other than to say we are very close -- work very closely with our brands to deliver the best experience to our guests, and they are active supporters of our efforts in the marketplace. And we anticipate that they'll continue to be that. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Adrienne Yih from Wolfe Research. 
Adrienne Yih-Tennant: Mary, first of all, congrats on the Chanel Beauté, very, very impressive to land them. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about how many stores, how many SKUs and the timing of that. And then along with that, the skincare size of -- prestige skincare size of market relative to prestige cosmetics and then your penetration within Ulta in those 2 categories. 
Mary Dillon: Yes, I'm not sure we'd break out all that in so much detail, but I'll tag team this with Dave. Thank you. We're thrilled about Chanel Beauté as well. It will be a pretty -- a small number of stores to start. We're starting Westport, Connecticut, in the next couple of weeks, [ additive ] assortment, beautiful brand. So we're thrilled to continue and deepen that partnership. 
David Kimbell: Yes. And the assortment will be highlighting the most iconic items. As Mary said a real  [ additive ]  assortment, we're really excited about the presentation in-store. But it will feature their iconic lipstick, Rouge Coco lip gloss and blush, cream foundation, skincare items. And so we think it will be a really nice presentation of their brand and a nice addition into our portfolio. 
Adrienne Yih-Tennant: Fantastic. And then Scott, just a clarification. On the year-over-year operating margin pressure, is that against the GAAP 13.1% or the 13.8%? And then for Q1, can you help us out a little bit with the gross margin? Because you're opening, I think, more stores in Q1 year-over-year, should we think about more pressure and then having that relieve itself or reverse itself in Q2? 
Scott Settersten: Yes. So it is -- so the guide -- the operating margin guidance is versus the GAAP information. We'll clarify that. And then Q1, yes, interesting -- I'm glad you asked this question because it is important for people. We did state it a few times. Q1 is probably our toughest compare of the year, right. So we had a 14% comp last year. We had some -- we pushed some expenses out of first quarter into the back half of '17. So that helped us as well. So the other things to keep in mind there, I would say, is supply chain deleverage. So we got a new DC in Fresno, California that's going to open up mid-year next year, so some slight deleverage there in the early part of the year and then improving in the back half of the year. And then you're right-on with the store program, so a lot more stores opening up in first quarter '18 than a year ago, plus we're carrying forward somewhat, I would call, higher cost kinds of real estate, right, that we put online second half of last year, Manhattan being the most notable of those that we're still up against here in the early part of the year; so again, fixed door cost leverage, tougher the first half of the year but improving as the year goes out. 
Operator: Our last question comes from the line of Oliver Chen from Cowen and Company. 
Oliver Chen: Our question is just the evolution of the space and how you're thinking about driving value and experience in the context of Amazon and other pure-play competitors. Just what's on your mind in terms of the shifting needs of the consumer? And how are you prioritizing and what can -- you can do just to make sure you have a competitive advantage along the [ attributes ] of value, of store experience, personalization and customer engagement? 
Mary Dillon: I would say all of the above, Oliver. It's a great question. And I believe we are really well positioned to really be a leader in this category for many years to come, both in the physical space as well as digital, full stop. I mean, to us, this is a category and a consumer that we focus on, the beauty enthusiasts who really loves both the in-store experience to try and discover and get services as well as the convenience and fun of buying online. And so we offer really what nobody else does, and we will continue to do that, so the broadest assortment across all categories and price points, a great in-store experience and online experience that means we just keep getting better, right, services, our loyalty program. And I'd say as we think about our e-commerce platform, we just continue to build out our e-commerce platform in a way that is great. It gives us great control over content, the guest experience, the pricing, the data. So we like the model. We think we're well positioned. And as we think about the future, imagining what that guest wants 5 and 10 years from now in that intersection of the physical and digital world, it's -- that's our job to do. But we believe she'll continue to want to have a physical experience as well. So that's how we think about it. It's a competitive space, but we think we're playing to win. So we will. 
Oliver Chen: And lastly, just as a quick follow-up. On the inventory journey, you've done a really good job managing capital and also the SWIFT system and thinking about accuracy. What are the next steps for inventory in terms of what you want to do and ensuring the omnichannel as well as the supply chain and speed and turns and stocks and service levels are where you want them to be regarding both the customer-facing as well as the planograms in the stores? Just curious about inventory. 
Scott Settersten: Yes. I'd say we're still in the early innings with respect to inventory optimization. So I mean, as you well know, it's a never-ending quest, right, to have the right product at the right place at the right time, which she's interested in purchasing, whether it's on the store shelf or it's in our distribution centers ready to be shipped out to her front door. So we've been making a significant number of investments over the course over the last couple of years with tools. You mentioned SWIFT is one and better space planning kinds of tools in the stores. I mean, our analytical capabilities have improved a lot over the last 3 to 4 years. That will continue. That's the quest again that will be evergreen for us to try to get better and better insights into our purchasing behavior and how we ship things quicker and more efficiently to folks. So there's still a lot of -- I guess, I would say a lot of progress for us to be made there when we think about inventory productivity and inventory turns kinds of things as we look to the future. 
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back over to Mary Dillon for closing remarks. 
Mary Dillon: I want to close by thanking our 35,000 associates for their commitment to providing a great guest experience and for delivering exceptional financial results in 2017. I look forward to speaking with all of you soon. Thank you. 
Operator: This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.

===== 2017 Q3  (2017-11-30 17:00:00) =====

[Operator Instructions]
 I'll now turn it over to Mary. 
Mary Dillon: Thank you, Laurel. Good afternoon, everyone. Our third quarter results clearly demonstrate the strength and distinct advantages of the Ulta Beauty business model. We delivered a double-digit comp in spite of a moderation in the growth rate of our largest category, makeup, and meaningful disruption from hurricanes. We flexed our merchandising and marketing plans, leveraged our consumer insights and CRM platform and worked with our brand partners to create compelling offers for our guests. We also benefited from the unmatched breadth of beauty categories and products that we offer. These levers allowed us to drive significant share gains, continue to rapidly grow our base of loyalty members and thrive in spite of shifting category trends within the beauty industry and disruption in some of our largest markets.
 Before I share our results, including the financial impact of the hurricanes, I'd like to take a moment to mention the fantastic job our teams did to prepare for the storms, support our field associates who were personally impacted and get our stores back up and running following an incredibly challenging time for these regions. It was truly inspiring to see the collaboration and caring from all corners of our organization to manage through this period.
 To recap our third quarter financial performance. We grew the top line 18.6% and delivered healthy 10.3% comps on top of 16.7% comps in the third quarter of 2016, an acceleration on a 2-year stack compared to the second quarter. The disruption from the hurricanes in Florida and Texas negatively impacted our results by a little more than 1 point of comp. Comp sales were driven by balanced traffic and ticket growth and continued strength in e-commerce.
 In terms of category trends, our highest sales growth was in skincare and fragrance, while haircare also strengthened. Makeup, while still producing very healthy growth by any standard, was softer compared to last year when it drove a disproportionate amount of our comp growth.
 GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.70 grew 21.4%. We delivered better-than-expected EPS growth despite gross margins contracting a bit more than initially planned. Some of this margin pressure was expected, driven by new store and boutique activity in the quarter and marketing and test-and-learn activities pushed back from the first quarter into the back half.
 In light of the hurricane disruption and the moderation in color cosmetics growth, we decided to boost our CRM and promotional activity. This allowed us to continue to drive strong market share gains and rapid membership growth in our Ultamate Rewards loyalty program.
 I'll turn now to a more detailed discussion of the strategies that drove our results in the third quarter, beginning with our strategic imperative to acquire new guests and deepen loyalty of existing guests. Our loyalty program continues to deliver significant benefits, and well over 90% of our sales are captured through the program. At the end of October, our Ultamate Rewards program grew to 26.4 million active members, up 21% year-over-year. Retention rates, sales per member, frequency of purchase and average member ticket are healthy and stable.
 To update you on our efforts to increase adoption of our credit card which we launched last year, we've rolled out in-store initiatives to drive awareness and are offering new incentives like free gift with sign-up in addition to savings on guest's first purchase with the card. We also launched the capability to apply online and buy which drove significantly higher online applications. Credit card sign-ups continue to grow with new accounts and conversion above plan, and we're continuing to garner a much higher share of wallet of our customers who signed up for the credit card.
 We're also very pleased with the growth in third-party distribution of gift cards through our Blackhawk relationship. We rolled out our gift cards to 10 additional retail partners in the third quarter, bringing our reach to 13,000 stores. We plan to add another 500 stores with 3 additional grocery chains in the fourth quarter, with more retail partners in the pipeline. Aided by this expansion, gift card sales grew nearly 50% in the third quarter with expectations for a strong fourth quarter performance.
 Now turning to our marketing programs. We executed another successful 21 Days Of Beauty event in September. Historically, this has been a promotion focused on color cosmetics with the strategic intent of migrating customers from our primarily mass basket to a richer basket, blending mass and prestige items. This year, we incorporated skincare items to take advantage of the current strong trends in skincare. We improved our overall offering, featuring highly sought-after brands and products like MAC lipsticks, and increased influencer content across Ulta Beauty channels, digital partner platforms and influencers' own channels, which all drove excitement for the event.
 In October, we had strong results with our signature Gorgeous Hair event and focused on our partnership with the Breast Cancer Research Foundation. We built on the success of our Gorgeous Way to Give campaign, performing 42,000 services during our salon Cut for a Cause event, partnered once again with The Ellen DeGeneres Show, garnered more than 5 million views of our new social media campaign featuring breast cancer survivors with an empowering and inspiring message and executed a series of activities all month long in stores, distribution centers and in corporate. We raised $4 million this year alone to fund research projects to support BCRF's quest for a cure.
 We continue to partner with Refinery29 in the iHeart Music Festival to drive brand awareness, and we launched a new partnership with Allure Magazine to enhance our position as a beauty destination. This partnership included an Allure Magazine curated mini book called Shop Like a Beauty Editor. This book features the favorite picks of Allure beauty editors available at Ulta Beauty. The program also highlighted digital content from Allure editors in their e-mails and the mix section on ulta.com.
 We also became the exclusive and presenting sponsor of Demi Lovato's Simply Complicated, which is a full-length documentary on YouTube that gives an intimate look into the life of the popular star. The video has already been viewed more than 10 million times. The partnership includes 3 get-the-look videos featuring products sold at Ulta Beauty. These efforts are part of our multiyear strategy to increase awareness of the Ulta Beauty brand, which has led to all-time high results for this metric. Aided brand awareness now stands at 87%, up from 84% last year, while unaided brand awareness grew to 50% compared to 41% last year.
 Next, I'd like to provide an update on our merchandising initiatives. The Ulta Beauty team did a fantastic job maximizing our brand partnerships, ensuring that must-have and often-exclusive product is on our shelves. We continue to drive rapid market share gains across the board with particular strength in prestige beauty. According to third quarter data tracked by the NPD group, Ulta Beauty continued to rapidly grow our share of prestige makeup, accelerated our gains in prestige skincare and fragrance and added 320 basis points of market share in prestige beauty overall. Year-to-date, Ulta Beauty grew the prestige segment by 28% while all other retail tracked by NPD only grew in the low single digits, netting to a total prestige beauty industry growth rate of 5%.
 Our broad and balanced portfolio of product categories and brands continues to be a lever in our ability to deliver healthy comps. Skincare in both mass and prestige, fragrance, professional haircare, sun care, accessories and personal care appliances all delivered well above average growth. Similar to what we discussed last quarter, the industry overall seems to be experiencing a bit of a lull in innovation in color cosmetics, although not across all brands. Our prestige boutiques featuring Clinique, Lancôme, MAC and Benefit brands were very strong as we continue to roll out 700 boutiques this year. These 4 high-growth brands contributed almost 1/3 of our total comp growth during the quarter.
 We are delighted with our new partnership with MAC. At the end of the quarter, we had 107 stores rolled out, and we'll have approximately 120 boutiques by year-end. We also rolled out 5 of MAC's hero SKUs in our impulse fixtures across the chain. Our assortment features several exclusive instant artistry kits available only at Ulta Beauty. MAC has quickly become the #1 brand at 80% of the stores where it's launched, and is a close second in the rest. Our consumer insights team has surveyed our MAC guests with their findings demonstrating that we're helping to recruit a new consumer to the brand, with roughly 50% of the MAC buyers at Ulta either new to MAC or lapsed MAC users who haven't purchased the brand in over a year.
 Beyond the prestige boutiques, we've seen the rest of our prestige color cosmetics category slowing compared to last year's exceptional pace of growth, but prestige makeup is still very healthy and comping in the high single digits. Many of our brands like Tarte and Too Faced are delivering strong innovation and double-digit comps. Encouragingly, color cosmetics, both mass and prestige were very strong during Black Friday weekend, which we believe bodes well for this category during the holiday season.
 We're also excited about developments on the mass side of the assortment in makeup, with e.l.f. rolling out chain-wide next year and cult favorite, Morphe, a social media influencer brand focused on eyeshadow palettes and brushes, added to 300 doors in ulta.com. Another brand born on social media is Dose of Colors, which was available online-only for the past several months. Following its success in ulta.com, we recently introduced 2 popular palettes to 400 stores and will be adding 21 lip and eyeshadow Dose of Colors SKUs in time for holiday.
 So fragrance was another highlight during the quarter comping in the high teens, with success in the base business and several strong new launches, including Chanel Gabrielle, Gucci Bloom and Carolina Herrera Good Girl. We continue to launch exclusive fragrances like Ballet Rose from Philosophy and an exclusive line of 4 fragrances from Kate Spade.
 Both prestige and mass skincare comped well above the house, with newness from No7, Yes To, Skinfood and MEMEBOX driving strength in mass skincare; and Mario Badescu, Dermalogica, Peter Thomas Roth and Juice Beauty driving exceptional growth on the prestige side of skincare.
 Our professional haircare category was bolstered by the rollout of Bumble and bumble in more than 500 stores, new brands like Aquage, the chain-wide rollout of Drybar and newness driving double -- strong double-digit comps in DevaCurl, Kenra, Matrix and Pureology. So as you can see, there's a lot going on in our assortment as we have access to more and more brands that continue to elevate our product offering.
 Now looking ahead to next year, we're excited about the new brand pipeline with additions in every major category, including makeup, skincare and haircare as well as a significant reflow in our mass cosmetics area planned for the beginning of 2018 to make room for brand additions and expansions. Our positioning of All Things Beauty, All in One Place gives us multiple levers to drive growth and quickly adapt to trends and changing industry dynamics.
 Let me turn now to our services business. Salon sales grew 10.8% and comped 3.8% in the third quarter. While a moderation from our rapid growth earlier in the year, these increases show that we continue to gain share and far exceed growth rates for the services industry. We saw some regional variation in our growth rates with slower growth in Florida and Texas, 2 of our biggest markets for services, reflecting disruption from the hurricane.
 The team managed labor and operating costs well and increased the profit rate of the services business while investing in growth initiatives. We're in the early stages of testing our improved salon business model in 2 markets, and we're encouraged by the early indicators. Initial surveys of our guests revealed significantly higher engagement and satisfaction with this new approach. As a reminder, the new guest-centric model features a simplified menu for hair and skin services, a more transparent pricing model to clearly and consistently communicate pricing to our guests and increase training for stylists. We believe this innovative approach is the foundation for long-term growth and share gains.
 Earlier this year, we launched our Pro Team, a group of salon stylists from Redken, Matrix, L'ANZA and Wella who are in charge of elevating the profile of the salon at Ulta Beauty, building trend collection and leading education programs for our 7,000 stylists. The Pro team is already making a big impact and getting a lot of attention in the salon world with extensive coverage in industry publications like Modern Salon and Behind The Chair. This publicity is positioning us as a trendsetter and helping us to track the best talent to our salon team.
 Now to update you on our new store program. We opened 48 stores in the third quarter, ending the quarter with 1,058 stores. We were able to open almost all of our 100 net new stores in our 2017 program before Black Friday weekend to take advantage of holiday traffic and sales. New stores continued to open up very strong, with the class of 2017 stores exceeding its budget and IRR hurdles.
 Earlier this month, we opened our first Manhattan store in a great neighborhood location in 86th and Third. This store is off to an excellent start in its first few weeks. Similar to the Michigan Avenue store in Chicago, we're seeing great results in the salon after hiring a seasoned team of salon professionals. At the Manhattan store, it offers extended hours to accommodate early morning blowouts in the salon before work or school. We're pleased to report that our newly opened high-profile stores in Chicago, the Mall of America and Manhattan are all performing very well. Looking ahead to 2018, the majority of our 2018 real estate program has been approved, and we're on track to open up another 100 stores next year.
 Now turning to our e-commerce business. Ulta.com sales grew 62.9%, representing nearly 9% of total company revenue and continuing the rapid growth we've seen from the past several quarters as we enhanced our assortment, site experience and delivery capabilities. E-commerce sales were driven by transaction growth. Total traffic growth was up 57% and mobile traffic grew 92%, driven by investments in digital marketing. We relaunched our mobile site during the quarter, improving the guest experience with the redesign of the shopping cart and checkout experiences. We also improved the credit card application experience, implementing the ability to apply and buy in one transaction, which has more than doubled the number of credit card account sign-ups online. We also gave the Ulta Beauty app a mini makeover, adding features like the ability to buy and e-mail gift cards from your phone; easier use of features like checking Ultamate Rewards account and point balance; an improved version of our try on app, GLAM LAB, a feature to enable push notifications to get alerts about the latest promotions and exclusive product launches, and the capability for guests to use voice search to find products. Mobile app traffic increased more than 300% during the quarter. We continue to build our ulta.com assortment with the addition of more online-only brands like Lime Crime, one of the first digitally native beauty brands, offering edgy makeup and hair color; Little Barn Apothecary bath products; the Pérsona Identity Palette created by YouTube influencer, Simply Sona, and exclusive to Ulta Beauty; and Milani makeup and primers. Online-only brands accounted for a significant portion of our e-commerce growth during the quarter.
 Ulta.com also delivered excellent results with our signature promotions like 21 Days Of Beauty, the Gorgeous Hair event, as well as online-only promotions including platinum perks, beauty sample bags with purchase and limited-time beauty breaks. We launched Shoppable Instagram in August, and we're seeing growing interest and engagement in this platform.
 Now turning to the development of our omni-channel capabilities. Last quarter, we've mentioned our store-to-door test in 40 stores which enable guests to place ulta.com orders in-store and have the products delivered to their homes. We rolled out this capability chain-wide at the end of the third quarter. And while this initiative is still fairly small in terms of demand, it's proving quite useful in satisfying guests looking for hot brands that are not available in every store, such as MAC or Morphe. The number of omni-channel shoppers continues to steadily increase. Guests purchasing both in-store and online now represent 9.1% of our loyalty members compared to 7.5% a year ago. And she's spending 2.7x more than a retail-only guest when she shops in both channels, including doubling her spend in our stores.
 And finally to update you on our supply chain operations. We continue to develop capabilities and leverage economies of scale in our distribution network to deliver exceptional guest experiences while focusing on cost optimization. Our DC network is forecast to ship nearly 20% more units this year compared to 2016, with almost 10% of units supporting our e-commerce business. Our improved operational capabilities are supporting this growth while capturing significant savings. E-commerce costs per order are down 10% year-over-year with a 4.4% reduction in retail replenishment costs over the same period. From the speed-to-guest perspective, the supply chain team has achieved a 20% reduction in retail replenishment lead times, with most of our e-commerce orders processed within 24 hours of an order being placed. We also -- we've also continued to implement technologies to provide greater control and visibility, supporting ongoing efforts to improve service and reduce costs.
 Our DC network has continued to mature with the ramp of our new DC operating model in Greenwood and Dallas. These 2 facilities are expected to process nearly 85% of our e-commerce volume during the peak 2017 holiday season. As we prepare to go live with the Fresno DC next summer, we'll continue to see more e-com demand fulfilled out of our new DC operating model. And speaking of Fresno, construction of our new West Coast distribution center is nearly complete, and hiring of the management team is well underway, and we're on track to open next summer. The Fresno DC will add another 670,000 square feet of capacity that can service up to 400 stores and 45,000 e-commerce orders per day. Fresno will also provide a platform to implement new technologies to increase productivity and significantly reduce transit time for our West Coast customers.
 From an inventory perspective, we've been building our DC and store inventory levels to prepare for the significant volume spike that we anticipate during the holiday season. The team has done a great job maintaining high in-stock levels. And while they remain above goal, we've also focused on achieving our inventory turn goals. Inventory per door grew by 6.5%, well below our total sales comp of 10.3% in the third quarter, a solid achievement in light of the additional safety stock we built in support of our fourth quarter sales projections.
 I'm also really proud of the partnership among the supply chain teams, store operations and merchandising teams to ensure the seamless execution of our many new brand launches and category reflows.
 That completes my progress report on our strategic imperatives. Looking ahead to the rest of the year, we're looking forward to an exciting fourth quarter as our teams work together to inspire our 26 million loyal guests to treat themselves and their friends and families this holiday season. Our merchants have planned a great assortment with lots of newness and exclusives. Our marketing team is executing a compelling 360-degree plan around our Bring the Beauty theme, including new creative for television and radio. Our store teams are ensuring strong execution of the planograms and events, and we're investing in labor hours to give great guest service. And our supply chain and system teams are supporting the stores and ulta.com with improved inventory planning, leading to higher in-stock levels. We are ready.
 And with that, I'll turn it over to Scott to discuss in more detail our third quarter financial results and our outlook for the current quarter. 
Scott Settersten: Thanks, Mary. Good afternoon, everyone. Starting with the income statement. Sales for the third quarter rose 18.6% to $1.34 billion, driven by 10.3% comparable sales growth and strong new store productivity. Adjusting for roughly $14 million in lost sales during to the hurricanes in Texas and Florida, total sales would have been above the high end of our guidance. The total company comp of 10.3% was composed of 6% transaction growth and 4.3% average ticket growth. E-commerce sales growth remained very healthy, contributing 370 basis points to the total comp. We estimate that the hurricanes in September impacted our overall comp rate by about 100 basis points, so the adjusted comparable sales growth of 11.3% was above the high end of our guidance range of 9% to 11%.
 Our retail comp was 6.8%, split evenly between traffic and average ticket growth. Ticket was driven primarily by an increase in average selling price, while growth in units per transaction was up slightly. The salon business comped 3.8%, driven primarily by ticket growth. The retail and salon comp combined were 6.6%.
 Gross profit rate decreased 110 basis points, primarily due to deleverage in merchandise margins. Rent and occupancy leveraged slightly despite more new stores opening versus last year and more high-rent locations in the portfolio year-over-year.
 Supply chain expense was flat as a rate of sales year-over-year as we balanced investments in our DC network and systems with cost efficiencies resulting from the maturation of our Dallas and Greenwood DCs. Product margins declined as expected, reflecting the dynamics we've discussed for the past several quarters relating to channel, category and brand mix headwinds. A higher mix of e-commerce sales and prestige brand boutique sales were the most significant drivers. Increased engagement on our loyalty program also pressured gross margins slightly. In addition, in light of the relative softness in our makeup category, exacerbated by the hurricanes coinciding with our signature event, 21 Days Of Beauty, we elected to drive market share gains through a variety of compelling offers. These actions yielded the desired outcome of significant share gains during the quarter but weighed on gross margin rate more than we anticipated going into the third quarter.
 We also delivered 90 basis points of SG&A improvement, a strong performance in light of additional expenses related to the hurricanes. The improvement was driven by corporate overhead leverage and excellent control of variable store costs, offset by investments in store labor related to our prestige boutique strategy and investments in store hours to execute brand rollouts and reflows as well as to strengthen guest service overall.
 Advertising expense was flat as a percentage of sales. As you may recall, in the first quarter, we benefited from shifting the timing of some of the planned advertising expenses into the third and fourth quarters.
 Turning to EPS. Earnings per share grew 21.4% to $1.70. A few puts and takes to cover here. We had a $0.04 benefit in the third quarter related to a lower tax rate compared to the third quarter of last year, in part due to the new accounting standard that changes how companies report the tax effects of employee stock option exercises and vesting of equity awards. Earnings per share were negatively impacted by about $0.08 from lost sales and one-time costs associated with the hurricanes in September.
 In terms of more permanent and strategic impacts, we continue to return excess cash to shareholders through our share repurchase program. Earnings per share in the third quarter benefited by about $0.03 due to the lower share count year-over-year.
 Moving on to the balance sheet. Inventories increased 6.5% on a per-store basis, well below the comp rate, a solid performance given the significant investments in new brands and boutiques, the ramping of the Dallas DC and inventory to support high in-stock levels for the robust comp growth anticipated this holiday season. Capital expenditures were $144 million for the quarter, driven by new stores, systems and fixtures for brand expansions. We ended the quarter with $107 million in cash and short-term investments.
 In terms of share buybacks, we continue to be more active with repurchase activity within our 10b5-1 plan in view of the pullback in our share price. During the third quarter, we repurchased approximately 591,000 shares of our stock at a cost of $131.7 million. As of October 28, 2017, approximately 136 million remain available under the 425 million share repurchase program announced in March 2017.
 Turning now to guidance for the fourth quarter and full year 2017. For the fourth quarter, we expect sales to be in the range of $1.926 billion to $1.959 billion versus $1.581 billion last year. We expect comparable sales to increase in the range of 8% to 10% versus 16.6% last year. E-commerce sales are expected to grow in the 40% range. We plan to open approximately 16 new stores in the fourth quarter compared to 25 last year. We're planning to open more stores in Q1 2018 compared to Q1 2017. And combining the timing impacts, Q4 preopen expense is expected to be flattish as a rate of sales. Diluted earnings per share are expected to be in the range of $2.73 to $2.78 versus $2.24 last year, with modest operating margin deleverage expected. We expect gross profit to be flattish as we are now forecasting less leverage on rent and occupancy costs on a more moderate retail comp expectation compared to earlier in the year. Our current forecast also includes prudent assumptions for merchandise margin in light of current category dynamics. We anticipate that SG&A expense will deleverage as we are planning higher labor costs driven by the full rollout of the prestige boutiques for the year that puts additional pressure on the payroll line in the short term as well as a slight deleverage of marketing expense related to the timing of advertising costs that were moved from Q1. These factors will be partly offset by leverage of corporate overhead expenses.
 The tax rate for Q4, excluding any impact of the new accounting standards for share-based payments, is expected to be 37.4%. And our fully diluted share count is estimated at 61.4 million.
 Rolling that up for the full year guidance. We expect to end the year with 1,074 stores, and we'll complete 11 major remodels and 7 relocations. We expect to grow our e-commerce business approximately 50% to 60%. We are maintaining our expectations for total company comps to be in the 10% to 11% range. FX is now expected to be approximately $450 million compared to our previous view of $460 million, which includes new stores, remodels, relocations, approximately 700 prestige brand expansions and investments in systems. We are maintaining our guidance for earnings per share growth to be in the high 20s percentage range. This includes the impact of the 53rd week which is estimated to represent about $100 million in sales and $14 million in pretax earnings. It also includes the impact of the third quarter hurricanes, assumes share buybacks in the 370 million range and assumes a full year tax rate of 35.6%.
 Operating margin is still expected to increase modestly for the year, albeit a bit less than initially planned, due to the actions we took in the third quarter to capture market share and the elements of the Q4 P&L I just described. Updating our initial view of the 20 to 30 basis points of operating margin improvement, we now anticipate margin rate to be in the range of flat to up about 10 basis points.
 We remain confident in our long-term range plan to deliver earnings per share growth in the low 20 percentage range and we continue to plan for margin rate improvement to build in 2018 and '19 to reach our goal of 15% by the end of 2019. This margin expansion is expected to come primarily from rent and occupancy leverage, benefits of our supply chain investments and more efficient distribution centers and systems and corporate overhead savings as we gain efficiencies and lap over significant investments in the last several years that have enabled us to execute our growth strategies and infrastructure initiatives.
 Now I'll turn it over to the conference call host to moderate the Q&A session. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Ike Boruchow of Wells Fargo. 
Irwin Boruchow: Scott, I guess my question is for you on the gross margin line. I apologize if I missed this. But for the gross margin decline in Q3, can you parse out how much of that was fixed cost deleverage versus merchandise margin? And then I -- if you guided gross margin for Q4 flattish, could you also walk us through the puts and takes on merch margin versus fixed cost? 
Scott Settersten: Sure, Ike. Well, I'm not going to parse out the basis points, but I'd give you a little bit more color on what we described in our prepared remarks. So as far as 3Q is concerned, again we are down 110 basis points actual for the quarter. After going-in assumption, it was kind of flattish, I would say, on the gross profit line. So again, part of it was expected and part of it was unexpected. So the expected part, I guess I would say prestige boutiques, those brands, put a little bit more pressure on gross profit. We've talked about that now for quite some time. Again, those brands performed extremely well during the quarter, were a bigger percentage of the pie overall, so created some downward pressure on rate. Similar story with e-commerce. Again, the going-in assumption was about a 50% growth rate, ended up in just over 60% year-over-year for the quarter. E-commerce, with some of the promotional activity that we do usually typically over indexes there, right, with the digital connectivity that we see there. Again, e-commerce creates a little headwind on the gross profit line. But on the EBIT line, we're almost agnostic on where that sale goes, whether it's through the retail fleet or through our e-commerce network. So very happy there overall with the results. As far as the unexpected piece was concerned, again, color cosmetics continue to be a little softer than we were thinking back in late August when we put our forecast together. And then, of course, we had the hurricanes, right, spring on us in a much more significant way than maybe you've seen with some other retailers. So a lot of stores impacted, a lot of them very high volume stores in key markets for us. At the peak of one of our signature events for the year, I think we had more than 1,000 store days impacted either full closures or partial closures. Again, tough to determine what the CNN effect on some of that stuff was, right? It was raining hard in a lot of parts across the U.S., not in just those 2 markets. So that, we reacted to during the quarter. We saw some softness in the sales trends and we reacted appropriately. Ulta, luckily, we've got a lot of levers we can pull. And so we immobilized the internal forces here, and we're able to recapture a lot of those sales, albeit at a somewhat lower margin rate. So fixed store cost, there was leverage there although not as much as we thought, right, kind of going into the quarter because the retail comps were a little bit softer. And of course, thinking back to last year on the very healthy retail comps that we generated, not consistent with the rates of leverage we saw last year. Supply chain did a little better overall. Again, we were thinking it'd be kind of flattish but they did a little better than we were expecting going in, so things are working well in the back of the house. Pivoting then, so 3Q and looking ahead at 4Q, gross profit, we're thinking kind of flattish for the quarter overall. Again, merchandise margins, we're thinking flattish to down modestly for the quarter. So again, not the same kind of circumstances apparent in the fourth quarter. So it's already a promotional period, right? So margin rates are already under pressure from just the nature of the overall environment there. We've got things we talked -- we referred to the credit card which gives us a lot of tailwinds with basket build and things like that. So we're doing a great job signing up people there. Gift card is another thing that we've got implemented with really healthy growth rates there year-over-year. Of course, those are post holiday kind of redemptions by and large, right, where the margin rate environment I'd say is a little bit healthier, right, and maybe preholiday. So we're optimistic that we can hold margin rates flattish in the fourth quarter. Fixed store cost leverage, we expect to get some in the fourth quarter, again, probably not as much as we saw last year on a healthier retail comp overall. Supply chain, we're going to get leverage there this year in the fourth quarter, which is quite a bit of different story than what we've seen the last few years in the fourth quarter when we've been ramping up these new distribution centers, right? So again, a great story. Those buildings are online. We're optimizing them, and they are driving efficiencies and leverage for us overall on the gross profit line. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Omar Saad of Evercore ISI. 
Omar Saad: I was wondering if you could expand upon the category shifts you're seeing a little bit in the marketplace. It sounds like skincare continues to strengthen as the makeup color business softens. How should we think about that dynamic? Is -- and the skincare dynamic relative to makeup, is it an online purchase? Is it a replenishment? Do you see a lot of innovation coming down on that side of the business as well? Just help us think about that transition and what it might look like from our side. 
Mary Dillon: Yes, well, first of all, I would say that one of the great things about the Ulta Beauty business model is that we participate -- the All Things Beauty, All in One Place line is real, so we participate across all the major beauty categories which gives us a lot of ability to drive growth and share gains and flex with category cycles. So I would say, first of all, we take a really macro kind of long-term view in the sense there's many categories within the big beauty category and there are cycles that happen. One thing I'll just say is that -- I'll come back to skincare in a minute, but guests are just as engaged as ever in makeup. And so if you just look at what's happening on YouTube or Instagram, or our own followers across channels, if you look at the trends that we see in demographics, the beauty enthusiasts segment of the future, millennials, Latinas, teens, all over index particularly in makeup. So we feel confident that the involvement and engagement in makeup, the somewhat softer current performance is fairly -- it's not a long-term trend. It's about innovation, lapping over some really big kinds of innovation platforms in the last couple of years. So makeup is great. We also saw not only strong growth but really strong share gains continue for us in makeup. So that's good. Now as you said, what's kind of cool is that we've seen some acceleration in some other categories. So in particular, fragrance and skincare both accelerated in terms of growth and our share gain, and we think that has a long-term life to it as well. Skincare has really been driven by a lot of innovation, and Dave can add more color to this. But some interesting innovation, what I'd call faster, funner ways to do skincare like masks or more interesting efficacious ingredients from Korea. And so that's interesting. And we think that's going to -- it has no reason to continue to not be strong across both prestige and mass. And we see a lot of innovation coming down the pike, I'd say across all categories for us as we look out into fourth quarter and 2018. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Joe Altobello of Raymond James. 
Joseph Altobello: Want to talk about your store target of 1,400 to 1,700 doors over the next few years. And I know in the past, you've mentioned that some of that will be determined by how quickly your e-commerce business grows. And obviously, that's been outpacing, I think, both your and our expectations. So how should we think about that ultimate number given the rapid pace of e-commerce growth? Will we expect to be toward the low end of that range in, call it, 5 years or so? 
Mary Dillon: Well, I would say, first of all, we love the fact that our e-commerce growth is picking up. And as Scott said I think very well, we're agnostic about it from a bottom-line profit perspective, but we're actually really positive about it as it relates to customer engagement. So the folks that are like 9% of our loyalty members that are omni-channel, multichannel right now, by far our best guests in terms of spending, almost 3x the amount of somebody who's only shopping in-store but she's also shopping even more in-store than before. So we talked about this a lot. It's not a shift, it's not a channel shift, it's actually an expansion of us getting more per share of wallet. So that's all great. Now of course, we're always thinking about our physical footprint and buildout, and that's something that we're very rigorous and disciplined about. We have no reason to change that target right now. There's a range for a reason because it's a range. I don't think there's any one point in time. But to me, the best thing is that, every year, our store fleet continues to perform better than the year before. So 2017 store fleet is ahead of budget and our IRR target, and we continue to see it strengthen. So I guess the best way to think about it is we actually know that when we build stores, the e-commerce business also grows with it so they actually are complementary, not stealing from each other. And so we have no reason to think that dynamic will change. And we, of course, are very disciplined about our real estate decisions. But we would keep that targeted range that it's in right now. 
Scott Settersten: And I would just remind folks, again, Ulta is a little bit different than a lot of typical retailers that are struggling these days, right? I mean, these stores are built to generate significant SLE, 20% plus at low to mid-single-digit comp kind of numbers on the top line. So again, while we monitor store productivity very closely, there's nothing today that would suggest to us that there needs to be any kind of radical adjustment to our long-range targets at this point. 
Joseph Altobello: That's helpful. Just one last one, is there any lingering impacts from the hurricanes in the fourth quarter? 
Scott Settersten: No. I mean, there -- it's a pretty sizable charge we had to absorb. So there's insurance claims being prepared, and we're working on trying to get as much of that back as we can in the fiscal year. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Steph Wissink of Jefferies. 
Stephanie Schiller Wissink: Mary, just a question on your comments around the pipeline into 2018, innovation, newness and then some of your initiatives around recasting your mass makeup business. Could you just talk a little bit more about some of that enthusiasm? 
Mary Dillon: Yes. Actually, you know what, I'll let Dave take this since he's the closest to it. Dave? 
David Kimbell: Yes. No, we were -- yes, we're excited about it. I mean, we're, of course, always looking to continue to innovate in every category that we have. And makeup is no exception, particularly given the importance in some of the things that we've seen this year. So on both sides of the house, in prestige and in mass, we've got quite a wide variety of newness coming in. And I'd classify that in kind of 3 ways that does apply to both mass and prestige. One is continued innovation from some of our biggest brands, brands that have been successful this year, like Tarte and Too Faced brands, that have been important drivers for us in the past, like NYX and Urban and IT Cosmetics will continue to have strong pipelines that we're excited about, and we're partnering with them to leverage our loyalty program and all the other assets we have to make them as big as possible. So we feel very positive by what we're seeing as we look out through 2018. We'll also see expansion into more stores of existing brands, brands like MAC. Mary mentioned e.l.f. A number of brands that are in limited doors today will continue to roll out through 2018. And there are a number of new brands that we'll be launching in 2018 as well. Mary talked about a reset in mass. And while we're not announcing all of the specifics yet, we see that as a growth driver of our business, an important element of our business to bring new guests in and allow them to ultimately shop the entire store. So we've got some exciting new brands coming in, in both sides of the store as well. So it will be a well-rounded set of innovation in makeup and the same applies in haircare, skincare and across the whole store. So we're optimistic and positive about what we're seeing. 
Mary Dillon: And I'll just add, too, that we're also actively participating with -- there's a lot of social media influencer brands that are hot. And so we talked about this a little bit but Morphe, Dose of Colors, Lime Crime, these are bands that were born more through social media. But also many of these brands also understand that the benefit of sort of merging the digital and physical is important for their guests and for our guests as well. And so we're seeing some nice growth with those brands, too. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Adrienne Yih of Wolfe Research. 
Adrienne Yih-Tennant: So Mary, I guess my first question is for you. Can you discuss how you choose your strategic response to an increasingly promotional environment, either maximizing profit or market share dollars? And what are the competitive factors that sway your decision? And then for Scott, op margins had been down the past 2 consecutive quarters. When we look to 2018, should we think that Q1 and Q2 still have that pressure and then we expand again in the back half the year? 
Mary Dillon: Thank you, Adrienne. So I'll start with your first question. I guess stepping back, this is really -- I mean, we really are playing the long game here and believe that Ulta Beauty has the most relevant proposition for the beauty enthusiasts now and into the future. And for us, it's really about long term, driving more guests, gaining more beauty enthusiasts into our loyalty program and also capturing more per share of wallet. So each quarter is a little bit different. But we're looking to drive not just long-term share gains but really long-term engagement with our loyalty platform. And so this quarter was an example of -- we did not want to miss the opportunity to continue to -- on the momentum. We gained 1.8 million new loyalty members this quarter. So I consider that a long-term play not just a short-term price promotion play. Now we need it to drive some traffic because there was some disruption with the hurricanes and some softness in the category. But for us, that's kind of how we think about it strategically, long term, it's how do we continue on the momentum that we have to drive and get an even bigger loyalty program, which really is the -- I guess the flywheel to drive our business for the long term. 
Scott Settersten: Yes, so looking ahead on operating margin, again, we know that's the hot button with our investor group, right? And so there were some unforeseen circumstances that happen. So softness in the color cosmetics area, we're kind of navigating our way through there as best we can. The hurricanes, we had to react to that. We thought that was the best course of action for us. So the last couple of quarters, we're not what we expected going into 2017, right? But the good news is we were able to respond, and we delivered on our financial commitments to our investors, right, so that's the good news. So as far as the quarter sequencing goes next year, I mean, I'm not going to be able to give you really probably the detail that you want on that, but we're prepared today just to give people a sense, like as we're thinking of 2018, here's a couple of data points, right, that we can process on. So again, Dave talked to newness for next year, right? So Ulta Beauty, great innovator, we'll continue to be next year. And we're -- our merchant teams have been working hard with the marketing folks figuring out what can we do next year, right, to reenergize the color cosmetics space both with our existing vendor partners and new folks, right, that we can bring in to the assortment overall, with the thought being how do we mitigate some of the merchandise margin pressure, right, that we've been facing here recently. So that's number one. When we think about other drivers for operating margin for the long term, so one thing is CapEx for next year. Right now our preliminary view again -- and we're not guiding for next year, but the preliminary view looks like CapEx will take a significant step down next year, right, below $400 million, significantly below $400 million versus the $450 million, let's call it, that we had in 2017. So some of you have heard us talk about what's driving some of that. So we've kind of cycled through the peak on the boutique rollouts, right? So there's been a lot of accelerated depreciation flowing through the P&Ls the last couple of years related to these remodel activities that we've taken across the large part of the fleet, right, to keep our store fleet looking fresh. So we're kind of past that now. I'd say we're taking a more moderate view with some of the back-of-the-house investments. So we've made significant investments the last couple of years, and now we're shifting to more of an optimization kind of mode, right, making sure we're getting the value out of those investments we've made the last few years. And you've heard us talk about forecasting and replenishment and master data and space planning and all those kinds of things. So that's kind of what I'm referring to there. Fixed store cost leverage. So again, we're not -- it's not a straight line, right? This year, we've had some higher rent, kind of higher profile locations go online. They were the right real estate decisions for us at this point in time. But they put pressure on margin rate. There's no avoiding that, right? So next year, as we look in at our store rollout plan, it's going to be what I would call a more normalized kind of rent structure, so more of our -- the historical vanilla power center kind of location. So again, we'll get the benefit of cycling some headwinds in fixed store cost this year. And then finally, cost optimization. Again, you've heard Mary and I talk about this over the last year or so. There's a more formal plan being put in place for 2018. That's going to go live with boots on the ground. We believe there's plenty of opportunity to leverage our scale and to reduce inefficiencies that built up over the years naturally as we've been primarily focused on growth. So we think there's a great opportunity there as well. So we just want our investor base to understand that there are specific actions being taken to help us drive operating margin leverage in 2018 and beyond, and we'll share more details on all that when we talk with you on our fourth quarter call. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Rupesh Parikh of Oppenheimer & Co. 
Erica Eiler: This is actually Erica Eiler on for Rupesh. So first, I just wanted to also touch on the promotional environment. Just curious how the holiday promotional environment has progressed this year versus perhaps recent years? And then as we move past the holiday, any thoughts you can share about how you're thinking about the promotional environment? Are you expecting that as some of that innovation starts to roll through that the potential need to be promotional should abate? 
Mary Dillon: Yes, I'll start with the second part of your question and then maybe, Dave, you can add on the holiday piece, too. But I would say, not to be redundant, but I'm really proud about the fact that we've got a business model that has a lot of levers and, frankly, flexibility. And so we've worked really hard over the past few years to really reduce our reliance on more broad-based, broad scale, just blunt instrument I'd call it, to a much more sophisticated lever, marketing mix. That's allowed us to do a couple of things. One, allowed us to participate in things that are driving the kind of brand awareness that we have today. I mean, to have 50% unaided brand awareness right now is actually a really big deal. And so we've been able to kind of pull back on broad-based discounting and still maintain a reasonable overall marketing spend by shifting into things that are driving awareness, allowing us to participate in the social channels where the journey is happening, from people learning about beauty, and then do more demand creation in a more targeted fashion, right? So the whole point of the loyalty program is to be as targeted as we can. That, in conjunction with exciting brands and assortment and events and all that, right, that all comes together in a great mix that allows us, I think, to be really smart and efficient. So there's times that we had to flex levers more aggressively than others, and it would be our intention to be less about price discounting and more about targeted promotions. And part of what we invest in -- or investing in over time is the ability to get even more personalized in everything we do. So that's the notion of -- at a time where we're using tools to get people into loyalty program, that provides long-term benefits because we know that our ability to target them with really exciting relevant offers that are not really relying on discounting but just exciting offers will only increase over time. So that's kind of a long answer to your question, but that's the goal, to have leverage, have flexibility but also continue to bias towards more targeted personalization. Holiday, Dave? 
David Kimbell: Yes, as far as holiday, I mean I think Scott said earlier, of course, the holiday is always a very promotional period, it has been in the past, and we don't expect that to change this year. It's -- we're only about a week into the heaviest part of the holiday period, so it's hard to say exactly what -- how it will shake out for the rest of the period. But so far, we've only seen perhaps maybe modest changes to promotional strategy or intensity, and we'll be watching carefully. Our plan is to continue to do all the things Mary had said, continue to drive promotion where it's necessary as we have planned through the rest of the holiday period, but deal with great products, our loyalty program, advertising, marketing, in-store experience, all those things to drive through the rest of this holiday period. 
Erica Eiler: Okay, that's helpful. And then just quickly, can you share with us any potential plans that -- what you plan to do with the excess tax benefit if the proposed tax reform is passed? Just curious, should we expect that to flow through to the bottom line? Are you planning to reinvest it? Just any thoughts you can share on that potential tax benefit would be helpful. 
Scott Settersten: Yes, another question on everyone's minds, right? It seems -- it may be a little premature to speculate on what we would do with that. But I would tell you that it'd be subject to very comprehensive discussion with our board about how to best deploy any potential cash tax savings here in the future. I mean, there's lots of things that we have on our road map that potentially we'd like to accelerate to drive the core business. There's things, other growth levers like international, things that we've been thinking about that perhaps we could get a little quicker start on and then, of course, capital structure overall, just making sure we optimize that for the long term. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Dana Telsey of Telsey Advisory. Our next question comes from Steven Forbes of Guggenheim Securities. 
Steven Forbes: So I wanted to focus on the product brand offering. So maybe you can kind of just discuss how you expect the ULTA Beauty Collection to evolve over time as it relates to maybe number of SKUs, the category exposure and really what you want that collection of SKUs to stand for as you think about how it fits into your overall customer value proposition. And then just lastly, still on the same topic, can you touch on how that part of the assortment performed during the most recent quarter, maybe year-to-date? 
David Kimbell: Yes, yes. So our ULTA Beauty Collection is a key part of our overall strategy. It's a part of our business that we're very proud of and have invested in pretty, pretty aggressively over the last year or so. We've revamped our packaging, the formulations, how we market it, how we communicate it, we're actually gearing up for even a larger presence of that in early 2018. So we're very overall pleased with its result. It has a strong presence in makeup, of course, but also in skin, bath and then holiday -- the holiday season is a big time for our ULTA Beauty Collection with an expanded assortment that is designed just for the holidays. So we're continuing to invest in all those things and drive that business and, as I said, have positive and optimistic plans in 2018 to make that an even bigger part of our business. Having said that, it's still relatively small in the total store. So it's not going to be the major part of our assortment, but it's one that can add a nice, obviously exclusive, higher margin business and one that we're going to continue to invest in and drive into the future. 
Steven Forbes: And just on that, any commentary on the performance of that selection of SKUs either year-to-date or in the quarter? 
David Kimbell: Yes. We, I guess, hadn't -- we don't historically talk about any individual brand performance. So -- but I'd say overall, again, we're proud and pleased with the history of that brand and optimistic about where it's going into the future. 
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back over to Mary Dillon for closing remarks. 
Mary Dillon: Thank you. I just like to think our 36,000 associates for their incredible commitment to serving our guests and delivering operational excellence. It's a very busy time of the year. And we thank you all for your interest in Ulta Beauty and look forward to speaking with all of you soon. 
Operator: This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation and have a wonderful day.

===== 2017 Q2  (2017-08-24 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Greetings, and welcome to the Ulta Beauty's Second Quarter 2017 Earnings Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Laurel Lefebvre, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed. 
Laurel Lefebvre: Thank you. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us for Ulta Beauty's Second Quarter 2017 Conference Call. Hosting our call are Mary Dillon, Chief Executive Officer; and Scott Settersten, Chief Financial Officer. Also joining us is Dave Campbell, Chief Merchandising and Marketing Officer. 
 Before we begin, I'd like to remind you of the company's safe harbor language. The statements contained in this conference call, which are not historical facts, may be deemed to constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual future results may differ materially from those projected in such statements due to a number of risks and uncertainties, all of which are described in the company's filings with the SEC. [Operator Instructions] 
 I'll now turn it over to Mary. 
Mary Dillon: Thank you, Laurel. Good afternoon, everyone. The Ulta Beauty team delivered another quarter of excellent performance with more than 20% top line growth coupled with robust margin expansion and earnings growth. We exceeded the high end of our guidance for total company sales, driven by strong new store productivity. Second quarter comp performance was a healthy 11.7% on top of 14.4% comps in the second quarter of last year with balanced traffic and ticket growth. Category strength was broad-based, with prestige cosmetics still driving the majority of our comp growth and with the skincare, fragrance and haircare all accelerated. Continued success of our marketing and loyalty program and rapid growth in e-commerce also contributed. In a period during which our market share gains are accelerating, we elected to prioritize earnings growth and margin expansion over comp sales growth. As a result, we chose not to run an incremental promotions in July in order to comp over significant clearance activity at the end of the second quarter of last year. GAAP earnings per share of $1.83 grew 28%. This growth was driven in large part by gross profit expansion resulting from lower promotional levels year-over-year as well as solid expense management. We're also benefiting from some strong execution across all parts of our enterprise. 
 Turning to a more detailed discussion on the elements of our strategy that drove our results in the second quarter. I'll begin with our strategic imperative to acquire new guests and deepen loyalty of existing guests. Our loyalty program continues to represent one of our most valuable assets. As of the end of July, Ultamate Rewards grew to 25.4 million active members, up 23% year-over-year, driven by merchandising and marketing efforts and excellent in-store conversion. With 1.4 million new members added in the quarter and nearly 5 million new active members acquired over the past year, our share of the beauty enthusiast market has increased to 27%, with plenty of opportunity remaining to attract more members. Retention rates, sales per member, frequency of purchase and average member ticket are all strong and stable. 
 Our Ultamate Rewards credit card continues to ramp up. We just celebrated the 1-year anniversary of the launch and continue to make improvements to the credit card application experience at ulta.com as well as roll-out initiatives to drive credit card application. 
 Our new grocery store gift card program continues to expand into the Blackhawk network, and we recently launched into additional retailers like Albertsons, Safeway and Publix. We expect to be rolled out to 22 retailers in 12,000 locations by the end of the third quarter. This program is off to a great start, and we expect it to be a more meaningful contributor to sales in the fourth quarter when gifting is a much larger part of our business. 
 Awareness of the Ulta Beauty brand continues to rise. In the second quarter, we reached 87% aided awareness versus 84% a year ago, and our unaided awareness increased by 7 points at 47% this year versus 40% last year. Our advertising strategies, including new creative for television and radio and increased investment in digital marketing channels, continue to drive awareness of our brand as the preferred destination for beauty. 
 Now we'll move on to our strategic imperative to offer innovative and often exclusive products that our guests love. Our unique assortment continues to drive market share gains across the board. The most recent NPD year-to-date data reflected 4 points of share gain in the prestige categories versus last year with even bigger gains in prestige cosmetics, while fragrance and skincare are continuing to gain momentum. We also gained significant share in the mass categories, makeup, skincare and haircare, while the rest of retail was essentially flat. Our prestige cosmetics category remains strong albeit not quite as fast-growing as last year, while skincare in both mass and prestige, haircare and fragrance are all comping well above plan. 
 While many of our color cosmetics brands are still driving exceptional growth with newness and innovation, a few of our large brands that has delivered several years of stellar comps are not contributing as much growth this year against tough comparison. As a reminder, last year was a huge year for innovation in the lip category, and there were several big influencer-driven make-up palettes that drove tremendous growth for a few brands. The curve momentum we're seeing in the skincare, haircare and fragrance categories is producing more balanced growth in the portfolio and demonstrating the value of our All Things Beauty business model. 
 While new product introductions in the makeup category hasn't been quite as strong as last year, we don't see any indication that the beauty enthusiasts as any less passionate about makeup. Actually, it's even more engaged with beauty and social media channels. And the interest in beauty in key growing demographics, like Latinas, millennials and teens continues to work in our favor. We're confident the pipeline of newness, excitement and innovation is stronger in the back half of the year compared to the second quarter. Here's why. We continue to have access to more and more coveted brands. We recently announced the addition of Bumble and bumble haircare products from the Estée Lauder portfolio, rolling out online and in 500 stores next month. We launched an exclusive solutions-based skincare makeup line for active lifestyles from Clinique, called CliniqueFIT, to capitalize on the athleisure trend. We've rolled out about 400 of the 700 prestige boutiques featuring Lancôme, Clinique, Benefit and MAC in our plan this year. 
 So to update on the highly anticipated MAC roll-out, we launched about 600 MAC SKUs online in early May and currently have 60 stores rolled out with plans to build more than 100 MAC boutiques by year-end. Initial results have been excellent, with MAC quickly becoming the #1 or #2 brand where it's launched. In addition to offering compelling assortment, MAC boutiques are staffed with highly trained makeup artists, providing makeup services to our guests, which further enhances the experiential nature of our stores. MAC is a great partner. And next week, we're introducing 5 handpicked MAC products that are impulse fixers chain-wide.
 Many brands that we've successfully launched in a limited number of stores are also expanding into additional doors. For example, NARS started out with a few SKUs on an [indiscernible] then went on an end cap and now expand to 9 feet in a few hundred stores. We've rolled out Drybar haircare products and tools chain-wide, and the Estée Lauder wall is expanding to hundreds more doors. We recently reset our exclusive IT Cosmetics brush assortment, making it easier to shop with the new elevated presentation. We'll also be setting 250 stores with an elevated IT Cosmetics presentation, which offers problem solution shopping, featuring more than 50 new and exclusive SKUs in an expanded footprint to maximize exposure of one of our most popular brands. 
 We also see opportunity to [ enhance ] smaller categories as well. We've elevated our bath assortment across both mass and prestige brands. On the mass side, we've launched popular bath brands, da Bomb and frank body. We're rolling out in select stores and online a prestige bath fixture, featuring new brands, Cowshed, RITUALS and Thymes. We also remerchandised our sun care department, pulling all brands together in a new sun shop, driving the acceleration of comps in this category, with particular strength in St. Tropez and Sun Bum brand. 
 As beauty enthusiasts increasingly look to social media to discover brands, we've accelerated our efforts to add new brands with tremendous engagement on social media. Many of these brands have millions of followers on YouTube and Instagram, and our guest response with these brands has been very positive. To give you a few examples of these up-and-coming social-media-driven brands, we're excited to announce an exclusive partnership with Morphe Cosmetics, known for high-quality makeup brushes, palettes and influencer collaboration. This will be both in-store and online later this quarter. 
 We continue to expand our Korean beauty offering with the roll-out of K-beauty discovery platform MEMEBOX in several hundred stores, featuring skincare lines, like I Dew Care and NuMe. And after great success introducing certain brands at ulta.com, we're now adding NuMe haircare tools and e.l.f. cosmetics to select stores. Recent online-only additions, such as Dose of Colors, Ofra, Cane + Austin, DERMAFLASH, Colorescience, Zoella Beauty, Velour Lashes, Lottie London and Wunderbrow are all contributing to our stellar e-commerce growth. 
 And finally, the ULTA Beauty Collection continues to roll out new and rebranded assortment. Recently launched bath lines and Korean-inspired skincare products are off to a strong start. We continue to partner with social media influencers within our private label offering, and the palette we just introduced with YouTube star, Melisa Michelle, has been very well received. 
 Now we'll turn to our services business. Salon sales grew 15.3% and comped 7.7% in the second quarter, and we're seeing 16% year-over-year growth in the number of 12-month active salon members. These results demonstrate that Ulta Beauty is achieving significant market share gains in the salon industry. We completed more than 1.4 million service experiences in the quarter, up 13% compared to last year. Strength in color services, blowouts and makeup services drove this performance. Our guests are also showing interest in bold and nontraditional hair color, and we're showcasing this in our fall trend collection, including a soft lavender shade, called [ geo balayage ] and a look with crimson and caramel highlights. We have a thriving salon business that drives meaningful differentiation versus a brick-and-mortar retailer. As a reminder, less than 6% of our guests [indiscernible] best guests, spending nearly 3x more than non-salon shoppers. 
 We'll continue to drive this important strategy for Ulta Beauty. In fact, we developed these consumer insights and hypotheses about how to innovate even further in the salon industry. To go after this opportunity, we just launched a major test on an improved salon business model based on guest and associate insights. The program is designed to enhance the salon designers and guest experience and the overall effectiveness of our salons. The new model is now being tested in 2 markets. The key components of the model are a simplified menu for hair and skin services, a more transparent pricing model to clearly and consistently communicate pricing to our guests, and increased training for our stylists. This is just one example of innovations we're developing and testing to continue to drive growth and differentiation for the long term. 
 Now turning to our store roll-out. We opened 20 stores in the second quarter, ending the quarter with 1,010 stores and tracking to execute our 2017 program of 100 net new stores. We beat the high end of our total company sales guidance by $12 million due to better-than-expected new store productivity. New stores are opening above plan, with many of our new stores going forward, opening with all 4 highly productive prestige boutiques, including MAC, Clinique, Lancôme and Benefit. We opened our new Michigan Avenue store in Chicago in June, and it's off to a very strong start with higher-than-expected sales in both products and salon services. This bodes well for the other urban store openings in our plan later this year. We also continue to see very low cannibalization of existing store sales, further supporting our view that a brick-and-mortar shopping experience in concert with a great online experience continues to be very important in the beauty category. 
 To update you now on our e-commerce business. ulta.com grew 72.3%, maintaining the great momentum we've seen for the past few quarters as we enhance the product assortment and content, improve the shopping experience and shorten the time to fulfill orders. We saw excellent results from promotions, like our Gorgeous Hair event and online-only promotions. MAC was a meaningful contributor to our growth after launching on ulta.com in early May. E-commerce sales were driven by transaction growth. Total traffic growth was up 73%, and mobile traffic grew 104%, driven by investments in digital marketing, pay channels including pay search, affiliate, display retargeting and paid social, including Facebook, Twitter and YouTube. We continue to update, enhance our mobile app, which at last count has been downloaded by 4.4 million guests and has a 5-star rating in the iTunes App Store. Traffic for our mobile app is up 450% year-over-year, with 41 million visits during the quarter. 
 We continue to make progress with our omnichannel road map. Currently, we're testing the ability to order from ulta.com in-store and deliver to the guest home if there were any products that were not available once she visited our store. This program, which we call store to door, is being tested in 40 stores, and we'll work on deploying other projects to strengthen our omnichannel capabilities. E-commerce profitability continues to improve. While still slightly less profitable overall compared to our bricks and mortar business, we're agnostic about which channel our guests shop since e-comm sales are largely incremental and represent a means to drive higher wallet share and higher margin dollars from those guests who shop both channels. Omnichannel customers now represent 8.8% of our loyalty members, up from 7.2% a year ago. And like our salon guest, she's a very valuable guest, spending 2.7x more than a retail-only guest and has 9.5 transactions per year compared to 4 transactions for retail-only. Our beauty enthusiast guest is obsessed with newness, and the vast majority of our online purchases are items she hasn't purchased in the last 12 months. Her shopping behavior online is even more driven by exploration and newness than in-store with very few repurchases of exact items in either channel. 
 Turning to our progress in our supply chain operations. Our supply chains team continue to ramp up our Dallas and Greenwood buildings and supported ulta.com's rapid growth in the second quarter, with nearly 80% of e-commerce order volumes shipping out of our new distribution centers. Our DCs process significantly more e-commerce shipments than forecasted during this quarter while improving productivity, decreasing cost per shipment and keeping labor costs in line with forecast. 
 Construction of our new distribution center in Fresno, California is on track, and we've begun installation of the material-handling equipment. We also began hiring for key roles, and we're planning to open in the summer of 2018. The Fresno DC will add another 670,000 square feet of capacity that can service up to 400 stores and 45,000 e-commerce orders per day. Fresno will also provide a platform to implement some new distribution technology to increase productivity and significantly reduce transit time for our West Coast customers. 
 So that wraps up my discussion of our progress on each of our strategic imperative, and I'll turn over to Scott to discuss in more detail the drivers of our second quarter financials and our outlook for the third quarter and the full year. 
Scott Settersten: Thank you, Mary. Good afternoon, everyone. Starting with the income statement. Sales for the quarter grew 20.6% to $1.29 billion, driven by 11.7% comparable sales growth and excellent new store productivity. The total company comp of 11.7% was balanced, composed of 5.5% transaction growth and 6.2% average ticket growth. E-commerce sales growth remained very strong, contributing 340 basis points to the total comp. The retail comp was 8.4%, made up of 3.4% traffic growth and 5% average ticket, driven by increases in average selling price. The salon business comped 7.7%, driven primarily by ticket growth. The retail and salon comp combined was 8.3%. 
 One callout on the sales growth for the quarter, in addition to the color Mary already provided, is lower year-over-year clearance activity in our stores. During the second quarter of last year, we executed additional markdowns on clearance product to end the quarter with very clean inventories primarily on the mass side of the assortment. This drove some incremental traffic and sales and a larger overall basket during the clearance period last year. As we continue to improve how we manage inventory and benefit from newly implemented systems and processes, we didn't need to repeat that additional clearance activity this year. This lower clearance level was a modest headwind to sales growth but also helped gross margins. 
 Gross profit leveraged 40 basis points despite comping over a 110 basis point improvement in the second quarter of 2016. We leveraged rent and occupancy cost, and supply chain expense leveraged slightly following several quarters of deleverage as our new distribution centers and supply chain systems mature. Product margins improved modestly as we were slightly less promotional year-over-year. These gains were in part offset by investments to strengthen our salon business and reflect the same dynamics we have been discussing with you for the past several quarters relating to channel, category and brand mix headwinds. 
 We also delivered 10 basis points of SG&A improvement. This was driven by corporate overhead leverage lapping last year's write-off, resulting from the closure of our State Street store in Chicago; and excellent control of variable store costs offset by investments in store labor related to our prestige boutique strategy. Some of the timing benefits we reported in the first quarter related to advertising spend reversed in the second quarter, but we expect advertising expense as a rate of sales to be flat for the full year. 
 Turning to EPS. We had a $0.02 benefit in the second quarter related to the new accounting standard that changes how company's record the tax effects of employee stock option exercises and vesting of equity awards. Adjusted for the lower tax rate, earnings per share increased 26.6%. 
 Now turning to the balance sheet. Inventories increased 10.5% on a per-store basis below the comp rate, a testament to the team's strong inventory management given the significant investments in new brands and boutiques as well as the impact of continuing to ramp up the Dallas distribution center. Capital expenditures were $116 million for the quarter driven by new stores, systems and fixtures for brand expansions. We ended the quarter with $273 million in cash and short-term investments. 
 In terms of share buybacks, we stepped up our activity within our 10b5-1 plan in light of the recent volatility in our share price. During the second quarter, we repurchased approximately 462,000 shares of our stock at a cost of $126.5 million. The resulting lower share count benefited earnings per share by about $0.01. As of July 29, 2017, approximately $268 million remained available under the $425 million share repurchase program announced in March 2017. 
 Turning now to guidance for the third quarter in fiscal 2017. For the third quarter, we expect sales to be in the range to $1.331 billion to $1.353 billion versus $1.13 billion last year. We expect comparable sales to increase in the range of 9% to 11% versus 16.7% last year, our toughest comparison of the year. E-commerce sales are expected to grow in the 50% range. We plan to open approximately 50 new stores in the third quarter, including our first store in Manhattan, versus 42 last year, with fewer stores opening in the fourth quarter compared to 2016. So Q3 preopening is expected to deleverage about 20 basis points. Diluted earnings per share are expected to be in the range of $1.63 to $1.68 versus $1.40 last year, with slight operating margin deleverage expected primarily as a result of the unusual preopening deleverage in Q3. Also recall some of the upside we achieved in the first quarter came from timing of expenses as some cost related to advertising and test-and-learn projects forecasted in the first quarter were pushed later in the year. We also have a significant portion of the boutique roll-out for the year falling into Q3, which will weigh on expenses. This deleverage is related to timing and investments specific to the third quarter and is consistent with our commentary on the cadence of margin impacts since the beginning of the year. Operating margin rate is expected to leverage in the fourth quarter, resulting in leverage for the full year. The tax rate for Q3, excluding any impact of the new accounting standards for share-based payments, is expected to be 37.5%, and fully diluted share count is estimated at 62 million. 
 Now turning to full year guidance. We plan to open approximately 100 stores, all of which will be our prototypical format. We are on track to complete 11 major remodels and 7 relocations during the year. We expect to grow our e-commerce business between 50% and 60%. We are raising the low end of the range for total company comps, which are now expected to be in the 10% to 11% range. CapEx is tracking to be $460 million, including new stores, remodels, relocations, approximately 700 prestige brand expansions and investments in systems to improve inventory visibility, which will enable future omnichannel capabilities. We are flowing through the upside from the second quarter and now anticipate earnings per share growth in the high 20s percentage range. As a reminder, this includes the impact of the 53rd week, assumes share buybacks in the $350 million range and assumes a full year tax rate of 36.5%, including a tax rate of 37.5% in the back half of the year. This EPS outlook excludes any impact from the new accounting standard for share-based payments for the remainder of the year. Operating margin is expected to increase in the 20 to 30 basis point range. 
 And with that, I'll turn it back over to Mary. 
Mary Dillon: Okay. Thank you, Scott. Before we begin the Q&A session, I'd like to just step back for a moment to recap our perspective on the quarter and our business model overall. As you've seen, we posted another double-digit top and bottom line quarter, far outpacing the result of any benchmark retailer. We achieved share gains across all categories, topped 25 million loyalty members, performed over 1.4 million beauty services, exceeded new store performance targets and accelerated growth in our highly incremental e-commerce business all while being less promotional than a year ago. 
 This is a competitive category and our consumer retail habits and expectations rapidly changing, of course, first, beauty has been an attractive category in which to compete and always will be, with over 70,000 physical points of distribution where guests can buy beauty in the U.S. as well as online retailers. This is not new, and we have never been complacent. Our rapid share gains, however, show that our guests love beauty at Ulta Beauty, but we don't rest on our laurels. We all know that shopping behaviors and expectations consumers have for retail are evolving rapidly, and we've been on that from the start. Our business model today and our continued focus on innovation in the areas that are relevant and differentiating to our guests provide me with the utmost confidence in our ability to gain share across multiple categories for many years to come. 
 A few points I'd like to reiterate. We have a unique model that encompasses more brands, categories and price points than anyone else. Our All Things Beauty positioning protects us from being too reliant on any one category. We're relevant to a large and diverse set of beauty enthusiasts, and we're increasingly focused on attracting growing demographic groups like teens, millennials and Latinas, who all overindex in beauty. 
 Our category is highly experiential, where the physical experience is welcome. In fact, 23 million of our guests shop only in our stores, and our new store openings continue to strengthen. Why? Our guests love to discover, explore and feel beauty. Also, our growing beauty services business must be experienced in store as well. But of course, a modern retailer also has to provide an exceptional digital experience from discovery to shopping, and we do that as well. And we will continue to invest in these areas, as evidenced by our e-commerce -- exceptional e-commerce growth. 
 And finally, we have a powerful and increasingly personalized loyalty program that our guests are highly engaged in. We're both driving our short-term performance and continuing to imagine and innovate for the future. We have many levers at our disposal. We have no blinders on, and we're playing offense to drive our performance and create long-term shareholder value with a balanced approach to driving sales and profits. 
 And now I'll turn it over to our conference call host to moderate the Q&A session. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Steph Wissink with Jefferies. 
Stephanie Schiller Wissink: Just one point of clarification, Scott, on the labor relation in other boutiques, so labor related to those brand boutiques. Can you remind us what the cost-share arrangement is with the brands themselves? And then my question, Mary, related to your comments on loyalty additions, I'm curious if you're seeing any changes in the demographic composition of your newer loyalty members versus what you've experienced in the past. 
Mary Dillon: Maybe I'll start with the loyalty. Steph, thank you for the question. And no, I mean, really, what we're seeing is a very consistent profile. This is a profile, beauty enthusiasts, that cuts across a lot of different demographics, and we're seeing very similar type of new loyalty member. So they ramp up over time. They don't start out as engaged in our program as they become over time but we're seeing very stable metrics around spend per loyalty member, frequency of visits and that kind of -- those kind of metrics, so very consistent. 
Scott Settersten: And as far as the boutiques are concerned, we don't get into a lot of details around that for competitive reasons, but I would say the third quarter each year is kind of the peak area where we see expense challenge in the P&L and it's primarily -- some of it is write-offs that we accelerate, right, from the existing store, fixturing and things that we have to remove in order to put those new boutiques into service. But the real incremental cost of the business in the early days is the labor piece of the equation. So we've been under that SG&A line on our P&L. There's been a fairly significant deleveraging of store payroll over the course of the last, call it, 6 quarters. It's kind of peaking now in the third quarter of 2017 just because of the multiple years now that we're kind of stacking on top of each other with the boutique additions. But again, over the long term, this is going to drive huge sales and margin dollars for the company. These our brands that our guests want and have wanted for a long period of time. So it's definitely the best decision for our investors for the long term. 
Operator: Our next question is from Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. 
Simeon Gutman: So Mary, my question is clearly, your strategy is working and the competition is -- does seem to be increasing. And it seems like the market's worried about the changing variables that's happened most recently. So my question is, what are you doing to protect or extend your lead since we last spoke? Is anything changing in your near-term strategy to address some of the variables that have been changing recently? 
Mary Dillon: Thank you, Simeon. I would say that really, nothing has changed in a lot of ways. This is a very competitive category. It really has been, I think, and it's really not new to us that we will see new competitors come in, loyalty programs, promotions, whatever. And if you look at it, we -- obviously, we are continuing to gain market share even in this very competitive industry. And I really think it's because the basic business model is working and we continue to invest in the areas that we think are going to differentiate us for the future that involve the guest experience, services, our omnichannel capability but, at its core, having great brands, new and exclusive and great brand launches that you can't get anywhere else and participating across categories. So I would say that as we think about it, playing our offense, continuing to really look at our new store productivity, which we're really proud about, our comp growth, our loyalty member growth, we feel that we're really in a great position and continue to lead. And we'll continue to focus on having the broadest assortment across all categories and price points. That's another part of our business model that frankly helps provide some great insulation for us; and invest in the differentiators that I've already mentioned. 
Operator: Our next question is from Brian Tunick with Royal Bank of Canada. 
Brian Tunick: I guess, maybe Scott, given your comments regarding the changes in channel and category and brand, probably not, versus your analyst event where you did say that the EBIT margin recovery wouldn't be pronounced this year. But any thoughts in where you think EBIT margin opportunity could get to in the next 2 to 3 years just given some of the changes, as you called out, on the mix of business. And then maybe Mary, as you talk to your brand partners and obviously a lot of fear also about what could happen with the folks out in Seattle, just curious, what's their perspective? Or what gives you comfort that they're not ready to move on to the bigger platforms? And how do you think that could influence the business? 
Scott Settersten: So I'll start with the operating margin targets. So Brian, again, at this point, we're still very comfortable with our mid-teens target, the same target we've been talking about now for some time. Again, as a reminder for everyone, we're not counting on product margins or merchandise margins to drive us, right, to deliver us to mid-teens. A lot of the benefits that we expect to get us there is coming out of fixed store cost leverage. Again, as the fleet continues to mature, we get a lot more leverage out of those mature stores. In the near term with the boutique investments, we've decided that we're willing to hold back a little bit on the rate in the near term to help those stores drive even higher sales levels over the long term, which should give us additional leverage in those stores and help us on that line. In addition, in fixed store cost leverage, we've talked about supply chain investments. So this is kind of a multiyear initiative here. And again, we're seeing the green shoots of more productivity both in the distribution centers themselves. Mary just called that out, right, over much better productivity here in the most recent quarter with the e-comm flow-through on the orders and also a lot of the merchandise infrastructure that we've been setting up behind the scenes to help us better manage our inventory flow. So again, operating efficiencies throughout the supply chain network and just improving our inventory productivity overall will help us get to that mid-teens target. 
Mary Dillon: Okay. And then we'll cut right to the elephant in the room, I like that. I'm kidding. But to pick up on the second part of your question. Here is what I'd say. First of all, our brand partnerships are stronger than ever. I feel very confident about the relationship that we're building with many brand partners across the spectrum in the beauty industry, proud of how our team is a valued partner. And we've got access to an increasing number of exciting brands that we've talked about and that -- we'll take that for granted, okay. So first of all, I will start with that. Secondly, I can't really speak on behalf of brands, and I generally think most prestige brands aren't that interested in that platform. But having said that, listen, it's not unusual for us to have competitors that carry some of the brands that we carry. So for example, that platform in Seattle already carry some of the brands that we carry, a few examples, Mario Badescu, Butter London, Stila. These are some brands that are sold there as well and sold at Ulta Beauty, and they're growing like crazy for us, right. So it's really not that uncommon to have some of that kind of competitive overlap. We don't have blinders on about this, but I would say at the end of the day, it's really about how we bring it all together. So what do we offer to our brand partners really the true -- a true beauty experience, right, from the experiential part of -- that a guest could have in store to try and play and explore all the way through a great online experience. So for us, it's about -- and one we offer to the guests. You can't get this anywhere else, the categories, brands, price points, the experience in the store. So I guess to answer your question that kind of relates to Simeon's as well, it's really about we just play our offense. We're very focused on the beauty enthusiasts. We think we understand her really well for shopping needs and what she wants in terms of an in-store experience as well as online as well as offerings -- or service offerings. And of course, it all gets wrapped together with an industry-leading loyalty program. So we understand those guests better than anybody else, and she loves our loyalty program. So there's great incentive for her to give us her purchases both in-store and online increasingly to get her loyalty points. So that's how we look at it. 
Operator: Our next question is from Simeon Siegel with Nomura Instinet. 
Simeon Siegel: Mary, when thinking about the new store productivity comment you made, do you think the new store sales might be growing to company average levels faster than before as the brand awareness grows? And I guess essentially, do you think your comp waterfall might be accelerating, which can help explain sales beats even though comps are still within the range? 
Mary Dillon: Well, certainly, our lead hypothesis on why we saw productivity continues to increase is exactly that. We have -- that was one of the effects. We have better brand awareness so every new store that opens, there's folks who'd know more about Ulta Beauty. I would also say we're doing a really great job on not only real estate selections but the grand openings. We've strengthened the tools that we used to drive awareness and guests into the stores initially. Our store teams are doing a fantastic job of converting folks early on into the loyalty program. So all those components together are really helping us to improve our new store productivity. 
Scott Settersten: And we've seen some acceleration over the course of the last couple of years. And again, this doesn't happen in a vacuum. When you do, your marketing is better and more on point and your assortments continue to improve and you've got -- making good real estate decisions. All of these things kind of work in concert to help drive those results. So as far as the waterfall is concerned, it's intact. It's healthy. We just want to keep an eye on that and kind of see itself prove out over a couple of cycles here before we formally, right, make any modifications to our new store model. 
Operator: Our next question is from David Schick with Consumer Edge Research. 
David Schick: You mentioned forgoing the promo as a modest impact to comp in the quarter. Any detail on magnitude versus other impacts to the quarter? And then from choosing not to do it, how has that evolved your thinking on choice and cadence of promo going forward? 
Mary Dillon: Yes. I don't think we'll quantify the exact amount but I would say a big picture -- I think this is probably pretty obvious. We're running this business for long-term shareholder returns, and you have choices, I think, you can make all the time. So at a time that we are -- continually have very strong share gains, I'd say the philosophy is we don't really need to go buy comp. And so we chose to end the quarter with less versus more promotion year-over-year. We had a very healthy comp with less promotion year-over-year. And so that, to me, was obviously the right decision. I feel very good about -- and it's a little tempting to want to drive it up above a 12, but it just wouldn't have been the right thing for us to do frankly. So I feel good about that and, I think as we look at our second half plans, feel very confident about the pipeline of newness and promotions that we have coming. So I would say that it's just really the situational decision that we all think was right. 
Operator: Our next question is from Erinn Murphy with Piper Jaffray. 
Erinn Murphy: I guess just following up on the promotional environment and some of the comments we've heard from the department stores particularly in the last couple of quarters, has that changed how you're approaching the 21 Days Of Beauty this September? Are there anything, whether it's brand partnerships, that you're going to be deepening during that period? And then just on the gross margin, when should we start to see the credit card impact neutralize? 
Mary Dillon: Well, let me start with the 21 Days Of Beauty. I just want to make a comment and then I'll turn it to Dave to give us some more color on that. But for us, it's not really new that there's promotion happening even in department store channels, although some might have been more aggressive. We definitely did not need to directly respond to it. As I said a couple of times, we gained significant market share in prestige while the rest of retail was negative. So I feel very good that, that proves our -- the reliance -- or I'm sorry, the resilience of our strength of our business model. 21 Days Of Beauty, why don't you... 
David Kimbell: Yes, 21 Days of Beauty, one of our signature events, coming up actually in just couple of weeks. We do that every third quarter. We have seen strengthening performance of that event each -- every one that we've done for the last several -- and the things that have been driving is just stronger brand participation. The core idea of that program is very strategic, and it's really to help our brands, our key prestige brands get introduced, in many cases, to customers that haven't been buying them. So it is a migration strategy that our brands have embraced, that we embrace, that helps drive our customers to experience new brands and new parts of our store. It's a big part of our overall share of wallet strategy. It's to get every customer buying both mass and prestige and multiple hair -- multiple categories throughout the store. So it has been working. As far as this one, we aren't very excited about it, not really going to share yet, for competitive reasons, any specific offers. But I'd say we feel that we've got a very robust collection. We've enhanced the marketing of the program. We have new television coming on air. We've got strong radio, strong digital activity. And our guests, I think, are pretty primed forward already, and we're excited that that's coming in just a couple of weeks. 
Scott Settersten: And as far as the credit card question is concerned, it's a little difficult to kind of project exactly when the headwind might fall away a little bit. I mean, I would just draw attention to last year, what we did. So again, we're always trying to optimize the business quarter-to-quarter as best we can. So last year, when the credit card went live, there was a significant step-up in discounting activity, right. There was a 20% off your initial purchase under the credit card. But while doing that, we pulled back significantly on other parts of our promotional kind of tray. So we try to optimize that. And last year, merchandise margins were flattish to up slightly, I guess, I would say, in the third quarter, right. So now we're lapping that this year. So we just got to keep in mind what the sales balance is and what the margin opportunity might be. So our merchant teams work really hard with us with our analytical support group just to make sure that we've got that in balance and that we're meeting our targets for the year. So again, as we look to the back half of the year, we'll optimize that as best we can, and we're on target to deliver our 20 to 30 basis points of operating margin leverage. 
Operator: Our next question is from Jason Gere with KeyBanc. 
Jason Gere: Just 2 questions. I guess, one, looking at the long-term comp -- and I know year-to-date, you're at 13%. You're talking 10% or 11% for the year, and I see the range for the third quarter. Just I know the fourth quarter does have a tough comp but, I guess, kind of thinking about the holiday season, is there anything that you're seeing out there that might be more promotional? And how are you balancing, as you did in this quarter between the gross margin improvement and taking sales that are less profitable? Just wondering if you could talk maybe a little bit how you're thinking about the holiday season and how that comes in. And then Scott, the follow-up is just as -- and I understand the 20 to 30 basis points of margin improvement for the year with some of the incremental investments out there. Have you kind of, I guess, break down between gross margin and SG&A? 
Mary Dillon: I'll start with holiday. I guess it's an interesting question. We look at holiday every year as the most promotional time of the year, right. Everybody is planning to win at holiday. And so I feel really confident that we've got a great lineup of plans, basically, whether it's product offerings, exclusives or marketing, advertising, merchandising. And the fact that our team does a great job of integrating all of those together year after year to make it even stronger. So it's -- we obviously keep up -- I mean, it's a quarter you're watching every day, and every segment of the quarter is different, right. So we'll be all over that but I feel like we're well situated or well poised to have a great holiday and expect it to be promotional. 
Scott Settersten: And as far as, I guess, P&L line drivers, right, Jason, just directional. So we said for the third quarter, gross profit, slight deleverage; and SG&A, flattish. I mean, the biggest driver is the preopening expense deleverage year-over-year, which again, I want to make people understand that's a good thing, right. I mean, it's a near-term headwind for us, but we're pulling stores forward, right, from where we had planned earlier in the year. And so those stores will get open sooner. They'll start generating profits quicker, and they'll help our store teams be more prepared going into holiday. It helps a litany of things, shrink among many other things that we deal with day to day. So that's a good investment from an investor perspective. As I look out to the fourth quarter, we'll get gross profit back in line. We'll see -- directionally, again, we should see some expansion there as we cycle through the heavy investments in the third quarter with boutiques and new stores and the retail labor payroll I called out earlier. And then we should leverage a little bit on SG&A line as well. So again, I'll let you guys do the detailed math on this one, but that gets you 20 to 30 bps of expansion on operating margin for the full year. 
Operator: Our next question is from Chris Horvers with JPMorgan. 
Christopher Horvers: So my question is, how much do you think the industry growth moderated during the quarter? I know you mentioned a modest impact from the lack of that clearance promotion in July, but it's also been a while since you haven't put upside to the upper end of your comp. So is the right way to think about it that moderated a couple of hundred basis points? And as you approach the third quarter guidance, has that moderation, I guess, forced you to be less conservative as you typically have been in the past around the guidance with you bracketing The Street? 
Mary Dillon: Yes. Well, I'll start with the first question, which is, it definitely was a quarter where we saw strong growth in all the categories we participate in. So color cosmetics. We saw comps accelerate in skincare, both mass and prestige, haircare, fragrance, bath. So that great benefit of our business model is that we're in every category. We actually are driving. We think we're really focused on some of these categories and helping to drive the growth. We also gained market share across all the categories. But color cosmetics was softer than it's been for the industry, right. People talked about this already, but prestige comp comped well above our house. So we have some brands that we have very strong growth happening from and others that maybe were lapping newness and didn't do it as well as before, same thing in mask. So as we look at what's coming down the pipe for the second half of the year in terms of innovation and newness, we felt very good about it. So again, it wasn't a competitive issue. We gained share but there was -- that segment of total beauty was a little bit softer than it's been. We're lapping over big units from last year platforms, like liquid lip and contouring and some makeup palettes by some influencers. So that's all that. But bottom line, I feel really good -- I know Dave does as well, about the pipeline of brands that we have coming and roll-outs and the unique -- the fact that we participate across the different categories. 
Christopher Horvers: And then on how you approach the guidance for the third quarter? 
Scott Settersten: Yes. So always with a prudent approach. 
Mary Dillon: Yes. 
Scott Settersten: That's always our mantra, trying to be optimistic but realistic at the same time. So I think I've said many times before -- I mean, the overperformance we've seen here over the last, call it, 2 to 3 years, a lot of it has been the newness and how it's performed way above expectations, right. So I mean, you can't continue to bat 1.000 every quarter with new product roll-out. So we saw a little bit more volatility, I guess, right. So it's not any one thing that you can point your finger at. The category, in general, was very healthy. So we're very optimistic. Again, Mary mentioned newness is on a great pipeline of things coming in the third quarter that has us feel really positive about the business. But I would say just be a little bit more conservative on what you think what the upside could be on top of what we're guiding at this point. 
Operator: Our next question is from Ike Boruchow with Wells Fargo. 
Irwin Boruchow: It's a really quick one for Scott. Scott, sorry if I missed it, can you tell us how you're planning the gross margin line in Q3 and Q4? And then talking about pulling out of promotion to balance the comp and margin in July, should we expect more of that going forward? You used to target a 7% to 9% comp. You've done -- been well above that for 2 years. Do you kind of want to ease back into that 7% to 9% and let a little bit more margin come to the model? Just kind of curious how you think about the business over the next couple of years. 
Scott Settersten: Yes. Well, I guess they would start with -- it's always a pragmatic approach, right. We look -- every quarter is a unique set of challenges and opportunities. We go into it. I mean, the one thing that we really have as an asset is our nimble ability, right, to flex with the situation. So our advertising, planning, marketing, merchandising, all the different aspects of our business are able to turn much more quickly than a lot of people are. So we're able to navigate difficult situations more easily than some. So as far as the discounting or the clearance win in the second quarter last year, we had great tailwinds. We looked at our business. We had things coming in the third quarter. We said, "Let's be more aggressive with our markdowns and try to move out of some of these products quicker than we normally would." Again, remember, 10,000 square feet, we've got space. We've got very disciplined management techniques on how to mark product down to make sure we optimize the gross margin outcomes there. So last year, we got a little more aggressive. That doesn't happen every quarter, right. We usually do a clearance event in the second quarter and then kind of at the end of the year. So that, I wouldn't say, is something that's going to be repeatable here over the next quarter or 2. As far as gross -- go ahead. 
Irwin Boruchow: No, I was just going to say, can you comment on gross margin for the back half, how you're planning it? 
Scott Settersten: Yes. So in the third quarter, I think I mentioned slight deleverage in the third quarter largely because a lot of the new store load, right, fixed store costs. I'm not going to get as much leverage there as I typically do because some of the higher cost stores we're opening in there and some of the other -- the pull forward things that we have flowing into the third quarter now. When we get to fourth quarter, I think we'll see expansion on the gross profit line because we will have cycled through the peak expense load and the P&L for the boutique additions and the new store additions and some of the labor things I already mentioned. And then we will get more efficiencies in the supply chain. Distribution centers are now primed, right, for holiday season, where we can push through a lot more e-commerce volume than we ever had before in a much more profitable fashion. 
Operator: Our next question is from Matt Fassler with Goldman Sachs. 
Matthew Fassler: Since you've been talking about this decision on the July promotion, what did you originally have embedded in your guidance? Did you have the promotion and the sales associated and margin associated with it embedded in the initial guidance? Or was it always absent, reflecting a decision as you entered the quarter that this was something you probably wouldn't repeat? 
Scott Settersten: Well, I think it's more a fact of what happened last year. I mean, it was always in the guidance, right. I mean, again, the levers we look at over the course of 3 months, you're planning and strategizing about how you're going to deliver the numbers, right. And what's necessary and what you think you -- what you would like to do to land the plane, so to speak. So last year, we pulled the lever then said, "Let's be opportunistic here and take advantage of the situation." This year, we looked at it. Again, we knew we were up against it over the last couple of weeks of the quarter. We looked at the comp target and we said, "You know what, it's not worthwhile." That's not a wise decision. We're going to -- we're playing for the long term. So we don't want to get into chasing these comps in the rest of the year. So that was... 
Matthew Fassler: So that was a decision that you made prior to entering the quarter when you guided a few months ago? 
Scott Settersten: No. That was a call we made during the course of the quarter. 
Matthew Fassler: During the course of the quarter, I understand, okay. 
Scott Settersten: Yes. 
Matthew Fassler: That's very helpful. Secondly, so as we think about trajectory, obviously, you have never guided nor had anyone expected you to make 10% to 15%, 16% comp with any kind of duration. Those are stellar numbers, as is an 11%, as is a 9%, wherever the numbers end up, any element of your guidance. All that being said, we've had about 5 points of deceleration from the peak comp to the number you just put up and a little bit more on the way it sounds like, very nominally so into Q3. Your long term guidance is 6% to 8%, and that's presumably each year for the next couple of years. At what point do we move past difficult comparisons such that you think we reach a sustainable benchmark? Is there anything in the industry that would have to change? Or are the underlying trends within the industry and within your own control, the brand roll-out, the boutique roll-out, the member growth, et cetera, intact to enable stable growth in that 6% to 8% comp range a couple of years hence that you gave a few months ago? 
Scott Settersten: Yes. So let me start. So the long-term guidance is actually 7% to 9, right. And we said heavier in the near term, moderating more as we get down the path. So I mean, sitting here today, we're looking at opportunity for market share gains. We're looking at all the levers we have internally with loyalty and credit card, assortment kind of things that we can expand in the future, just overall awareness of the Ulta Beauty brand, real estate opportunities like Manhattan and other places that we've never done business before. So again, I don't want to seem too optimistic, but we think there's plenty of room to continue to drive very healthy comps for the foreseeable future. 
Operator: Our next question is from Rupesh Parikh with Oppenheimer & Co. 
Rupesh Parikh: So I had question on the MAC roll-out. I think you mentioned in your prepared comments that it's a #1 and #2 brand so far where it's launched. I was just curious versus your expectations, is the brand as incremental to the store as you expected? And any sense at this point whether it's bringing new customers to Ulta stores? 
David Kimbell: Yes. It has performed very well, both online and in-store. We're really pleased with the results. And we believe very strongly that it's incremental. You know, it's early, but we're quite confident. In fact, we see that really across many, if not most, of the brands we bring in, particularly large, established brands like MAC, Clinique, Lancôme, as we see continue to roll those brands out, we see a high level of incrementality across the whole stores. So we're confident it's going to be there. We're still early. We're just at the early part of our roll-out, but we're seeing some strength. And an important part of that is it's certainly the product sales, but also, as Mary mentioned, the service component to it add in a greater sophistication of makeup service in our store through MAC, has been very, very well received from our guests, and that just adds to more the experiential component of our stores and those that it's rolled out to. So we're excited about that as well. 
Operator: Our next question is from Oliver Chen with Cowen and Company. 
Oliver Chen: We had a question related to the integration of the physical and the mobile and the desktop. What are your thoughts from a consumer experience in terms of the opportunities you have ahead and just making sure you're using your physical assets and being very competitive versus Amazon? And also, another angle on this is the inventory management side in terms of making sure you have smart supply chains and plan correctly as customers really look to meld these channels and interact with these channels in creative ways just to save time. 
David Kimbell: Yes. I'll start. The -- I think the integration of physical, digital, mobile is really essential to our strategy. In fact, Mary mentioned that in her remarks, and it's really a key part of our long-term -- short-term, long-term differentiation strategy. The physical experience, the human component to it, the idea of having a beauty destination that our beauty enthusiast guests can come in and touch and feel and smell and be immersed in beauty is exciting to her, and that's what she looks forward to when she comes to our stores. At the same time, we're building out all of our digital and mobile efforts. You heard some of the growth that we've seen in all of our mobile engagement. That is clearly the dominant interaction point that our guests has outside of our stores. It's growing in ways not only to help drive online sales but perhaps even more importantly to drive in-store sales. She's using it to check out her points, to understand about new products that have been ordered, to use our new service, like GLAM LAB. So it's an experiential extension of our store, and it's really working well to integrate. And so many of the infrastructure investments that we're making, perhaps most importantly, the DC expansions are just enhancing our capability to service our guests better. Greenwood and Dallas have already allowed us to increase the speed in which we're delivering and the efficiency in which we're doing it, the cost of which we're doing it. And as soon as we open Fresno next year, that's going to particularly help the West Coast to speed up deliveries there. So all these investments will make our outside-of-store experience even stronger at the same time we're integrating and increasing our in-store experience. 
Oliver Chen: Do you -- would you call out any features or capabilities that you think you need that customers are wanting, like car pick-up or try on in-store or other creative ways that will really change the game and move the needle? 
David Kimbell: We have a real pipeline of ideas. We're continuing to find ways to innovate within our store experience. Mary talked about one that's in test right now that we plan to roll out, which is store to door, the ability to -- when an item either is out of stock or perhaps not available in that store at that moment, to have it shipped directly to your home. And so items like that are a big part of our experience. We'll be testing in-store, virtual try-on capabilities in many of our stores coming up later this year. So yes, we have a -- we see that as a big part of our overall strategy, integrating online, offline and making that even easier for her going forward, so very much so. 
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of our question-and-answer session, and I would now like to turn the call back to Mary Dillon, CEO, for closing remarks. 
Mary Dillon: I'd like to thank our 35,000 associates for their passion and commitment that continue to drive some of the best results across all of retail. We look forward to continuing the strong performance in the back half of 2017 and beyond. We thank you for your interest in Ulta Beauty and look forward to speaking with all of you soon. 
Operator: This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.

===== 2017 Q1  (2017-05-25 17:00:00) =====

[Operator Instructions] 
 I'll now turn it over to Mary. 
Mary Dillon: Thank you, Laurel. Good afternoon. 
 The Ulta Beauty team kicked off 2017 with excellent first quarter results. Strong sales growth, driven by product newness and solid execution of our merchandise and marketing programs, translated into better-than-expected earnings growth, even excluding the significant tax rate benefit. Comp sales grew 14.3% on top of 15.2% in the first quarter of last year, maintaining the more than 29% 2-year comp trend we achieved in the previous couple of quarters. Comp sales were driven by balanced traffic and ticket growth in our stores and remarkable strength in e-commerce.
 We're particularly proud of these results in light of the challenging environment many retailers are experiencing. Our differentiated and increasingly compelling assortment, the experiential nature of our stores, the strength of our loyalty program and CRM capabilities that help us drive traffic and manage promotional activity with greater precision, the supply chain investments we've made to support the acceleration of our e-commerce channel, all of these assets are contributing to our exceptional growth.
 Now let me provide some more detail on the components of our strategy that drove our first quarter performance, starting with our strategic imperative to acquire new guests and deepen loyalty of existing guests. During the first quarter, we acquired 1.1 million net new loyalty members, bringing the Ultamate Rewards program to 24.5 million active members. This represents growth of 26% year-over-year, driven by continued strong execution by our store teams who are passionate about converting new members and healthy traffic in our stores, supported by our merchandising and marketing efforts.
 As we anticipated, the growth rate is beginning to moderate slightly as we cycle the big impact from initiatives that lifted conversion rate over the past several quarters. But we still expect to see rapid growth in loyalty membership well above square footage growth. All of the metrics we track, including retention rate, sales per member, frequency of purchase and average member ticket, remain very strong. We continue to find ways to enhance the benefits of the program, particularly adding perks for our most engaged Platinum level customers who spend more than $450 a year.
 Our brands are increasingly interested in partnering with us on loyalty and CRM efforts. An example of this is our most recent pre-birthday gift for loyalty members. It was a deluxe sample of Lancôme's new Monsieur Big mascara, offered to our members before the full-size product launch in store. Our Credit Card program continues to exceed expectations and we're excited to be launching the gift card program with Blackhawk in grocery stores this quarter.
 To update you on progress in increasing brand awareness, in April, we reached 86% aided awareness versus 84% a year ago, and our unaided awareness was up 6 points at 45% this year versus 39% last year. Awareness of Ulta Beauty brand is at an all-time high as our marketing and PR activities, including TV and radio advertising for 21 Days Of Beauty; partnerships such as those with POPSUGAR and Refinery29, which included an activation at the Coachella festival; and a stronger focus on social media all are contributing to make Ulta Beauty top of mind.
 Key promotional periods during the quarter included our spring trend report, where we highlight new styles of products through the integration of hair and makeup trends in our print and social media channels; 21 Days Of Beauty, our signature prestige beauty event that just keeps getting bigger and better; and Mother's Day, when we highlight the fragrance category. For the Spring 21 Days Of Beauty event, we enhanced the daily beauty steals program with additional hot buys and elevated our ULTA Beauty Collection offering, resulting in our strongest 21 Days Of Beauty event ever.
 One of our daily beauty steals, Anastasia Beverly Hills' iconic Brow Wiz pencil, broke the record for the best beauty steal in the history of the event. For Mother's Day, we upgraded our "gift with fragrance purchase" offer and elevated both our Pamper Her with Pretty and our Mother's Day Gift Guide. This year's social media activation invited our guests to share their mom's beauty wisdom, which was about best tips and makeup advice. And this garnered high engagement on social media. 
 Now turning to our efforts in merchandising. We continue to gain share across every major category, with particular strength in prestige cosmetics as well as in skin care in both the mass and prestige categories. IT Cosmetics, Tarte, Too Faced, Mario Badescu, BECCA, Anastasia, Clinique, Lancôme, Benefit, TONYMOLY, Yes to and the ULTA Beauty Collection were among the best-performing brands for the quarter. Positive product launches included IT Cosmetics' Confidence in a Compact serum foundation, Too Faced's Peanut Butter & Honey palette, Smashbox's Be Legendary liquid metal lip color, BECCA's Sunchaser bronzing palette, Stila's Magnificent Metals eye shadow and a new line of 30 Estée Lauder lipsticks exclusive to Ulta Beauty that are now featured in 650 stores.
 The new brand pipeline remains robust as well. Recent additions to the prestige cosmetics portfolio include several brands much loved by beauty enthusiasts, including Nude sticks and COVER FX. In prestige skin care, we launched Nyakio; and a new brand targeted to millennials, NIA, which stands for Not Into Aging. We also added a handpicked assortment of K-beauty favorites to our prestige skincare offering. Our Pro Hair assortment received a significant assortment reflow with the addition of Klorane; Aquage; Flawless by Gabrielle Union, which is exclusive to Ulta Beauty; and Madison Reed salon quality hair color. In mass cosmetics, we launched several new brands in select stores: L.A. Girl, Catrice and Models Own. The mass skincare portfolio added Skinfood and Derma E essentials. In addition, many existing brands expanded into additional doors, including NARS, Origins, Drybar and Estée Lauder.
 Now to update you on our M·A·C introduction, we launched about 600 M·A·C SKUs online a couple of weeks ago, and the brand is off to a very strong start on the website. To generate buzz for the e-commerce launch, we ran a 1-day flash sale for a lip palette on Instagram a week before the launch. The excitement is building for a M·A·C launch in stores for this quarter. We're on track to open more than 100 M·A·C doors before the end of the year with a similar breadth of assortment. The first M·A·C boutique will open on June 10 in Davenport, Iowa. 
 Moving on to services. The Salon business grew 16.7% and comped 9.9%, with strength in color services, blowouts and makeup services. We're investing in people and processes in our services business to continually improve the guest experience and drive sustainable market share gains. So for example, we're investing in training and brand building for The Salon through the recently announced formation of the Ulta Beauty Pro Team. This is a group of 5 artists and educators from some of the industry's top professional hair care brands: Redken, Matrix, L’ANZA and Wella. With over 100 years of combined experience, these professionals will elevate the profile of The Salon and Ulta Beauty, and help to educate and inspire our stylists across the country by working to enhance our salon education programming, building trend collections and providing training.
 Their efforts will be complemented by the Ulta Beauty design team, who will bring these collections to life with the company's 80 educators, who, in turn, will train ULTA Beauty's 6,500 stylists. In addition, we've created a dedicated team at corporate to build out our analytical capabilities, and we'll be testing a variety of changes to our model, including pricing, staffing and technology enhancements. As a result of all these investments, we're very optimistic about the opportunity to continue to enhance our market position in salon services.
 Now turning to store expansion. We opened 18 stores in the first quarter to launch our 2017 program of 100 new stores. We closed 2 stores, relocated 2 and ended the quarter with 990 stores. New store productivity continues to be very strong, reflecting excellent site selection, growing brand awareness and an increasingly appealing assortment of brands. We're on track to open a handful of high-profile stores this year, including a store on Michigan Avenue in Chicago opening in a couple of weeks, our first store in Manhattan planned for October and a store in the Mall of America expected to open in the fall as well.
 As a result of these higher-rent locations as well as the higher percentage of stores on the West and East Coast with generally higher rents than in the center of the country, we expect some modest pressure on rent per square foot for the chain. We're confident we can offset this in part by continuing to optimize lease terms. We're very active with renegotiations of rents as part of the lease renewal process after the initial 10-year term to ensure we're paying the most competitive rents.
 To update you on the e-commerce business. The ulta.com team delivered growth of 70.9% in the first quarter. This was the highest quarterly growth rate for our e-com business since the first quarter of 2014, back when the base was only $17 million. This sales growth contributed 340 basis points to our total company comp, driven almost entirely by transaction growth. As we study our guest purchase behavior, our e-commerce business is proving to be largely incremental. The Ultamate Rewards member who shops online are also increasing their purchases in bricks and mortar versus shifting their purchases online.
 We continue to improve our site experience and fulfillment capabilities. ulta.com drove very strong growth during 21 Days Of Beauty and other events, including the limited time offers we call Beauty Bags and Beauty Breaks!, and special offers for Platinum loyalty members. These events are often a catalyst for retail guests to become omnichannel shoppers, which brings many benefits. The number of omnichannel loyalty members continues to increase and now represent 8.6% of our members, up 140 basis points year-over-year. We continue to add online-only brands and expand the assortment of brands we carry in stores. During the quarter, total traffic growth was up 77% and mobile traffic rose 107%, driven by growth in paid search, affiliate, display and social, including Facebook, Twitter and YouTube. 
 And now turning to progress in our supply chain and systems. Supply chain operations really performed well across all metrics in the first quarter, maintaining a high in-stock position throughout the quarter while managing multiple resets, introducing new brands and working with some of our brand partners to get back in stock after strong holiday demand. Our supply chain supported ulta.com's strong performance as we continue to ramp order volumes shipping out of our new, more efficient distribution centers.
 Our DCs processed significantly more e-com shipments than forecasted during the quarter, while improving productivity, decreasing cost per shipment and keeping labor costs in line with forecasts. From an inventory management perspective, we maintained high inventory in stock to support our best-ever 21 Days Of Beauty event. Our top SKUs continue to be fully supported as we identify opportunities to make our inventory more productive. 
 Finally, to update you on our new distribution center in Fresno, California. Construction is underway and we're on track for a summer 2018 opening. As a reminder, this DC is similar to our Dallas DC, a 670,000-square-foot facility that can service up to 400 stores and 45,000 e-commerce orders per day. This DC will enable new distribution technologies that would increase our productivity and significantly reduce transit time to our West Coast customers. 
 In summary, 2017 is off to a great start, and I'd like to hand it over to Scott to discuss the drivers of our first quarter financials and our outlook for the second quarter and 2017. 
Scott Settersten: Thanks, Mary. Good afternoon, everyone.
 Starting with the income statement. Sales for the quarter rose 22.5% to $1.3 billion, driven by 14.3% comparable sales growth and continued very strong new store productivity. The total comp of 14.3% was made up of 8.7% transaction growth and 5.6% average ticket growth. The retail comp was 10.9%, composed of 6.2% traffic growth and 4.7% average ticket, with ticket roughly split equally in between units per transaction and average selling price.
 The Salon business comped 9.9%, driven primarily by ticket growth, although traffic growth was the strongest we've seen in several quarters. The retail and salon comp combined for a total store comp of 10.9%. Operating margin increased 60 basis points, driven by SG&A leverage. The drivers of our P&L were fairly similar to what we saw in the fourth quarter, with gross profit decreasing by 20 basis points and SG&A improving by 80 basis points. 
 On the gross profit line, we leveraged rent and occupancy costs, and product margins at retail were about flat. This reflects similar levels of promotion year-over-year, with one exception. As you know, we introduced the Ultamate Rewards credit card in August last year as an important tool to enhance loyalty and drive higher share of wallet of our guests. We're very happy with the program and the positive overall impact to the P&L. 
 However, it impacts some of the geography of expenses and benefits. When guests sign up for the card, they receive a onetime 20% off offer, and begin to earn extra loyalty points. Both pressure gross margin rate, but we see offsetting these factors with credit card income, including sign-up royalties, labor support and lower transaction processing fees, which are included in SG&A.
 On the mix side, we benefited from strong growth in the ULTA Beauty Collection and some of the higher-margin brands, but offsets included headwinds from higher mix of boutique brand sales. As a reminder, some of the prestige brands we've added are contributing significant margin dollars, but are dilutive to margin rate. With the hundreds of prestige brand boutiques we rolled out last year and are now accelerating this year, we are seeing a higher percentage of sales from these brands and anticipate that this margin rate headwind will continue. We also felt some pressure from a higher mix of e-commerce sales, investments in The Salon business, as well as higher distribution costs as our recent DCs and newly implemented systems continue to scale up.
 Turning to SG&A. Improvement here was primarily driven by advertising expense leverage on strong sales, corporate overhead savings as we anniversary-ed G&A investments made last year to support our supply chain and systems initiatives, and benefits from the Ultamate Rewards credit card. We also had some savings due to the timing of certain expenses, with some planned activities in areas like marketing and consulting that didn't occur as expected in the first quarter. But these dollars are expected to be deployed later in the year. These timing impacts represented about half of the earnings upside in the quarter, excluding the tax rate benefit. Investments in store labor to enhance the guest experience and to ensure strong execution of planogram changes partially offset these improvements.
 Just to touch on the tax rate for a moment. You saw that we called out a $0.14 earnings per share benefit in the quarter, primarily related to the new accounting standard that changes how companies record the tax effects of employees' stock option exercises and vestings of equity awards. The tax benefit moves from the balance sheet to the P&L. Going forward, we may see fluctuations in our tax rate quarter-to-quarter, which will be difficult to forecast. Broadly speaking, we expect the full year rate to be about 1 point lower than last year or approximately 36.5%. Our guidance will assume a 37.5% tax rate for the remainder of the year.
 Moving on to the balance sheet. Inventories increased 11.2% on a per-store basis, well below the comp rate, driven by solid inventory management, especially in light of the inventory additions for new brands and boutiques as well as ramping up the Dallas distribution center. Capital expenditures were $77 million for the quarter, driven by new store openings, systems and fixtures for prestige brand boutiques. Depreciation and amortization was $62 million for the quarter. We ended the quarter with $472 million in cash and short-term investments.
 In terms of share buybacks, we continue to repurchase shares through our 10b5-1 plan. During the first quarter, we repurchased approximately 185,000 shares of our stock at a cost of $51.6 million or an average share price of $279. As of April 29, 2017, approximately $395 million remained available under the $425 million share repurchase program announced in March 2017.
 Turning now to guidance for the second quarter and fiscal 2017. For the second quarter, we expect sales to be in the range of $1.257 billion to $1.278 billion versus $1.069 billion last year. We expect comparable sales to increase in the range of 10% to 12% versus 14.4% last year. E-commerce sales are expected to grow in the 50% range. We plan to open approximately 25 new stores in the second quarter versus 24 last year, so preopening is expected to be slightly higher. Diluted earnings per share are expected to be in the range of $1.72 to $1.77 versus $1.43 last year, with leverage on the gross profit line and modest deleverage on the SG&A line, with overall operating margin rate flattish. The tax rate, excluding any impact of the new accounting standard for share-based payments, is expected to be 37.5% and our fully diluted share count is estimated at 62.4 million. 
 Now turning to full year guidance. We plan to open approximately 100 new stores, all of which will be our prototypical format. We plan to complete about 11 major remodels and 6 relocations during the year. We expect to grow our e-commerce business approximately 50%. 
 Total company comps are expected to be in the 9% to 11% range. CapEx is expected to be $460 million, including new stores, remodels, relocations, approximately 700 prestige brand expansions and investments in systems to improve inventory visibility, which will enable future omnichannel capabilities. We are increasing our annual earnings-per-share guidance to flow through the tax rate benefit reported in Q1, and about half of the operating upside to account for the timing of planned expenses shifting from the first quarter till later in the year.
 We anticipate earnings-per-share growth in the mid-20s percentage range compared to our earlier outlook of low 20s EPS growth. This includes the impact of the 53rd week, assumes approximately $300 million share buybacks and assumes a full year tax rate of 36.5%, and a tax rate of 37.5% for quarters 2 through 4. To be clear, our EPS outlook excludes any impact from the new accounting standard for share-based payments for the remainder of the year. Operating margin is expected to increase in the 20 to 30 basis point range. 
 And with that, I'll turn it over to our conference call host to moderate the Q&A session. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Mark Altschwager from Robert W. Baird. 
Mark Altschwager: I did want to ask about the loyalty program. You've had a lot of success in the past year reactivating some of the lapsed loyalty members. Just curious how much opportunity remains on that front. And then for some of your more mature stores, just how are you thinking about the balance between adding new members versus capturing that incremental share of wallet to drive the comp moving forward? 
Mary Dillon: Thank you, Mark. Let's -- I'll break this into 2. I'll [ take ] the second part of the question first. I'd say, in total, wherever our stores exist, whether they're more mature or newer stores, we see plenty of opportunity to continue to drive market share growth and loyalty member growth. And so, over time, certainly it's about more share of wallet of current members. But we believe there's opportunity out there as we look at the marketplace for both of those kinds of growth going forward. In terms of lapsed users, do you want to... 
David Kimbell: Yes, absolutely. Mark, this is Dave. Yes, the -- we have had a lot of success, as you mentioned, continuing to reengage lapsed guests. And that has continued and continued in the first quarter of this year, and we see more opportunity in that. We've got a larger database beyond the number of members, active members, and we continue to reach out and attract them, both through our broader marketing that we know reaches them and encourages them to come back, and then some direct marketing efforts that we started to experiment with. So we see continued opportunity on that side as well. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Oliver Chen of Cowen and Company. 
Oliver Chen: So the question we had is a broader question on that topic regarding Amazon. What are your thoughts on how you preserve the specialness of your brand? And how you will continue to do a really superior excellent job with the growth and loyalty you're seeing in the face of Amazon, which, as you know, has so many -- such a big user base? And then if you could just brief us on your thoughts around your smaller format, pros and cons, in terms of what you're thinking about flexible formats as you continue to grow and be relevant across different types of opportunities, given that there's opportunities in different formats, I'm sure. 
Mary Dillon: Okay. The two-pronged question. Got it. In terms of -- I would just step back and just say that I think that we feel, as we've discussed kind of at length about -- as we look at the category we operate in, the consumers that we're focused on, the beauty enthusiasts, our loyalty program is quite large, 24.5 million people and growing, right? The uniqueness of our business model is that we're in a category that's not only growing, but as we look at demographic trends and we look at millennials and Gen X and Latinos, all fast-growing sectors of our economy, these are all folks who really are engaged in beauty and, frankly, love the way that we offer how to shop for beauty. This notion of All Things Beauty, All in One Place clearly is resonating. And it's very much about an in-person experience as well as we're seeing a very incremental online experience. And so the notion of continuing to have a wonderful shopping experience with a great assortment of products and categories and brands, plus services, plus the ability to have a great online experience, we see plenty of runway for us to continue to be a very relevant both bricks and mortar and online player. We know that the beauty enthusiasts love to shop in person and our associates love that interaction with the guests as well. So that, we think -- I believe strongly that, that platform, we'll continue to do what we do, but just getting better at it all the time is what we're focused on and why we feel confident about our ability to continue on the growth path. In terms of formats, we just have a couple of those smaller-format stores and we learned a lot about operating them. We like what we saw, but we also feel, as we've said, very confident that our base of, overall, 10,000-square-foot format is our most productive, best for our guests. We see plenty of real estate opportunities to do more of that. And we see opportunities both to go deeper into markets that we're in, to go open up stores in more one-store kind of markets as well as urban opportunities. And most of those cases, we'd say, the 10,000-square-foot could be a little bit less, it could be a little bit more. But bringing Ulta Beauty in kind of the full-throttle way that we do it is really, we think, the best way to continue to proceed. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Mark Astrachan of Stifel. 
Mark Astrachan: Curious how you think about the ultimate number of boutiques in stores relative to current levels if you start to think about it on a longer-term basis? And how do you think about the existing brands for those versus newer brands? And related to that, how do you think about picking up more brands from some of the larger beauty companies, like the L'Oréals and Estées, compared to indie brands that may not have broader distribution? 
Mary Dillon: I'd say think about this as a continuation of some of all of those, all of the above, how's that? Then our guests, they are really interested in brands that they know and love. They want to be able to access those in a more convenient format, like Ulta Beauty, as well as discovering new brands that maybe we're the first to bring to market. So that mosaic of interesting brands in -- we'll continue to play that out in the future. In terms of boutiques, Dave, you want to add to that? 
David Kimbell: Yes. Yes. As we said before, we're adding about 700 boutiques across the chain this year, with those key boutique brands, Clinique, Lancôme, Benefit and M·A·C. And we see more expansion, certainly as we build new stores. Many of them will get all of those or most of those boutiques. And then we'll continue to penetrate our existing stores where it makes sense, and we have the opportunity to go back in and do that. So that will be a continued source of growth, but it's, by no means, the only growth. And as we're -- building on what Mary said, continued mix of both big established brands, like a M·A·C or an Estée Lauder, but also uncovering new, emerging and independent brands and bringing that balance to our guests, which is what she wants. 
Mark Astrachan: That's helpful. If I could squeeze in one more sort of related question. Just curious how you're thinking about, with now a few weeks of M·A·C online, how you're seeing that doing relative to, I don't know, expectations? It might not be the best way to think about it. But just in terms of how sales have been, whether you think it's cannibalizing these stores outside of Ulta, and sort of thoughts about how that would fit into the e-commerce expectations, which would seem like it could be even better than that given that M·A·C just started. 
David Kimbell: Yes. So not to talk too specifically about any individual brand performance, other than to say we're very pleased. We're just a couple of weeks in, as Mary mentioned in her comments, that we're happy with the results. And then we've included that -- our anticipation of continued success there in our forward-looking view of business. So we're excited about it, and we'll continue to drive that business going forward. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Christopher Horvers of JP Morgan Chase. 
Christopher Horvers: So I wonder, first of all, on the M·A·C question. I know you're pleased with the results so far, but I guess could you share any thoughts on the demographics that you're picking up on the M·A·C side? And how maybe that -- how your core customer is also responding to that M·A·C offering? And then, in terms of the how the quarter played out for you, obviously you got it a lot lower to start the quarter. Was February hurt by tax refunds, and then does it sound like you basically just recaptured that into the balance of the quarter? 
Mary Dillon: Yes, I'll start with that, I guess, which is -- yes, I mean, I think -- we saw some -- a little choppiness. Overall, it kind of averaged out. But we saw a little bit of volatility, I'd say, late January, early February, probably due to the same factors that others saw with the tax refund. April was our strongest of the period, that has also benefited from a change in Easter timing. So in total, I'd say, it kind of all worked itself out and it wasn't -- we felt good about -- I mean, we had -- we did better than we had guided, better than we thought, and I think the e-commerce business in particular was stronger than we had planned, so that was kind of how it netted out. In terms of M·A·C, I would just say way too early. We just launched it online, but I appreciate the question. And I would say, I would expect that this will be very much -- our core guests will love it, and it's already showing in the online response that she is. I wouldn't expect it to be different, right, than who would be interested in many of the other brands that we offer, but she's excited to be able to get that Ulta Beauty, that's for sure. 
Christopher Horvers: Understood. And I think the biggest question out there right now is what you're seeing in the promotional environment from the department store channel. I mean, there was some news out there that you added a couple of incremental promotions. It sounded like it went to your best customers to optimize the value to them. But what are you seeing in the department store channel? And is there a wholesale change going on in terms of the complexion of the industry? 
Mary Dillon: Well, that's a deep question. I'd say this: beauty, it really always has been a competitive category. I would just step back by saying that I think our results in terms of traffic and market share underscore that what we're doing is working, right, it's competitive. Also, I would say, yes, in the quarter, we -- over the past several quarters and several years, we've actually been modifying our approach to marketing tactics with a meaningful reduction in the broad-based discounts to more kind of balanced and targeted mix. We do use postcards. We do it on a more limited and targeted basis, really, than we ever have. So in the quarter, we did two. We did one that was -- they were both digital. One was very targeted to our Platinum-only guests in February. So we've got a lot of different levers that we can use and flex as we need to in terms of demand creation. So I feel that we will always be offering a great value proposition to our guests. And we've got the right tools to allow that to happen. So will some competitors get more aggressive with price promotions? Sure. That sometimes happens in a competitive market, but we've got the levers that we can use to respond in a dynamic environment. I'd also add that we always -- we work with our brand partners to make sure that we have really great exciting offers for our guests all the time. And again, I would say that our results are showing that that's working. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Rupesh Parikh of Oppenheimer. 
Rupesh Parikh: So I was hoping to get a little more clarity in terms of how you guys are thinking about gross margins for the balance of the year. It sounds like the greater e-commerce sales this quarter and greater prestige sales weighed on your margins in Q1. So just want to get a sense if you expect similar pressures or potential decline to continue for the remainder of the year. 
Scott Settersten: Yes, I mean, the one thing I would just remind folks of is that we're lapping some pretty significant promotional kind of pullbacks here over the course of the last, whatever, call it 6 to 8 quarters, right? So we're lapping some pretty tough compares, I would say, on the margin line recently. So in the big scheme of things, we look at each quarter individually and try to optimize as best we can to deliver the best overall result for the business. There's nothing, as we sit here today, that would indicate that there would be any significant change in the trend that we've seen here recently, and we'll just do our best, right, to try to course correct as we think necessary as we navigate through that. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Simeon Siegel of Nomura. 
Simeon Siegel: Are you -- Mary or Dave, are you seeing any change in your incremental customer as your brand awareness grows? And are you reaching any new demographics with marketing? And then how is the awareness in city centers, just particularly ahead of the high-profile store openings? 
David Kimbell: Yes. We've had a -- definitely an effort to continue to expand our appeal across all consumers in all markets and geographies, and I think we're seeing success with that. Our awareness, in total, continues to grow and, certainly, it's much higher than it was 2 or 3 years ago. Our aided awareness is 86%. Our unaided awareness remains at about an all-time high, around 45%. So we're feeling very good about that. We have a big focus this year, we've talked about it in the past, in expanding our efforts to reach Latina guests. We've had more dedicated marketing partnerships with key media sites, like Viva La and POPSUGAR Latina and others to kind of reach out directly through influencers. We're testing some Spanish-language advertising later this year that will give us the opportunity to reach them more directly. So there's -- we see strength there and lots of opportunity to continue to build that. As far as urban centers, we do measure and look at awareness across major centers. And it's actually quite strong. I mean, Los Angeles is an example. We've opened quite a few stores there over the last few years and get the strong awareness that really mimics our national. Chicago, New York, we're building and it's quite strong. So yes, there isn't big pockets of undeveloped in urban areas, but we see more growth potential across the board and specifically with key groups like Latinas. 
Simeon Siegel: And then just the point of the leveraging marketing. What's the right way to think about marketing dollar growth or as a percent of sales? And then, Scott, I don't know if I missed it, but did you say what the right way to think about total SG&A dollar growth for Q2 and the full year would be? 
Scott Settersten: Yes. We don't really talk about SG&A in terms of dollars like some of the big box guys do. I mean, when we're thinking about the full year, I guess, this gets back to the pressures question as well. I mean, I think we said operating margin flattish in the second quarter, up a little bit on the gross profit line, down a little bit on the SG&A line. I think as we navigate through the rest of the year, the third quarter, I would say, gross profit, we're going to have a little bit more pressure on that because some of the rent, the heavier rents we're going to pay for some of those higher-profile kind of stores that are common in Manhattan and Mall of America and a few others in the boroughs of the New York Metro area. So that might be a little tougher on the gross profit line. We'll get a little offset there in SG&A to offset it there again. I'd say maybe slight deleverage in the third quarter overall, and then we make it back up in the fourth quarter when we've got -- we're lapping the Dallas DC there and we're scaling up on e-commerce and retail overall. So we're seeing more leverage in the fourth quarter. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Mike Baker of Deutsche Bank. 
Michael Baker: More of a longer-term bigger-picture question. Typically, I think you saw it this quarter, as companies grow their e-commerce, it does pressure margins because I think contrary to what a lot people thought years ago, e-commerce can actually be a lower-margin business. The question though is how does that leverage as your e-commerce business grows? As e-commerce business gets bigger, do the margins on the e-commerce itself get better and then, therefore, becomes less of a drag? Or if that doesn't occur, as e-commerce grows, does the drag actually get bigger? 
Mary Dillon: Well, first of all, I'd step back and say, just to reiterate something that was great about our e-commerce business growth, which is that as we measure and look at it closely, it looks to be a very incremental business to us. So I'll come back to margin, but in total, this is incremental dollars. And it's kind of supported by the consumer behavior that we understand. Our guest, especially our most engaged guest, she loves to buy a lot of offers from us. And so when somebody becomes an omnichannel shopper, they end up basically being our best guest because they're spending 2.5x the amount of money than somebody who's just shopping in store. 21 Days Of Beauty is a great example of an event that can drive that kind of incremental additive behavior. It's 21 days, a lot of days, every day there's a deal, a special offer. So a guest might come in a couple of times and then see a couple of things online that she also wants to get. So it's an incremental shopping occasion. So it plays out that, whether it's an event or a palette that she can only get online at first before we put it in stores or other special things she's looking for, it's sort of feeding into this behavior and creating a nice, incremental business for us. That said, we also -- the margin, yes, it's somewhat lower on our e-commerce business. And we don't really break this out in a lot of detail. But basically, they're pretty -- it's getting closer. The gap is not that large and it's actually closing. So it's incremental dollars at a somewhat less but narrowing gap of margin. And it's just the kind of decision that we think is right for our business as we continue to grow the business in total. And our supply chain investments have certainly helped us to make this part of our business more efficient over time. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Ike Boruchow, Wells Fargo. 
Irwin Boruchow: Scott, so I always thought the prestige brand business was higher margin for you. But I think you said in your prepared remarks, the new prestige boutique sales are a little dilutive. Can you maybe just walk us through some of the economics on how the boutique business differs from the other prestige business that you guys have? 
Scott Settersten: Sure, Ike. It's an interesting mix, and that's why we've been trying to walk people back a little bit from counting the number of boutiques we're putting in and what store locations and so on that they're going into because it is kind of an interesting mix and dynamic that we have in the store. And it's the overall offering and the variety of brands and the different price points, I mean, collectively, with services, that's driving the results, right? So back directly more to your question, so the prestige boutique brands are -- well, take a step back, prestige generally, overall, is higher-margin business than mass is, all right? So that's one general statement. But there's a lot of exceptions to the general rule unfortunately, or fortunately for us. So on the prestige side, those boutique brands are lower than a lot of our other prestige brands, right? So adding into the mix, while it's driving incremental sales and margin dollars, on a rate basis, creates a headwind for us. So again, fantastic comps, very healthy growth there, excellent overall result for us. On the mass side, well, again, it's generally lower-margin business. The exceptions there: ULTA Beauty Collection, right, very high private-label margins there; Mix would be another one that provides better-than-average mass margin rate. So the secret sauce then, also, is having all those different levers and ability to promote and drive conversion on those brands to help deliver the best overall result. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Shannon Coyne of BMO Capital Markets. 
Shannon Coyne: Just wondering if you could talk directionally about the growth rates in the prestige brands versus the mass brands. Do you find that the growth rates are widening or converging over time? And then maybe, if so, kind of what's driving those different -- any changes that you might be seeing? 
David Kimbell: Yes. So I'd say, if you just look across the industry as a whole, over the last several quarters, year or so, prestige in general has had a higher growth rate than mass. Both have been growing. And that's been true, largely true at Ulta, that the prestige brands have been growing -- or prestige portfolio has been growing a little bit faster than mass. Having said that, mass is quite strong. Prestige has the benefit of -- we're still building our penetration and adding probably more brands into prestige than in the mass over the last year or so. But our focus is to drive growth, and we're pleased with the growth that we're seeing on both sides of the business. Again, that's one of the key differentiators for us is the mass to prestige, the ability to offer All Things Beauty, All in One Place. So we're really happy with the growth. And a nice benefit of having a diverse portfolio is we can take advantage of wherever there's growth in the industry and then drive our own business that way. 
Operator: Our next question comes from David Schick of Consumer Edge Research. 
David Schick: Just wanted an update on -- as you've added the prestige brands, is it bringing in a different customer at a different clip? I think we've talked about this before over the last year, but any update to whether it's a different customer, your existing customer trying those brands, what's driving the ticket? 
David Kimbell: Well, we've been adding a -- as we've talked about over the last several quarters, we're really pleased and, I guess, proud of the new member growth that we've been having. I'll tell you, that growth comes as some are coming in for new prestige brands. Many are coming in for the first time and buying mass brands, they buy hair brands. So there's still a mix of the new brands. But I'd say yes, adding brands anywhere in the house can help us attract new customer -- new customers, if it's a known brand or a new brand that we're launching with social -- some social buzz, exclusivity. So certainly, that helps to add new prestige brands in driving new members in. But by no means is it the only source of new member growth in our business. Ulta Beauty does a great job of introducing customers to their prestige brands with many -- often our guests that come in and buy mass discover brands in the prestige portfolio for the first time at Ulta Beauty. So that's a big growth driver for us and an important growth driver for our brand partners. 
Mary Dillon: Yes. I would just add one thing to what Dave said, which is kind of the core premise that we operate off of, [ they give us a really good ] deep understanding of the consumer segments in the beauty market. And the beauty enthusiast is a phrase that we use, but it really defines a core segment. It's really a large segment, it's 57% of shoppers. By definition, they are -- they buy products and brands all across the spectrum in terms of price points and categories. So I wouldn't expect that by adding certain types of brands, like prestige brands, that's going to fundamentally change who's attracted to Ulta Beauty. I think as Dave said, well, it kind of adds to the mosaic, but she consistently -- she might change that -- shift that mix a bit over time, but she loves the fact that she can get an array, that's what we call it, All Things Beauty, All in One Place. So this we expect to continue, and we expect the beauty enthusiast segment to grow as well. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Joe Altobello of Raymond James. 
Joseph Altobello: So I was hoping to get a little more insight into the spending patterns for your typical Ultamate Rewards member and how that plays out over time? How long do you see that ramp up before there's a plateau? And how does spending patterns of your newer members differ from spending patterns of your more tenured members? 
Mary Dillon: Well, our newer members -- our members spend more over time as she gets more engaged at Ulta Beauty, and certainly as she becomes a multiple -- an omnichannel shopper. But Joe, if you step back, we still really only have 1/3 on average of our shopper's beauty wallet. Certainly higher for some, lower for others. We also know that most of our members -- our members are only shopping about 1/4 of the categories that we operate in. So it's hard to kind of pinpoint the exact feeling. I think there's plenty of opportunity for us to continue to drive growth through share of both new members coming into the program as well as the beauty wallet of our existing members, plenty of opportunities for that to continue to expand. 
Joseph Altobello: Okay, got you. And then, if I could just sneak one more in for Scott. The ROIC of the nontraditional doors versus your typical 10,000-square-foot variety? 
Scott Settersten: I think we said on our fourth quarter call, right, probably not at exactly the same kind of returns. At least in the early years, we're not expecting that. I mean, these are significantly higher cost kind of real estate deals, but they are subject to the same exact disciplines that we use for every other store in the chain. These are not the term "flagship" in any way shape or form. They're expected to be very productive stores over the long time. We're just allowing ourselves a little cushion to see them -- give ourselves a little bit more ramp-up time in those stores. They're going to -- we expect them to produce very solid financial results for our investors. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Adrienne Yih of Wolfe Research. 
Adrienne Yih-Tennant: Mary, I guess my question is going to go back to e-commerce and the tremendous strength and growth you saw there, up 70%. Were you surprised by that, first of all? And then secondarily, were you doing something to kind of move the customer to that particular channel? And Scott, I guess in that vein, when we're looking at the gross margin from -- or the margin, both gross margin and operating margin, on the gross margin side, is it pressuring because it's inclusive of free shipping, there are smaller, lower-margin items there? And then, is it operating margin-accretive? So to the extent that we see this growth -- this channel growing, it should be accretive to earnings? 
Mary Dillon: Okay. Thanks, Adrienne. I'll take the first part on e-commerce. Yes, it was a stronger result than we had planned. We're very, very excited about this asset. Because of our supply chain investments, we're able to fulfill what the guest wanted in a way that was really exceptional. So that was terrific. And I would say, we're probably benefiting for some newer digital marketing tools that we implemented last year. So paid search, display advertising, paid social, those are all building momentum to really drive traffic, so that certainly benefited our e-commerce business. We also just have great offers, I think they're really smartly targeted, site improvements and, again, the supply chain investments that have made the overall experience for the guest even better. So those things in total, I think, created that kind of momentum on e-commerce. 
Scott Settersten: And that's a good question, Adrienne. I think people get -- it gets a little fuzzy, right, when you're talking about margin and the contribution on e-commerce versus retail, I know myself. So we've been spending a lot of time here. Actually, we just refreshed our board here recently on just new ways of thinking about that. So yes, the difference that the gross margin versus operating margin -- I'd say at operating margin level, we're almost to the point now where we're kind of agnostic on what channel she buys in. And so when you think about the dynamics there, it really almost, not quite, but it's close to being a wash, with the trade-off being on the shipping. We've made a lot of progress, right, on the efficiencies in our DCs here over the last couple of years. We have the full assortment online now. Remember, it wasn't that long ago that we didn't have Pro Hair online, which was one of our higher-margin categories. So we've gotten to a good place overall with our e-commerce business, where at the operating margin line, it's almost kind of a net 0. You're trading off shipping costs for store labor and boutique investments and all those things that you're doing in the stores, right, labor investments that go along with that. So that's the good news. Working our way back up to the gross profit line. Really, what's going on there is it's more of, I'd call it, a category, a product mix kind of issue, right? So the margin there is lower online than it is in our typical store, at least today it is. And it's generally because it's -- we overindex on things like PCA, right? So think $200 hairdryers, where it's easier, you're going to price compare that maybe a little bit more closely than you would if you were walking around a store. You got easier access to a coupon, right? It's easier to go find is there some kind of deal I can get on this appliance when I'm spending this kind of money. So that's kind of what's putting pressure on the gross profit line, I would say, right now. But again, we kind of make up for a lot of that as you move your way down the P&L. So the good news there as well is it's something that we're aware of and we're working on and thinking about ways that we can try to improve that for our business as we look to the future. 
Adrienne Yih-Tennant: And then to your gross margin, up a little bit in the second quarter, what dynamics changed there? Or what's the underlying e-commerce growth in Q2? 
Scott Settersten: It's a roughly 50% comp, we said, for the second quarter. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Omar Saad of Evercore ISI. 
Omar Saad: Great quarter. It's interesting to us that it seems like your -- your traffic numbers are phenomenal. But almost as they slow down just a little bit, you're seeing the e-commerce side accelerate. And I'm wondering, through the great data that you guys collected through the loyalty program, if you can see patterns or trends. Is it the same consumers shopping less in stores and more online? Is it total incremental trips that are coming online in addition to what they've been doing in the stores? Or is it new people who are shopping online only? Would love to kind of get a perspective on that, those changing dynamics between your online and physical stores. 
Mary Dillon: Yes, I'll start. Dave, if there's anything else you want to add. But it is -- we really have very few people that shop online only at all. It's really the bulk of our business is people shopping obviously in store, and then around 8.5% of our guests are now doing omnichannel shopping. And really, as I said earlier, as we study it, it looks to be quite incremental. So I mean, in any given quarter, there's going to be variations, I guess, on traffic patterns and whatnot. But the incremental, what's happening with the e-commerce business, really, for those guests, as we kind of separate them out and look at them, they're growing in terms of retail sales the same as similar-looking guests are adding e-commerce trips, I guess you'd call it, and purchases on top of that. So I think it's a very healthy place to be and it plays into the consumer insights that we have about how she likes to shop. The most engaged shopper likes to try a lot of things that we offer and [ we ship those up ] well online. So I think it's a continuation of that, which is great for our business longer term because these omnichannel shoppers are our best guests, not unlike our salon guests, most engaged today. 
David Kimbell: Yes, the only thing I guess I'd... 
Omar Saad: Definitely. Sorry, go ahead. 
David Kimbell: I was just going to say, that only thing I'd add, it goes back to Mary's wallet share opportunity, and I think that's really the big driver of this is we're -- we believe it's very incremental. And because of that, it's capturing just a greater share of her wallet. So we see a lot of runway there without cannibalizing stores. So our goal is to have them work together. We want the new guests that we acquire online to get into stores as quickly as possible, and then we're working hard to convert our in-store customers to online. So there doesn't appear to be a big trade-off at this point, and we see a lot of runway ahead of us. 
Omar Saad: Yes, that's definitely pretty interesting that you're not seeing the in-store trips and spend drop off that much as they add online trips to their menu. 
Mary Dillon: Thank you. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Kelly Halsor of Buckingham Research Group. 
Kelly Halsor: I just wanted to follow up on a previous question since there's been a lot of chatter around the beauty category lately. So how did the total beauty category grow, your prestige beauty in particular and prestige cosmetics? And just remind us of how it grew in FY '16? And then, as you go deeper with some of these premier prestige brands, have you thought about how that opens you up or possibly makes you more exposed to competitors who may not be as disciplined with their promotional cadence? And is that a conversation you've had with some of these key vendors? Historically, they've been very disciplined with their pricing and promotions. And then, just secondly, I know Pro Hair care is a pretty important category in the second quarter. How's that category been growing? Has there been any changes in growth or anything we should be thinking about? 
Mary Dillon: Let me just start with the first part. I'll see if Dave can come back in on the category type work. So I guess I would just say, as I said before, that it's certainly a competitive category. There's a lot of moving dynamics. All we can do is play our offense, and I think our offense has proven to be a pretty good offense, right? So we offer our guests a whole array of ways to get great deals. And being a great total value proposition is important for every consumer category that exists. And so we can flex up and down. I would say that our ability would be very targeted, to be very varied in our marketing mix and our demand creation tools, and the ability to leverage our loyalty program to get insights and drive -- work with our brand partners to offer really targeted, smart promotions is pretty unparalleled. And so I think that for us, as we work with our brand partners, we are making sure that we have -- always working to make sure we got great guest offers that are compelling and differentiated. And I'm confident that that's going to continue to be a way for us to be -- continue to win and drive share growth in a dynamic marketplace. And frankly, our guests love the fact that when she buys more from us, she gets more points that she can then redeem in the store. So the loyalty program really is the foundation of helping us I think be protective in our competitive position. [ The second ] category? 
David Kimbell: Yes, on the total category, I don't know if we got full insight on the combined category. What I will -- although we feel confident in beauty as we have for a while and see a lot of growth, all the demographic trends that we talked about are every bit as true today as when we talked about it in the past, continue to see high engagement in beauty with young women, with Latinas, African Americans, there's plenty of growth ahead of us. We will -- I will say, we see strong growth in categories that hadn't been growing as strong like skin care. We've seen strong in performance in fragrance. Bath is doing well. You asked specifically about hair. Hair has been strong for us and you're right that we've got -- hair is always important for us and we've got some big kind of activities on hair. We've launched several new brands and there's strong newness across key brands, like Paul Mitchell and Dyson, and Mary mentioned the Flawless line that we just launched. So there's Madison Reed. So lots of newness, lots of strength, good marketing and promotional strategy in hair, so we're confident about that. So we feel really good about the total category and are seeing some strength in key pockets that we're excited about. 
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the call over to Ms. Mary Dillon for closing remarks. 
Mary Dillon: I'd just like to say thank you to our 34,000 associates who delivered a terrific start to 2017 and have set the stage for another year of strong top and bottom line growth. And thank you all for your interest in Ulta Beauty, and look forward to speaking with you soon. Thank you. 
Operator: This concludes today's conference. You may now disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.

===== 2016 Q4  (2017-03-09 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Greetings, and welcome to the Ulta Beauty Fourth Quarter 2016 Earnings Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Laurel Lefebvre. Please go ahead.

Mary Dillon: Thank you, Laurel. Good afternoon, everyone. The Ulta Beauty team delivered very strong fourth quarter results, capping an exceptional year of sales and earnings growth while investing to drive market share gains and create sustainable long-term shareholder value. 
 Let me start with a quick review of the headlines for the fourth quarter. We grew the top line 24.6% and delivered 16.6% comps on top of 12.5% comps in the fourth quarter of 2015, driven by strong traffic and ticket growth. Multiple factors, strength across our product offerings, our best-in-class loyalty programs, great in-store execution, investments in marketing and labor and steadily improving supply chain capabilities, all worked together to drive stellar growth across both our retail and online business. E-commerce growth exceeded our plans, driven by strong traffic and outstanding fulfillment execution during the holiday. Our services continue to gain share as we grow our business with existing guests and acquired new ones, significantly outpacing industry growth. 
 In concert with above planned sales growth, earnings per share growth of 32.5% also exceeded our expectations. 
 Before I dive into a detailed review of the fourth quarter, I'd like to highlight some of our team's accomplishments for the full year. In fiscal 2016, we drove top line growth of 23.7% and earnings growth of 30.9%, well above our expectations at the beginning of the year, achieving robust market share gain, solid execution and strong flow through on better-than-expected sales. We achieved a 15.8% comp with 13.4% comps in stores and 52% -- 56.2% growth in e-commerce, with healthy traffic and ticket growth each quarter during the year. 
 Underlying this financial performance were the many significant accomplishments we achieved as we executed against our 6 strategic imperatives. We opened 100 net new stores and continued to deliver very healthy new store productivity. We completed more than 500 prestige brand expansions across new and existing stores and also executed updates to Ulta Beauty Collection fragrance area and nail fixtures. We added 69 new brands to our portfolio, reflecting the fact that Ulta Beauty is a great place for our brand partners to grow. We grew active memberships in our loyalty program by 5.2 million members to 23.4 million active members, an increase of 28%. We increased our aided brand awareness to 86% as we continued to drive marketing effectiveness and efficiency. 
 We launched our -- successfully launched our Ulta Beauty Credit Card program. We continue to improve our supply chain capabilities, successfully opening a new DC in Dallas and further ramping the Greenwood DC we opened in 2015. Finally, we also seamlessly implemented several new core merchandising systems, which will improve our capabilities across the merchandise, planning and forecasting as well as space planning and allocation, driving higher in-stock as we continue to grow. I am so proud of this team and the terrific year we delivered. I'd now like to go into a little bit more detail on some of the key drivers specific to our fourth quarter performance. 
 Starting with our first strategic imperative, which is to acquire new guests and deepen loyalty of existing guests. We increased active membership in our Ultamate Rewards loyalty program by 1.7 million members during the quarter, driven by compelling marketing communication and excellent conversion in-store. We continued to see strength in retention rate, sales per member, frequency of purchase and average member ticket. Our loyalty program allows us to execute compelling CRM campaigns which drove incremental sales and margin. We also more than doubled our sampling campaign, delighting our guests with free gifts while driving additional sales. 
 Our Ultamate Rewards credit card program exceeded expectations, driven by above-plan new account sign-ups and higher average sales per cardholder. We also experienced very strong gift card sales, contributing to our sales momentum after the holidays. This spring, we plan to launch Ulta Beauty gift cards in major grocery chains across the country, which will allow us to reach thousands of locations with the new point of presence for the brand. 
 Our team successfully executed on 3 key events during the fourth quarter: holiday; our haircare jumbo size promotion; and our signature Love Your Skin event. 
 For the holiday season, we launched new creative for our television and radio ad, centered on our JOY TO THE GIRL campaign, which was integrated across all touch points. We increased our TV, digital video and cinema ads and dramatically increased impressions with content partnerships with POPSUGAR, Refinery29, CafeMedia and E! News freeSTYLE. We also made a big impact on social media with our #JoyItForward integration, delighting influencers and Ultamate Rewards members with custom beauty boxes. 
 Post-holiday, we refined our long-standing and very popular haircare event featuring Leaders or Jumbo-sized products to drive sales and margin improvements with a fresh approach that sharpened the appeal and impact of the event. We also adjusted the cadence of the marketing and added radio advertising. These and other modifications led to the most successful Leader event in our history with strong growth across our largest brands, both in-store and online. 
 Our business were very strong in January as well, anchored by our successful Love Your Skin event which drove growth in both mass and prestige skincare. We've focused our communications and merchandising to help our guests truly understand the benefit and features of the brands and products within the skin care arena, which can sometimes be overwhelming to navigate in light of the complexity of the category. 
 Demystifying skincare was a key theme throughout our marketing messaging as we highlighted regimens for various skin care types to help guests discover our best-selling products. 
 On the merchandising front, we continue to see trends similar to the preceding quarters during the year, with prestige cosmetics leading the way but with strength across all major categories and newness contributing significantly to our performance. Urban Decay, IT Cosmetics, NYX, Redken, Too Faced, Tarte, Anastasia, Clinique, Lancôme, Benefit, Ardell, Real Techniques and the Ulta Beauty Collection were notable among the best-performing bands for the quarter, with all brands providing terrific newness to the holiday season. 
 While cosmetics were the biggest comp driver in the quarter, we gained market share across all major categories. Skincare, both mass and prestige, accelerated in the quarter with strength in mass, continuing interest in the Korean beauty trend and the recent addition of 3 major new brands: proactiv, Shiseido and Origins, contributing strong growth as they ramp up in the assortment. 
 The power of social media influencers are driving particular strength in prestige skincare brands like Mario Badescu and Peter Thomas Roth. 
 Our own Ulta Beauty Collection performed very well in the quarter, benefiting from upgrades to in-store presentation, formulations and packaging, all rolled out earlier in the year and from new product additions and popular holiday kits. 
 Looking ahead, we are excited to announce today a new partnership with the Estée Lauder company. We will be launching their MAC brand online in early May, and we'll begin roll out MAC to stores starting in June and continuing throughout the year. We plan to reach more than 100 stores in 2017, including the majority of new stores opening in the second half of the year. MAC is the #1 prestige makeup brand in the U.S. and one of the strongest brands in America. MAC has long been one of our guests most requested brands and its addition to our assortment helps us reach and better serve audiences that are important to us, including teens, millennials and diverse customers. 
 To highlight the strong positioning as a makeup artistry brand, we plan to offer MAC makeup services at all stores in which we'll roll out the brand. The service component of the MAC offering is yet another example of how we're able to enhance and differentiate the shopping experience and drive traffic to our stores. 
 Turning to the services business. Salon sales increased 15.2%, and comped 8.8% with strength in hair color and makeup services. Color services got a boost from the launch of Redken pH-Bonder, a color additive that better protects the integrity of the hair during color services. 
 In skin, MicroZone services were a standout as the targeted promotion drove new guests acquisition. We continue to evolve our marketing strategy by utilizing our CRM and loyalty programs to simplify offers to attract new guests to the salon while still driving great value and a great experience. 
 In addition to continuing their participation in New York Fashion Week, the Ulta Beauty artistic team recently styled the hair of the dancers performing for the Super Bowl halftime show with Lady Gaga, garnering significant exposure on social media and continuing to raise our profile as the hair authority. 
 Our Benefit Brow boutiques continued their strong performance with brow services now available in about 850 stores. Benefit Brow Bars complemented their services business with product newness, including exciting product launches in the lip and the eyeshadow category. 
 Now turning to store growth. Our growth and development team wrapped up a very busy year, opening 25 stores in the fourth quarter to end the year with 974 stores. New store productivity remains very strong. We have accrued all the real estate sites for our 2017 store program, including a handful of stores that are not in our typical suburban location and which will require more capital and higher rent. These include our new store at Michigan Avenue in Chicago opening this summer, our first store in Manhattan planned for the fall, and a store in the Mall of America in Minnesota. 
 Moving to our e-commerce business. Ulta.com sales grew 63.4% on top of 44.2% growth last year, contributing 380 basis points to our total company comp. This revenue growth was driven almost entirely by increased transactions. While total traffic growth was up almost 63%, mobile traffic rose more than 90%, driven by growth in digital marketing pay channels, including search, affiliate, display and Facebook. 
 Ulta.com's product mix continues to mirror that of our stores, with strong interest in newness and trials demonstrated by the ongoing success of our online-only beauty breaks and beauty bags that give our guests compelling sampling opportunities. 
 Now this was the first year that our enhanced supply chain capabilities allowed us to confidently go through the holiday season without throttling demand on the site, enabling sales growth well above the plan. The profitability of our e-commerce business improved as a result of our more efficient fulfillment capabilities as well as a more effective promotional strategy. 
 Finally, I'd like to update you on our supply chain operations and investments. Our supply chain team performed very well during the quarter, and the team did a great job keeping up with the higher-than-expected demand, both in stores and online to keep in-stock levels high throughout the quarter, in particular during the holiday selling. 
 The Greenwood, Indiana distribution center ramped up to serve 230 stores to the holiday season and delivered 45,000 e-commerce orders per day during peak. Our newer Dallas building ramped to 130 stores and 25,000 e-commerce orders per day at peak. Shipping lead times continued to improve with 88% of orders shipping within 48 hours. So it was an 83% increase improvement compared to 2015 performance. We expect to ramp the Greenwood DC to serve close to 300 stores and the Dallas DC to serve a little over 200 stores by the end of 2017. 
 We recently signed a lease for a West Coast distribution center in Fresno, California which is planned to open in the summer of 2018. This sixth DC will be a copy of the Dallas facility and is designed to substantially improve delivery times to the West Coast. 
 From a systems perspective, our new forecasting replenishment system, SWIFT, performed as planned during the holiday period. As a result, we saw higher in-stock to increase productivity of our inventory in the fourth quarter. We also successfully implemented our new floor planning and assortment optimization tool, allowing for more analytical rigor around our assortment decisions. And finally, we continue to invest in foundational capabilities like our product information management system newly deployed to all of our suppliers. This capability streamlines to capture of more accurate product information directly from our brand partners. We're making good progress and we'll continue to leverage these investments to improve operational performance and the guest experience. 
 This wraps up my review of the quarter. In sum, excellent fourth quarter results represented a strong finish to our best year yet. Our performance puts us in a unique position in the beauty industry and within the broader retail landscape to take advantage of the many opportunities before us to invest to drive the business for the long-term. 
 And now, I'll turn it over to Scott, to discuss the drivers of our fourth quarter results and our outlook for the first quarter and all of 2017. 
Scott Settersten: Thank you, Mary. Good afternoon, everyone. Starting with the income statement. Net sales for the quarter increased 24.6% to $1.58 billion, driven by 16.6% comparable sales and excellent new store productivity. The total company comp was composed of 10.9% transaction growth and 5.7% average ticket growth. 
 The retail comp of 13% was driven by 8% traffic and 5% ticket. Ticket growth was driven primarily by average selling price. The units per transaction were also up, in line with the UPT performance for the year. The salon business comped 8.8% driven primarily by ticket growth but also included some encouraging signs of traffic growth. The retail and salon comp combined produced a total store comp of 12.8%. 
 Operating margin increased 80 basis points, driven by strong SG&A leverage. Since components of the P&L are quite different this quarter compared to the rest of 2016, let me give you some color on the moving parts. Gross profit decreased by 10 basis points. But on a 2-year basis, gross profit increased 110 basis points. While we leverage fixed store cost on strong sales, product margins were down slightly for 2 primary reasons: First, and most importantly, we cycled over the elimination of a 20% off postcard promotion in Q4 of last year, resulting in similar year-over-year promotional levels versus the last several quarters when we were also able to opportunistically eliminate the similar 20% off postcard promotions. 
 Second, channel and product mix put modest pressure on margin rates. While our e-commerce business continues to improve its overall profitability with more efficient fulfillment capabilities, Ulta.com's lower gross margin had a more significant impact on the total company margin rate during the quarter as our e-commerce channel represented a larger percentage of the business in Q4 at 10% of the mix versus 7% for the full year. 
 On the product mix side, growth in prestige and mass cosmetics outpaced the higher-margin hair care category. And while many of the prestige brands we've added recently drive sales and margin dollars, they tend to dilute margin rate. 
 Finally, we continued to see planned deleverage and distribution cost since supply chain investments are still weighing on gross profit as our new DCs and newly implemented systems continue to ramp up. 
 Moving on to SG&A expense. We improved by 110 basis points, driven by leverage of advertising expense and corporate overhead on strong top line performance, offset slightly by investments in store labor related to prestige brand expansions and providing higher staffing levels in stores particularly during the holiday. 
 In terms of the balance sheet, inventories increased 11.2% on a per store basis, well below the comp rate, driven by careful inventory management and better-than-expected sales. Capital expenditures were $93 million for the quarter, driven by our new store opening program, systems and fixtures for prestige brand expansions. CapEx for the full year was $374 million as some of the capital projects planned for the year slipped into 2017. We ended the quarter with $415 million in cash and short-term investments. 
 In terms of share buybacks, we continue to repurchase shares in the open market as part of our 10b5-1 plan. During the fourth quarter, we repurchased approximately 190,000 shares of our stock at a cost of $47.3 million. For the full year, including the accelerated share repurchase program and activity under our 10b5-1 plan, we repurchased 1.6 million shares for $344 million at an average price of about $210 per share. Share repurchases contributed about 3 percentage points of EPS growth for the year. As of January 28, 2017, approximately $101 million remained available under the $425 million share repurchase program announced in March 2016. 
 Turning now to guidance for fiscal 2017 and the first quarter. As Mary mentioned, we are in a unique situation among retailers with our current opportunity for growth and market share gains. From this position of strength, we plan fiscal 2017 to allow us to deliver on our long-range planned goal of delivering EPS growth in the low 20s percentage range while investing in new brands, store labor infrastructure and exciting new real estate opportunities while continuing to grow our brand awareness and invest more aggressively in digital. 
 I'd like to share with you a few data points and assumptions that influenced our 2017 plan. First, sales for both the fourth quarter and the full year 2016 came in much stronger than we expected. So we are starting from a much larger base than we anticipated. We also delivered much more margin expansion in 2016 than expected, about 60 basis points versus our initial expectations of flat margins due to significant sales upside to our plan, which we are not counting on repeating to the same degree in 2017. 
 Second, we plan to rollout more Clinique and Lancôme expansions than in our original plan as well as other brands across the portfolio, including launching MAC. This will put additional pressure on the P&L in terms of product margin rates and the startup cost of building out these brands. But these brand additions are expected to deliver incremental sales and margin dollars. 
 Third, we will need to continue to invest in our supply chain and systems to be competitive from an omni-channel perspective. For example, we still need to play catch up with some basic omni capabilities like Buy Online and Pick Up In Store. 
 And finally, as Mary described, we will open a handful of non-prototypical stores, like Manhattan, with much higher rent than average this next year. This is a prudent approach to testing some different types of real estate, but it will nonetheless pressure the P&L. 
 All that said, our 2017 guidance is still in keeping with our long-range plan announced at our Analyst Day in October. Our plan allows us to invest in the business to improve the guest experience, drive market share gains and deliver healthy growth and sustainable long-term shareholder value. 
 We plan to open approximately 100 stores to all 10,000 square-foot boxes. For your models, we expect to open 15 stores in Q1, 25 in Q2, 40 in Q3 and 20 stores in Q4. In terms of the mix of market sizes, roughly 60% will open in large and medium-size markets and 40% in small and single-store markets, mostly in power centers and community centers, with about 10 in malls, including the Mall of America. And 5 or so in urban street locations like Manhattan, Michigan Avenue in Chicago and Santa Monica, California. About 20% will be located in new Ulta Beauty markets, and 80% will be still in existing markets. Roughly 40% are planned in new shopping center developments versus 60% in existing centers. 
 We plan to complete about 13 major remodels during the year. We expect of grow our e-commerce business approximately 40%. Total company comps are expected to be in the 8% to 10% range. We anticipate earnings per share growth in the low 20s percentage range, including the impact of the 53rd week and assuming approximately $300 million in share buybacks. 
 Operating margin is expected to increase modestly in 2017 in the 20 to 30 basis point range, with margin expansion building in 2018 and 2019 to reach our goal of 15% by the end of 2019. 
 I've highlighted some of the major margin headwinds but we also have many margin expansion opportunities ahead, including continued benefits from our CRM and loyalty program, supply chain efficiencies, procurement savings and new store productivity needs. As you model out the quarters, keep in mind the impact of the 53rd week in Q4. It's included in our low 20s EPS guidance. And while it's too early to forecast exact numbers, we anticipate that the extra week equates roughly to $100 million in sales or $14 million in pretax earnings, or approximately 2% of annual earnings growth. 
 Turning to CapEx. In light of the additional opportunities we've evaluated, we expect capital spend to be higher than our previous guidance, in the range of $460 million, which is in line with 2016 CapEx as a percentage of sales. Compared to our initial plan, we expect to spend more capital for stores in the non-prototypical locations like Manhattan, and we are planning for a higher fixture CapEx with the continued rollout of prestige brands as our access to great brands accelerates. About $80 million has been allocated for prestige brand updates with about 700 expansions of Clinique, Lancôme, Benefit and now, MAC. Further significant investments include the Fresno distribution center and a series of customer-facing technology investments necessary to remain competitive. 
 On the share repurchase front, our Board of Directors recently approved a new share repurchase authorization for $425 million to replace the prior authorization which will be canceled. Our guidance for 2017 assumes about $300 million in share repurchase, and our new authorization allows us flexibility to do more opportunistically. 
 Our tax rate is expected to be in line with 2016. But keep in mind, the new accounting rules effective in 2017 will change how companies record the tax effects of employee stock option exercises. The tax benefit moves from the balance sheet to the P&L, resulting in a potential for increased quarter-to-quarter volatility in our EPS results. We don't expect the full year tax rate to be materially impacted. As a point of reference, if we had adopted this accounting update in 2016, our effective tax rate would have been about 1 point-or-so lower. 
 Now moving on to specific guidance for the first quarter. We anticipate sales to be in the range of $1.244 billion to $1.265 billion versus $1.074 billion last year. We expect comparable sales to increase in the range of 9% to 11% versus 15.2% last year. E-commerce sales are expected to grow in the 40% range. We plan to open approximately 15 new stores in the first quarter versus 13 last year. So pre-opening is expected to be modestly higher. Earnings per share are expected to be in the range of $1.75 to $1.80 versus $1.45 last year, with modest leverage on both the gross profit and SG&A lines and with overall operating margin expected to increase slightly. The tax rate is expected to be 37%, and our fully diluted share count is estimated at 62.5 million. 
 Now I'll turn it over to our conference call host to moderate the Q&A session. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Omar Saad with Evercore. 
Omar Saad: I know it's just the beginning of the year. I want to just kind of have you talk about how you think about the long-term comp guidance you gave at the Investor Day in the fall and the initial kind of comp guidance for the year and how we should think about the fact that you're expecting the 2017 comp rate to be in that 8% to 10% range versus the 7% to 9% longer-term guidance you gave. And what kind of what gives you confidence that this year will kind of be above that longer-term trend that you expect. 
Mary Dillon: Great. Thank you, Omar. We try to be prudent, I guess, and really reasonable with the guidance that we give on every dimension. We see, obviously, the core of their brand. We've guided the 9% to 11% for the quarter. We feel confident about the strength of what's happening in the business, our ability to understand the dynamics and the levers that we have to continue to drive the results in a healthy long-term way. So I would just say that, really, there's no change to the long-term guidance. We always said that it would be stronger in the beginning and start to moderate a bit out in the outyears, so the 7% to 9% is the longer term. And as we guided 8% to 10% for this year, we feel it's just very much in our sight, line of sight, and feel very confident about being able to deliver that. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Steph Wissink with Piper Jaffray. 
Stephanie Wissink: Mary, could you talk a little bit about the brand boutiques? Just give us a sense of the current number across the 4 or 5 brands. And then of course, with the addition of MAC in that rollout how should we think about the staging and phasing of the rollout of those brand boutiques? And if you can just remind us what the productivity is of those prestige boutiques on a relative basis to your overall store average? 
Mary Dillon: Yes, I'll talk about these in sort of just overall terms. First of all, let me reiterate, we're thrilled about the launch of MAC. We're thrilled about the progress we're making across the box in terms of brands and newness and innovation. There's hundreds of boutiques with brand expansions that will happen this year. We talked about that in the script. We're not going to break that out in specific detail or the productivity. What I would say, again, we've referenced this. So in the upfront, there's some investment in terms of getting a brand up and going, and these fixtures are a little bit more expensive but they drive incremental sales and profit. And also in the long-term, excellent for our brand in terms of really reinforcing ULTA Beauty as a great destination for All Things Beauty. So we feel very good about that current status. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Kelly Halsor with Buckingham Research Group. 
Kelly Halsor: My first -- or my question is really around the margin expectations, and I appreciate, Scott, the color you gave. So if you can just dig in a little bit more on the puts and takes as you look at gross margin versus SG&A. Should we expect the same sort of dynamic to play out as we did in 4Q given that you have fully lapped the pulling of the coupons from last year? So not really expecting much product -- margin expansion from here? And then on the SG&A line, could you kind of quantify the dollar amount that you spent last year around the boutiques and how that plays out in '17? Is it going to be more? Or is it the same amount? Any color on that would be great. 
Scott Settersten: Sure, thanks, Kelly. As far as the gross profit question is concerned, I'd say looking ahead, I think that's where your pivot point is. So as I look ahead to 2017, I'd say gross profit largely in line with what we saw in the fourth quarter. So to your point, we have -- we are now lapping what I would call, the low hanging fruit of the postcard elimination that we saw in the fourth quarter of '15 and then carrying through the first 3 quarters of 2016. I will, again, for investors, we opportunistically took advantage of that. There's still, we believe, plenty of opportunity to continue to tweak our promotional and discount tactics and strategies as we look out over the long term. And with benefits of that, we're still not counting on that being a major driver of our mid-teens operating margin target here over the next couple of years. Again, as a reminder, most of the benefits we see there will come from fixed store class leverage and capturing benefits from our supply chain investments. So still very confident in our long-range target there. As far as SG&A is concerned, we really don't get into the details of the boutiques, how much they cost and exactly the productivity, but rest assured, you see the results of that in our comp results, right? I mean, that's part and parcel of what we're doing, continuing to invest in the store environment which, again, is our most important investment. It's one of the reasons we're able to drive such healthy traffic gain to our stores, right, continue to invest in that to keep it fresh and exciting and fun for our guests. So we believe these are great investments for now and for long into the future. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Jason Gere with KeyBanc Capital Markets. 
Jason Gere: Okay. I guess I got a question that I get from a lot of investors, and it's basically more of the male investors, so bear with me on this question. Can you just talk about the beauty enthusiasts? And I know that they're really the ones who are driving a lot of excitement on some of these new startup brands so -- as a means to drive sales. So can you talk about the sustainability of the beauty enthusiasts? So I guess the question I'm going to ask is really about the advertising that you're putting in-store, the support you get. But really, it feels like a lot of some of these brands that you're carrying are getting a lot of just word-of-mouth traction, YouTube support, et cetera. So can you maybe educate the male audience out there about beauty enthusiasts and your confidence that these enthusiasts can really continue to drive a lot of the excitement that's going on in some of your key categories? 
Mary Dillon: We will be very enthusiastic to teach more about the beauty enthusiasm. But honestly, I'll ask David Kimbell to add. I just want to say that it's actually one of the core reasons and one of the core foundations as to why we feel very confident about our long-term prospects is our understanding of this segment, the size of this segment and the momentum. So I'll let Dave take it from there. 
David Kimbell: Yes, yes. We're -- we've spent a lot of time really trying to understand her behavior. And our beauty enthusiasts, I think, we shared at the Analyst Day, just some information about her. She makes up about 57% of total women in the marketplace that drives a disproportionate amount of the revenue in the category. So to your point, it's critical that we continue to find ways to connect with her. We're very optimistic about her long-term engagement in the category. In fact, every indicator we have is -- shows that she's just getting more engaged, and that's largely due to the relatively new tools that she has at her disposal through social media and YouTube and the ability to learn more, to share more, to be more engaged in makeup and hair trends and skin trends. So she is not demographically defined. We see that across all ages from teenagers, through millennials all the way up from an age, from an ethnicity standpoint. It's not demographically defined, but it is a mindset that keeps her positively engaged. And so many of the things that we've been doing over the last 2 years-or-so to pretty significantly change our marketing mix had been very purposeful in order to reach her in new and compelling ways. A lot of the tools we used in the past, we've found weren't as effective in meeting her today. So our advertising, even some of the broad scale advertising, like TV and radio, we think sets the stage, and then we're building much more communication through social media, our own applications on [ph] our own website to provide content and engagement tools, influencers in the marketplace that are driving much more change in how consumers behave. And then even tools like our GLAM LAB that we launched on our app, which is a way for her to engage in beauty, virtually engage in beauty in a way that she couldn't before. So we're focused on meeting her needs. We're, as I said, very optimistic about her continued engagement, and it's really center of everything that we're doing in building our business for the future. 
Jason Gere: Okay. I appreciate that. And then Scott, can you just -- did you say what the preopening expense was going to be for the year, just so we have that? 
Scott Settersten: Yes. As a percentage of total sales, roughly flat with 2016. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Dana Telsey with Telsey Advisory Group. 
Dana Telsey: As you think about MAC, and it's so exciting that's coming in the stores, what could it contribute in sales? And how does the margin compare to the rest of the product categories? And then with online, the margin progression of online, where does it go and when does it balance out with stores? And just lastly, what kind of comps do you need to leverage expenses going forward? 
Mary Dillon: Thank you, Dana. It's a 3-point question. 
Dana Telsey: Exactly. 
Mary Dillon: Yes, we share your enthusiasm about the launch of MAC, and we're not going to give specific value. We're just getting started, right? So we're starting online, and we're going to launch to a little over 100 stores this year. And it's a really important brand for us to have, and we're confident it's going to add to the mix very nicely and our guests will be very excited about it. Your second question was, remind me. 
Dana Telsey: Online. 
Mary Dillon: Online, you mean the margin, right? So I will say that we're very focused on improving the profitability of our online business. As we've talked about today. And the big part of our supply chain investment is around fulfilling the online orders in a way that's better for our guests in terms of speed and also more efficient in terms of cost. But we expect to see it to improve, but we expect that, that -- the four wall margins are always going to be higher than the online margin. On the flip side, so the margin is getting stronger, but the great thing is it's a very incremental business to us, right? So we study this closely. We look at it very closely at consumer and our guest trends. And the guests who are shopping online only, this is a small number of people, it's really about guests who are shopping in-store and online, and that guest is involved across both channels is really driving 2.5x more sales, really, than somebody who's just buying in store. So even if that margin is, I think, in some ways, inherently going to be somewhat lower than the bricks and mortar, it's a very incremental business to us, feeds very much into the dynamic that Dave was just describing about how the beauty enthusiast shops. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. 
Simeon Gutman: Back to the question -- well, let me phrase it this way. Thinking about 200 basis points of margin expansion over the next few years, is the cost component of these continued rollouts of new brands, is that factored in? And I guess as part of it, would you say it's fair that new brands rolling into your top line, benefit your top line as well. But maybe you haven't built the full ramp of a brand like a MAC into that longer-term outlook? 
Mary Dillon: Yes, we certainly are doing the best job we can thinking about the cost of roll out of brands, and I say that's inherently assumed. We feel confident about the ability, we're maintaining the goal of reaching that '15 margin target by the end of 2019 and -- but being really, I think, very smart and prudent about how we get there, balancing short and long-term. And Scott talked about it well in his prepared notes, we adapt to the opportunity to invest long term in this business, and we're definitely going to do that because we know we've got -- we need to have the right brands, the right in-store experience and the capabilities to support that. So whether or not that top line could be stronger with some of these brand launches, I don't know. We try to be really as prudent as we can with our guidance. But we like to see how it goes before we call it higher than we think we need to. So... 
Scott Settersten: And I would just add to that. Assuming things, again we're giving guidance here early in the year, there's a long way to go in 2017, but even if we only achieve to what we're guiding to today, by the end of 2017, we'll be halfway to our goal, right, of close to 15% by the end of 2019. So there's still plenty of room left for us in a long time. And again, we always weight these decisions carefully, right, versus dollars, and we think today that these investments and these choices are the best for our investors for the long-term. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Oliver Chen with Cowen & Company. 
Courtney Willson: This is Courtney Willson, in for Oliver tonight. We just had a question regarding expansion into urban locations. You mentioned more capital, higher rents. Will you be merchandising these stores much differently on the product side in terms of the balance of mass versus prestige? And do you have any plans to adjust your service offerings at all to cater towards the urban customer versus your traditional suburban customer? 
David Kimbell: Yes, Courtney. It's Dave, I'll take that. Overall, no. We're -- we think our model works in all types of locations, urban, suburban. So we're merchandising these locations pretty consistently with how we're doing in all of our stores. There may be some fine tuning changes that we'll make, and we're certainly looking at making sure that these stores are efficient and effective. But we don't see a big mix. I mean, a big part of what ULTA stands for is All Things Beauty, All in One Place, having the proper category and mix, being able to have mass and prestige and hair care. And so we're going to make sure that it's reflected in that location. As far services, we think that's a big part of our mix, too so we anticipate very strong service businesses in those high-traffic locations, and we're preparing for that, but we're not radically changing the store design and the amount of space allocated towards that. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Ike Boruchow with Wells Fargo. 
Irwin Boruchow: I guess, Mary, this might be for you. Just looking at the loyalty membership growth, the growth rate, I think, has accelerated the last couple of years. I think now it's like 29% at the end of this year. Can you just talk to some of the things that you've done the last 18 or 24 months that's helped you accelerate that growth? And then kind of what's baked into your plan for this year in terms of new membership adds? And I'm just kind of curious if there's a way to talk about how loyalty is maybe even benefiting the comp. And if that does start to normalize, how should we think about more sustainable comp growth rate? Just tying comp and loyalty together would be great. 
Mary Dillon: Yes. So let me take some of that. Maybe I'll start. Dave, if you want to add. I will say, this is a bit of the secret sauce so I'm not going to get very specific about a lot of it because we're really proud about the loyalty program is working. And as you know, the loyalty members are driving the majority of our sales. So obviously, that's part and parcel to comp growth. I mean, that's the kind of the way to think about it. Comp is driven by a lot of components, but the sales are coming from our loyalty members. We've done a few things. One, is obviously, we just converted a couple of years ago to one loyalty program. We've simplified it. Our fleets make it very -- I think our communication about how the program works, how we communicate with that guest and how we convert new members, potential members in store, are all kind of components of what we've done that's making it work well. And I'll ask Dave to add some more color, but I will just say that also, what's exciting to me is we're not going to drive that rate of growth with new members forever, right, because we're kind of early in the program. But yes, we still really only have 20% of the beauty enthusiasts as we define them shopping at Ulta in the U.S. There's plenty more loyalty prospective members out there. And also even the folks that are on the program, we certainly don't have 100% of their share of beauty spend, and they're not even buying every category that we offer today. So we see these as all levers to continue to pull at the top line -- at the top level to help drive -- to continue to support the kind of comp growth that we're guiding. And maybe, Dave, just add a couple more points about what we've done with the program. 
David Kimbell: Yes, absolutely. As Mary said, the combination and the simplification into one program a couple of years ago really has allowed us to accelerate our growth in that space by a few things. The marketing has, by adding one program, has allowed us to just be sharper and clearer about marketing that on a national scale, which we couldn't do before. So we've been able to leverage that in all of our vehicles, reaching all of our guests. We have significantly increased our in-store execution, our store associates are -- better understand the program, they participate in the program, and they've done a great job educating our prospective members and converting prospective members into that program. And then we really made sure that just the value is there. It is fundamental to our overall business, and we want to make sure that we're continuing to meet her needs. There's 3 core things that we deliver to her. She finds value first in the points program, and we've got a number of levels and elements to that, but she finds that valuable, the ease of accumulating points and the simplicity of redeeming those points. She gets -- the second piece is she gets a lot of content from us. And this beauty enthusiast that I've described is open and interested in the content that we give her, whether it's our mag or e-mail or other activity that we have reaching out. And then we try to delight her throughout the year with special perks, birthday -- birthday gifts, anniversary gifts, sample programs. So those things keep her engaged, and the execution we've had through marketing and in-store and our merchandising partners have allowed us to drive that growth, and we're going to keep focused on doing that in the future. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Rupesh Parikh with Oppenheimer. 
Rupesh Parikh: So I also wanted to ask about your urban locations, and maybe even the Manhattan location. I just wanted to get a sense of whether you guys expect similar returns for the urban units? And then secondly, when you enter new markets such as, I guess, in this case, Manhattan, do you also typically see a meaningful lift on the e-commerce side of your business? 
Scott Settersten: Yes, let me start with that one. So to Manhattan specifically, and I guess the other urban sites that we're going forward with this year. By and large, we expect the same kind of financial results. I would say Manhattan is a special case. I mean, so back to Dave's earlier point about we're putting our standard prototype store in there, right? It's 10,000 square feet, and that's an expensive proposition anywhere on the island. We went to a place where we felt most comfortable, kind of a neighborhood feel there with a lot of traffic. I know we've got a new subway station, right? It's just right near our front door. So we're trying to make smart decisions as far as the location is concerned. That would be a case where we would take something less than our internal hurdle rate, which is way north of 20%, right? And most of our stores that we open each year performed way in excess of our internal hurdle rates. In the case of Manhattan, we're still expecting to recruit investment returns well above our cost of capital. I think that would be another measure that would be significantly lower than the 20%. So we feel very comfortable that this is a wise decision, and it's going to produce great returns for us. 
David Kimbell: And in the question about e-commerce business when we open a new store, we do see that not only driving growth in that store but driving our e-commerce business. We see it in all types of markets, small markets and we anticipate that to be the case in Manhattan. We do have a strong awareness, and we surround Manhattan, so it's not like we're unknown in that area. But obviously, this will be the first time we're serving them directly and we anticipate our e-commerce business to benefit from that as well. 
Operator: Next question, Chris Horvers with JPMorgan. 
Christopher Horvers: I'd like to peel apart the $80 million increase in CapEx. It seems like the number of Clinique and Lancôme upgrades were -- are in line with what you previously planned at the Analyst Day. Or I'm guessing that they were given that happened in October. So is the $80 million, is that MAC counters in the store, as in are you buying some of the real estate in markets like New York and Chicago? So perhaps you could lay out the size of the buckets of the incremental CapEx year-over-year? 
Scott Settersten: Yes. This one is one that I could understand. It could get a little murky for people who would just looking at the numbers at the top level. So I would say that short but easy way to think about the $80 million is, it's just incremental store fleet investment, all right? So when we gave the guidance earlier in the year about CapEx maybe being kind of flat-ish in '17 compared to '16, we didn't have line of sight clear on MAC at that point in time or how many stores it might go into and things like that. Since that guidance, we've increased the number of Lancôme and Clinique and Benefit boutiques versus our prior thought process, you layer in MAC on top of that, you layer in a bit of inflation in the new store, cost to open the new store, so most of it is primarily boutiques in those new stores, which is again is a great -- it's great news for investors because it's a lot more cost efficient for us to put this boutiques in new stores versus going back and remodeling stores, right, kind of disrupting guest activity, and it's a lot more expensive to do that. So it's kind of a combination of those things. But by and large, the $80 million is going into the store fleet, which again, our most productive asset and the reason why ULTA is a standout as far as driving traffic. 
Mary Dillon: Yes. And there's no purchasing of MAC real estate or anything like that. You asked that question at the end. Just to be clear, this is just investment in our stores. 
Christopher Horvers: Understood. So as a follow up, the CapEx should also drive extra depreciation expense which was not in what you previously guided in terms of margin expansion and getting to the mid-teens. So following up on a prior question that tried to address this, what's the offset in the margin line that allows you to stick to your existing long-term algorithm? Are you embedding more sales? Is there margin benefits that you are seeing now that you previously didn't expect when you laid that out? 
Scott Settersten: No. I mean, again, we're giving guidance, there's a range of outcomes, right, that you're looking at, a continuum. And so we feel comfortable that between having flexibility on the upside to do better with promotion tactics, I mentioned earlier, other benefits coming out of supply chain investments may be quicker than we had originally thought and just other stronger retail trends that drive a lot of leverage on fixed store cost. So combination of those things. And as we look at the range, we feel very comfortable that we can stick to our target. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Joe Altobello with Raymond James. 
Krystyna Metcalf: Krystyna on for Joe. I was wondering if you can talk about the promotional environment and who you're taking market share from? 
Scott Settersten: The promotional environment, what that we're -- who are we taking market from. 
Mary Dillon: Yes, I guess the best way to think about it is that we compete across a lot of dimensions, right? So I mean, we compete with the, I'd like to say, 70,000 places in any given day that you can buy beauty because we offer all the product categories and price points. So department stores are certainly one source. But we also compete with mass, with drug, online retailers. So it's really kind of across the board. Promotional environment, I guess, for us, what I feel good about is that we -- the quarter that we have with consistent levels of promotion a year ago, I think is a really good way to think about the underlying health of our business and that we have -- we're always going to make sure that we're providing a great value to our guests. And so there's always going to be some levels of coupons or promotions in store. But certainly, our loyalty programs allow us to get that much more focused and targeted and we've been doing that over the last few years. So I feel like we've got good control about our levers. We've got levers that we use as we need them. And more importantly, we're really just in an environment where beauty is certainly it's a growing category. It's very active. There's a lot of players. Nobody is doing exactly what we do, so we really try to just play our offense, and that's why we're talking about we're continuing to invest in the long term of our business because obviously, the beauty enthusiasts is voting with their dollars. We are not complacent. We're not perfect, right? So we know we just have to stay on top of our game. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Mark Astrachan with Stifel. 
Mark Astrachan: I wanted to ask about the percent of stores with at least one prestige boutique if you could comment -- if you cannot answer directly, just give some direction sort of how that's increasing over time. And commentary about more expansions for Clinique and Lancôme that you mentioned on the call, that relative to the 100 more boutiques that you announced at the October investor meeting. And just sort of broadly, given growth and seeming increasing focus on prestige brands relative to mass, any thoughts about how you see the sales split over time between mass and prestige within the stores? 
David Kimbell: Yes. So I'd start by saying we don't give, as we've said before, we don't give specific numbers on that. But I'd say increasingly, many of -- most of our stores, certainly more than half have at least one boutique in them. And as we continue to grow, I think if you look at the history of what we've talked about, we said at the beginning of last year that we started the year -- started 2016 with approximately 200 of each of Clinique and Lancôme and 700 of Benefit, and then we added about 500 boutiques last year. And this year, as we said, another 700. So increasingly, we'll be reaching pretty much the whole fleet with at least one over time, and we think that's important to continue to elevate the experience and invest in our stores, as Scott has said. As far as the mix between prestige and mass, we really focused on making sure the entire store is growing. Certainly, prestige has been leading. But our mass business across cosmetics for sure, but also skincare and bath has also been contributing in a very strong way to our overall business. And that's really important because that's ultimately what our guest comes to us for is that mix. So as much as we talk about and we spend a lot of time today talking about prestige boutique investments, we've been equally as focused on building all parts of our store. We're investing in our haircare business, adding a lot of new brands there, we're, as I said, building our mass side. So the balance overall is important. We don't see a real dramatic shift. It might gradually continue to grow within prestige but we are focused on keeping that balanced for the long-term. 
Operator: Next question, Simeon Siegel with Nomura. 
Simeon Siegel: Scott, just maybe to follow up on a few of the others. Just I guess, could we -- what do you expect depreciation to be this year? And then any update to what you'd expect CapEx to look like beyond '17? And then maybe for Mary or Dave, I don't know if I missed it, but where is the private label penetration at this point? Do you see any big difference between stores and online? And I don't know if you think about it like this, but is there a ceiling level that you wouldn't want to surpass? 
Scott Settersten: Yes. So as far as D&A and CapEx is concerned, I think D&A we said $215 million. 
Mary Dillon: $250 million. 
Scott Settersten: $250 million, sorry, 2-5-0, for 2017, is the estimate. In CapEx, Simeon, it's hard for me to sit here today and think about how we could do anymore, right, how could we take on any more with the capacity that we have. So we expect that CapEx, I've learned now never say never, but it's hard to imagine that the number could get larger than what we're looking at for 2017. It's a large undertaking, but again, a lot of that is going into the store fleets, and we think there's great payback there and great prospects for our investors over the long term. One other thing I would say about CapEx, so again, getting back to that $80 million number year-over-year. There's a lot of other things going on behind the scenes, I guess, right, besides, just the MAC and the Clinique and Lancôme boutiques. There's things like Estée Lauder, right, we introduced it last year. Going much larger with it this year across the fleet, 250 comp stores, up an additional 100 new stores. There's things like that. Remember, when we go to the stores and we do these boutique drop-ins, we're also taking the opportunity to refresh the store, right, on a pretty large scale. So we're going in with new nail features, fragrance fixtures, updating the ULTA Beauty collection where it makes sense. So there's a lot of activity going on in the store just to keep it fresh, right? When she comes back, it's like a new shopping experience, right? And we just want to continue to do that. So that's the CapEx explanation. 
Mary Dillon: Great. And then the ULTA Beauty Collection. I think we break it out. It's -- between 3% and 4% of the business similar online to in-store, which is true for most of our business. But actually, I'm really proud about our little Ulta Beauty Collection, the growth rate. I mean, Dave talked about this. The mass side of our business is very important to our guests. And our private label brand, we've really, really doubled down in making that a stronger brand than we had, and I'm proud of it. So part of the investments in store had to do with making sure that we're using fixtures and showcasing that brand and to its best possible light. We've invested in -- yes, we've redone the packaging. We're really bringing newness to that line, much more rapidly, and it is doing very, very well. So I don't know if there's a. cap. Certainly, like it. It's a great margin, and our guests -- the response of our guests is wonderful. The constraint would be, we're not going to be too big at anything, right? I mean, we want this to be a mosaic of brands that our guests want and love. Having said that, we know it can be bigger. It will be bigger, and we have a fair amount of space dedicated. We can make that space even more productive over time, and we will. So -- but we're proud about what's happening in Ulta Beauty Collection. 
Operator: The next question comes from Matt Fassler with Goldman Sachs. 
Katie Parson: This is Katie Parson for Matt tonight. Just taking a little bit on the SG&A cadence that you guys have had over the last year. Obviously, the growth per store was elevated, reflecting the investments that you've made. In the fourth quarter, that growth rate came back down pretty sharply. But as we think about how the investments that you're going to continue doing over the next year will flow through, should we expect that growth rate to reaccelerate once again? Or kind of given the base of investments that were made last year that, that growth rate would remain below prior year levels? 
Scott Settersten: Yes, I guess, I would say, again, in the quarter, when we look at individual quarter, every quarter has its special set of challenges and opportunities, right? And really, over the last couple of years, there's been a lot of investments, right? So I think we saw last year in the fourth quarter, we deleveraged on the SG&A line, right? I think for the year, we were kind of flattish. But the fourth quarter included some consulting expense. We were thinking about our Analyst Day and refreshing the 5-year plan. We were -- the business was strong. So we pulled forward some of our supply chain expense to try to get a head start on things. We also had some people decisions that we made to try to get more footsteps on the ground to make sure we could ramp up some of these investments even quicker. So again, we're lapping that in 2016. And you saw fourth quarter this year, right? We saw the fruits of our labor, so to speak, in a lot of different ways. We got a lot of leverage this year because we got an early start on a lot of those things. So I think we mentioned, as we look at 2017 now, SG&A, slight leverage, I would say, for the full year. So there's still a number of things that we need to work on, people-wise and tool-wise and we're just thinking what -- being pragmatic and doing what we think is good for the business for the long term. 
Operator: I would like to turn the floor back over back to Mary Dillon for closing comments. 
Mary Dillon: Thank you. I just want to reiterate, we're really proud about the year that we had in 2016, and I'd really like to thank our 32,000 associates for delivering that year and all their efforts to continue to drive our success in 2017 and beyond. I appreciate your interest in Ulta Beauty and look forward to speaking with everyone soon. Take care. 
Operator: This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time.

===== 2016 Q3  (2016-12-01 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Greetings, and welcome to the Ulta Beauty Third Quarter 2016 Earnings Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Ms. Laurel Lefebvre. Thank you. Ms. Lefebvre, you may begin. 
Laurel Lefebvre: Thank you. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us for Ulta Beauty Third Quarter 2016 Conference Call. Hosting our call are Mary Dillon, Chief Executive Officer; and Scott Settersten, Chief Financial Officer. Also joining us is Dave Kimbell, Chief Merchandising and Marketing Officer. 
 Before we begin, I'd like to remind you of the company's safe harbor language. The statements contained in this conference call, which are not historical facts, may be deemed to constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual future results may differ materially from those projected in such statements due to a number of risks and uncertainties, all of which are described in the company's filings with the SEC. [Operator Instructions] I'll now turn it over to Mary. 
Mary Dillon: Thank you, Laurel. Good afternoon. Ulta Beauty's top line momentum accelerated in the third quarter, driving record sales and earnings performance. The team continues to execute exceptionally well against our key strategies. 
 Highlights of the quarter include success in acquiring new brands, strength in overall newness, increases in awareness of the Ulta Beauty brand, continued excellent results from our loyalty program, improving performance of our supply chain and systems and robust growth in our e-commerce business. 
 In the third quarter, we grew the top line 24.2% and delivered 16.7% comp sales on top of the 12.8% comp in the third quarter of last year. This is the best comp performance on both a 1- and 2-year basis in our history as a public company, driven by healthy traffic and ticket growth. 
 We achieved the strongest quarterly comps of the year in all 3 channels. E-commerce growth was well above plan, and the retail and salon businesses also delivered their best top line growth of the year. 
 In terms of categories. Cosmetics, both mass and prestige, continued to lead our growth, with new brands and new items from existing brands contributing to better-than-expected performance. Strength on the top line was broad-based as we gained market share across all major categories. 
 Earnings per share rose to $1.40, representing 26% growth, significantly better performance than what we anticipated going into the quarter when our initial outlook called for 13% to 17% earnings per share growth. This upside in EPS was due to better-than-expected top line growth and our continued success with loyalty and CRM efforts. 
 I'd now like to highlight some of the key drivers of our third quarter performance in the context of our strategic imperatives, starting with our loyalty program. We grew rolling 12-month active membership by 28% to reach 21.7 million active members as our store teams continued to drive excellent conversion at checkout. Similar to the trends we've seen all year, the loyalty program metrics, including retention rate, sales per member, frequency of purchase and average member ticket, all continued to be very strong. We continued to prioritize more personalized CRM offers for our loyalty members versus broad discounts and promotions. And this evolution in our marketing strategy continues to benefit margin rate and allows us to invest in other parts of the marketing mix such as television, radio and digital advertising, which continue to drive awareness and clarity about our brands. 
 Our Ultamate Rewards credit card reward program continues to be well received since its launch in August. We're seeing strong guest engagement both in-store and online. Our team carried out extensive associate training and planning ahead of the launch, resulting in seamless execution of the program. Credit card sign-ups are exceeding expectations. Some of the compelling promotions we're offering for new cardholders are driving higher average baskets and units per transaction as guests take advantage of onetime offers. 
 Turning to our marketing and brand awareness activities. Our third quarter marketing plan features signature promotions like 21 Days Of Beauty in September, our Gorgeous Hair events in October and a series of activities focused on raising funds for the Breast Cancer Research Foundation. We returned as the official partner to The Ellen DeGeneres Show, putting BCRF and Ulta Beauty on a national stage to millions of viewers each week to raise awareness and funds. Our store teams raised nearly $3 million during this year's Gorgeous Way to Give campaign, and our salon stylists were proud to perform more than 50,000 beauty services at our Cut for a Cause event in support of our BCRF fund-raising program. 
 From an advertising perspective, during the fall, we ran national TV and radio ads to support our 21 Days Of Beauty and Gorgeous Hair promotions. The creative is new and built on the inaugural campaign from last year. We continue to also see significant growth in our social platforms, especially Instagram and Snapchat. We recently surpassed 2.6 million fans on Instagram and held our first-ever Snapchat takeover with YouTube influencer, Jenny Fox. We have Wende Zomnir, the Founder and Chief Creative Officer of Urban Decay, take over our Snapchat and Instagram channels, yielding millions of impressions. And we also announced a partnership with E! News with the launch of freeSTYLE, a weekly Facebook Live show. The program includes fan interactions, discussions and reviews of the best and most relevant people, products and trends that matter to the 9.5 million highly engaged E! News Facebook fans. 
 Now on the merchandising front. New brands and new products within existing brands drove better-than-expected sales growth with strength across all categories. Similar to what we've experienced all year long, makeup brands like Urban Decay, IT Cosmetics, NYX, Anastasia, Too Faced, Tarte, Clinique, Lancôme, Benefit, Real Techniques and Ardell delivered the highest growth rates in the quarter. Our own Ulta Beauty Collection was also a top performer. We've restaged the brand with new packaging, branding and innovation and about 600 stores now featuring enhanced wall presentation with improved signage and elevated fixtures. 
 In mass skincare, TONYMOLY and Boots No7 were standouts. And our Pro Hair business accelerated, with newness from DevaCurl and Living Proof contributing to strong comps in this category. Living Proof also partnered with our services business for a 1-day salon takeover event to introduce salon guests to this brand. 
 And we discussed many of the new brands we're adding to our assortment at our Analyst Day just a few weeks ago, but let me recap a few of the highlights. During the third quarter, we launched Estée Lauder skincare and cosmetics in 30 stores and online. We launched Shiseido, Origins and proactiv, greatly enhancing our skincare offering. We added e.l.f. to our online assortment. We introduced the innovation -- the innovative Dyson hairdryer in 200 stores and online. We've also completed almost all of the 500-plus Clinique, Lancôme and Benefit boutiques planned for the year. In addition, we added a best of Clinique endcap in all stores that don't have a full Clinique boutique. 
 Now turning to our services business. Salon sales grew 16.7% and comped 10.3% with strength in color, hair treatment and makeup services. Our services business is increasingly using CRM campaigns to drive awareness and encourage trial of our service offerings. We rolled out our improved online booking experience to all stores during the quarter to make it even easier for our guests to make an appointment in our salons. 
 We continue to focus on elevating our in-house artistic team and curating design trends exclusive to Ulta Beauty. Our fall and holiday trends include a look we call Sombre, which is a new softer way to achieve an ombre look; and a new color we call ronze, highlights that bring together beautiful shades of copper and auburn. The artistic team participated in several designer runway shows at Fashion Week, driving awareness for Ulta Beauty's hair authority and inspiring the entire salon team across the chain. And our Benefit Brow boutiques continued their excellent performance with brow services now available in more than 800 stores and the successful launch of a wide range of new brow products in more shades. We're now testing online booking for brow services to make it easier for our guests to make an appointment in our Benefit Brow Bars. 
 Turning to store growth. We opened 42 stores in the third quarter, on our way to executing our 2016 program of 100 net new stores, ending the quarter with 949 stores. Our growth and development team has completed almost all of the 500-plus prestige brand boutiques we planned for this year, including new stores and remodels, along with updates to the Ulta Beauty Collection of fragrance and nail fixtures. 
 New store productivity remains very strong, with the class of 2016 stores performing well above budget and far-above sales hurdles established to meet our internal rate of return threshold. We've already approved all of the 100 stores planned for 2017 program, including a new store on Michigan Avenue in Chicago. 
 As you heard in our Analyst Day, we completed our in-depth analysis of the real estate opportunity in the U.S. and announced a new long-term target to roll out between 1,400 to 1,700 stores, with opportunities to further penetrate existing suburban markets, expand our penetration in small markets and begin to develop urban markets. At the same time, we updated our new store maturation ramp based on current trends and higher new store productivity, upgrading year 1 sales from $2.8 million to $3.1 million and revising upward our year 5 sales estimate to $4.5 million from $4 million. We're confident that our stores will continue to produce very attractive returns. 
 Turning to our e-commerce business. ulta.com sales grew 59.1% on top of 56.3% growth last year, contributing 240 basis points to our total company comp. The strong revenue growth was driven entirely by increased transactions. We continue to evolve and upgrade the guest experience while improving site performance. We made enhancements to our mobile app, including our product detail page redesigned to better display product options and information, integration of our recently launched content platform called The Mix and the addition of our new salon appointment booking tool. We launched a try-on feature called GLAM LAB last month to allow guests to virtually test products and shades within our iPhone and Android app by uploading a selfie or choosing a model with a similar complexion. Our technology partner for this platform is a company known for best-in-class realism and accuracy of color matching. 
 Finally, to update you on supply chain performance and investments, we are very pleased and proud with how smoothly our team has executed on a very complex set of initiatives and system rollouts in addition to opening 2 new DCs in the past 1.5 years. Our Greenwood DC is now serving 227 stores and fulfilling 44% of our e-commerce orders. Our newest distribution center in Dallas is ramping on schedule and currently fulfilling 130 stores and 30% of total e-com orders. 
 On the systems side, we're starting to see benefits from the core merchandise systems we recently implemented. SWIFT, our new forecasting replenishment tool, continues to ramp up and help us optimize inventory. Our store-level in-stocks are improving and more of our inventory is in our stores versus in our DCs, improving the guest experience. We now have all the tools in place to help us make better, more data-based assortment and inventory decisions. 
 So that wraps up my third quarter review. Looking ahead to holiday, we're expecting healthy traffic and strong sales growth as a result of our integrated merchandising and marketing plan. From a product standpoint, we're excited to offer an array of newness and exclusivity on our holiday assortment across all categories and brands. 
 To share a few highlights, we'll feature an assortment of Clinique and Lancôme products in every store for holiday. We just launched NARS, featuring 3 hero products: their famous blush, bronzer and a multipurpose stick, The Multiple. These are available online and featured on the [indiscernible] in every store in time for holiday with a more expansive assortment offered online later this month and then launched in select stores next year. 
 Our merchants have done a great job partnering with our brands to offer exclusive products across many brands and categories, a wide variety of holiday-themed kits and stocking stuffers and men's grooming and fragrance kits. This year, we upgraded our fragrance kit with purchase program, complementing the exciting newness of our holiday fragrance assortment. And we've also launched an elevated Ulta Beauty Collection of our traditional blockbuster kits that have already shown strong consumer response. And to support our compelling merchandise offering, we rolled out our holiday advertising campaign JOY TO THE GIRL, which is integrated from a design and messaging perspective across all touch points from in-store signage to new TV and radio spots running now to prints and even the packaging of our Ulta Beauty Collection holiday assortment. Our campaign encouraged our guests to see us as a great gift-giving destination as well as a place to get glammed up for holiday events with a visit to our salon. The guest gifts and get glammed theme is featured in television and radio spots through inspirational content on our social media platform and on The Mix on our website. 
 Key to executing our holiday plan, our store operations, e-commerce, supply chain and systems teams have all done an excellent job preparing for the busy holiday season, and their efforts have already paid off with the successful Black Friday/Cyber Monday weekend both in stores and online. All areas are staffed up and ready to delight our guests during the big weeks ahead. 
 So now I'll hand over to Scott to discuss our third quarter financials and our outlook for the fourth quarter. 
Scott Settersten: Thanks, Mary. Good afternoon, everyone. I'll start with the income statement. Net sales for the quarter increased 24.2% to $1.13 billion, driven by 16.7% comparable sales and continued strong performance of new stores. The total company comp was composed of 11.1% transaction growth and 5.6% average ticket growth. The retail comp of 14.6% was comprised of 9.6% traffic and 5% ticket. Ticket growth was driven about 1/3 by units per transaction and about 2/3 by average selling price. The Salon business comped 10.3% and, similar to the recent trend, was driven by ticket growth. The combined retail comp and salon comp yielded a total store comp of 14.3%. 
 Gross profit increased 90 basis points. The improvement was the result of product margin expansion and leverage of store rent and occupancy expenses on strong comps, offset by planned supply chain investments. 
 Turning to SG&A expense. We deleveraged by 80 basis points, driven by investments in growth initiatives, including store payroll to support our boutique strategy and a differentiated guest experience; and deleverage of corporate overhead cost, in part due to an impairment charge related to the closure of a store in Louisiana due to the August flooding. This was partially offset by modest leverage in marketing. 
 The tax rate was 37.4%, consistent with the first half of the year. Last year's Q3 tax rate of 36% reflected the benefit of some tax true-ups. 
 Moving to the balance sheet. Inventories increased 16.5% on a per-store basis, which is slightly below the comp rate. Similar to the recent trend, we continue to invest in inventory to support sales growth, gain access to new brands and expand the presence of prestige boutiques in our stores. Also, our new distribution centers in Greenwood and Dallas are ramping and performing well but are still far from being fully optimized. 
 Capital expenditures were $131.6 million for the quarter, driven by new store openings, fixtures related to the continued rollout of boutiques as well as investments in systems. We ended the quarter with $243 million in cash and short-term investments. 
 In terms of share buybacks, we continue to repurchase shares in the open market as part of our 10b5-1 plan. During the third quarter, we repurchased about 179,000 shares of our stock at a cost of just over $44 million. Year-to-date, including the accelerated share repurchase program and activity under our 10b5-1 plan, we repurchased approximately 1,450,000 shares at an average price of about $205 per share. Share repurchases under our current authorization are expected to contribute about 2 points of EPS growth for the year. At the end of the third quarter, we had approximately $148 million remaining available under the $425 million share repurchase program announced in March 2016. 
 Turning now to guidance for the fourth quarter. We anticipate sales to be in a range of $1.516 billion to $1.541 billion versus $1.268 billion last year. We expect comparable sales to increase in the range of 12% to 14% versus 12.5% last year. E-commerce sales are expected to grow in the 40% range. We plan to open about 25 stores in the fourth quarter versus 14 last year, so preopening expense will be higher. Earnings per share are expected to be in the range of $2.08 to $2.13 versus $1.69 last year, with modest leverage on both the gross profit and SG&A lines. The tax rate is expected to be 37.5%, and our fully diluted share count is estimated at 63 million. 
 At our Analyst Day event in October, we raised our guidance for the full year 2016, expecting comparable sales to grow approximately 12% to 14%, including the impact of the e-commerce business and EPS to increase in the mid-20s percentage range. 
 Now with the upside to third quarter earnings, we expect full year comparable sales to grow 13% to 15% and earnings growth to be in the high 20s percentage range. Operating margin is expected to be up modestly for the year. 
 CapEx is on track to reach approximately $390 million, driven by slightly higher CapEx per new store and also includes about $80 million for boutique expansion, with 500-plus store touches for Clinique, Lancôme, and Benefit boutiques as well as fragrance fixtures and Ulta Beauty Collection updates. 
 Now I'll turn the call over to our conference call host to moderate the Q&A session. Operator? 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Matt Fassler of Goldman Sachs. 
Matthew Fassler: Any way you look at it, you saw a meaningful acceleration. Mary, you spoke about the 2-year comp. If you look at the typical seasonality of the business, you really broke out. What would you say, among the different drivers of the business, really changed the most? I mean, you talked about the credit card as being new and being successful. Would you say that, that was decisive? Would you say it was the convergence of brand adds? Would you say it was anything on the online side? How would you -- what would you identify as the primary catalyst to drive that kind of step change in sales momentum? 
Mary Dillon: Thank you, Matt. Honestly, it's -- I would say it's a convergence of multiple factors, some of which you just said. So we've been on a path for a while to drive increased brand awareness that obviously starts with that. People need to know who we are. I would say that, certainly, the assortment of products, of brands, the acceleration of new brands and the, frankly, the great performance of newness of new brands and the newness within existing brands has been a key factor. And I would also say that our sort of demand-creation engine just gets more fine-tuned. The team's done a great job through loyalty -- evolving the way that we promote to becoming more personalized. Our CRM platform working extremely well. As you mentioned, the launch of the credit cards has been another layer of a way for us to drive relevancy and drive share of beauty wallet with our shoppers. So it's really a combination of all of those things coming together plus, I would say, fantastic execution. So in store, the experience we think just gets better. Our associates have done a fantastic job of converting guests into our loyalty program. And obviously, our loyalty members are driving the majority of our sales. And of course, our in stocks are just getting better all the time. The supply chain and systems and teams behind those are working to just make sure that guests have what they want. So I hate to throw the laundry list at you, but it really is a combination of all of those factors working in concert. 
Matthew Fassler: Can I ask a quick follow-up without breaking your rule? 
Mary Dillon: Matt, you just broke the rule. But go ahead. 
Matthew Fassler: So to the extent that loyalty has typically generated a majority of your sales, as we look at the growth in loyalty members per store, is that a pretty good representative of your -- representation of your view of the growth in customers who are new to the chain on a same-store basis? 
Mary Dillon: Yes, I'm not sure if I could do exactly the equation you're doing, but you know that the majority of our sales are -- vast majority are driven by our loyalty members. And so that's where the growth is coming from, and we know that we're getting new -- I mean, we just really keep accelerating the growth of the number of people in the loyalty program, having 21.7 at the end of last quarter. So yes, I would say that those things go together. And awareness is part of what's driving them in, but it's also the relevancy of our offers and everything else that we're doing. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Simeon Siegel of Nomura. 
Daniel Stroller: This is Dan Stroller on for Simeon. With regards to the online booking, is there any way to quantify how much that contributed to performance? How should we think about the benefits this might provide to the brow bar and then other ways you can leverage this tool? 
David Kimbell: We're really excited to have it, particularly on the brow bar. No we wouldn't -- we're still monitoring and tracking it. It's relatively new on the brow bar. So there's no real specific data that we're ready to share about direct impact, but we think it's really important for us across all services to make it as easy as possible for our guests to make appointments and engage with us. And so we'll continue to evolve the technology. And we know that it'll improve the guest experience, and we're excited about that going forward. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Adrienne Yih of Wolfe Research. 
Adrienne Yih-Tennant: Mary, I was out in the stores over Black Friday and Black Friday weekend, and it was tremendous conversion. I was wondering, could you give us some metrics on kind of some of your Black Friday traffic stats and also kind of what you did differently this year over last year and how -- what the results ended up being? 
Mary Dillon: Sure. Thank you, Adrienne. Yes, can't get specific about the quarter that we're in. I'll just give you a little bit of color on it. We're pleased with how the holiday is starting, very pleased. And I think you saw that in action. I would say there's kind of a few things. One is that really, it's about what we sell, what we offer. So I mentioned some of this already, but we've really got great new brands, existing brands with great newness. And then I would say we just keep raising our game as it relates to whether it's partnering with our brand partners on exclusives and great holiday kits or really raising our own game like on our Ulta Beauty Collection blockbusters and products. So that, I would say, is a continuation of just improving. It's not new, but it's what we do but doing it better. Even our gift with purchase, stronger than year ago, and then really pull together in a really fantastic 360-degree marketing plan. So more to come in the holiday. I'm pleased with how it's starting both in-store and online frankly and, again, I said our store teams and our supply chain working together to make sure that the experience is great for the guest. 
Adrienne Yih-Tennant: And I'll just add that The Salon was incredibly busy during that weekend, so good job there. 
Mary Dillon: Thank you. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Mike Baker of Deutsche Bank. 
Michael Baker: This question is for Scott. I believe you said that SG&A was leveraged in the fourth quarter, slight leverage, I think you said. And if that's right, this will be the first time in 4 quarters when you leveraged SG&A. So is that a sign that we're now fully through all the supply chain and systems investments? And then should we, therefore, think that we should be able to leverage these really strong comps going forward? 
Scott Settersten: Yes. I would say as we look at 2016, the third quarter kind of represented the high watermark, I guess, I would say, as far as the deleverage is concerned. Again, a lot of factors come together at that particular point in a year whether it's boutiques ramping up, new stores, right, 42 new stores there is kind of the high bar. The supply chain, we're just getting out of the gate with our Dallas C [ph] there. So it takes a while for those things to scale up. So fourth quarter, as we go in with the heavier sales lift in the fourth quarter, we expect to see operating margin expansion and SG&A leverage as well. As I look to '17 and beyond, I would just be a little careful there. Again, we've given some long-term financial framework there, right, where we expect operating margin to expand. And I think we said generally, heavier on the gross profit line, a little bit less so on the SG&A line, but they both are expected to leverage in '17 and beyond. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Joe Altobello of Raymond James. 
Joseph Altobello: First question, I guess, for Scott. Obviously, the upside to the gross margin in the quarter much better than what we were looking for. And I think you guys have talked about that being flattish last quarter. And Scott, you mentioned product margin helped there as well as fixed cost leverage. Could you kind of give us a little more color on what happened on the product margin side that led to that upside? And then secondly, if I could, for Mary, as you look at the introduction of new bands going forward, do you feel like there's more of an opportunity on the department store brand side or more from upstarts? 
Scott Settersten: Yes. So as far as the product margins are concerned, Joe, it's really just a continuation of all the things we've been doing over the course of the last couple 2 to 3 years, right? So just being smart about our marketing, our merchandise mix, how we're optimizing the business for both in short and the long term. So we mentioned pulling back on broader kind of promotional efforts and kind of redeploying some of that into more targeted things with our loyalty and CRM tools. I mean, that just continues to work really well. So we're a pragmatic crew here. One of the fortunate things we have in this model is being able to toggle while we're in the quarter, right, and watching sales trends. So we mentioned the credit card got off to a spectacular start as we got into the quarter. We weren't expecting it to be quite so strong. So again, Mary mentioned there was a -- there's a nice offer there, right, 20% off your entire purchase when you sign up initially. So as we saw that kind of take off, we are able to pull back on the postcard that we typically do later in the quarter. So again, just looking at all the different elements and levers that we have to pull and try to optimize total results each quarter. 
Mary Dillon: And Joe, I'll have Dave take your second question. Dave? 
David Kimbell: Yes. So about new brands and where we see opportunity, I'll start with just saying we see opportunity across all parts of the store. That's one of the real secrets to our success is this all things beauty, all in one place. So we're looking for growth in prestige brands, mass brands, hair, skincare, fragrance. And we've been -- and that's part of the reason we've been having success is we've been bringing in new brands or expanding with existing brands in all parts of the store. And specifically, you asked about department stores brands or big established brands versus upstarts. And frankly, I think we're looking for both. We talked about expansion in some of the biggest established prestige brands. You know we've been continuing to expand our partnership with Clinique and Lancôme. We're just getting started with Estée Lauder and NARS, and -- but then upstarts has been a big part of our success over time, and we feel really privileged to be partnering with smaller brands that are innovating in new and creative ways. Makeup Revolution in the mass cosmetic space is one example of that, that has demonstrated some nice growth. So we'll look -- we will look for those opportunities as well, and both of those areas will continue to drive our growth. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Rupesh Parikh of Oppenheimer. 
Rupesh Parikh: So my one question is around your advertising efforts. So again, the past few months, you guys have again run the TV campaigns. It sounds like they're still meeting your expectations even as you lap some of the prior year efforts. I just wanted to get a sense of what's helping to drive still strong performance on some of those advertising campaigns. 
David Kimbell: Yes. So yes, we're really -- feel really good about where we are from our overall marketing campaign. We did -- this third quarter was the lap of our first national TV campaign in the fall of 2015. And as Mary said, we repeated that again, really supporting our 21 Days Of Beauty effort in the middle of the quarter, and the results were quite strong. We track that. We measure it very closely. We see strong and growing ROI across that probably most visible vehicle in TV. But other elements of our marketing plan, really all elements of our marketing plan are coming together to continue to drive awareness and growth. Radio is a strong contributor to that, but we've been investing much more heavily in the digital space, in awareness, in social media, influencer, really across our entire digital footprint to connect with our guest where she wants to be connected. Mary mentioned in her remarks, our Ulta Beauty Mix is an example of that on our own website, of creating our own content as a big push, also partnering with influencers to drive that. So TV is a big part of it. We're pleased with the results. We're continuing that as we speak over the holiday period. We're back on air, and we see that as a part of our mix. But we'll also continue to innovate in all parts of it to make sure we're really taking advantage of the awareness opportunity that we see ahead of us. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Brian Tunick of Royal Bank of Canada. 
Brian Tunick: I guess, my first question is ticket versus traffic. Just curious, I know you don't probably manage the business to it. But just curious as you think about -- when you head into 2017 or beyond, what do you think is the makeup of that comp performance you've laid out between ticket and traffic and what might be the drivers? And then, just a second quick one, is online profitability versus the store four-walls, like what kind of sales volume perhaps does the online business need to be to reach parity? 
Mary Dillon: Yes. I would say on the traffic versus ticket, to me, the ideal is just to be balanced, and we've been doing that, I think, pretty effectively. Last quarter, I think we were about 2/3 traffic, 1/3 ticket, and retail online was mostly transact -- traffic, which is great. But that balance is important because it's the ability to just continue to grow the business and not be reliant on just sort of a set number of people and visits. So a balance I think we'd expect to hope -- it's never going to be exactly that every quarter, but that's the overall goal. In terms of e-comm profitability, I mean, I guess that's a constant area of focus. First of all, our e-commerce business has gotten more profitable in the last couple of years as we've expanded the assortment, certainly the investments in supply chain, being able to get those orders together in more effective and efficient way. It will probably always be a somewhat lower profit margin than in the bricks-and-mortar part of the business just because of the shipping costs, but we're happy with it. I mean, the online business, as you can tell as we talked at Analyst Day, is -- looks to be quite incremental to our guests in terms of how she uses the channel. And so as we continue to close the gap on profit margin, it's a great part of business. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Ike Boruchow of Wells Fargo. 
Irwin Boruchow: I guess, my question, I'm not sure -- Scott, I think this is for you. I'm not sure if I'm looking at this right, but I think you said supply chain pressure should be the most pronounced in Q2 and Q3. And your gross margins were up really nice in Q2, Q3 about 100 basis points each of those quarters. And looks like if you're assuming expense leverage in Q4 that the gross margin expansion should be much more moderate in Q4. I guess, my question is, is there a call out there? Is this just holiday being a more competitive quarter for you? Or is this just general conservatism, if I'm thinking about this right? 
Scott Settersten: Yes. I mean, directionally, we're on the same -- when I say it's the high watermark for supply chain deleverage, we're not expecting a lot of improvement, I guess I would say, in the fourth quarter. It's in -- it's directionally about roughly the same kind of deleverage level. But again, it takes -- these are, I would say, we -- inside joke here, we're kind of the belt and suspenders crew when we think of some of these behind the curtain, complex new systems and processes that we're implementing. So better to be prudent and careful and make sure that we can execute to make sure we keep our guests happy and the performance in both those buildings is outstanding. They're doing much better than original targets and expectations, so we're very happy with the performance. 
Irwin Boruchow: Got it. But is there a specific reason why the gross margin gains you've been seeing, which had been pretty massive the last 12 months, why those would taper down significantly in Q4 and going forward maybe? 
Scott Settersten: Yes. I would just say, overall, the guidance is prudent, right? I mean, holiday is wild and woolly. A lot of things can happen, weather, other kinds of things. So we just want to make sure that we're prudent with our outlook and make sure that we provide financial targets that we feel comfortable that we can hit. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Mark Altschwager of Robert W. Baird. 
Mark Altschwager: I wanted to follow up on the boutiques, big investment, been  ramping up throughout the year here. Can you just give us a better sense of maybe how that's impacting the basket size and ticket expansion within those stores? Is it a trade-up versus an incremental purchase? And have you found the lift from these recent additions to be consistent with what you've experienced in the past? And perhaps to -- difficult to view these things in a vacuum, but just interested in any other learnings you have from the recent rollout. 
David Kimbell: Yes. Overall, I'd say we continue to be really pleased with the addition of these boutiques. We haven't shared specific incrementality, although we'd say this is incremental to our business and the new boutique are behave -- or performing as well or better than the -- at this stage in their life as the previous boutiques that we've launched. So we wouldn't have any reason to believe that they wouldn't continue to add in the way they have been adding. Having said that, of course, they are just a portion of our new brand additions. So while they're important, a lot of other things have been driving our overall comp growth in new brand additions. So we're pleased with it, and we see growth come in as we look into 2017. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Mark Astrachan of Stifel. 
Mark Astrachan: I wanted to ask about what's driving comp growth by category, if you could give a bit more granularity there, makeup, skincare, et cetera. And then just sort of a broader question and elaborating on one that was previously asked. I appreciate the kitchen-sink answer to the question of sort of what is driving comp growth. But what has surprised you most since March, given the original plan was 8% to 10%, now you're expecting 13% to 15%? Just sort of any granularity there would be helpful. 
Mary Dillon: Yes. I'll start with that, which is that I think it's really the performance of some of the new brands and the newness in existing brands have been stronger than we perhaps had forecasted, credit card stronger than we initially thought. So those are a couple of things that, I'd say, were somewhat more accelerated. It really is -- those aren't the only things that are driving the comp growth, right, so that's why I listed the dynamic of multiple factors working together. But those will be a couple examples of things that's probably stronger than we would have thought back then. And then, Dave, on the other question? 
David Kimbell: Yes. On the specific categories, I guess, I'd just say that we're, one, really pleased across all categories that we're seeing strong growth. I think Mary mentioned in her remarks that we're gaining share in each of our key categories. And the drivers, overall, we've talked about in the past is just a highly engaged consumer in beauty and our continued ability to connect with her and gain market share and gain her trust and loyalty and wallet share. And we think specifically within makeup, a lot of trends driving makeup. It is the fastest-growing segment of beauty right now, and that's really driven by a high-level engagement, particularly with young women, teens and millennials but really across all age groups and all ethnicities. Hispanic and all women of color, in particular, are heavily engaged in makeup. There's more education and training and knowledge and trends around different makeup looks and styles. So it is just a really healthy category, and our participation in that has expanded through the brands that we're carrying, the way we're marketing it, the way we're participating in social media, so we're benefiting from that. Skincare has been struggling for a few years but has shown some nice signs of growth. Korean skincare has played a role in that. We're seeing strong growth in different aspects. Masks are a big part but other Asian skincare trends are driving growth. And overall recognition by millennials, in particular, that it isn't all about makeup, but you need to make sure your skin is in good shape as well. And so we're seeing a nice rebound at skincare. Other categories, fragrance, that's -- that is -- isn't growing anywhere near the level of makeup but a lot of innovation in that space. We, of course, have been driving that with -- one example of that is our Sarah Jessica Parker exclusive, STASH. So a lot of different reasons across key categories, and we -- it's a big focus for Ulta to make sure that we're front and center in all of those trends. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Chris Horvers of JPMorgan. 
Christopher Horvers: So I wanted to ask about the cadence of the quarter. You preannounced in sort of mid-October at 14% to 15% at the Analyst Day. Were you anticipating a potential election disruption that didn't materialize? Was there an acceleration? Or was it just being prudent and conservative in the outlook? 
Scott Settersten: Yes. Again, there's always a lot of things to consider during the course of a quarter, right, and this pre-announcement always presents a little bit of risk. So again, you want to be confident in the numbers you're offering up to investors, right, that you're -- you feel confident that you can hit the target. So there was some hurricane things floating around there in the middle of the quarter, there was the election, the uncertainty. Again, we didn't see it reflected in our business day to day, but everyone else seemed to be talking about it. So again it was just making sure we are prudent and comfortable with what we were communicating. 
Christopher Horvers: Understood. That's very helpful. And then just as a quick follow-up, was there any incentive comp pressure that you had in this quarter because the numbers came in much better than expected? And could you quantify the impact to SG&A? 
Scott Settersten: Could you repeat that question again, Chris? I don't think I quite followed it. 
Christopher Horvers: Was there any incentive -- any bonus accrual pressure? 
Scott Settersten: Oh, I'm sorry. I did share the comp piece, not the incentive. Yes, so that year-over-year, that there was an impact in SG&A, it's not the most significant piece of it, but there definitely was higher incentive comp accrued this year obviously because of the performance, right, from what we initially thought early in the year. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Jason Gere of KeyBanc Capital Markets. 
Jason Gere: Just a simple question. I guess, as you think about the holiday season now, are you surprised by what your competitors are not doing differently than maybe over the last couple of years? Because it seems like based on our checks, they're doing kind of sticking to the script, and we know how that story kind of turns out. So I don't mean to put you on the spot. But just in terms of from other retailers out there and how they're approaching the holiday season, it's a great category obviously, but you seem to have kind of the right recipes. Just surprised that some of your competitors have not adjusted their strategy. 
Mary Dillon: Well, thank you, Jason. I don't know. I mean, I really can just focus on playing our offense, which sounds cliché. But I think we've got a really good bead on the insights, and Dave talked about this. That core focus on is our guest, current and prospective guests, what their needs are, how to think about the shopping experience, partnering with our brand partners to have great products and then our teams putting together great demand tools whether it's a CRM platform, credit card, all the marketing. So I mean, I really -- can't really comment on what people are doing or not doing. We certainly pay a lot of attention and are out there watching it as well. I'm proud about the fact that I think we're leading through guest insights and really driving execution through a lot of collaboration, and it's working. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Kelly Halsor of Buckingham Research Group. 
Kelly Halsor: I just wanted to follow up on the boutiques. I think you -- and correct me if I'm wrong, you called out 500 touch points related to the 3 brands where you have boutiques currently, and I know you guys said that you'd accelerated the growth of that this year kind of ahead of the holiday season. So if that is the case, I mean, what's the kind of opportunity into next year? I mean, are we -- are there opportunity with new brands? In terms of the class of store, is this a situation where as you go to the kind of next tier down of stores that we shouldn't expect the same sort of returns on the boutiques or perhaps you're not wanting to expand further? Just any color on the boutiques would be helpful. And then secondly, just on e-commerce with the implied deceleration relative to 3Q. I mean, we saw that last year as well, but I know you guys had just opened up the Greenwood DC. Now that the 2 DCs are running together and seem to be doing pretty well, is there any opportunity there that you could speak about? 
David Kimbell: Yes. So on the boutiques, you're right. We've talked about 500 total boutique installations across the entire chain, both new and existing stores, and with those 3 brands: Clinique, Lancôme and Benefit. We said before that we intend or anticipate that -- about that same amount next year, both new stores as well as existing stores. I wouldn't think of it as much going to a different tier of stores. We've really been rolling them out in our comp stores based on what's optimal from a scheduling standpoint, where it can fit lease terms for stores. Because we do other activities within the store when we put a boutique in. We'll  update our Ulta Beauty Collection presentation. In some cases, we put in a new fragrance presentation. So it is a part -- an important part but only a portion of the activity that we have in store when we put that in. So we'll continue to put those in next year and see that again. I'd say -- well, so that's important. It is one element of the new brand activity that we'll have across the whole chain next year. And as far as e-com growth in the fourth quarter, we just -- we feel confident within the guidance that we've given, and we'll continue to try to focus on that business. We're happy the results we've had so far this year, and it's an important season for e-com -- for our e-commerce business. And we're confident in our efforts. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Stephanie Wissink of Piper Jaffray. 
Stephanie Wissink: I just have a follow-up question on the e-commerce business. Could you compare or contrast a bit your online orders versus some of the store-level analytics? Is it similar from a category mix or mass versus prestige? And then as you think about overall, your loyalty program, how important is that online business to driving kind of a multi-channel shopper over time? 
David Kimbell: Yes. So the first part of your question around mix, generally, yes. It is very similar both online and in-store. Her shopping behavior is reflective of the in-store experience, in particular over the last couple of years, as we've rounded out our portfolio. Not so long ago, we didn't have all the brands in professional haircare or even in prestige online that we had in store. Now we do have that, and so her behavior is very similar, and we really see it as a complementary part of our in-store business. She looks to find what's most convenient for her as we -- book. As far as loyalty and the importance of that, your question is about loyalty and importance of both online and in-store and how we drive that. Is that right? 
Stephanie Wissink: Yes. And I think historically, you've given us the metrics around that cross-channel shopper per size and kind of importance versus the single channel. 
David Kimbell: Yes, yes. So we shared some of the -- those statistics back at our Analyst Day. It's really consistent in that 6% range of online omni-channel shopper. It's growing a little bit. But when our base store growth is so strong, it takes a really high e-commerce growth to make a big difference in that number. But importantly, the absolute number of omni-channel shoppers is expanding, and that's very much part of our overall strategy. We see that as a big part of our future growth, is to get her fully engaged in all aspects of our business: e-commerce, retail business, services and salon. We feel like once we can get her engaged in all parts, then her loyalty raises, her spend has gone up. We shared those numbers before. And so we're continuing to see that in the third quarter, and it will be a focus for us going forward. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Oliver Chen of Cowen and Company. 
Oliver Chen: We are curious about the next few years with mobile innovation. What's on your radar for just making sure your experience is set apart? And in that context, the reality of Amazon making strides in this category, what are just some of the factors that really continue to set you apart as you look to the future and continue to really distinguish yourself with a product assortment, with the loyalty program, with the newness factor as well versus Amazon? And then if you could just tell us, is strobing and contouring still middle innings? Because it seems like it continues to be a hot trend. 
Mary Dillon: I love it. Oliver, I appreciate your knowledge about the categories. I'll say contouring, strobing, highlighting, all that is still popular. Interesting little fact: false eyelashes is on the move, too, right? So it's something that you wouldn't think.  It's a tiny but fast-growing kind of trend, too. So anyway, that's the great thing about beauty. There's so much innovation and interesting trends that cycle in and out. I would just say -- I'll make a comment about mobile and ask Dave to add more color and context here, but you're absolutely spot on. We all -- everybody understands that mobile is the center of everybody's life. It's our appendage, our attachment. And I'm proud about the fact that I think as a company, our team has really been increasing our focus and our execution around mobile. It's becoming more important to us than ever in terms of driving sales and traffic, and it's fast-growing. We've been innovating in terms of our mobile platform, and I mentioned already but an example  is GLAM LAB, which is a nice little piece of technology that I'm not good enough to take my selfie to really execute it well. I've tried. But it's a great thing for millennials who want to have a more interactive experience. So as our offering and our execution in mobile improve, we just get stronger there. And it's certainly going to be the epicenter of how we think about sort of a mobile-first mentality as we go forward. Is there anything else you might want to add, Dave, in terms of  innovation there? 
David Kimbell: I'd just say mobile, to put it simplistically, is certainly -- for us, it is the focus of really all of our e-commerce efforts on this. So we'll continue to work on our desktop. But the -- where all the growth is and the attention is in mobile. Over 2/3 of our traffic is coming through mobile right now and a growing part of our sales and 2 core components of that, content and commerce. And we'll keep building a content experience that gives her access to the information when and where she wants it and then just make it as easy as possible for her to shop. It's a different -- as you well know, it's a different shopping experience on a mobile device. And so we're continuing to innovate in that space and make it easy through finding products, paying for products and exploring new information and trends. So it's really a focus for us. 
Operator: Our last question comes from Simeon Gutman of Morgan Stanley. 
Simeon Gutman: First, I'll put in part -- 2 parts. The -- on the top line, you said a lot of the sales or a majority are getting done in the loyalty card, as we know. Can you tell us how, I don't know if this was mentioned, the mix of either new sign-ups, since that's where the majority of sales are coming versus existing and how that's trended versus prior quarters? And then this is also a clarification to an earlier question. On the expense line, if I heard right, even excluding the impairment charge, did the corporate expense line delever? And if so, if -- I'm sorry if this was said, but can you tell us why and if that should continue? 
Mary Dillon: Yes. On the loyalty, Simeon, so -- I mean, we're growing rapidly and adding new members. But the majority of the sales are coming from existing members or members that have reactivated. But as we get new members into the program every day, frankly every week, obviously, that gives us a great base for future sales growth. 
Scott Settersten: And as far as the SG&A line is concerned, the answer to the question is yes. It did delever even ex the store impairment charge. It was primarily kind of a mixture of things, store payroll being one of the primary drivers. Again, part of it is connected to the boutique strategy. So there's a lot of training and payroll preparation associated with those new boutiques that are kind of just getting off the starting line during the course of the third quarter, right, and setting us up for success in fourth quarter and many quarters beyond that. And then we also kind of -- we were also -- with people cost-associated expenses in the quarter, again the way we kind of operate out, but we finally get all of our corporate headcount kind of adds in place usually in the third quarter. So again, that's maxed the leverage point during the course of the year and then a little bit of incentive compensation that goes along with that year-over-year comparison. Again, we leverage that as we go into fourth quarter and into following years. 
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back to Ms. Mary Dillon for closing remarks. 
Mary Dillon: I'd just like to thank our 30,000 associates for another fantastic quarter and all the hard work everybody has put in and has continued to put in to give our guests a great shopping experience over the holiday season. And thanks to all of you for your interest in Ulta Beauty, and we wish you a happy and healthy holiday. 
Operator: This concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect your lines at this time.

===== 2016 Q2  (2016-08-25 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Greetings, and welcome to the ULTA Beauty 2016 Second Quarter Earnings Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I'd now like to turn the conference over to your host, Ms. Laurel Lefebvre, Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin. 
Laurel Lefebvre: Thank you. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us for ULTA Beauty's Second Quarter 2016 Conference Call. Hosting our call are Mary Dillon, Chief Executive Officer; and Scott Settersten, Chief Financial Officer. Also joining us is Dave Kimbell, Chief Merchandising and Marketing Officer.
 Before we begin, I'd like to remind you of the company's safe harbor language. Statements contained in this conference call, which are not historical facts, may be deemed to constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual future results may differ materially from those projected in such statements due to a number of risks and uncertainties, all of which are described in the company's filings with the SEC.
 [Operator Instructions] I'll now turn it over to Mary. 
Mary Dillon: Thank you, Laurel. Good afternoon. Our team achieved another quarter of excellent top and bottom line performance while making significant progress in many elements of our growth strategy. Highlights of the quarter include the continued impact of a strong pipeline of newness and innovation in merchandising, progress in growing our brand awareness, reaching major milestones related to our loyalty program, continued rapid growth in our e-commerce business and successful execution of our supply chain investments.
 To summarize our second quarter financial performance. Total company sales grew 21.9%, and comp sales rose 14.4% on top of 10.1% comps in the second quarter of 2015, driven by healthy gains in both transaction count and average ticket. Strength in cosmetics, both mass and prestige, continues to be the biggest driver of our growth, while our other major categories are contributing as well. E-commerce performance was very strong, and The Salon business achieved solid top line growth. 
 We deliver earnings per share growth of 24.3% despite significant investments in the business, including the opening of our new distribution center in Dallas, implementing core merchandising systems and rolling out a large number of prestige brand boutiques and related store remodels.
 Let me cover some of the highlights driving our performance in the second quarter. Starting with our efforts to acquire new customers, our loyalty program surpassed the 20 million member mark and now boasts 20.6 million active members, growing more than 27% year-over-year on a rolling 12-month basis. We believe our evolving marketing strategy with a growing focus on multimedia advertising and digital marketing is working to raise our profile in consumer awareness and to better define our brands. Once people discover Ulta Beauty, our store associates continue to do a fantastic job signing them up for ULTAmate Rewards loyalty program. Retention rate, sales per member, frequency of purchase and average member ticket remain very strong.
 We're also very excited to launch our new ULTAmate Rewards credit card program chain-wide just a few weeks ago. We now offer members an Ulta Beauty private label credit card, which can be used in any of our stores and at ulta.com, and we offer a co-branded credit card, which can be used wherever MasterCard is accepted. 
 Our team has been working diligently on this project for more than a year, designing a program we know our members will love, upgrading our POS systems, preparing our store associates and developing our robust marketing program. It's a great example of enterprise-wide collaboration across multiple areas of the business. 
 The credit card is designed to enhance our ULTAmate Rewards program by offering greater benefits to our members, which we believe will drive increased engagement and loyalty. While we don't expect this new program to have a material impact on our results in the short term, early indications are quite positive, and we believe this will create tremendous value for our guests and our company over the long term.
 Our marketing mix continues to evolve with increased use of television, radio, digital and social media and less reliance on traditional print vehicles. During the second quarter, we executed a successful Gorgeous Hair event supported by national radio and digital campaigns. Reflecting our 2016 focus on the lip category, we continued our Lip Happily campaign and launched the #ThisIsHowILip digital campaign with native content integration, influencers, dedicated e-mails, video and banners with mass-reach beauty sites like Viva La, Refinery29 and POPSUGAR.
 Now turning to merchandising. Newness and innovation continues to drive the business. We're seeing ongoing strength in both mass and prestige cosmetics, with impressive growth in Urban Decay, IT Cosmetics, NYX, Anastasia, Too Faced, Tarte, Clinique, Lancôme, Benefit, Maybelline, Real Techniques and the ULTA Beauty Collection. The professional hair care category was also strong, anchored by great execution of the signature Ulta Beauty promotion, our leader event featuring compelling prices on jumbo sizes of salon hair care brands.
 New items contributed significantly to the overall comp. Noteworthy additions included Urban Decay's new assortment of 100 shades of Vice Lipstick, the introduction of Anastasia color cosmetics, the launch of Soap & Glory cosmetics, hundreds of new SKUs from NYX and innovation in the nail category with Essie's Gel Couture nail polish featuring up to 14 days durability. We added several new limited-distribution brands including Shiseido, e.l.f., Gillette, Drybar, Maui Moisture and Vita Liberata. We also expanded Clarins skincare to additional stores and rolled out BECCA Cosmetics to almost the entire chain. 
 The ULTA Beauty Collection continued its rapid growth with new products and an upgraded presentation, which includes a new wall layout and improved graphics. We're also improving the shopping experience with our chain-wide tester program for the ULTA Beauty Collection as well as mix within the mass cosmetics assortment. 
 We're very pleased with the strong execution of a large number of Clinique and Lancôme boutique installations that are planned this year, and the stores are excited to introduce these prestige brands to our guests. We'll continue to enhance the overall assortment with a strong pipeline of brands for the rest of the year and many more brands in the wings for 2017. Also, we recently launched the iconic Estée Lauder brand on our website and will roll it out to 30 stores in September with a broad expansion plan for next spring.
  To update you on our services business, our Salon sales rose 14.3% and comps 8% with strength in hair color, hair treatments and makeup services. We saw strong responses to year-round [ph] campaigns to drive services and continue to develop additional strategies to drive new customer acquisition over the long term. One example, we're testing enhancements to our online booking software and expect to roll out the new platform this fall. The new booking tool will make it much easier for our guest to select her service and schedule her appointment online, where and when it's convenient for her. 
 Also, our salon stylists were excited to experience our fall/winter training programs developed by our lead artistic team featuring a glamping theme, which is designed to integrate on-trend hair and makeup looks like ronze hair color, a blend of coppery red and brown; and natural darling makeup, which is a fresh take on no-makeup makeup. We also introduced BroLiage [ph], the first time we featured a men's haircare color service. 
 Our Benefit Brow Bar business continued its strong performance with brow services in 785 stores at the end of the quarter, with more than 500 of these offering brow tinting as well. We also enhanced Benefit's product offerings during the quarter with the addition of 36 new innovative brow products, which are merchandised in the boutiques as well as on custom pictures in our stores.
 Turning to new store growth. We opened up 24 stores and closed 3 stores in the second quarter. One closure was the Chicago State Street location, and the other 2 were relocations. We're on track to complete our 2016 program of 100 net new stores and ended the quarter with 907 stores. New store productivity continues to be excellent with new stores performing well above their budgets and their IRR targets. 
 In addition to the new store program, our growth and development team is very focused on ensuring high-quality execution of our prestige boutique rollout, and we completed a large number of the more than 500 Clinique, Lancôme and Benefit boutiques planned for this year. We're taking advantage of this boutique expansion activity to further refresh our store fleet with improvements to fragrance, nail and ULTA Beauty Collection fixtures. And looking ahead, we've already approved 100 stores for next year's real estate program. 
 Now moving on to ulta.com. Our e-commerce growth was very strong, up 54.9% and contributing 180 basis points to our total company comp. Site traffic accounted for almost all of the growth as we continue to invest in digital marketing. 
 E-commerce margins improved in part due to the more efficient fulfillment costs from orders delivered from our new Greenwood distribution center. Similar to our performance in stores, the fastest-growing categories were prestige and mass cosmetics. 
 Professional hair care was also a standout as this category ramps up online following the addition of many brands previously sold in-store only last year. Our signature leader event, featuring jumbo sizes of hair care products at compelling prices, was very successful online during the quarter. 
 To highlight our authority in hair care, we also conducted our first ever live beauty chat with expert salon stylists. These members of our elite Ulta Beauty artistic team answered guest questions on hair products, tools and tips.
 Turning to assortment newness. We launched Shiseido skincare products in the website ahead of our limited in-store launch. Continuing on our efforts to increase our portfolio of online brands, we introduced e.l.f., a popular value-priced cosmetics brand, at the end of the quarter. This new brand features many new products exclusive to Ulta Beauty in the assortment and got off to a very strong start in the website. 
 We continue to improve the guest experience at ulta.com with more content for the beauty enthusiasts. And recently, we launched a new feature called Ulta Beauty Mix with tips, articles and how-tos. The content is shoppable, and we view this as our first significant step towards merging content and commerce. 
 In addition, we've made several technical enhancements to the website, including a search engine optimization URL rewrite. We also released updates for our iPhone, Android and iPad apps, including support for ULTA Reward credit card applications and account management and improved loyalty program sign-up process, a new gift card purchase capability and Apple Pay expedited checkout.
 Turning to supply chain and systems, I'm very pleased to report that our new Dallas DC opened up on time in early July and is currently fulfilling more than 90 stores and about 30% of our e-commerce volume. The Dallas DC is expected to ramp up a bit faster than Greenwood, with plans to service more than 130 stores and 25,000 e-commerce orders per day by the end of the holiday period. 
 Similar to the benefits we're seeing from the Greenwood DC, the advantages of the Dallas operating model includes fewer, fuller and more stable retail cartons, increased categorization and improved labeling and enhancements for e-commerce orders. The Greenwood, Indiana DC, now just over a year old, is serving about 220 stores and fulfilling almost 40% of our e-commerce orders. We still plan to end the year delivering to approximately 240 stores from Greenwood.
 On the system side, SWIFT, our new forecasting and replenishment tool, has now been rolled out to all product categories. The space and floor planning and assortment optimization tool went live a few weeks ago, and our teams are starting to use the new system to plan for holiday and next year's store planogram. The space planning system will be fully integrated with SWIFT, and these processes will be integrated with our new master data system, which will automate the work and thus reduce the time needed to create floor plans at our increasingly complex spots. 
 So needless to say, I'm extremely proud of how our teams have executed across these initiatives while supporting strong growth.
 Before turning over to Scott, I'd like to preview our upcoming investor conference in Chicago on October 13. I'm very excited to update you on our long-term growth strategies and looking forward to giving you a deeper understanding of the drivers of our business, the future growth opportunities we're prioritizing and also to give you insight into the talents and capabilities across our leadership team. 
 You'll hear about our view of category and consumer trends that support our confidence in growth in the beauty category. We'll show how we plan to continue to elevate awareness and clarity about Ulta Beauty as a retail brand. We'll provide an update on our loyalty program and how we're using data in new ways to drive greater share of wallet of our ULTAmate Rewards members. We'll discuss the pipeline of new brands we plan to add to our assortment and provide new insight about our products and services offering. We'll describe how our supply chain and systems investments position us to drive cost efficiencies and higher service levels. We'll discuss the multi-faceted real estate analysis we've just completed that gives us confidence in many more years of store growth ahead, confirming square footage growth as a key part of our strategy to double our market share in the next several years. We'll detail the margin drivers that give us great confidence in achieving our mid-teens operating margin target by 2019 and show you why we're confident in achieving the long-term earnings growth targets we set as part of the strategic plan that we shared back in 2014, even on a much bigger base of business than we forecasted in the initial plan.
 So now I'll turn it over to Scott to give us more details about our second quarter results and our outlook for the third quarter and the year. 
Scott Settersten: Thanks, Mary. Good afternoon, everyone. I'll start with the income statement. Net sales for the second quarter increased 21.9% to $1.07 billion. And once again, our top line was driven by a very healthy 14.4% comp and strong new store productivity. The total company comp was composed of 9.7% transaction growth and 4.7% average ticket growth. The retail comp of 12.9% was made up of 8.9% traffic and 4% ticket. The Salon business comped 8%, with all of the increase, driven by ticket growth similar to trends earlier in the year. E-commerce growth of 54.9% was driven almost entirely by increased traffic with ticket growth up low-single digits. 
 Gross profit increased 110 basis points. The improvement was driven by a leverage of store rent and occupancy expenses as well as by healthy product margin expansion, partially offset by planned supply chain investments in our new distribution centers. E-commerce margins also improved with strength in the high-margin professional hair care segment. 
 Moving on to SG&A expense. We deleveraged by 110 basis points, driven by additional headcount to support our growth initiatives as well as an unexpected charge related to a store closure. We recently closed our multilevel State Street store in Chicago. The store was temporarily closed back in May due to disruption from a construction in an adjacent building. The extensive damages to the store and the extraordinary amount of time and expense required to reopen the store resulted in our decision to permanently close the location, necessitating a significant impairment charge. 
 This charge represented about 1/3 of the SG&A deleverage in the quarter. 
 We reassigned our impacted associates to nearby alternate stores and have assisted guests to minimize any disruption in their shopping experience. We are currently evaluating nearby relocation opportunities and expect to get a replacement store up and running soon. 
 Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. Inventories were up 18.7% on a per store basis, a bit higher than expected, reflecting the opening of our new distribution center in Dallas. Excluding the impact of the inventory for the new DC, inventories were up 14.5% on a per store basis, in line with our comp. We continue to invest in inventory, given better-than-expected top line growth, new brand additions and the step-up expansion of prestige boutiques. Going forward, we're expecting to see total inventory per door growth more in line with comp growth by the end of the year and anticipate that the efficiencies from our supply chain investments, including new DCs and merchandise planning tools, will become more evident in our financial results starting in 2017.
 Capital expenditures were $95.3 million in the quarter, driven by new store openings, fixtures for the rollout of prestige brand boutiques and supply chain investments. We ended the quarter with $304.1 million in cash and short-term investments.
 In terms of share buybacks, year-to-date, including our ASR, which settled in the second quarter and activity under our 10b5-1 plans, we have repurchased 1.27 million shares at an average price of approximately $199 per share. At the end of the quarter, approximately 193 million remained under the $425 million share repurchase authorization.
 Turning now to guidance for the third quarter. We anticipate sales to be in the range of $1.072 billion to $1.090 billion compared to $911 million last year. We expect comparable sales to increase in the range of 11% to 13% versus 12.8% last year. Online sales growth is expected to be in the 40% range.
 We plan to open about 40 stores in Q3 compared to 45 stores during the same period last year, and preopening expense for the quarter is expected to be about $7.6 million.
 Earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $1.25 to $1.30 versus $1.11 for Q3 of 2015. We anticipate a tax rate of 37.6% and a fully diluted share count of approximately 63 million.
 Our supply chain investments, particularly the ramp-up of our new Dallas DC on top of the Greenwood building still only fulfilling about half its plant capacity, will continue to weigh on margins the rest of the year. We expect to see the largest impact in the third quarter with deleveraging of P&L reflecting the high watermark of our supply chain investments. We anticipate stronger earnings growth in the fourth quarter on higher sales volumes.
 In light of the strength in the business in the first half of the year, we are raising our guidance for the full year 2016. We now expect comparable sales to be in the range of 11% to 13% for the full year versus prior guidance of 10% to 12%. We now expect to grow earnings per share in the low to mid-20s percentage range versus our prior guidance of low 20s percentage growth. We continue to expect that share repurchase activity under our $425 million authorization will contribute about 2 percentage points of earnings per share growth this year.
 The other elements of our full-year guidance are unchanged. We're on track to open approximately 100 net new stores, all planned to be our 10,000 square foot prototype. We expect to open about 40 stores in Q3 and 25 stores in Q4. We are also executing 12 major remodels and 2 relocations. We plan to grow e-commerce approximately 40%.
 CapEx is on target to be about $390 million, driven by slightly higher capital per new store and the rollout of boutiques. As a reminder, we've planned about $80 million for the boutique expansion and updates, with the rollout of over 500 Clinique Lancôme and Benefit boutiques underway as well as updates to our fragrance fixtures and the ULTA Beauty Collection.
 I'll now turn the call over to our conference call host for the Q&A session. Operator? 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Simeon Gutman from Morgan Stanley. 
Joshua Siber: It's Joshua Siber on for Simeon. I'm curious where are you guys in the investment cycle relative to where you thought you'd be when you laid out your 5-year guidance 2 years ago? 
Mary Dillon: I'd say we're right on track with that. I mean, we described that this year -- last year and this year would be kind of the key years of investment relative to the new distribution centers in Greenwood and Dallas, all on track; investing in new systems and capabilities, all on track. So we're pretty much right on track with what we described. 
Joshua Siber: Okay. And with respect to your consumer, how are you seeing the average age trend? Are you skewing younger with more social media mix of advertising? 
David Kimbell: Sure. This is Dave Kimbell. Yes, we see strength really across all ages and demographics. We don't look specifically. I mean, we certainly look at the demographics, but we're actually more focused on psychographic around these beauty enthusiasts, and we see that growth on all ages. Having said that, we're excited about strength with the millennials and teenagers, a lot of growth there, and the strong performance of our brand awareness growing there. And we see continued growth in that space. So really growth across all ages and demographics right now. 
Operator: Our next question is from Oliver Chen from Cowen and Company. 
Oliver Chen: We just had a general question regarding Amazon and your competitive advantages online in terms of what you're offering versus Amazon. And also as brands go direct-to-consumer, it would be great to get briefed there. And what -- on the long-term for online, what are your thoughts on margins in the context of just the changing customer expectations as online continues to evolve? 
Mary Dillon: Thank you, Oliver. I'll start and I'll ask if Scott and Dave want to jump in, so please do. On the -- I guess I would just step back and say we compete, as you know, with a lot of players, both bricks and mortar as well as online, but really nobody brings together everything that we do at one place. And so I don't think so much about head-to-head competition at any one place even though we certainly look very closely at the competitive environment. So our online offerings now represent everything we have in the store and more, pretty much everything we have in store plus more. We're starting to expand that. Our guests enjoy the online experience. We're improving the shipping time frame every day. And certainly, as she participates in buying products online at Ulta Beauty, she gets points, and that's the whole loyalty program she loves, because the more she buys from us, the more she gets points that then she can redeem anywhere in the store. So certainly, we compete with Amazon in some ways in beauty. I would say we offer a great selection that our guests love. But of course, as you know, we also have exceptional bricks-and-mortar physical experience that our guests love. And really, the beauty enthusiasts that Dave described love to go in person and buy beauty and experience beauty and, of course, get our services. So I look at them as part of the mosaic of competition and I think our proposition for our guests is really superior in total. In terms of margin on e-commerce, that's getting stronger. I mean, a big reason behind the investments that we've done in our distribution centers is to really improve the efficiency and effectiveness of that part of our business, and that's happening. I'd say the guest is happier with the speed of delivery, and certainly, the margins are improving. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Steph Wissink from Piper Jaffray. 
Stephanie Wissink: Just a follow-up question, Mary, on your comments around the prestige brand boutiques. I'm wondering if you can give us a sense of once you roll out those boutiques in store what the mix between prestige and mass will look like. And then, Dave, just as a follow-up to that, how you're thinking about marketing the localization of some of those boutique rollouts and drawing on your customer traffic in those local markets. 
Mary Dillon: Thank you, Steph. We don't really break out the exact mix. In total, part of the really compelling aspects of our proposition to our guests will always be the case of this assortment of categories and price points. And so while the shift to prestige has been happening over several years, and we're thrilled with the array of prestige brands that we have that we're rolling out, I don't anticipate that mix to change dramatically and relative to mass in the future. What's happening is we just have a great assortment of prestige brands to choose from, and that's a great, and we love those brand partners. But again for our guest, it's very important that she always feels that she can come in and have that combination of categories and price points that she loves about Ulta Beauty. 
Scott Settersten: Yes. And as far as the targeting localization, I'd say a couple of things. First of all, with the boutique brands, in particular, Clinique and Lancôme, Benefit, Bare, those we're building boutiques at a fast pace, but we're also expanding those brands, Clinique and Lancôme, into every store, to a presence of some SKUs in every store. And that allows us to market the brand at a total company level, national level, because every store will have some SKUs, both of those -- really, all of those boutique brands. But we also tailor and target and localize our communication through our CRM activities. Email is a big part of that. Our magazines will also customize based on location. And those that are close to a specific store with a boutique, we will customize that communication. At the same time, our national advertising marketing is really talking about the total Ulta Beauty, all things beauty, all in one place messaging. 
Operator: Our next question is from Kelly Halsor from Buckingham Research. 
Kelly Halsor: Just was wondering if we could dig in a little bit more into the back half guidance. Should we look at the magnitude of the gross margin deleverage related to supply chain investments to be similar to what you saw in 3Q last year when you opened up the Greenwood facility, or are you kind of implying that maybe it's a little bit more, considering you have Greenwood and Dallas both open now? And then, just secondly, on the SG&A cadence, how should we think about SG&A in the back half of the year now that you will start to be lapping the advertising investments that you made in the back half of last year? 
Scott Settersten: Yes. So the deleverage in the supply chain is significant. Again, I don't want to be reconciling basis points quarter-to-quarter, but it's kind of in the general ZIP code, I would say, to what you saw in third quarter last year. Net-net, I think, for the third quarter, gross profit is kind of flattish year-over-year when you add up all the puts and takes because we are still going to get a sizable fixed store cost leverage benefit in the quarter, we're going to continue to expand merchandise margins like we have earlier in the year, and so that will kind of cover up some of the hurt, I guess, I would say, from the deleverage from supply chain. What I don't think most of the models include now is the SG&A deleverage in the third quarter. It's much more significant than what most people are thinking. It's really a combination of the boutiques, the high watermark on the boutiques and the remodel programs and all the other things we have in process to drive growth for the business. So again, it's just a matter sequencing the quarters, right? A lot of it ends up in the third quarter this year. We've got some consulting timing that we've moved from earlier in the year to the back half to help us plan for the future as well, to help us frame out growth drivers that will help us next year and beyond. And then, there's another store impairment charge coming in the third quarter. That was just a fairly recent development as part of the heavy flooding down in Louisiana. So that's another roughly a $0.02 charge that was unexpected that we have to record in the third quarter. So that's really the combination of things. When I think about the rest of the year then, moving on to the fourth quarter, again, supply chain, we start get some benefits there, so we expect to get leverage overall on some of those supply chain investments. SG&A then, we get back into our normal cadence. The heavier sales volume in the fourth quarter. The upfront cost from some of those boutiques are behind us now, and we get leveraged SG&A in the fourth quarter. So that's kind of how we end up full year then, with slight leverage coming from gross profit and slight deleverage on the SG&A line that gives us an all-in slight leverage for the year in operating margin. 
Kelly Halsor: Okay. Great. And if I could just squeeze in one more. Very excited to see that you're introducing Estée, it's considered a pretty premier brand, cosmetics brand. Any opportunity there in terms of boutique opportunities similar to what you're doing now with Clinique and Lancôme. 
David Kimbell: Yes. We're excited to be launching -- introducing Estée Lauder, that launched online within the last week or so, and then, we'll be rolling that out into 30 stores next month. So at that point, you'll kind of be able to see the presentation will be different than the way we've done some other brands, we're really excited about it, and we're particularly excited about it, it's really focused on the strongest, most iconic elements of that line, parts like Advanced Night Repair, Double Wear makeup, complementing it with things, Perfectionist Serum, Extreme Lash. And we've had a strong fragrance, Estée Lauder fragrance business, for a while, so this will complement that very well. So we're going to watch it closely. It's one of the largest prestige brands in the world, and so we're happy to have it in the store, and we'll learn and look to continue to expand that over time. 
Operator: Our next question comes from David Schick from Consumer Edge Research. 
David Schick: With the continued success you've seen in this country, how does that factor into thinking about the way you might attack other markets? 
Mary Dillon: Well, first, I would start with the fact that we've got a lot of great opportunity here in the U.S. We're going to continue to be able to drive growth, we think, for many years. And as we start to think about international, we're starting to frame and look at possibilities. There's nothing to announce. But certainly, we're looking at where might it make sense from a consumer environment, a competitive environment, overall business environment, and we'll make some decisions if we move forward, we would do that in a way that would be let's learn about it first and then decide if we would go further. So in the analysis phase, I guess, is the best way to think about it right now. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Dana Telsey from Telsey Advisory Group. 
Dana Telsey: As you think about the new brands that you're adding to the mix, what's being taken out of the mix? And as you look towards next year, what categories are you thinking about that you'd like to add to the mix? And given The Salon business and, obviously, now some men's opportunity there, how do you see the growth of The Salon business and the margin implications? 
Mary Dillon: I'm going to tag team this with David. Maybe I'll just start with The Salon piece. I'm glad you noticed that. Yes, BroLiage [ph] is our [indiscernible] I want to see people line up for that appointment on this call, but it just was the creativity of our artistic team, they've really invented that idea, exfoliage [ph] for guys. Anyway -- but I'm really -- our salon and overall services business are a really critical part of our strategic imperatives going forward, right? So we've got hair services, skin services and brow services. And still, in many ways quite small, but performing really well. I mean, an industry in hair that's flattish, we're gaining market share and we're growing. So we see that as an area that we think we're working on just on how do you think about continuing to drive that as a growth lever, a traffic driver, bringing in a new guest. I'm sure you know that when a guest becomes a salon guest, she or he becomes one of our best guests because they come frequently and they spend 2.5x the amount of non-salon users. So more to come on that. And we think it's going to provide not only growth but also the ability to really position us as the beauty authority for many years to come. On categories, David? 
David Kimbell: Yes, as far as assortment and managing that and looking at new brands, certainly, as we add many of the great new brands that we've talked about and that Mary mentioned, that does mean in many cases that we have to make room for that. And it's really a focused approach on looking at sales and gross margin per square foot, inventory turn, a bunch of metrics that really look for the most profitable usage of our space, but also focused on elements that are really delivering against our core proposition of All Things Beauty, All in One Place. And so when we look at adding new brands, makeup is the fastest-growing part of the beauty business, and certainly, it is within our portfolio, so you'll continue to see makeup brands for sure. But we want to make sure that we're really focused on understanding how her needs are evolving, and we're bringing innovation across all elements, both mass and prestige. We've had a lot of innovation, great, exciting innovation in fragrance. We've got Sarah Jessica Parker's fragrance coming out on Sunday. I think it's good to be great. So a lot of innovation continued in fragrance. Skin care is an area that has had its ups and downs, but we see growth and potential within that. And then, certainly, haircare and connected to our salon, it's a big and very important part of our business, the styling part, liquids, shampoos, conditioners, tools, our professional tools area -- personal tools areas, so we'll continue to innovate across all parts of the store and optimize our assortment as we go forward. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Mark Altschwager from Robert W. Baird. 
Mark Altschwager: Can you talk a little bit more about your partnership with Alliance Data and the private label credit program? Just first, how should we be thinking about any revenue sharing or P&L implications over time? And then, you've already had a lot of success with your loyalty program, obviously, and the CRM initiatives, but how do you see that evolving as you start to leverage the ADS capabilities on that front? 
Mary Dillon: Great. Thanks for asking about that. I just want to give a little plug. I'm really proud about our team having really worked this for over a year, and it's a very cross-functional effort, as you can imagine, to prepare an organization to launch something like this. And we're off to a strong start. And the good news is we based it first and foremost on guest insight, which is that our guests are very interested in this program because it gives them the opportunity to just get more points at ULTA Beauty. But also for us, obviously, it's creating more loyalty, more -- increasing her share of wallet going to us. So that's all great, and we're not going to get into parsing apart all the details of the deal. ADS is a great partner. I will say they manage the program for us and take the credit risk, so that's great. And more to come. So our CRM team is really the folks who really own this project, and you can imagine, they've got a lot of ideas about how to leverage this going forward to drive growth. So more to come on that, and we feel good about where we are. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Ike Boruchow from Wells Fargo. 
Irwin Boruchow: Just a quick one. I guess, Mary, you talked about your replenishment business being fairly small today. I'm just kind of curious how big is it, if you can say, and kind of how do you view that part of the business longer term? Is it a key focus for you, or is it just -- are you focused on other parts of the business in terms of incremental growth from here? 
Mary Dillon: Thank you, Ike. Well, the good news is that everything we sell -- almost everything we sell is highly replenishable, but the great news is that our guest and beauty enthusiast is really not interested in just the same product every time. There's categories that she'll need to replenish when she's out. There might be a couple of items that she's quite attached to, but I'll tell you, for the most part, our guests are really coming in and loving to try new products. She loves trends, she loves newness, she loves great, new products that are launched by our brand partners. So what we're finding is that very little of the business is one-for-one replenishment. And as that becomes bigger perhaps in the future, we're always looking at that to see if there's a way we can make it even easier for her. But what she seems to be responding to is the breadth of innovation and newness. And if you look at, for example, our e-commerce guests, the guests who shop online and in-store, again, some of our best guests, they spend significantly more than someone who's not buying online. And what she's tending to buy is in response to things that we're bringing to her attention via email, so it's usually new products or exclusives or new trends. Again, I don't have anything against replenishment, but I love the fact that we're replenishing our products a lot, but the one-for-one piece is something that is not a big part of the business. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Jason Gere from KeyBanc Capital Markets. 
Jason Gere: I guess, 2 questions. The first one, did you say what your loyalty card membership growth was in the quarter? And I was just wondering, as this continues to rise, like how do you think about what the potential penetration can be? And on that point, what was the transaction size for loyalty card members versus non-loyalty card in the quarter? 
David Kimbell: Yes. We -- so our loyalty program did exceed the $20 million -- 20 million member mark to 20.6 million active members. That's a 27% growth rate. So we're really pleased with that. That's very strong. We've had very strong growth with that, and that will, we think, continue. And we're really happy with our new members. It's actually been a strong kind of flood of new members that are coming in and getting engaged with our program, understanding the benefits of the program. We'll also be able to then talk to them about new elements like the credit card. So clearly, a big driver for us going forward. The second part of your question was around... 
Scott Settersten: The baskets for the loyalty guest. It basically represents what we quoted in our prepared remarks, Jason. So, I mean, again the loyalty program is more than 80% of our total sales. And so when we're looking at those kind of metrics, that's basically what it represents. 
Jason Gere: Okay. Fair enough. And then, I guess, the other question was just given where the stock price is right now, how do you guys internally think about maybe splitting your stock at this point? The only reason I say that is a big part of your story is kind of reaching out to that retail customer. And if a stock was, let's just say, under $100, maybe you'll get more of your retail customers actually become your shareholders as well. 
Scott Settersten: Yes, that's something that we've kicked around from time to time with our Board of Directors. Again, thinking about all options, right, on being as shareholder-friendly as we can be, whether it's capital allocations or things like stock split. So surprisingly, I've only gotten this question maybe 2 times in the 3-plus years I've been here, and it's been at the annual shareholder meeting, right? So it's usually a local retail holder, right, that would ask that kind of question. So generally speaking, most of our shares are held by big, large investment funds and houses and most of those folks aren't that interested based on our Q&A with them about entertaining a stock split. So it's nothing that's on the front burner, but of course, it's something we'll always be ready to consider. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Mark Astrachan from Stifel. 
Mark Astrachan: I wanted to ask about thoughts on the sustainability of cosmetics growth, given the contribution to comp, and how do you weigh newer, smallish brands versus those from larger companies like Estée that you talked about and L'Oreal who are likely increasingly eager to work with you considering trends in other channels like department stores? 
Mary Dillon: Let me start by saying, as a category, beauty has been growing for multiple years. It's a strong -- it's up last quarter, was up 5%. Prestige was up higher than mass, but all growing. As you said makeup growing, the lead in terms of growth, skincare, every category we saw growth last quarter. So the good news is we're in a category that's growing. As we look at consumer trends going forward, and Dave touched on this, but younger women, millennials, Hispanic women, fastest-growing segment of our population, there's a propensity, we think, for the beauty category for all those folks to continue to play a very important role in her overall spend of her money and how she spends her time. So that's all good. And the great thing is that innovation comes from companies large and small, it's probably the most exciting consumer category, I think, that exists because innovation comes from many different sources, and we positioned ourselves to hopefully be a great partner for brands to do business with and we offer this variety of products, categories and price points. So I think that also helps to sort of insulate us as the subcategories go up and down, and Dave talked a little bit about those categories. We're trying to look out multiple years and say, okay, where do we place our bets, but knowing that, it really -- innovation is coming from all -- many sources, and we think the foundation of growth is there for us. 
Mark Astrachan: Got it. Great. And just one follow-up. In the next quarter from a guidance standpoint, it looks like the 2-year CAGR, and even for the balance of the year, back half, gets a little bit stronger relative to 2Q trends, is there anything in the timing, Scott, that influenced the rate of growth in comps in second quarter versus third quarter or fourth quarter? 
Scott Settersten: I know it gets a little -- if you look at quarters and you try to stack them together, we look at the single, the double, the triple stack, every which way you can look at the comp. There's nothing extraordinary that sticks out in any one. I mean, each quarter has kind of a unique set of opportunities and challenges. I would say, generally speaking, the back half of the year, we just feel really great about the boutiques, right? The tailwind we're going to get from that, finally, all being installed, there's a great pipeline of newness coming, and we believe we've got a great set ready to go for holiday, both on the assortment and the way we we've our stores set up and our gift card program. So we're very bullish on the back half of the year. 
Operator: Our next question is from Brian Tunick from World Bank of Canada (sic) [Royal Bank of Canada]. 
Brian Tunick: I guess, on the boutiques first, just thinking about the free cash flow going forward. I think, you're earmarking $80 million this year for the boutiques on the CapEx side. Should we be viewing that as a one-time number or maybe that's a peak number? And then, the second question is on your stated store targets, and I know you'll update us at the Analyst Day, but I guess, if there's more department store closings coming or you guys think your e-comm penetration can get to a certain level, how does that inform ultimately what you think the right size of the North America store base can be? 
Mary Dillon: Okay. Well, I'll start with the store piece first. Certainly, this will be something we'll talk more about in October. I think the dynamics that have been happening for some period of time in terms of how people shop for beauty. So that's not new to us. It's encouraging to us. As we look at how our stores are performing today, the store class is getting stronger, even after this many years of being in business, that's really encouraging. And we think that everything that surrounds how we're doing business, driving awareness, getting the great products and services are all enhancing that. So I feel good about that. We had a -- we think that our 10,000 square foot store has plenty of growth ahead. We're also looking at smaller markets, urban or suburban downtown-type formats. So all those things, we feel, given frankly the fact that we only have a 5% share of this really enthusiastic beauty shopper provides us plenty of runway for growth. So we'll talk more about this. We certainly have done a lot of work and analysis and feel confident that we can drive market share growth, frankly, both through comp store growth as well as new stores. 
Scott Settersten: And as far as the CapEx related to boutiques, again, I just want to remind folks that the boutiques were always in the plan back in 2014 when we rolled out the 5-year financial targets. There was an assumption in there for boutiques, all right, over those 5 years. We've just accelerated that, so we kind of pulled it forward -- '16, a big step up, roughly $80 million, as you mentioned. That will repeat next year into 2017, so we're kind of viewing it as a 2-year kind of cycle, and at that point, we'll have, again, those 2 great brands in the majority of our comp stores, and then it will be just about new store buildup from that point on. 
Operator: Our next question is from Joseph Altobello with Raymond James. 
Krystyna Metcalf: This is Krystyna on for Joe. I was just wondering if you could talk about the rollout of Honest Beauty this past quarter? 
David Kimbell: Sure. We're really pleased with it, it's a great brand, of course, from Jessica Alba's company, and it's off to a great start. I mean, it's part of Honest, The Honest Company, it's been a leader in a broader trend around natural and it's great to bring that to the beauty segment. There's other brands that have been in that space for a while with us, and we're seeing a lot of growth across the area, but really pleased with that and think it will be continuing to drive nice growth for us going forward. 
Operator: Our next question is from Chris Horvers JPMorgan. 
Christopher Horvers: Mary gave us a little taste of what you plan to talk about at the Analyst Day, and so I wanted to follow-up on one of your comments. You mentioned getting to the mid-teens operating margin by 2019. And of course, we'd like to parse words, and that buy stands out to us. So does this imply that your original mid-teens forecast could be reached prior to 2019? Because clearly, the comps have exceeded expectations, or does perhaps that long-term target -- long-term operating margin target see some upside? 
Mary Dillon: Yes, talk about parsing, I like that. We're not going to get into details on that today, except to say we feel confident about reaching the target that we set out back a couple of years ago, and frankly, at a much bigger scale of business today, right, with a lot more complexity, so I stand by that description. 
Christopher Horvers: Okay. We're Lip-Happy here so we like to parse [ph]. 
Mary Dillon: Okay. #That'sHowILip, I like that. Thank you. 
Christopher Horvers: So then, since I didn't get that one, can you talk about your in-stock rates, how they're improving at the store level, how they're improving online and contributing to comp growth? You mentioned that the 2 DCs are about 70% -- 2 new DCs are about 70% of the volume. Is the rest from the vendor? And does that percentage go up over time? 
Scott Settersten: No. So with the e-commerce, just to be clear, so we service e-commerce out of 4 buildings today, so Chambersburg out east, Romeoville here locally in Chicago, and then the 2 new, Greenwood and Dallas, and so, again, nothing's coming direct from the vendor, so we're doing all that. The new buildings are just much more efficient, right? They're designed to actually do e-commerce, pick-and-fill-and-ship processes unlike the older buildings, which were retrofitted and not quite as efficient. So we're happy to see that and we're showing the benefits show up in the P&Ls as currently and as we think about the future, so we're very excited about that. As far as in-stock rates overall, that's something that we've -- that's kind of priority #1 when we think about the guest experience in our stores. And again, that's part and parcel of all the investments that we've been talking about for the last couple of years, whether it's distribution center to help the throughput there, capacity and capability overall, but also, we're doing a lot other work behind the scenes with merchandise planning, tools, SWIFT we've talked about, master data, managing that better, floor planning and space planning kind of tools that are going online as well to help with in-stocks overall. And then, our team internally here, there's a lot of individual projects and look-sees going on around how we can do a better job, just making sure we go extra heavy on A and B SKUs so we just don't disappoint folks, and how can we be more effective with some of the C, D, E and F SKUs, right, in the stores and how we better align ourselves on that. So all oars are in the water when it comes to in-stocks and inventory productivity across the enterprise. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Rupesh Parikh from Oppenheimer. 
Erica Eiler: It's actually Erica Eiler on for Rupesh. So clearly, another strong quarter from your team, and your results continue to stand out, but we are seeing a mixed consumer backdrop out there, is there anything that you're seeing from a consumer or even a geographical perspective that concerns you at all? 
Mary Dillon: Well, we're not complacent about our results, so I'll say that. But I will tell you that as we look at -- our results have been pretty consistent, I would say, across regions, core up period to period, pretty consistent. So -- and you just saw the kind of comps we've delivered. So we're seeing that -- a strong consumer sentiment, right? And I think, it's because we continue to benefit from the fact that we're in the category that's important to our guests. And I mentioned this earlier, it's replenishable, it's affordable indulgence, and beauty is popular right now in many ways in terms of culture and social media. And so you combine that with being in a range of categories and price points, so even if somebody is a little bit more pinched, you can also get great products at a lower price from us. And at partnership with our brand partners, we're continuing -- continuing to excite her with newness. So I feel like our results would say that there's certain pockets of consumer spending that are quite strong, and obviously, we see that macro for the category of beauty as well. We'll just continue to watch it closely. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Omar Saad from Evercore ISI. 
Omar Saad: I actually wanted to follow up on one of the earlier questions about the potential for category expansions in the future and maybe ask more specifically about bath and home and those types of related products, scents and soaps, if those are categories that you would look to going into? I think, it would have a very nice overlap with the customer base and with All Things Beauty as well. 
David Kimbell: Yes. I'd start by saying we're always looking across every element of the beauty space to find growth, and we are listening to our guests and finding opportunities. Our focus is on continuing to drive a lot of innovation in those most important biggest categories that we have, makeup, hair, skin care, fragrance, nail is important, but we are looking -- we are seeing some nice growth in additional categories, one of which you mentioned, bath and body space is one that is a nice category, obviously not anywhere near as big for us as something like makeup, but we do see growth potential. We've added some new brands into that space, Fizz & Bubble, Soap & Glory among others, and we've got some great business. The exclusive distribution of the Body Shop outside of their own shops is an example, and so it's not huge for that total bath and body space isn't enormous for us, but it's an example of what you're talking about. We do see potential growth to continue to add to that and make sure that we're delivering against what our guest is looking for. So we'll look across all different avenues in addition to the big ones that we're driving growth on today. 
Omar Saad: And then, while we're on the topic of the product offering, I've heard you mentioned a couple of times now in the last few quarters, prestige and mass, the areas of strength, almost a bit of a barbell, high, low. Are you evolving? Do you see yourself evolving the offering and kind of the density of the price points around the high, low strategy, or could this be a little bit more of a transitory effect? 
David Kimbell: Well, make sure I understand your question, but the mass and prestige has been part of our business and is part of the original insight that the company is founded on and certainly is a critical part, key part, of our strategy today. We've grown our prestige business pretty quickly over the last several years as we've added a number of brands, but we've also been focused on growing mass, so a key part what our guest really responds to us is this idea of mass and prestige because that's where she shops, that's how when you look at products that she has at home, most women don't have either prestige or either mass only, they have both. So providing both to her is a key part of our strategy. We will never kind of shift away from that, we want to see growth on both sides because that's what our guest wants. And so we're investing heavily in the experience as well as bringing in new brands and innovation across both sides, the range of price points that we think is what our customers really want. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Simeon Siegel from Nomura. 
Simeon Siegel: Any way to quantify what portion of the transaction growth came from new customers versus greater frequency of visits? And then, just sorry if I should already know this, but when you open up new prestige boutiques, do you have general rules or preferences regarding geographically clustering those brands or just starting them out? And if they are clustered, any color on how the existing boutiques have done after the new openings? 
David Kimbell: On the customers, I don't think we've kind of broken out that level of detail. What I would say is there's kind of a few key elements that are driving our total customer growth. Retention is strong and healthy. And as we look across, as we understand just loyalty programs, not necessarily just in beauty, but loyalty programs, we think we have a very healthy, probably it's a leading level of retention. So that's key and strong and will continue to be. Reactivation, we've talked about in the past and that also was strong in the second quarter, which is essentially those that had not shopped -- that had been members of our program but had not shopped with us in the last year through some elements, our expanded marketing, advertising, new store openings perhaps, we'll get them in and driving that. But new -- totally new guest, is absolutely still a big growth driver getting that guest attracting new guests across the country, both obviously new stores but existing stores bringing her in as a key part to our growth. So those 3 things are what's driving that growth today. And then, boutiques was -- I don't know if I fully understood the question about... 
Mary Dillon: The location. 
David Kimbell: Where we're locating. It's really across the country. So across the country. We're looking at really stores -- as we continue to add these 500 boutiques, we're seeing success in big market, small markets, all different regions of the country, we'll continue to expand. As Scott said, by next year, we'll be in a large percentage of our total chain, so thereby being in most stores across the country. 
Operator: I would now like to turn the floor over to Ms. Dillon for any closing comments. 
Mary Dillon: Thank you. I just want to thank everybody for your interest in Ulta Beauty, and we look forward to seeing you in a few weeks at our Analyst Day. Importantly, I'd also like to thank all of the Ulta Beauty associates for delivering yet another terrific quarter. Take care. 
Operator: This concludes today's teleconference. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect your lines at this time.

===== 2016 Q1  (2016-05-26 17:00:00) =====

 [Operator Instructions] I'll now turn it over to Mary. 
Mary Dillon: Thank you, Laurel. Good afternoon, everyone. 2016 is off to a phenomenal start with excellent top and bottom line growth in our first quarter. There are several factors coming together to drive the momentum in our business: healthy consumer demand in the beauty category; ULTA Beauty's unique and relevant format and positioning; and effective collaboration across the enterprise, which is driving strong execution of our growth strategy. 
 To recap the first quarter results: We grew the top line 23.7% and delivered a 15.2% comp on top of an 11.4% comp in the first quarter of 2015. This is our best comp growth since 2006. Comp sales were driven primarily by traffic, while ticket also saw healthy increases. Ongoing strength in cosmetics, both mass and prestige, is the largest contributor to our growth, but other major categories are delivering robust comps as well. E-commerce continues to see rapid sales growth. The Salon's top line was solid even while we reduced the frequency of our promotions. So with overall revenue growth significantly better than planned, coupled with strong execution of our strategic imperatives, we delivered earnings per share growth of almost 40%, well above our expectations. 
 I'd like to call out some more specific details on the primary contributors for our performance during the quarter. Growth in our loyalty program continues to fuel our business results. ULTAmate Rewards membership grew to 19.4 million active members, up 25% year-over-year. This continued acceleration of sign-ups reflects our store associates' efforts to convert new members and strong traffic driven in part by our advertising campaigns. 
 The number of members shopping increased as well as their average sales per ticket -- per visit. Loyalty member retention has increased steadily each quarter and is up almost 200 basis points compared to last year. Using the loyalty program points as currency, our CRM team is working closely with our merchants and our brand partners to continue developing targeted and relevant campaigns that are increasingly resonating with our guests. 
 Our marketing mix continues to evolve with great balance across television, radio, digital and social media as well as our traditional print vehicles. In March, we ran television and radio ads for our signature 21 Days of Beauty event. We complemented this with an aggressive online video campaign as well as extensions into online radio with Spotify and Pandora. 
 We elevated our social media and influencer efforts anchored on our spring trends. We surrounded our consumer with current and relevant content online and in-store as well as activation at high-profile events, including the Coachella music festival. 
 Our comprehensive campaign for Mother's Day, which was called Pamper Her with Pretty, was designed to build awareness of our brand, deepen our connection with our guests and provide a platform to make ULTA Beauty a top-of-mind destination for gift-giving, especially in fragrance. In addition to the return of the Mother's Day gift guide and fragrance finder, we offered more Gifts with Purchase and CRM promotions in conjunction with many exciting new fragrance launches. 
 The Mother's Day activities also included a social media campaign with the launch of a special video entitled Mom, the Original Beauty Icon, which invited guests to celebrate mom by sharing what makes their own moms' beauty iconic through a post on Facebook, Twitter or Instagram. This campaign was viewed over 4.5 million times. We believe all these marketing efforts contributed to our strong traffic growth during the quarter. 
 Now to update you on merchandising. The trends from last year continued to drive the business, with Urban Decay, IT Cosmetics, NYX, Anastasia, Too Faced, Tarte, Clinique, Lancôme, Benefit and ULTA Beauty Collection among the best performing brands for the quarter. The pipeline of newness really continues to be quite compelling, translating into strong growth in both mass and prestige cosmetics. 
 During the quarter, we launched Honest Beauty in 250 stores, rolled out our exclusive Fiona Stiles line in 500 stores and added Buxom Cosmetics to all doors. Anastasia Beverly Hills and Perricone launched new product lines. Clarins was rolled out to additional doors. We introduced Tarte's Double Duty Beauty collection, which is exclusive to ULTA Beauty. And we rolled out Dior mascara to all stores. 
 More recently, we announced the addition of dpHUE hair care products, and we began to offer Nuxe, a French skincare brand, on our website. We also rolled out an assortment of the iconic Drybar hair products and tools in hundreds of stores. 
 We are enhancing our ULTA Beauty Collection through a series of initiatives. We've been updating and elevating the formulas and packaging as well as the in-store graphics, while improving speed to market and on-trend products. Trend categories include contouring, strobing and multidimensional makeup. And we've also added an endcap featuring new spring kits. We've produced compelling training videos and enhanced our sampling programs. While we've made great progress, we're just getting started with our efforts to evolve ULTA Beauty Collection to continue to represent our brand personality. 
 Turning to services. Our salon sales rose 14.7% and comped 7.7%, with strength in blowouts, hair treatments and makeup services. We view the services business as a growth opportunity, and we're very focused on our strategy to convert more of our loyalty members to discover our high-quality services offering. Our Benefit Brow Bar business continued its strong performance, with brow services now in 738 stores. And we're proud to perform more brow services than anyone else in the U.S. 
 Moving on to stores. We opened 13 stores and closed 1 in the first quarter, well on our way to executing our 2016 program of 100 net new stores. We ended the quarter with 886 stores. New store productivity remains very strong, with all vintages of stores benefiting from the successful execution of our strategic imperatives. Our growth and development team is now in the process of performing a deep dive analysis to refresh our estimate of the store potential in the U.S. This analysis includes an updated assessment of the potential for smaller and urban markets as well as how our small store format will fit into the future store mix. Sharing the outcome of this work is expected to be one of the topics we plan to cover at our next Analyst Day this fall as well as other updates from our long-term strategic plan that we're now in the process of refreshing as well. 
 Moving on to ulta.com. Our e-commerce growth was very strong, up 38.8% and contributing 130 basis points to our total company comp. The mix of professional hair care and prestige cosmetics continues to grow, helping our e-commerce margin rate. We're also adding brands and products that are available only online such as J.Cat Beauty, StriVectin Hair Care, Eyeko and ManCave among others. Our ulta.com guests remain very interested in our beauty bag sampling program and Beauty Break! limited time promotions. 
 Mobile is growing rapidly, now representing more than 60% of site traffic. We released new versions of our iPhone and Android apps in the first quarter. The iPhone app was featured on the Apple Store home page. Moving up to a 5-star rating, this new version now includes features such as Apple Pay checkout, enhanced features displaying ULTAmate Rewards information and Gifts with Purchase details on product pages. Both app versions have been a big hit with users, garnering enthusiastic user reviews and an increase in downloads, now reaching well over 2 million between the 2. 
 Finally, our supply chain and IT teams have done a great job managing the ramp-up of the Greenwood distribution center while preparing to open our new distribution center in Dallas, which began to accept inbound inventories just last week. The Greenwood DC is now serving about 200 stores and fulfilling roughly 40% of our e-commerce orders. We're on track to end the year delivering to approximately 240 stores from Greenwood. 
 Our Dallas facility, a carbon copy of our Greenwood building, is right on track to begin outbound shipments in July as planned. We expect to ramp up this newest DC to serve 125 stores by holiday. As expected, the Greenwood distribution center and systems are producing efficiencies and cost per unit shipped. 
 On the system side, we have good progress to report here as well. SWIFT, our forecasting replenishment tool, has been rolled out to additional categories including skincare and hair care, and the rest of categories will be implemented throughout the remainder of the year. I am particularly proud of the supply chain team and the IT teams' performance and deep collaborations, and they're balancing the execution of several major initiatives and projects while doing an excellent job improving in-stocks in our stores to support the higher-than-expected sales trends. 
 So now I'll turn it over to Scott to discuss the drivers of our first quarter results and outlook for the second quarter and the year. 
Scott Settersten: Thanks, Mary. Good afternoon, everyone. 
 Starting with the income statement. Similar to previous quarters, our top line was driven by a very healthy 15.2% comp and strong new store productivity. The total company comp was composed of 11% transaction growth and 4.2% average ticket growth. The retail comp of 14.3% was made up of 10.5% traffic and 3.8% ticket. The Salon business comped 7.7%, and Salon growth was all ticket-based. E-commerce growth was almost entirely driven by traffic, with modest ticket growth. 
 Gross profit increased 150 basis points. The improvement was driven by strong leverage on store rent and occupancy expenses as well as by healthy product margin expansion, offset by planned supply chain deleverage related to investments in new distribution centers and core merchandising systems. Strong product margin performance was driven in part by significant margin improvement in mass departments due to changes in our promotional offers and a mix of higher margin brands, including the ULTA Beauty Collection. We continued to carefully pull back on broad discounting, while placing more reliance on loyalty and our CRM tool kit. 
 Moving on to SG&A expenses. We deleveraged by 20 basis points, primarily related to investments in headcount and consulting to support our growth initiatives. 
 Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. Inventories were up 14.5% on a per-store basis, slightly below the comp rate. This growth was driven by investments in inventory to keep up with better-than-expected top line growth, new brand additions and the accelerated expansion of our prestige boutiques. In-stock levels have improved year-over-year, but we still expect to make more progress going forward as we begin to reap the benefits of our new distribution centers and related systems. 
 Capital expenditures were $54.3 million in the quarter, driven by new store openings, merchandise fixtures for the rollout of prestige brand boutiques and supply chain and system investments. 
 We ended the quarter with $369 million in cash and short-term investments. 
 We repurchased 158,000 shares at a cost of $27 million under our 10b5-1 plan. 
 And as you know, we entered into a $200 million ASR agreement in March, which settled just last week. During the first quarter, we received 80% of the shares we expected to receive on settlement, or about 852,000 shares. 
 The reduction in shares outstanding year-over-year contributed approximately $0.03 of earnings per share growth in the quarter. Including the entire $200 million paid as part of the ASR agreement, approximately $219 million remained available under the $425 million share repurchase program announced in March. 
 Turning now to guidance for the second quarter. We anticipate sales to be in the range of $1.041 billion to $1.058 billion compared to $877 million last year. We expect comparable sales to increase in the range of 11% to 13% versus 10.1% last year. Online sales growth is expected to be in the 40% range. We plan to open about 25 stores in Q2 compared to 20 stores during the same period last year. And preopening expense for the quarter is expected to be about $4.6 million. 
 Earnings per share are expected to be in the range of $1.32 to $1.37 versus $1.15 for Q2 of 2015.  Our supply chain investments, including the new Dallas DC, are expected to weigh on margins the most in the second and third quarter. And we expect earnings per share growth to be higher in the fourth quarter this year.  We anticipate a tax rate of 37.6% and a fully diluted share count of approximately 63 million. 
 In terms of our outlook for the full year 2016, we are raising our guidance for comparable sales and earnings per share growth to reflect the strong start to the year. Total company comps are now expected to be approximately 10% to 12% compared to our prior guidance of 8% to 10%. We now expect to grow earnings per share in the low 20s percentage range versus our prior guidance of 18% to 20% growth. Operating margins are now expected to leverage slightly. 
 The other elements of our guidance for the year are unchanged. We are on track to open approximately 100 stores, all planned to be on our 10,000 square foot prototype. We expect to open about 25 stores in Q2, 50 stores in Q3 and 15 stores in Q4. We're also planning 12 major remodels and 2 relocations. We plan to grow e-commerce approximately 40%. 
 We expect CapEx to be about $390 million, driven by slightly higher capital per new store and the rollout of boutiques. As a reminder, we planned about $80 million for boutique expansion and updates, with over 500 Clinique, Lancôme and Benefit boutiques as well as updates to our fragrance fixtures and the ULTA Beauty Collection. 
 We anticipate that share repurchase activity under our $425 million authorization will contribute about 2 percentage points of earnings per share growth. 
 I'll now turn the call over to our conference call host for the Q&A session. Operator? 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Chris Horvers of JPMorgan. 
Christopher Horvers: I was curious. A lot of retailers talk about an uneven cadence during the quarter. Some folks are [ph] to manage earlier in the quarter, some weather issues. I was curious if you had a view on how that impacted your business during the quarter. 
Mary Dillon: Thank you, Chris. Well, I guess, first of all, I'd say, what we saw was pretty consistent across the quarter in terms of comps. Not a lot of variation. Where we did see variation, it was maybe cadence in promotions than we had planned. So I think at the end of the day, beauty as a category is a great place to be, as you know, and it's a healthy category. And it's fairly, we think, insulated from some of the factors that are affecting maybe retail broadly. And in particular, our -- what we bring to the marketplace in terms of this differentiated proposition of categories, various price points, products and services, we think makes us pretty insulated right now. And we're pretty proud of the results. 
Christopher Horvers: Understood. And then, as a follow-up, can you just talk about the performance, the comp performance in your mature store base and how that impacts your view on potential store penetration over the long term? 
Scott Settersten: Yes, I can. Our store model reflects mature stores 5 years and older kind of moderating, comped down to middle, lower single-digit kind of comps over the long term. With the 15 comp in total, as you can well imagine, Chris, I mean, the existing store base, very healthy comps overall, very productive on the SLE [ph] contribution line, which is a huge contributor to the profit increases that we saw year-over-year. As we look to the future, I mean, that's part of the mix. We're adding the boutiques, that's why we're being so aggressive with the CapEx this year to get those installed. We believe that, that along with all the other great parts of the pipeline that we have coming aboard, loyalty on top of that, some of the marketing and advertising kind of initiatives we have underway, we think all of those things together will come together to drive really strong productivity in that existing store base. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Joe Altobello with Raymond James. 
Joseph Altobello: I guess, first question on the ULTAmate Rewards program. Obviously, hugely successful for you guys. You're now well north of 19 million. First, how high can that number get? I guess you guys, I'm sure, have done some demographic analysis in terms of the potential size of that. And secondly, if you can remind us what percentage of your sales comes from your loyalty club members. 
Mary Dillon: Thank you, Joe. Well, first of all, I would say we've said it's well over 80%. Over 80% of our sales are driven by the loyalty program members. We're really pleased with how that's working for our business. It's really one of the key drivers of the results that we're seeing is the acceleration in members entering the program. Really proud about our store teams being able to convert new traffic and new members into the store and into the program. How high is that? I mean, certainly, we ask ourselves that question as well. As we think about our kind of long-term view of the business, it's going to be obviously a very key driver for us as we move forward. And if you step way back and look at it, our share of the market in beauty in the U.S. is still only 3% or so of the total market, right? So we know there's a lot of growth ahead. And we're very focused on understanding kind of what it is about the loyalty program that drives the appeal and continue to make sure that we fine-tune it going forward. So we think there's more growth there certainly, and I think our results are showing that. 
Joseph Altobello: Okay, understood. And then just moving on. I guess, one for Scott. The guide for 2Q, you mentioned, it looks like earnings per share down sequentially. That's seasonally feel [ph] unusual. You mentioned some of the costs related to Dallas hitting you in 2Q and 3Q. You had the Greenwood facility around the same time last year, and yet, you had sequential earnings improvement in 2Q. So I'm just curious, is Dallas bigger in terms of the impact? Or is the timing a little bit moved forward relative to Greenwood? 
Scott Settersten: No, I would say it's probably more along the lines of a couple of new factors this year. So again, I think we've kind of talked about the DCs and the lapping effect there year-over-year. So not a huge change there, I would say, in the sequence. We do have accelerated depreciation from this boutique acceleration that we talked about, so again, you guys can't really model that very accurately. But that's a little bit lumpy, and it's kind of first half of the year kind of weighted, I would say. And then, we also have some store payroll implications related to the same boutique strategy, right? So I think we explained back in the fourth quarter that it takes a lot for those boutiques to ramp up, right? So they're being installed now and we got some payroll investment there in the early days, which again, over time moderates and plays very well at least from a profitability standpoint. So it's really the payroll piece of that and some of the depreciation that's related there that's causing it. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Brian Tunick with the Royal Bank of Canada. 
Brian Tunick: So excited to hear you guys are having an Analyst Day in the fall. It sounds like the footage in the smaller stores, you'll be updating us on. But I guess I was curious about the mid-teen operating margin that you have been talking about. I guess, if you look at these double-digit comps you've been running, I guess the question is, can you get to a mid-teen operating margin target faster? Or is there anything impairing you from getting to a high-teens operating margin over the next couple of years? So curious on that. And then from a market share perspective, when we all look at the department store numbers they've been putting up in the last couple of quarters, can you maybe talk how that affects the brand conversations? So are there still major holdouts regarding brands that you'd like to be offering your guests, that might be still looking at the department stores as one of their key channels of distribution? 
Mary Dillon: Okay, thank you, Brian. On your first question, well, I'm not going to provide our guidance today. Nice try, though. But it's a really fair question. I'd say this. We're very confident. First of all, we're thrilled with the progress in the business. I mean, I think that should be pretty clear and confident that we understand the drivers, and we see plenty of growth ahead. We're confident in the mid-teen operating margin target that we've stated previously. I think what you'll see is we -- we're looking to refresh our view but feel good about where we are. I wouldn't expect to change our outlook materially. We believe we can continue to drive top line and invest in the business for the long term as well as drive efficiencies with the investments that we're making today. And while we're thrilled about the top line momentum, I think all of us would say consumer expectations in the future will continue to evolve. And so we need to be prepared to be able to respond in some areas, lead in some areas. So that makes us cautious about getting more aggressive about that gross margin target. 
David Kimbell: Great. And Brian, it's Dave Kimbell. On your second question around adding new brands in this environment, I'd start with saying that we're really focused on growing our business with our existing brands, and that's working very well for us. We've got a great portfolio of brands across all categories. And that's been very successful and will continue to drive success for us going forward. Having said that, Mary mentioned some of the brands that we've added just in the last quarter. You've heard that we've added well over 100 over the last several years. So we're always looking at new brands. And as our growth continues, I think we're an attractive partner for brands. So we'll continue to be having discussions and exploring new opportunities. But right now, we're really focused on continuing to drive behind the success that we've been having. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Jason Gere with KeyBanc Capital Markets. 
Jason Gere: I guess I want to go back to talking about maybe the omnichannel customer, and I know you talked about e-com was up almost 40%. A lot of that was traffic-driven. So I was just wondering, as you're kind of learning more with the loyalty card and CRM and the personalization, how are you getting that transaction size of that omnichannel customer to kind of increase? And any updated outlook in terms of how big that customer could actually become as a part of your subscriber base? 
Mary Dillon: Well, I'll start, and maybe, Dave, if there's any additional color you want to add. We're totally [ph] with the growth that we're seeing in e-commerce. Of course, it's still a pretty small percentage of our sales, just under 6%. So -- and what's interesting is that as we look at that omnichannel shopper, I guess, multichannel shopper, we love that guest because they're really our best guests in many ways. So the person who's shopping both in-store and online is driving 2.5x the sales than somebody who's only shopping in the store. So what that says to us is it's quite incremental. There's not like a lot of replenishment-type activity happening. We talked about this. We focus on this beauty enthusiast who's really focused on trend and newness. And actually, when we get her email address, the ability to give her email, spark her imagination and curiosity about other products that maybe she didn't see in the store, seems to be driving. Whether it's that or Beauty Breaks! or samples, they're really responding. So over time, we certainly see that expanding in terms of percentage of sales. It's a small percentage of our sales today in terms of the multichannel shopper, but it's a very healthy place for us to continue to look at driving growth. 
David Kimbell: Yes, the only thing I'd add to that is what we see as this omnichannel guest, most of them pretty quickly if they come in through e-commerce, pretty quickly move into retail. And that's what we like to see. We want her experiencing the entire ULTA Beauty experience, both online and in store. We're investing heavily in various -- both enablers of omnichannel around our inventory and our understanding of our guests as well as guest-facing experiences that we've talked in the past. We've got beacons in our stores now that allow us to -- will allow us over time to identify our guests. We've got same-day shipping with -- in partnership with Google. Mary mentioned some of the app improvements, which will make it easier for her to buy anywhere and anytime she wants. So it's a big focus for us, and we see lots of upside going forward from that. 
Jason Gere: Okay. And then the other one, I was just going to squeeze in. So I know you talked about Greenwood and Dallas in terms of the DCs. Just given that the last 3 years, you've made some key investments, and obviously, you guys have been really doing a terrific job in terms of top line and bottom line. How does that make you think about the older DCs? Like as you're continuing to really drive strong growth now, is now the time to maybe think about retrofitting some of the older DCs that eventually you might have to do just to obviously keep it best in class? So I was just wondering if that's something that you guys internally talk about. Or you're happy at the way things are with the older DCs, and down the road maybe you'll just deal with it? 
Scott Settersten: No. I mean it's part -- the whole supply network is part of our -- we've got a road map built, right, 5 years into the future showing us different things that we're going to address at different points in time. So yes, you're right on, Jason. We're thinking about the rest of the network and those buildings. We'd like to have everyone on one platform, right, best-in-class kind of platform at one point in time. So those decisions are a little bit yet out in front of us, but I would say definitely, that will be a focus of ours over the long term. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Ike Boruchow with Wells Fargo. 
Irwin Boruchow: Scott, just for you, I guess. I'm sorry if I missed this. But on the gross margin, great, very impressive expansion this quarter. Can you just elaborate how much of that was merchandise -- core merchandise margin versus fixed cost leverage? And then the 4% pricing in the quarter, maybe just how do we think about that in terms of product mix and then just higher like-for-like pricing due to the pullback in couponing? 
Scott Settersten: Well, let me take a crack at that. So gross margin overall, we're not going to break down all the basis points, pluses and minuses here, puts and takes, but I could just directionally talk. And I know sometimes people, it may not be clear because this is kind of a multivariable equation that we're solving for here and also when we talk about promotions, right? So there's a couple of major buckets, I guess, I would call them. Merchant discounts, right? So what are we -- what are the offers in the magazines that we distribute or the tabs that we put into newspapers? Is it a 2-for-1? Is it a buy one, get one 50% off? Is there a GWP with it, right? So that's one bucket. Then there's the marketing discount bucket, right, which is the coupon, right? $3.50 off $10, 20% off one item, 20% off the entire order kind of thing, right, with the postcard offer that we described in the past. And then there's the loyalty, right? So that would be the third leg of the stool. So again, we approach this very carefully, right, and we're testing and learning constantly. But if we look at the first quarter, for example, we talked about the mass area, right? So mass has been generating really healthy comps for us. We've kind of learned over the course of the last year that the merchandise discounts don't need to be as broad maybe as what we've done in the past. So this year, we kind of narrowed it down. Instead of 2 -- buy 2, get 1 across the whole brand, maybe it's just a narrower set of SKUs. So that would be one example of something that we executed very well in the first quarter, right? And then there's just another -- a set of other just what I'd call smart merchandising marketing decisions, continuing to tweak our coupon offers and the circulation that we have on our marketing offers, Ulta Beauty collection, private label, super high margin part of our business where they're especially strong in the first quarter this year. E-commerce, we called out again, product mix there is being very helpful to us. So you got a lot of good things happening in the merch margin bucket, I would say. And then you layer on top of that a 15 comp, right? That helps a lot on the fixed store cost line. We called that out in our comments. And then we had some offset, some deleverage on supply chain, which was planned and which was expected. So that's kind of it, I guess, I'd say in a nutshell. On the explanation of the variation year-over-year, when we think about the comp breakout and the ticket bifurcation, units were pretty flat year-over-year, so most of it was on average selling price. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Mark Altschwager with Robert W. Baird. 
Mark Altschwager: Scott, thanks for all that detail on gross margin. I guess I wanted to follow up quickly on SG&A. Spending was up 25% in the quarter, which is presumably more than you initially planned when you built your -- the plan for the quarter and for the year. So I guess can you break out just how much of that was pull-forward and some of the accelerated depreciation you referred to that would potentially allow greater leverage later in the year? And then to the extent you had more dollars to spend, given the top line growth, what are the areas where you've chosen to really intensify investment? 
Scott Settersten: Yes, so we're really trying to stay focused on not breaking out in too much detail kind of the variations. And I know you guys would love to have that. But again, directionally, the store payroll, there is some investment there as we ramp up the boutiques. There was accelerated depreciation in the first quarter. It's going to be heavy again in the second quarter as we look -- compare against last year. I would say that there's some cost of doing business things that are in there. You guys read all these stories about credit card fraud and the whole EMV thing that all of retail is kind of struggling with. So we're not immune to that, right? We had some of that in the first quarter. Now lucky for us, our EMV rollout is complete now. So that -- we've mitigated that risk as we look out across the rest of the year. I would also say that we're -- like we've done in the past, we look to optimize the business, right? So there's some additional investments, I guess, I would call, in the short term around some test-and-learn things around levers, future levers to drive growth, that we think we can move up here and accelerate a little bit into 2016. And again, those aren't huge things, but there's a little bit here and a little bit there. So again, we're doing it in a very disciplined manner, making sure we have the right balance for both the short-term and long-term financial results of the business. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. 
Simeon Gutman: Mary, you mentioned, I think 3%, you said, market share. I don't know if that was including or excluding services. But my question is, do you have a sense of the share of the beauty spend among your best customers? What percent of their wallet are you getting? And then based on what you carry, I know this is a moving target because that will change over time but, based on what the carry, how much of that wallet is attainable? 
Mary Dillon: Well, the 3% number that I mentioned is if you take all of beauty products and services in the U.S. and that's sort of a very macro view of it, which is kind of where we start. And then if you look at, really, just the dollars that are spent even amongst the target that we focus on, the beauty enthusiasts, the beauty enthusiasts on a budget, certainly, is higher. We have 5% of their share of wallet. Of the people that are in a loyalty program, well, clearly, it's higher than that. But I'll tell you what, there's a lot of upside to that as well. We believe, even if you look at our best guess it would be a step back. There are, I don't know, I'm going to make -- 50,000 places you can buy beauty in the U.S., right? So between grocery, mass, drug, department stores, specialty retailers, online, there's a lot of places you could buy beauty. So there's a lot of sources of volume and share gain. That whole idea for us that our guest could be really resonating with this is the more success with us with loyalty program, right, the more benefit she gets by consolidating her spend at ULTA. So we have not had that at ULTA either in terms of the number of relevant -- the addressable market kinds of folks that could be in our loyalty program as well as -- we'll never have 100% of anybody's wallet, I think. That's kind of, in any category, think about grocery, for example, people buy food probably in 2 or 3 or 4 different types of retail outlets. It's probably always going to be a little bit like that with beauty. But we feel good about where it is and there's still a lot of potential for that growth. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Daniel Hofkin with William Blair. 
Daniel Hofkin: Two quick questions, one on the comp, further uptick. Anything you could point to either in terms of brand, marketing, et cetera, that led to the further acceleration in the first quarter? Second question is just on the labor cost outlook with some of -- what's going on in retail broadly and some of the recent legislation or Department of Labor rulings. Any impact on you guys in the next couple of years. 
Mary Dillon: Thank you, Dan. In terms of the drivers, honestly, it really is a combination of a lot of factors. It really -- I guess you can point most directly to the acceleration in the growth of the member file. So with a 25% increase in the members in ULTAmate Rewards program, that clearly we can point to as a major driver. So more guests in the program and guests spending more often, reactivation of guests, better retention. Now that doesn't happen kind of on accident, right? So it's really a combination of, I would say, everything we're doing. I mentioned at the top, I mean, it's great to be in a category that's growing and beauty, we believe, what we have is a very compelling proposition relative to a large segment of the market, right? So what we offer them is relevant. And as we look out into the future, the future consumer, millennials, I think even more so relevant. But then in addition, right, we have to be driving awareness and traffic. So I feel great about what I would call our demand creation tools, so we wouldn't have an increase in the numbers if we didn't have new people aware of and coming to ULTA, and the traffic shows that. And then, in addition, of course, it's about what we sell in the store and the service that we give and the services and the guest experience. So I talked a lot about the merchandise assortment. So I feel good about -- we're really doing business smartly with our brand partners. So I guess, in total, it's a lot of things coming together, I think, effectively for us to drive members into our loyalty program and have a relevant proposition to drive their growth. The second part you asked about was on -- yes, there's a lot obviously happening as it relates to wages and whatnot. In particular, the overtime pay thing that just passed, we are -- we've already factored that into our forecast. There's some attach to us this year, it's pretty immaterial, I would say. Most of our managers are typically paid above the threshold, and some of our comanagers are affected. And as we look out into future years, we'll continue to obviously be cognizant of the factoring wage and other pay factors. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Adrienne Yih with Wolfe Research. 
Adrienne Yih-Tennant: Two quick -- very quick questions. Mary, what is the overall forecast that you're using for beauty and services segment growth? And then, secondarily, as you build or as you do your brand awareness studies, where are you finding -- which demographic do you have the highest brand awareness with? 
Mary Dillon: I would say that we would just look at kind of the current growth factors for the industry that you guys can see as well, which is the industry is up, what, 4%, which is great. And obviously, prestige up more than that, color cosmetics up a lot. So we look at the published forecast or the published data that's out there as well as just do our own kind of work that's both qualitative and quantitative, thinking about future sources of growth. So we don't have a great -- any other crystal ball than anybody else, but we -- we're, I think, pretty darn good at understanding consumer segments, understanding and projecting where their demand might go in the future and use that to try to figure out what we think the category growth will be. Second question was... 
David Kimbell: Awareness. 
Mary Dillon: Awareness. Yes, let me give that one to Dave. 
David Kimbell: Yes. So on brand awareness, overall, we see -- we don't see huge swings by any demographic group. It's really -- it's pretty broad-based, and we're seeing growth across all demographic, all age ranges, ethnicities. But I would say Hispanic women do have a bit higher, in general, across the board, and that's the strength that we're continuing to grow with. 
Adrienne Yih-Tennant: Okay, great. Any quantification of that, please? 
David Kimbell: No. I guess we won't share any of that detail, but -- yes. Yes. Well, we give you our total awareness, and we've shared that in the past. So our total awareness are -- increased 5 points in Q1 versus Q1 of last year to 84% on an aided basis and was up 2 points on an unaided basis to 40%. So continued strong growth of that behind kind of marketing efforts, and we expect to continue to drive that go forward. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Simeon Siegel with Nomura Securities. 
Simeon Siegel: Did you say -- or how many prestige brand boutiques do you currently have? I think, Scott, did you say you expect to open 500 this year? And then can you share any color on the comp lift and maturity curve you tend to see in those stores when added? 
David Kimbell: Yes, we -- I think we've shared this last time. So we started the year with -- we talked about in a couple of hundred range of Clinique and Lancôme. This year, yes, 500, in the approximately 500 new boutiques across Clinique, Lancôme and Benefit, those 3 brands. We will see growth over the year. We're just getting those new ones opened. So while it had some impact on Q1, it was not the big driver of Q1. And frankly, I don't -- it will be a contributor, but there's a lot of other parts of our business that are driving growth, a lot of other brands in prestige space with mass and hair care, skin care so it will continue to drive growth, but we're not counting on that being the primary driver of growth throughout the rest of the year. 
Simeon Siegel: Okay. And then did you say what the Ulta Beauty collection penetration was at this point? I mean do you see that business grow in mix as the overall brand awareness grows? Did you actively look to grow that penetration? Any thoughts there? 
David Kimbell: Yes. Yes. Yes, Mary gave a few of the highlights of some of the things that we're doing to build that. And frankly, I think we are at the beginning of a, really, reinvention of that business, and we're seeing the impact of that already, strong growth. Scott talked about high margins, of all the reasons we'd want to grow them. When we look at all the exclusive Ulta Beauty collection and the exclusive brands combined like -- including brands like IT Brushes for ULTA, it's about 6% of our business. But we -- and we'll see that growing over time. We've got new innovation we'll continue to drive that business behind. And we'll -- as you mentioned, as our brand grows, as our recognition grows and then if we improve its presentation and quality of the product and just overall merchandising strategy, marketing strategy, we'll see that grow as well. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Matthew Fassler with Goldman Sachs. 
Matthew Fassler: A couple of follow-ups. In terms of demographics, you spoke a bit about Hispanic customers. You talked to millennials. If you think about the market share opportunity you have and where you're getting incremental traction, it would be interesting to talk a bit more about age and also new versus existing markets, what cohorts you feel you're uncovering and kind of awakening to the vitality in the comps up to this point as the marketing has exploded here. 
Mary Dillon: Let me just say I think more of this we'll talk about in the fall as we do the Analyst Day because it's -- kind of as we think about the future, that's obviously -- we're sort of in the insights and mulling machine about kind of where the world is going and how to think about those dynamics for ULTA. I'll let Dave maybe add some color, but I will tell you, I think we all feel personally very optimistic about that. That as we think about the way the world -- if we just look at the world today, sort of the influences are really converging nicely as it relates to beauty as a category as well as shopping in the way that we offer to be able to come in with a point of view and be -- already have a curated idea in mind but to get some help as well. So maybe you can add a little more to that. But more on this topic later, I'd say, is the best way to think about it. 
David Kimbell: Yes. The only thing I'd say is our growth -- we're excited to see in our growth, as I mentioned earlier, it isn't concentrated on any specific age range, demographic profile. It's really is this beauty enthusiast, and she's all ages. She lives all across the country. And so we're seeing strength with teenagers. There's been reports out from other third parties about ULTA continuing to gain a strength and presence with teenagers, certainly millennials, but through -- all the way through ages and, for instance [ph] a great part of beauty is it's not age-dependent. Needs might change, but their desire to be a part of a beauty category continues. So we're seeing that across the board right now. 
Matthew Fassler: My second follow-up, so it sounds like the boutiques, while they're rolling in, are only about -- or only starting to really impact the business. As you think about your historical experience and the kind of pop that, that can give the business relative to the double-digit same-store sales you've been posting, without that catalyst, is the input or the additional volume from those boutiques material in that context? Or is this something that should just be sort of absorbed by the strong growth that you've got these days? 
Scott Settersten: Yes. I think, in the short term, it's absorbed. So again, back to Dave's earlier point here, it's going to be additive. It takes a while for those boutiques to ramp up much -- similar to our store maturation curve overall. We've seen that demonstrated over a long period of time. So again, over the longer term, yes. We think it's a significant add to the box overall and will help productivity significantly over the long term. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Oliver Chen with Cowen and Company. 
Courtney Willson: This is Courtney Wilson in for Oliver tonight. We just had a question in terms of the consumer dynamics of the mass consumer versus the prestige consumer. Which segment is experiencing higher rates of new customer acquisition? And is there an increasing amount of cross-shopping between the 2 customer segments? 
Mary Dillon: Thank you, Courtney. Yes, you know what, the great thing is there's not really a separate mass versus prestige consumer at our store, which is kind of cool. Our guests, there's just been a tendency to come in. I think we've talked about this right, on maybe more the mass side than prestige and then migrate over time. Typically, our guest has a mixture though. There's really very few people that I think are just completely one versus another type category. And that's part of the beauty of what we offer that makes it super relevant for our guests and I think as well for our brand partners. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Rupesh Parikh with Oppenheimer. 
Rupesh Parikh: So 2 quick questions. First, are you guys seeing any significant differences between the performance or traffic at your mall locations versus non-mall locations? And then, second, on new products, clearly, from your Q1 remarks, it sounds like there's a significant amount of newness and innovation in Q1. As we look out for the balance of the year, what can we expect in terms of brand and product additions? 
Mary Dillon: Okay. So we'll tag team this again, Dave. I'll start on the mall piece. Malls are about, what, 10% or so of our store base, and we're not really -- we're not seeing much of a difference. We're seeing positive traffic. I would say when we're in malls, we pick those spots pretty carefully, both in terms of the market, it being a great place to shop in a given market, as well as our locations tend to be on the exterior of the mall, so we feel good about how they're performing. 
David Kimbell: Yes. On new brands, not -- nothing to report specifically here. But I will say, as has been our trend of late, we'll continue to add new brands. But I'd say, while that is a big contributor, we're also, I mentioned this earlier, we're really focused on driving growth with our existing brands. We have a lot of new products coming in and growth with existing products within our portfolio across many of the brands that Mary mentioned in her remarks. And so it will be a mix, continue to drive with the strength of our big brands like Urban Decay and Redken, and Bare and Too Faced and NYX. But then, we'll certainly complement that with new brands throughout the year. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Steph Wissink with Piper Jaffray. 
Stephanie Wissink: I just have one question on the brand boutiques. I wonder if you can give us a little bit more information on the return on invested capital or some of the productivity goals that you have within that floor space? And just given the $80 million investment, I think, that you talked about so far, can you talk to us about what the brands are committing to, whether it's capital or exclusive product or marketing? 
Scott Settersten: Yes, let me start there. So as far as the $80 million is concerned, I mean, that's all on ULTA, right? So we're stepping up with the CapEx investment. And again, that $80 million, partly it's not just a boutique drop-in, right? So again, there's 500 -- roughly 500 individual boutique drop-ins across the chain. But we're going to take the opportunity while we're in the stores to also refresh our fragrance fixtures in those stores and Ulta Beauty collection fixturing as well, as well as other miscellaneous things, right? You’re in the store, touching it up and causing some chaos. You're going to take the opportunity to do what you think is best for the guest long term. So that's how we're deploying the $80 million. Again, each vendor, we have a different set of economic terms with them. So I think by and large, it's kind of a -- it's a payroll share kind of model, right? So again, they're trained. There are associates, they're on our payroll. The vendors provide -- our vendor partners provide excellent training for them. We kind of share the payroll model on a go-forward basis. And it takes a while. Again, we install the boutiques upfront. It takes a while for those to reach maturity, right? So again, as we go over time, we add more payroll resources there to make them more productive. So I think that's it in a nutshell. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Michael Baker with Deutsche Bank. 
Michael Baker: So I just want to ask about the loyalty card increased membership. Is a lot of that -- or is there any way to break down how much of that is coming from people who already were shopping in your store but weren't loyalty cards, and now you're sort of upgrading them to loyalty members? Or versus what percent is coming from customers who are new to the brand, and they're coming in and then they're signing up? 
David Kimbell: What we've shared, I think a couple of quarters ago, that we've seen an increase in, I guess, what we call, reactivation, which were lapsed customers. And so we've seen a healthy increase of that. Probably, we won't get into sharing that every quarter, but that is part of it. So customers that might have shopped with us 2 years ago would not be considered a current customer, but we have a record of them. They come back in. They reactivate their account, and they would move into our active -- would move back into our active member profile. So that's a chunk of it. But the biggest part of it is new-to-ULTA customers. And that is exactly, as you described, customers coming in and shopping at ULTA and starting that experience not a customer, and when they get up and interact with one of our associates, they become a customer during their visit there. And a key part of our success has been our store associates really doing an excellent job converting nonmembers into members in the store, and we've seen a strong increase in that. So that's -- that is the primary driver of our new member growth. 
Michael Baker: Okay, great. That's helpful. While I have you, one more, maybe a more mundane question. But we've heard from a couple of other retailers that the real estate opportunities are very strong out there, much -- very much a buyer's market. Can you talk about what you're seeing in some of your new stores in terms of rents and those types of metrics? 
Scott Settersten: I guess we could echo those comments that you've heard from others. We have -- there's no shortage of great real estate sites that we're seeing as we look at proposals across the country. Again, our stores, we have a typical, I guess, best-in-class kind of set of co-tenants that we would like to operate with. But we've proven and demonstrated over time, ULTA stores work in a wide variety of real estate locations and types. So we feel very confident about our current pace of 100 stores a year, right, that we talked about here as our medium-term target. We just came back, I guess, from ICSC here in the last day or so. And again, we -- the landlords, the relationships that we have are very strong. We know ULTA's being sought out as a tenant of choice, we're proven traffic drivers to centers. And the beauty category is something that many landlords -- that's a piece of the offering, retail offering, that they'd love to add to the mix overall. 
Michael Baker: So I guess the punchline there, is that materially changing your new store economic model? And is that something that you would address at your Analyst Day in the fall? 
Scott Settersten: Yes. I mean, I don't -- we haven't -- we're always very competitive when we get into the rent structures and the economic terms of our deals. I mean I think Ulta is probably best-in-class when you look at our operating model overall. So it's not like we're seeing some big step decreases in rent terms or anything like that, at least not at this stage. A lot of these liquidation events are kind of in process, I guess, I would say right now. So I guess that's yet to be seen. And we don't -- it's not causing us to rethink the number of stores that we open every year, right? 100 a year, again, there's no magic in our method, that's kind of been a comfortable pace for us with the number of new associates we need to add to the mix overall and the time of year that those stores usually get open. All in, when you think about that, 100 is kind of a good pace. 
Operator: Our final question comes from Omar Saad with Evercore ISI. 
Omar Saad: Was wondering if you could elaborate a little bit on the comment you made earlier around urban stores and doing some more thought process around that. If you have anything in the fleet now that resembles kind of an urban location, and how it does and how those locations may do in more densely populated urban-type areas? It seems like it could be a great fit. Obviously, real estate costs are a bit different, but would love to hear more about it. 
Mary Dillon: Yes. No problem, Omar. I guess what I would say is that, yes, we have several urban, I guess, you'd call them, stores in the fleet. And they do fine. As we're thinking about the future, I wouldn't say we've ever had a concerted urban strategy, right? So we don't have a lot of them. Our main strategy has been really in suburbs and in power centers, in lifestyle centers. We've talked about -- we feel good about the 10,000 square foot store format and the ability to hit at least 1,200 at least of that format. But what I referenced at, we're also looking at what's the opportunity in smaller markets and then also what's the opportunity in places where the parcels of real estate would, by definition, be smaller, so whether it's urban centers or the downtown maybe shopping area of high-end suburbs, right? So all I -- we've got 2/3 with 2 5,000-square-foot stores right now that we're operating to learn about the dynamics of a different sized box. And they're doing well, they're also learning a lot about the best way to operate that. And as we look at refreshing our view of store growth, urban is a question we're asking ourselves and would look at. As you said, obviously, the economics are different. But as we drive brand awareness across the country with our marketing efforts, we know that we've -- wherever we go now, people know more about us than, I guess, they would have been in the past, right? So that's a good way, a place to start. So more to come on that. 
Omar Saad: That's helpful. And then can I ask one follow-up on the loyalty? Have you thought about ever partnering with a financial services firm and maybe adding a private label credit element to that? Or are you happy as a stand-alone loyalty program? 
Mary Dillon: Well, we're very happy with our loyalty program today. It's really a key asset for us. And so that's a fair question. I mean, that's something that could be a good asset in the long run, right? Nothing to announce on that certainly, but it’s certainly something that has a history in retail that's been successful for many retailers, no doubt. 
Operator: I'd now like to turn the call back over to management for closing remarks. 
Mary Dillon: Thank you. I'd just like to close by thanking our 26,000 associates for an incredible start to the year, and I look forward to speaking with all of you again soon. Thank you. 
Operator: This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.

===== 2015 Q4  (2016-03-10 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Greetings and welcome to the ULTA Beauty Fourth Quarter 2015 Earnings Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Ms. Laurel Lefebvre. Thank you, Laurel. You may begin. 
Laurel Lefebvre: Thank you. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us for ULTA Beauty's Fourth Quarter 2015 Conference Call. Hosting our call are Mary Dillon, Chief Executive Officer; and Scott Settersten, Chief Financial Officer. Also joining us is Dave Kimbell, Chief Merchandising and Marketing Officer. 
 Before we begin, I'd like to remind you of the company's safe harbor language. The statements contained in this conference call which are not historical fact may be deemed to constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual future results may differ materially from those projected in such statements due to a number of risks and uncertainties, all of which are described in the company's filings with the SEC. We may make references during this call to the metric free cash flow, a non-GAAP financial measure defined as cash provided by operating activities minus purchases of property and equipment. [Operator Instructions] I'll now turn it over to Mary. 
Mary Dillon: Thanks, Laurel. Good afternoon and we have a lot to share with everyone today. Our fourth quarter results capped an exceptional year. We made significant progress against our strategic imperatives while achieving outstanding sales and earnings growth. We continue to benefit from the powerful combination of strong demand in the beauty category and ULTA Beauty's highly differentiated product and service offering. This unique positioning is driving business results that transcend prevailing trends across the retail landscape. 
 To review the fourth quarter highlights, we grew the top line 21.1% and delivered 12.5% comps on top of 11.1% comps in the fourth quarter of 2014, which was our toughest comp of the year. Comp sales were driven primarily by traffic, yet ticket increased nicely as well. The fourth quarter delivered the best 2-year comp since 2011, with a 23.6% 2-year stack. 
 Product newness, our loyalty program, great in-store execution and investments in marketing and store payroll hours are fueling this industry-leading growth across both retail and online, with the fastest category growth in cosmetics on both mass and prestige sides of the portfolio. E-commerce top line growth and profitability were better than planned, driven by improved fulfillment capabilities and execution during the holiday season. And our salon business maintained its solid top line performance. 
 For the full year of 2015, we achieved an 11.8% comp, our best annual comp since 2010, with double-digit comps in each of the 3 businesses: store, salon and e-commerce. Sales strength was driven primarily by traffic each quarter during the year and the full year comp was comprised of a very healthy mix of 70% transaction growth and 30% ticket growth. 
 Before updating you on the drivers of our fourth quarter results, I'd like to take a few of the team's accomplishments throughout fiscal 2015. We drove top line growth of 21.1% and earnings increased 25.2%, well above our expectations at the beginning of the year, reflecting robust market share gains and strong execution. We brought significant newness and exclusivity to the merchandise assortment and added 26 significant new brands during the year, demonstrating increased traction with our brand partners. 
 We accelerated growth in our ULTAmate Rewards loyalty program membership, adding 3.2 million members, to reach a total of 18.2 million active members by year-end. We meaningfully increased brand awareness through our investments in television, radio, digital advertising and PR. We achieved strong and increased guest satisfaction scores as measured by MPS. We improved our supply chain operations in a few ways. We invested in better processes and inventories to increase in-stock levels, we drove efficiencies in our e-commerce fulfillment performance and smoothly launched the Greenwood distribution center. 
 We also delivered against complex IT goals with the implementation of a host of new tools across the enterprise: a new warehouse management system, our new merchandise forecasting and replenishment system and a new product information tool, among others. 
 So for the past several quarters we've been describing to the investment community our progress against our 6 go-to-market strategic imperatives. But we rarely discuss externally our foundational seventh strategic imperative, which is talent that drives a winning culture: guest-centric, values based, high performance. I believe that the results we've just reported are the reflection of our attractive category, balanced strategies, great execution and also the progress we've made in building our company's culture. 
 I am so proud to see proof that our commitments of putting the guest and the associate at the center of our mindset is truly delivering marketplace results. We're respecting the opinions of those who matter the most, the guests who give us their hard-earned money and the associates, who really knows best how to optimize the guest experience and our operations. 
 We're also leading through the lenses of functional expertise, enterprise-wide thinking and collaboration, which is required more than ever in this fast-chasing world of guest expectations. We now have evidence that these efforts are having an impact, not just in business results, but also in our culture. In fact, we saw significant year-over-year increases in the level of engagement of our associates as measured by a third party through our Annual Cultural Survey. We are gratified to achieve global top quartile employee engagement scores among best-in-class companies. Highly engaged employees are tightly correlated with high-performing companies. 
 So now let's turn back to our fourth quarter results. In an effort to allow more time for Q&A, instead of going through each of our strategic imperatives, I'll call out some of the highlights driving our performance. 
 Our loyalty program is truly one of our most valuable assets. Active membership grew 23%, showing continued acceleration. The growth in our loyalty program has been driven by 2 major things. The successful evolution of our marketing strategies to include awareness-driving tactics like television, radio and digital is driving brand awareness and new guests to our stores. In addition, our store associates have done a terrific job of making new guests aware of the ULTAmate Rewards program and then converting them in. At the beginning of 2015, active member year-over-year growth was a bit less than 17%. And that growth rate increased each month throughout the year. We're seeing excellent trends in retention rates, sales per member, frequency of purchase and average ticket. Reactivation of loyalty members who hadn't shopped in the past 12 months remains robust as well, another indicator of the benefits of the changes in our marketing model. 
 As we discussed at our Analyst Day in 2014, we're conducting ongoing marketing mix analyses using a customized modeling tool that correlates sales results to end market actions at the store and category level. This work clearly demonstrates that we've successfully and profitably delivered on the promise of getting to a healthier mix of marketing strategies and tactics. We're dedicating more resources to personalize offers through our loyalty program and newer tactics, including television, radio, expanded digital and PR. These marketing campaigns are designed to position ULTA Beauty in a meaningful and differentiated way, with every piece of communication reinforcing our brand personality and elevating our beauty authority. 
 This reallocation of resources increases the impact of marketing and we believe is one of several factors fueling the strength in our comp sales. While we are reducing our spend on less productive tactics, to be clear, we will always make sure that our guests see ULTA Beauty as providing a great value, and periodic promotions, loyalty offers, newness, and great experiences in-store and online are all part of that value equation. 
 These changes to our marketing strategy are also driving meaningful improvements in our brand awareness. Our latest survey showed that aided awareness rose to 84% versus 77% a year ago and unaided brand awareness improved to 39% from 36%. We believe this increase in awareness was driven in part by our national advertising campaigns. Stronger awareness of ULTA Beauty is helping us acquire new guests and reactivating guests who hadn't shopped recently. 
 Now in terms of merchandising, we continue to gain share in all categories, with particular strength in mass and prestige cosmetics. Urban Decay, IT Cosmetics, NYX, Redken, Too Faced, Tarte, Clinique, Lancôme, Benefit and the ULTA Beauty Collection were among the best performing brands for the quarter. 
 We launched several new brands in our skin care area, including Julep and First Aid Beauty. The pipeline of new brands for 2016 includes exclusive brands like Jessica Alba's Honest Beauty and Fiona Stiles Cosmetics as well as the introduction of Buxom Color Cosmetics and the expansion of Clarins skincare and cosmetics. We continue to focus on products that are only available at ULTA Beauty, with the addition of many exclusive products within existing brands, including a new line of color cosmetics from Tarte called Double Duty Beauty. We're very excited to work with our brand partners to accelerate the rollout of Clinique, Lancôme and Benefit boutiques in hundreds of stores this year that will make us even more of a beauty destination. 
 Our brand partners are finding increasing value in working with our CRM platform. The number of brands participating in targeted CRM campaigns rose meaningfully last year. We partnered with them to increase the number of targeted e-mail and direct mail campaigns and to develop exclusive offers for platinum members. All of these efforts drove incremental sales and margin dollars. 
 Our brand partners also love working with our data analytics team to drive trial of various products and categories. We continue to put product samples in the hands of our guests in several smart ways and we tripled the number of samples obtained from our brand partners during 2015. We're executing our sampling programs through online Beauty Bags and targeted samples to surprise and delight our guests at point-of-sale in store. We also have sample box programs in fragrance, professional hair care, prestige skincare and mass hair care that have proven to be extremely popular. And we doubled our sales of these multi-brand sample boxes during 2015. 
 For example, our sample box called Secrets to Gorgeous Skin, offered during a recent skin event, was a big hit and we plan to offer many more of these sample boxes in 2016. 
 Turning to services. The salon business comped 9.2% with continued strength in cut and color. Blowouts, hair treatments and makeup services were the highest growth categories. We're delivering trend-right training to our salon professionals and continue to integrate hair and makeup in our offerings. Our hand-picked artistic team works to develop haircut, color and finishing techniques that are reflective of the season that then creates and delivers high-impact training programs for all the salon teams in our stores. The trends created by our team translate hair and makeup looks straight from the runway in partnership with our brand. 
 We recently launched spring and summer trends, including 9 different hair and makeup looks such as festival style hair and pearlescent glow makeup. The Benefit Brow Bar continues its excellent performance with double-digit comp sales and a continued expansion of brow services now in 712 stores. 
 To report on store growth, we opened 14 stores in the fourth quarter to complete our 2015 program of 100 net new stores, ending with 874. New store productivity continues to be very strong, reflecting our growing brand awareness, dedicated resources to grand opening activities, ongoing improvements to our portfolio of brands and high-quality real estate. We are increasingly a tenant of choice as landlords appreciate our growth profile, our ability to drive traffic to shopping centers and willingness of other retailers to follow in our footsteps to participate in the healthy traffic we draw. Landlords also appreciate the quality of our store design and the way our differentiated offering enhances the mix of retailers in their shopping centers. 
 We also continue to enhance the store portfolio through improvements to our new store format, as well as investments to elevate existing stores. For the 2016 class of stores, we'll be implementing a series of enhancements to our store format that elevates both mass and prestige categories, give us a flexibility to respond to our growing access to brands, improve the signage and presentation of our ULTA Beauty Collection and upgrade fixtures in key categories such as fragrance. 
 New stores will also put the excitement of our services offering more in the forefront by placing the Benefit Brow Bar front and center. We'll also fully remodel about a dozen stores this year and touch hundreds of stores in the fleet with prestige boutiques and remodeled fixtures in key categories. 
 To update you on our e-commerce business. Top line growth of 44.2% contributed 210 basis points to our total company comp. Significant improvements in fulfillment speed and customer satisfaction during holiday resulted in stronger-than-expected sales and much better profitability compared to a year ago. We added Clinique to the ulta.com assortment during the fourth quarter. So at this point, e-commerce is virtually at parity with brick-and-mortar in terms of our breadth of assortment. 
 We continued to launch some new brands online to test before rolling out to the stores and offer some brands online only, such as an expanded assortment of men's products. 
 Moving on to supply chain. We are clearly seeing the benefits of cross-functional collaboration and joint planning among our supply chain, e-commerce and IT teams as well as store operations. Our focus on continuous improvement in simplifying processes led to efficiencies across our network of 4 distribution centers. During holiday we achieved record network e-commerce throughput of 55,000 orders in 1 day, almost double our maximum volume last year. 
 Shipping lead times improved dramatically with the percentage of orders shipped in 3 days or less at 92% versus just 14% last year, significantly increasing guest satisfaction. In-stock levels improved despite achieving sales well over our holiday sales forecast. 
 The Greenwood DC successfully ramped up to serve 125 stores through the holiday season and delivered 25,000 orders per day during peak holiday. We remain very pleased with how the new DC is performing. We continue ramping up -- continue to ramp up and serve another 100-plus stores in Greenwood by the end of this year. The new Dallas DC is on track to open this summer and we continue to roll out new systems like SWIFT, our merchandise forecasting and replenishment tool, and we're also investing in space and assortment planning tools this year. 
 Now let me turn over to Scott to discuss the key drivers of our fourth quarter financial performance and our outlook for the first quarter and full year of 2016. 
Scott Settersten: Thanks, Mary. Good afternoon everyone. I'll start with the income statement. Top line growth was driven by a 12.5% comp and a very strong new store productivity. The marketing mix analysis that Mary mentioned showed that we were able to achieve this comp through a healthier mix of business drivers, including new brand launches and new products; more effective marketing, including TV, radio and digital; more efficient in-store labor; and continued benefits from new store maturation. Increased sales of gift cards helped drive top line strength post holiday. 
 During the fourth quarter our comp continued to be a bit more weighted to transaction growth, with traffic about 70% of the comp and average ticket representing about 30%. The retail only, the 10.4% comp, was composed of about 75% transaction growth and 25% ticket growth. Units per transaction were flat but average basket rose 3% to just over $43. E-commerce growth was driven roughly 75% by traffic and 25% by ticket. 
 Now let's talk about the key drivers of the 120 basis points of gross profit improvement, which was quite a bit better than our initial plan. The increase was partly driven by higher merchandise margins due to mix as we delivered strong sales in many of our better margin categories and brands, including the ULTA Beauty Collection. We also successfully continued our shift away from broad coupons and discounts and toward more targeted and relevant offers to our guests, supported by our loyalty program and CRM. In fact, we completely eliminated one of our usual discount offers at the end of the quarter, which helped our margin rate. We leveraged store rent and occupancy expenses modestly on a double-digit comp. And while our supply chain investments were still a drag on margins, they were less so than in the third quarter, when we first opened the Greenwood, Indiana DC. 
 E-commerce fulfillment costs were also much more favorable this year. You probably recall that during the holiday season of 2014 we were challenged with fulfilling orders during the spike in demand between Black Friday and Cyber Monday. And the higher-than-expected e-commerce fulfillment cost for holiday 2014 weighed on gross profit a year ago, creating an easier margin comparison in the fourth quarter. The team did a much better job getting orders to customers in a timely fashion during the 2015 holiday season. 
 In addition to the successful launch of the Greenwood DC, which provided additional capacity, we also increased the efficiency of our other distribution centers with process improvements throughout the year. The e-commerce marketing team did a nice job smoothing out consumer demand during the holiday season, with promotional events planned before and after the Black Friday period, culminating in a much improved guest experience and significant profit improvement. The product mix for e-commerce continues to help as well as we ramp up sales of high-margin haircare products, which were added to the site last February. 
 Moving on to SG&A expense. Deleverage of 100 basis points was driven primarily by planned investments in marketing and store payroll hours to support holiday season sales. While marketing expense was flat for the year, it was back half weighted with the introduction of new vehicles to drive brand awareness including the national TV and radio campaigns. We also invested in store labor hours and training to improve the guest experience, especially during the key selling weeks during the holiday. Corporate overhead also deleveraged slightly due to higher incentive compensation in concert with our better-than-expected earnings performance. 
 In terms of the balance sheet, inventories were up 16.1% on a per-store basis, driven by investments in inventory to keep up with much-better-than-expected topline growth, several new brand additions and the continued expansion of Clinique and Lancôme boutiques. The team did a great job selling through holiday inventory and making sure we start the new year with very clean inventory across all categories. 
 While we generally strive to keep inventory per door growth in line with comp growth, we had compelling business reasons to modestly exceed that benchmark and are very happy with the quality of our inventory and the resulting sales growth. With the large number of prestige brand boutiques and new brands being added in 2016, we expect inventory per door growth to remain somewhat elevated for the rest of the year, although at a slightly lower level than Q4. 
 Capital expenditures were $67 million for the quarter, driven by 14 new store openings, investments in systems, store fixtures and supply chain. CapEx for the full year was $299 million. We ended the year with $476 million of cash and short-term investments. The company repurchased approximately 262,000 shares at a cost of $46 million during the fourth quarter under our 10b5-1 plan. For the full year, we repurchased just over 1 million shares for $167 million. This reduction in our shares outstanding delivered about $0.03 of earnings per share growth for fiscal 2015. 
 Today we announced our 2016 guidance. In light of our accelerated share repurchase plan and continued momentum in our comparable sales growth, our anticipated earnings per share growth rate is higher than what we expected when we discussed our 5-year plan back in the fall of 2014. We plan to add 100 net new stores with all stores in the program in our traditional prototypical store size. We expect to open 11 stores in Q1, 21 in Q2, 44 in Q3 and 24 in Q4. We plan to complete 12 major store remodels and 2 relocations. We expect to grow e-commerce about 40%. Total company comps are expected to be in the 8% to 10% range. We anticipate earnings per share growth of approximately 18% to 20%. Operating margins are expected to be flattish, similar to what we achieved in 2015. Gross profit margin will be pressured by our new Dallas DC coming online this summer, continued investments in core merchandising systems and depreciation and write-offs related to our accelerated boutique rollout and store refresh program. 
 CapEx has been planned higher than our previous view, which was in the $300 million range. We now anticipate CapEx of about $390 million. This includes slightly higher CapEx per new store, with the latest enhancements that Mary mentioned, as well as a significant step up in boutiques in our new store program. We have also added about $80 million to the capital plan to refresh hundreds of our existing stores, which will include a major expansion of Clinique, Lancôme and Benefit boutiques as well as a significant presentation upgrade for fragrance and the ULTA Beauty Collection. We believe these prestige boutiques drive increased productivity in our stores and improve our positioning as a beauty destination.  We are delighted that our brand partners want to grow even faster with us. 
 In terms of share buybacks, our Board of Directors has authorized a new share repurchase program for $425 million, which replaces the previous program. As you saw in the press release, we announced an ASR for $200 million and expect to continue our open market repurchases similar to what we did in 2015. 
 Turning now to guidance for the first quarter. We anticipate sales to be in the range of $1.016 billion to $1.033 billion compared to $868 million last year. We expect comparable sales to increase in the range of 9% to 11% versus 11.4% last year. Online sales growth is expected to be in the 40% range. Preopening expense for the quarter is expected to be about $2.5 million. Earnings per share are expected to be in the range of $1.25 to $1.30 versus $1.04 for Q1 of last year. We anticipate a tax rate of 37.8% and fully diluted share count of approximately 64 million. 
 I'll now turn the call over to our conference call host for the Q&A session. Operator? 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of David Schick with Stifel. 
David Schick: It's David Schick. Just a quick question or a basic question on salon and then a quick question on gross margin. On salon, you're lapping those incremental salon booking capabilities already and then -- but the business is continuing to grow quite nicely. Can you talk about how you're able to grow that rapidly despite that lap? And then separately, any color on how much private label is benefiting gross margin would be helpful. 
Mary Dillon: Sure. I'll start on the salon question, Dave, thank you. I've -- the salon business right now is -- we're pleased with the growth. But it's interesting. Only -- it's really under 7% of our loyalty members are currently using the salon services. So there's no reason for us to think that we can't just continue to grow that nicely by getting -- driving more awareness of salon and more trial. So the online booking tool is certainly one step in that direction, which is great. But we anticipate that, as we think about how we can continue to drive awareness in trial and rebooking in our salons, that we'll be able to continue to grow that for years to come. As I mentioned in the script, we've got plenty of excellent offerings for our guests, whether it's new trends right off the runway on cut and color, even things that people can try just for the first time like a blowout or a makeup service. So there's plenty of growth that we believe we can drive ahead there. 
 In terms of the private label margin... 
Scott Settersten: Yes, let me jump in there, Dave. So we don't break out specific categories or rate contributions by line. But obviously private label is a very high margin category for us. It's something that's key to the mix overall to ULTA and something that we use, right, we use strategically to help drive the business overall, both on the top and bottom lines. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Kelly Halsor with Buckingham Research. 
Kelly Halsor: I just -- I guess, given the momentum that you're seeing in the business here, how do we -- how should we think about some of the metrics that are implied in your longer-term targets? Does this give the potential, given the strength of the categories across the board, any thoughts on the potential upside to margins, et cetera, from here? 
Mary Dillon: Thank you, Kelly. Yes, first of all, we're thrilled with the results and the momentum in the business today for sure and excited about that as we move forward. I would say this: We're very confident and we remain confident in the mid-teen operating margin target that we put out for our long-term guidance. And that's going to be a combination of growing top line, driving efficiencies while still investing for the long-term health of the business. Having said that, there's also plenty of questions ahead as it relates to guest expectations in a changing retail environment. So we want to retain some flexibility to continue to think about innovation in that area. So we'll continually be refreshing our 5-year view. At this point we don't have any reason to think we'll change our 5-year financial guidance, though. 
Kelly Halsor: Okay, great. So just if I could squeeze in 1 more here. Could you just give any color... 
Mary Dillon: Nice job, Kelly. Squeeze in a second question. 
Kelly Halsor: It will be quick. Just in terms of the categories, I mean, was the growth still largely driven by the strength of cosmetics? Are we seeing any strength in categories... 
Mary Dillon: Yes, let me turn this one to Dave. 
David Kimbell: Yes, Kelly, we -- Mary mentioned in the script that cosmetics has certainly been very strong for us, both in prestige and the mass side. But we're really excited that we're seeing growth across really the whole store. The thing that makes us different is the unique combination of assortment; All Things Beauty, All in One Place. And we're seeing growth in hair for sure. It's a huge foundational element for us. So all aspects of hair, fragrance, skincare, accessories. So we're getting growth in all categories. But it is being led by cosmetics at this time. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Omar Saad with Evercore ISI. 
Omar Saad: I was really intrigued by the 10% to 12% comp guidance for 2016. I can't remember you guys giving comp guidance so high. And I'd love to hear maybe what are some of the factors that give you confidence this early in the year? And obviously the current trends are very strong. But what's causing kind of the sea change in your confidence to be able to deliver that level of comp, especially in a retail environment where there's so little traffic out there? Is it the loyalty? Is it the new marketing campaigns? Is it something you're seeing in the store aging, the way older and new stores are behaving? Would love any more details there. 
Mary Dillon: Well, Omar, first I'll say you're on the right track and that it's a lot of things. Let me tell you this. We're very excited about our comps, but we guided 8% to 10% for the year, just to be clear, okay? So that's what we just communicated. The -- but stepping back, we're pleased with that. I would say that as we're coming into this year, I guess what I would say is at the highest level this is a business model that's working and we're executing it really well. And so we feel confident about the momentum and that continuing. It's a combination of a lot of factors coming together. 
 So if you'll indulge me, let me just spend a minute on this, which is, first of all, it's great that we're in a great category that is a growing category, right? And so that's important to start with. And there's expandable consumption of beauty products. So these are everyday use, sometimes multiple times a day, driven by innovation. There's plenty of innovation. So we're in a growing business. We at ULTA Beauty have a really, I think, very clear beat on who our target guest is and how to position ourselves against this guest. So this beauty enthusiast is a large and growing segment. Dave just mentioned that we are positioned as All Things Beauty, All in One Place, which is differentiated and relevant to that segment. We have exceptional brand partnership. So it's about knowing who we're trying to target but also offering her what she wants. So exciting products, new and exclusive, and really working with our brand partners to continue to have the great assortment across category price point and services. 
 I'd also add that smarter use of demand creation tools. So our loyalty program is really the heart. I talked about that. We've got long-term awareness and equity building tools moving in the right direction. The role of e-com and digital improved, especially at the guest service side of that as well. So the demand creation tools are working well. 
 And then I'd say just exceptional collaboration in our -- with our teams and executing against complex things. So it's about making sure that the in-store experience is exceptional, and that takes a lot, whether its payroll hours or investing in in-stocks. The distribution side of it, the focus on our Greenwood distribution center, the IT systems that support it. And real estate is a core competency for us. And we're quite good at selecting store locations, building them out, remodeling. And store productivity is even stronger than we expected it to be. 
 So I would say that truly is a notion of kind of a great market opportunity coming together and being executed well. 
 And last thing I'd say is that we also are less subject to some other factors that some other retailers are. So whether it's weather, maybe weak mall traffic or fashion hits or misses, a few other things, we're less subject to that. 
 So you put all that together, it helps us feel very confident that we can transcend what seems to be overall retail trends and deliver the kind of comps that we just guided you to. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Steph Wissink with Piper Jaffray. 
Stephanie Wissink: Mary, just an observation. It seems like you've moved from a position of you desiring bigger and better brands to bigger and better brands desiring you. So I'm wondering if you can talk a little bit about the 26 brands you added in 2015. How important were those to the comp? And also, what are the plans for 2016 in terms of new brand additions? I think you mentioned several hundred boutique [indiscernible], if you could give us a little more color on a specific number. And then any investments you're making in merchandising? 
Mary Dillon: Steph, thank you for the question. And I'd like to start off with Dave because he and his team are really the experts at all of this -- all of these things. Go ahead, Dave. 
David Kimbell: Yes, that's great. First I'll start with new brands. That has been something that we had been focused on for a long time. We've added well over 100 new brands over the last 5 years. And as you said and as Mary mentioned, we had 26 new brands in 2015 alone, and that included brands -- we brought Dior late in the year, Skyn Iceland, Soap & Glory, First Aid Beauty, Revolution Makeup, Pacifica, TonyMoly, several others that were key across all categories and all different mass and prestige and hair. And so we brought growth. And we're really excited to be continuing to partner with our brands to leverage growth. And we feel like we've got a great relationship that has been in -- that has been building and strengthening for many years and we're excited about our ability to do that. 
 We've got -- Mary mentioned a couple, but as we look forward into 2016, we're as excited for the upcoming year as we were in our results in 2015. We've got some great brands already that have already come out in the Spring Trend magazine that you may have seen that came out. We featured over 2,000 new items across new brands and existing brands just in that magazine alone. Some key new brands that we're offering, Honest Beauty just launched. Mary mentioned that, Jessica Alba's brand that is exclusive with us. Fiona Stiles, also exclusive with us. Fiona is a well-known makeup artist and we're proud to be working with her. 
 Our existing brands continue to bring newness and excitement to us. Mary mentioned Tarte with their Double Duty Beauty. And we're finding growth across all of our key brands, both big and small, continuing to expand and roll out brands that we launched last year: BECCA and Clarins, Clinique and Lancôme, which I'll touch on in just a second. And then all of our big brands, our big partners across every part of our store are great partners in finding new ways to grow and we're excited to be working with them and brands like Bare and Too Faced and Philosophy and Urban Decay and Benefit and Chi and Redken and Matrix. The list goes on. NYX and L'Oreal. So we're excited to be working with our brand partners and we think we've got a rich pipeline to come. 
 On boutiques specifically, we did mention that we're continuing to expand. I'd say boutiques are an important part of our growth plan. It should be evident by this, they're not the only part of our growth plan, but we're really excited to be continuing to work. We have 4 main boutique brands. Bare has been our largest boutique brand and they're essentially in every store. We're continuing to roll out Benefit. We have -- they were in roughly 700 stores at the end of last year. And then over the last several years we've been partnering and expanding our relationship with Clinique and Lancôme. Each of them ended up with roughly 200 stores at the end of the year. In total, across the ones that we're continuing to expand into existing doors and new doors, Benefit, Clinique and Lancôme, we'll be adding over 500 boutiques across those 3 brands in 2016. So we're excited about all the brand innovation and brand expansion that will be coming this year. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Dana Telsey with Telsey Advisory Group. 
 Our next question comes from Adrienne Yih with Wolfe Research. 
Adrienne Yih-Tennant: I was wondering if you can talk about the penetration in 2015 of the e-com business and your private label and then your exclusives. Seems like there's a lot of growth opportunity in those 3 areas. So if you could give us more color on that, that would be great. 
David Kimbell: Yes. Private label in total, when we look at total private label we include our ULTA Beauty Collection and then some exclusive co-brands like our IT Brushes with ULTA, and those represent approximately 6% of our sales in 2015. Our e-commerce penetration ended about 6% as well for 2015. So those are -- and they both have been growing. We're continuing to expand. As the rest of our business grows, on a penetration basis there, we're seeing incremental growth in each of those areas as well. And was there a third? 
Adrienne Yih-Tennant: The exclusives? 
David Kimbell: Oh, exclusives. Well, so I rolled in some of the exclusively, like co-branded, like our IT Cosmetics. We look at a lot of exclusivity and we don't really have a number that we look at with that. But within nearly every brand and certainly every major brand that we have we have exclusive products or lines. Tarte Double Duty Beauty is 1 example that I've already talked about, and we have quite a few of those throughout the entire store. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Simeon Siegel with Nomura Securities. 
Simeon Siegel: So I guess, Mary or Dave, as you look at your shoppers that are converting to multichannel, does that channel migration happen from store to web or vice versa? Are you seeing any change in where or how the customers discover you? And then just quickly for Scott, how much did the Indiana DC weigh on gross margin this quarter and then what's the right way to think about the ongoing impacts from the DCs to margins? 
Mary Dillon: I'll start with the cross-channel. Maybe Dave added -- if there's anything on this  here. But cross-channel shopping is actually a pretty small percentage of our shopper base today. It's only about 6% of our guests or so. And we love them because the cross-channel shopper is shopping more frequently and spending more than a single-channel shop by far. I would say that you can think about digital as the center of pretty much everything now, right? So quite often, maybe somebody is discovering and researching online before they come into the store. Whether they discover us online or in-store first, I'm not sure if I can break that out, but I'd say probably mostly in-store. Online tends to be very incremental to us as well. Our guests love the experience of coming to the store. The whole beauty enthusiast vibe is about trying things and increasingly experiencing services. And then online she's buying things that are kind of incremental to perhaps what she even had time to discover. We push out lots of e-mails, not lots, but I mean an appropriate number of e-mails to our guests around new and exclusive and exciting products and that tends to stimulate some online shopping as well. So to your premise about will that be a big area of growth for us in the future? Absolutely. 
David Kimbell: As far as the new distribution center is concerned, again, as Mary stated, we were very happy with the performance the team put in there, getting it off the ground successfully. And you'll recall the third quarter was really the first time we had it in service. So it was less of a drag on gross profit margin in the fourth quarter because the building was operating very effectively. As we look towards 2016, again, we will have headwinds in the first half of the year because of Greenwood being online. It wasn't there last year. It's still going to continue to scale up. And then in the second half of the year we're going to step -- we'll see more benefits there as we lap Greenwood but they will be taking online the new Dallas DC. So you're going to have incremental headwinds there. 
 So as we look at next year, it's going to be fairly challenging, I would say, from a supply chain and contribution perspective. But we do expect to see merchandise margins continue to expand. So there will be a bit of a help there overall at the gross profit line. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Mike Baker with Deutsche Bank. 
Michael Baker: I guess I'll follow up for my one question, I'll follow up on the Clinique and Lancôme rollout. So in about 700 stores now. I mean, that's up pretty substantially. I think the last time I have numbers was 2013, where they were in about 100 each. So it's clearly rolled out pretty quickly in 2014 and '15 and likely a big comp driver. But with it in now, what, about, let's see, about 80% of your stores, should -- is the lift from that going to potentially slow over the next couple of years? 
David Kimbell: Let me clarify what I said earlier and kind of repeat this . The 700 number was specifically about Benefit. So that's Benefit boutiques at the end of last year. Of course you know with Benefit we have services, we do Benefit Brow Bar. That's in those stores. What I said about Clinique and Lancôme is, you remember 100, that had grown by the end of last year to about 200 each. And then I kind of -- and then -- so that's where we are on those brands roughly, roughly speaking. And then the 500 boutique number is a combination of additions in new stores and existing stores of Benefit, Clinique and Lancôme. We won't kind of talk specifically about any one of them. But in total, across those 3 brands in both new stores and existing stores, we'll be adding about 500 boutiques. 
Michael Baker: Understood. All right. So since -- yes, so since I got that completely wrong, let me ask one other question. You didn't -- my fault. I wrote down the wrong number. You didn't talk about the small stores at all. So can you just update that also, how that's going? 
Mary Dillon: Sure. I appreciate your humility and admitting when you get something wrong. Anyway, the small stores, I guess I would just say, stepping back, we have, as you know, 2 small stores that we opened up in small markets: Vernal, Utah, and Morganton, North Carolina. Both are performing fine. The most important thing is we're learning a lot about operating a smaller footprint. And as we look into the future, a couple of things I would say. One is that we know that smaller markets like those markets, there's plenty of them out there and they offer another growth opportunity for us. Having said that, we could do 10,000-square-foot stores maybe even easier because it's a better -- an even better representation of the full brand experience. So we kind of get into more experience in small markets. Those stores are doing well. 
 We also -- the other thing is that as we look out in the future, we have not yet sized or put any kind of target out there on other opportunities like, say, urban stores or maybe the downtown main street parts of, say, suburbs across the country, where there are smaller parcels of real estate. So we continue to refresh our real estate view, and we're always doing that. And if we decide to go after smaller stores, we'll have a lot better handle on what that looks like in terms of how we think about season states, the assortment of labor models and supply chain models. So all good learnings. And I think we've shown  consistently that we like to kind of walk before we run. So we're walking and learning and it's going to provide benefits for us in the future. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Dana Telsey with Telsey Advisory Group. 
Dana Telsey: Thoughts on the mall stores. How are you thinking about the mall and opening stores in malls? And then also, with the success of services, how are the margins on services? And is there opportunity there? And just lastly, any thoughts on the time frame of the accelerated share repurchase? 
Mary Dillon: Three questions in one. 
Dana Telsey: I know. 
Mary Dillon: Okay. We have a mic, I guess you've got to run with it. 
 So mall stores are a small percentage of what we do today, but we have a fair -- about 10% of our stores. And we are very selective about when we should open up in malls. And we're very -- I think we understand that model well. There are certain markets where that's an excellent piece of real estate. And we've got a lot of learnings about -- even where inside the mall, how to think about where we're positioned, who we're positioned by, where the -- how the doors open, et cetera. So we'll continue -- I don't ever expect it will become any -- much bigger than it is, but certainly we do not reject that if we feel like it's going to give us the kind of return that we need. So think about that as a smallish, I guess, opportunity going forward but part of the mix. 
 Okay, that's malls. Number 2? 
Unknown Executive: Service margins. 
Mary Dillon: Service margins. So go ahead, Dana. 
Dana Telsey: Is that -- how do you think about margins on services and the opportunity? 
Mary Dillon: Okay, yes. I mean, I would say we don't break out the margins specifically across the business. Because of the labor involved the margin on service is typically going to be lower than margin on retail product. That guest, though, who's coming to use services is going to be spending 2.5x more than somebody who's not, so -- and buying a lot of retail products, coming frequently. So in total it's very incremental in terms of profitability to our business model. 
Scott Settersten: And then to close out, on the ASR, we're very happy to be able to announce that today. Again, that would typically -- will begin as soon as the open window for us occurs, which is early part of next week. And that sizing, we would expect to be able to execute that over a course of 30, 45 days roughly. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Rupesh Parikh with Oppenheimer. 
Rupesh Parikh: So I just want to go back to your CapEx spend. We're seeing a lift this year in CapEx, and you guys called out some of the reasons with the boutique expansions and additional fixtures, et cetera. I just want to, I guess, how do you think about the returns on investments related to these investments for fixtures, boutiques and even some of the refreshes? 
Scott Settersten: Well, we feel very confident that it's a good way to invest money. We -- we've had experience, again, Mary mentioned we crawl, walk, run. I mean, that's the way we operate here. So whether it's the new fragrance fixture that we referred to, we already have that installed in a number of stores. We've monitored the results there, both from a sales and margin perspective but also from a shrink perspective, right? It's always a 360-degree view. As far as the boutiques are concerned, again, we've had a long history there with a number of these brand partners and we've been able to measure incrementality and halo effect in all those other things when these are installed in our stores. So we're very confident that they're going to produce excellent returns for investors over the long term. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. 
Simeon Gutman: Two; I'll make them very quick. The first, Mary, you said that the 5-year guidance followed that [indiscernible] pack. Thinking about investments, right, we had 2 big years of investments, this being the second one. Is there any -- how should we think about I guess next year, the outyear, '17? Should we see the taper off? And second question, it's one of those quarters, Mary, I think it's fair to ask what's not going right in the business? 
Mary Dillon: What's not going right. It's an interesting question, Simeon. Here's the thing. I'm -- we're really focused on the future and where the world is going in the next -- I mean, maybe I'll be so bold as to say 5 or 10 years. But thinking about what are the innovations and/or ways to think about the way that the guest expectation is going to continue to evolve and change about seamless retailing and shopping. So it's not a problem. It's a great opportunity for us because it's -- and I talked about  this in the script. But I've got a team of people and their teams  that think in a very integrated, guest-centric way and store-associate-centric way. So we're thinking a lot about how do we think about just continuing to be ahead of the curve as it relates to the competitive environment and the shopping expectations in the future. So -- and there's no one to answer to that, I guess. So it's not like it's -- anything is broken. It's a matter of where do we point ourselves for the future. And I mean that honestly. I think that I'm very, very pleased at how many things are going well. We're not complacent about that. We push ourselves very hard. We're really focused and always improving. 
Scott Settersten: And as far as the CapEx and long-term guidance implications are concerned, Simeon, I mean, we're very happy with where we are today. I mean, the business is performing very strong. We're probably a little bit ahead of where we thought we would be at this point in time. The boutiques were in our five-year guidance. I mean, they were inherently built in there. But we are pulling them forward, so there is an acceleration here. And we expect, again, those investments, we demonstrated that they pay great dividends for investors over the long term. 
 So the CapEx specifically for next year, you can expect it to say elevated. This boutique, the strategy we have in place with our brand partners is a multi-year rollout. So we're going to touch as many of our comp stores. And again, that's what that $80 million is basically referring to, is our existing store base. So try to touch as many of those over the next couple of years as we can. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Matthew Fassler with Goldman Sachs. 
Matthew Fassler: My first question, I'm going to ask a couple follow-ups on topics that have come up. You talked about the small stores. You didn't explicitly address store capacity. I think 1,200 is the number that you've had out there in the past. You'll be at 900 at some point in the second quarter, adding 100 stores per year and the productivity looks terrific. There's no signs of saturation whatsoever based on all those numbers. Any updated thinking on capacity as we think about the five-year outlook here? 
Mary Dillon: Yes, thank you, Matt. I'd reiterate what we've said, which is that, and you just recapped it, 1,200 stores, full-sized, kind of prototypical, we see a very clear line of sight to that. We've also said that beyond that, the small market opportunity probably represents another couple hundred. We're in the process of refreshing our real estate view and we're going to start to take a more specific look at the opportunities beyond that, so urban or downtown suburban type pieces of real estate. So I guess I'd just say stay tuned on that. We'll continue to refresh that view. 
 But I feel very optimistic about our ability to continue to drive market share growth. So whether it's in terms of square footage or at a comp basis, we have, if you step way back, we have only 5% share of the spending of the beauty enthusiast today in the U.S. And it's -- beauty is highly fragmented. You can buy beauty products in thousands and thousands of places across the country. But we know that we've hit a sweet spot with a group that's actually, frankly, really strong and growing in terms of the beauty enthusiast segment. So we're differentiated. They like us. 
 So we're never going to get complacent about building out too much, but we certainly don't want to underestimate the possibility here. So I feel good about the target that we've communicated. If that changes, certainly we'll refresh that. But we'll continue to look at it. 
 The other thing I'd say is that, reiterate, new store productivity: very strong. Cannibalization: very low. Too low to even be material. And it's actually gotten less, which is great. And I'd like to mention that real estate opportunities, very strong out there for us. And everything we just talked about as it relates to driving brand awareness of ULTA only helps. Every store that we open now we've got people who kind of know more about the brand than they did a couple years ago. So I think all those factors are very positive for us. 
Matthew Fassler: Great. And if I could follow up briefly with Scott on gross margin. You're coming off a massive increase and I just want to understand a couple of the moving pieces that drive your gross margin outlook. That G&A and write-off piece, is that significant? Because it seems like that would ultimately be nonrecurring. Also, Dallas versus Greenwood, just in terms of relative impact? And then finally, shouldn't mix, as it did this quarter, help you overcome a lot of those factors? 
Scott Settersten: Yes, I guess the one thing I would say right off the bat is, we're batting a thousand here, right? I mean, we've had a pretty good run the last few quarters and you can't always plan for everything to go perfectly every quarter. So as we look out towards 2016, I mean, the combination of the DCs, we feel very confident now. We executed very well in Greenwood. We expect to do as good or better with Dallas coming online next year. Again, I won't break out basis points of headwinds or tailwinds from each one of those. But directionally we feel very confident that these are going to deliver the kind of benefits that we expected up front and that we described back in our investor day presentations. 
 I mentioned merchandise margins a little earlier here. Again, the core, the mix of the business is very strong in retail. All these new brands that are coming in, we've got generally very strong terms with our vendors. Pulling back on some of the broad discounting things and doing things more direct and focused with our customers are only going to help drive merchandise margins higher in the future. So net-net we feel very confident that we're going to deliver at least flattish next year, and we're hoping that we're going to be able to do better, similar to what we did in 2015. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Oliver Chen with Cowen and Company. 
Courtney Willson: This is Courtney Willson in for Oliver. We're just wondering, of those 100 new stores expected to open next year, are they weighted towards new or existing markets? And then also, we were just wondering what you're seeing going forward on the promotional front and if promotion -- the promotional cadence differs at all in the mass versus prestige categories? 
Scott Settersten: Yes, let me start off with the mix. So next year, basically new versus existing is consistent kind of where we've been the last couple of years. It's about 70% existing, 30% new. The one place we are seeing a bit of a change is in types of center. So new centers versus existing centers. So historically -- the last couple years it's been 80-20 existing, 70-30 existing. Next year we see it kind of ticking down a little bit to 60% existing center versus 40% new. So that's a great sign, to have new developments coming out of the ground. 
David Kimbell: Sure. And on the promotional front, we've talked about some of the gradual changes that we've made and trying to rely less on broad couponing and discounting to more targeted and leveraging our loyalty program as a source of value for our guests and we're going to continue to do that. We're not going to make any wild swings in 2016, but we'll continue down that path. 
 As far as mass and prestige there, each of those categories are very different in how they promote. But so -- we tend to have more promotions on the mass side, of course. Prestige is not -- does not tend to be a promoted category. Although starting on Sunday, Courtney, is our 21 Days of Beauty event, beauty's biggest event. So it is one of the 2 times a year where you can get pretty consistent prestige promotion. So that will be something we'll continue, focused events like that. 
Operator: Our final question comes from Daniel Hofkin with William Blair. 
Daniel Hofkin: Just a couple -- one clarification question back to the gross margin in the quarter versus the year-over-year trend and earlier quarters. It sounds like mix was generally kind of similarly strong. But just given the gross margin along with comp was so much better than expected, was there -- what would you call out as -- was it less promotion? Was the mix better year-over-year than it was in earlier quarters? What were the biggest things there? Was it the DC having ramped up? And then I have just one question about not 2016 but 2017. 
Scott Settersten: Yes, I guess the answer to the first part of the question, yes. I mean, it was -- again, it wasn't any one thing, Dan. It was a total team effort in the fourth quarter. Stores, e-commerce team, DCs, merchants, planning; everybody in the corporate support area just really executed at a very, very high level. The merchants picked the winners, the store teams did a great job selling gift cards, e-commerce mix was better than ever, things that we had been telling investors we were going to improve on. The mix overall was good. Just an improved focus on giving the customer what she wants, right? So pulling back and being more focused on some of the discounting tactics that we used and overall -- and the DCs just -- and the work that our teams put in this year to not only get Greenwood open but to improve the existing buildings was just beyond what we expected. So it was just really spectacular performance overall. 
Daniel Hofkin: Great. And then as it relates to next year, and I think you have an extra selling week, like a lot of companies, in 2017, if I'm not mistaken, a 53rd week. But if you put that aside, are you still thinking we might even see a little bit of acceleration in earnings growth next year with some of the investment spending sort of normalizing or tailing off a little bit? 
Scott Settersten: Yes, our 53rd week is actually the following year. It's going to be 2017. So just to make sure we're consistent there, yes. So for '16 now when you're referencing accelerating... 
Daniel Hofkin: I was asking about the year that you have not specifically guided to. I was just thinking most of us model out a year. And I think originally in your plan you were thinking '15 and '16 were going to be flattish margin years and then possibly starting to increase again beginning in 2017. Is that still the way you're thinking about that? 
Scott Settersten: Yes, that is. It's consistent. I think Mary mentioned earlier, our long -- we're not changing our long-term guidance. We feel confident in the trajectory of the business. We think there's a lot of benefits coming out of these supply chain investments that we're making today. So merchandise mix going up, supply chain efficiency is kicking in, in a meaningful way in 2017. We feel very confident that we're on target. 
Operator: At this time I would like to turn the call back over to CEO Mary Dillon for closing remarks. 
Mary Dillon: I'd like to just wrap up by thanking our 26,000 ULTA Beauty Associates who delivered a fantastic year and I look forward to continuing our terrific momentum throughout 2016. And thanks to all of you for your interest in ULTA Beauty. 
Operator: This concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect your lines at this time.

===== 2015 Q3  (2015-12-03 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Greetings, and welcome to the Ulta Beauty Third Quarter 2015 Earnings Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Ms. Laurel Lefebvre. You may begin. 
Laurel Lefebvre: Thank you. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us for Ulta Beauty's third quarter 2015 conference call.

 [Operator Instructions] I'll now turn it over to Mary. 
Mary Dillon: Thank you, Laurel. Good afternoon, everyone. Ulta Beauty delivered excellent results in the third quarter. Strong traffic and healthy new store productivity drove the top line, leading to better-than-expected earnings growth. Sales rose 22.1%, and we achieved a 12.8% total company comp on top of a 9.5% comp in the third quarter of 2014. This was our best retail comp since 2011 and the best total company comp in our history as a public company.
 We gained market share across all of our categories with both prestige and mass color cosmetics achieving outstanding growth. Earnings per share increased 22% to $1.11 compared to $0.91 in the third quarter of last year. Scott will take you through details of our third quarter financials in a few minutes. But first, I'll provide a business update through the lens of our 6 strategic imperatives, which is our template for long-term shareholder value creation.
 The first imperative is to acquire new guests and deepen loyalty with existing guests. Our ULTAmate Rewards loyalty program continues to be a significant contributor to our business results. We now have 17 million active members, up almost 20% versus a year ago, a significant acceleration compared to the 15% growth we achieved last year. Our store associates are doing a fantastic job converting new customers to the program, and we've improved all the loyalty program communication touch points in conjunction with our brand relaunch last quarter, including loyalty cards, brochures and web content.
 All key loyalty program metrics, including retention rate, sales per member, frequency of purchase and average member ticket, are trending well above last year's numbers. We also saw a big jump in reactivation of members who haven't shopped to Ulta Beauty recently, about 56% higher year-over-year likely helped by our increased digital marketing and national advertising. We believe our efforts to increase brand awareness through advertising are also contributing to the acceleration in new loyalty member acquisition. As a reminder, Ulta Beauty's brand awareness, while still lower than our peers, has increased over the past year and we still have an opportunity to improve both the aided and unaided awareness of our brand.
 On September 7, we debuted television and radio ads on national cable and broadcast networks and also aired these commercials during new fall episodes of several prime time shows. One of the ads focused on our 21 Days of Beauty event, during which we saw double-digit traffic increases, and the other ads were focused on Ulta Beauty's unique All Things Beauty, All in One Place positioning. We're currently running another flight of TV and radio during the holiday season with new creative, both a new brand ad and one focused on Ulta Beauty as a great gift-giving destination.
 We also use social media and public relation activities to grow awareness about our support of the Breast Cancer Research Foundation, an important cause that we've been closely involved with for many years. This year, we introduced new elements to deepen the emotional connection for our guests to the cause, which included sharing the story of a breast cancer survivor in a new video called Tracy's First Haircut that was watched over 3.8 million times. And we launched a fund-raising challenge on social media, #UltaPinkOver in partnership with actress Tiffani Thiessen. We also returned as the official partner to The Ellen DeGeneres Show for her Breast Cancer Awareness Month activities, which put BCRF and Ulta Beauty on the national stage for millions of viewers each week to raise awareness and funds. Through all this activity, we expanded our reach in educating and raising funds for the important work of BCRF.
 The second strategic imperative is to differentiate by delivering a distinctive and personalized guest experience across all channels. Our CRM and consumer insight capabilities continue to grow, leading to more effective, personalized and targeted communication. Our CRM platform enables more targeted offers so that we can continue to reduce our reliance on coupons and discounts to drive sales. Our data shows that more targeted e-mail offers lead to higher open rates and significant increases in online sales per e-mail sent.
 We also continue to use both our CRM platform and our website as important components of our multifaceted sampling program. In addition to our popular beauty breaks and monthly sample beauty bags, we're also working with our brand partners to deliver product samples based on customers' past purchase history and propensity to buy certain products. We can track subsequent purchases, get guest feedback and share data with our brand partners. We're on track to distribute more than 4 million personalized samples this year, primarily through targeted e-mails, but also through targeted point-of-sale messages and direct mail.
 Now turning to the in-store experience. Over the past few quarters, we've implemented several initiatives to enhance service levels. Our payroll optimization tests are ongoing as we experiment with allocating incremental staffing hours to support higher sales goals. In the current quarter, we're deploying insights from previous tests to invest in customer-facing hours to deliver a great guest experience during the holiday season for when there's increased traffic in our stores.
 We continue to see benefits from recently rolled out programs that increase productivity, including our task management tool, a new store walk tool to help district managers and other field leaders consistently measure and reinforce store operations and service and Kronos mobility, which improves store management's ability to appropriately staff the stores while increasing guest-facing time. We also continue to reinforce product knowledge and guest service training through our learning management system. And finally, we continue to elevate our guest experience through improved execution of our in-store event strategy for both brand partner and store-generated events.
 The third strategic imperative is to offer relevant, innovative and often exclusive products that excite our guests. The beauty business is driven by news and innovation, and our merchants are doing a terrific job curating an assortment that's clearly resonating with our guests. We gained share across the board with color cosmetics growing well above the house on both the mass and prestige side of the portfolio.
 In the prestige cosmetics category, brands like Urban Decay, IT Cosmetics, Tarte and Too Faced are leading our growth with plenty of newness. Urban Decay's Naked Smoky Palette was the biggest sales item of the quarter. Too Faced was a standout with the successful launch of Born This Way foundation. Ongoing interest in contouring and strobing is driving strength in palettes from Anastasia, LORAC, BECCA and many others. Exclusive to Ulta eyeshadow palettes like Too Faced Vegas Nay Stardust palette and the LORAC Mega PRO Palette were big hits on social media and with our guests. We also continue to roll out Clinique and Lancôme boutiques as well as Benefit Brow Bars. All 3 brands contributed significantly to our comp growth.
 After introducing an assortment of 5 Lancôme mascara SKUs to all stores during the quarter, we're excited to add another great prestige cosmetics brand in a large number of doors just this week. Two of Dior's iconic Diorshow mascaras were introduced in nearly 600 stores.
 On the mass side of the assortment, we added the popular Soap & Glory luxury bath line during the quarter, which is off to a great start. NYX, owned by L'Oreal, is simply on fire, and we offer a dominant assortment of more than 900 NYX SKUs. Their suede lip launch was a big hit in the third quarter. Masks are also a trending category, and we've added a great assortment of masks from Korean brands like TONYMOLY and Leaders. And lastly, the Ulta Beauty collection continues to perform very well, benefiting from the team's work to offer higher-quality, on-trend products as well as the updated in-store presentation we rolled out at the end of the second quarter in more than 300 stores.
 Our professional haircare department exceeded expectations as well driven by newness and continued benefits from the extensive work we completed during the second quarter to improve the assortment, signage and overall presentation of the category. Innovation from Redken, Living Proof, Pureology and DevaCurl drove double-digit comps in those key brands. We also saw great results following the rebranding of our gorgeous hair event in October with enhanced content, how-tos, sampling and events in the salon.
 The fragrance category strengthened in the third quarter as well with new launches including Gucci Bamboo, Jimmy Choo Illicit, Kate Spade Walk On Air, Marc Jacobs Decadence and Estée Lauder's Modern Muse Le Rouge, contributing to renewed interest in fragrance. We also added  Christian Dior fragrances to ulta.com during the quarter as we continue to enhance our online offering.
 Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, we are excited about our assortment and growing number of exclusive product offerings. bareMinerals Enchanted Beauty, Tarte's Tartelette In Bloom, Benefit's Party Hoppin' kit and NYX holiday kit, Clarisonic limited edition holiday sets, these are just a few of the holiday kits that are exclusive to Ulta Beauty.
 In our minds, though, the exclusivity of our assortment is really twofold. On the product side, we have a great private-label offering with our Ulta Beauty collection, exclusive brands like IT Cosmetics and IT Brushes for Ulta, the broadest assortment around from limited distribution brands like NYX and Urban Decay and an array of kits sold only at Ulta across many of our brand partners. Equally important, Ulta Beauty is the only retailer that brings this broad portfolio of brands, categories and price points together in one place to delight the beauty enthusiasts, combining it with a compelling loyalty program and our high-quality services. So how we bring it all together is what sets us apart and what's driving our consistent market share gain.
 Next is our fourth strategic imperative, which is to deliver exceptional services in 3 core areas: hair, skin health and brows. Our salon business comped 10.9%, an acceleration compared to the first half of the year. This momentum was driven by a balance of traffic and ticket increases. Transaction growth reflected strong new guest acquisition, complementing solid growth from existing guests. Online booking generated 22,000 appointments per month with about 2/3 of these coming from new guests. The increase in average ticket was due to more targeted discount and growth in add-on services like conditioning and hair treatment.
 We recently rebranded all of our salons, including in-store signage, training material and direct mail and digital content, in concert with our overall rebranding of Ulta Beauty, which we rolled out in the fall. The focus on trend in combining hair and makeup looks has been very well received by salon designers and our guests. The strongest category during the quarter were hair color, blowouts, hair treatments and makeup services, which reflect the increased integration of hair and makeup looks in our training and marketing materials.
 In the third quarter, our artistic team trained all of our 5,000-plus salon designers on the latest haircuts and styles, hair color and makeup trends in our integrated fall/winter trend collection with a focus on building average ticket. Our annual Cut-A-Thon to raise funds for the Breast Cancer Research Foundation was a big success this year. We provided 26,000 haircuts and 6,400 MicroZone skin services free with a donation to BCRF, significantly more than the prior year. This event was made possible by an incredible passion and engagement of our salon associates who generously donated their time, raising more than $500,000 for BCRF in a single day. We continue to see excellent growth in our brow services performed by Benefit arch experts. We now have 710 Benefit boutiques, and we'll add another 12 this quarter.
 Turning to our fifth strategic imperative, to grow stores in e-commerce to reach and serve more guests. We opened 45 stores, closed 2, remodeled 2 and relocated 2 stores during the quarter, ending with 860 stores. New store productivity continued to be very strong this year with a class of 2015 stores opening well above plan even excluding the record-breaking grand openings of our 3 stores in Alaska.
 We believe these results are driven by great site selection and also because of our growing brand awareness, continuous improvement in our merchandise assortment, stronger grand opening marketing tactics and strong store teams with more tenured managers now often opening new stores. We've invested payroll hours to support training and on-boarding for new store associates. We're building a strong bench of field leaders through an improved succession planning process to support our growth, and we're dedicating resources to make sure new stores get off to a strong start. We're on track to open 100 net new stores to end 2015 with 874 stores.
 In addition, the real estate pipeline continues to look very healthy. We've already opened almost all the -- we've already approved almost all the sites for 2016 and we continue to have access to high-quality sites as our unit growth and ability to drive traffic to centers gives us an excellent standing with landlords. Approximately 25% of these will be in new markets and 75% will be in existing markets. About half the stores will be in new or redeveloped shopping centers and about half in existing centers.
 Now turning to e-commerce. ulta.com achieved very strong growth of 56%, contributing 190 basis points to our total company comp and composed of 54% transaction growth and 2% ticket growth. Traffic to the site was very strong, benefiting from continued digital marketing channel growth, including e-mail, paid search, affiliate, display retargeting and paid social media including Facebook, Twitter and YouTube. Integrated marketing campaigns for Ulta Beauty's 25th birthday, our signature 21 Days of Beauty prestige event, BCRF, our redesigned mobile app and holiday gift guide, all contributed to growing interest in our e-commerce offering. We also saw a significant increase in customer retention in e-commerce, a reflection of our more compelling assortment and offers, improved site shopping experience and fulfillment capabilities.
 More of our ULTAmate Rewards customers are shopping both online and in stores. Currently, 6% of our loyalty members are shopping both channels versus 5% a year ago. Omnichannel guests spend about 2.5x as much as retail-only guests. We continue to see great interest in our CRM campaigns online, our sample bag with purchase offers and limited time beauty breaks on ulta.com. So as a result, we view e-commerce purchases as largely incremental in providing a path to trial and discovery versus primarily replenishment. We've yet to see e-commerce shifting any volume away from bricks and mortar.
 Finally, our sixth strategic imperative, to invest in infrastructure to support our guest experience and growth and capture scale efficiencies. Our new DC in Greenwood, Indiana continues to perform very well. We successfully ramped the building as planned to fulfill orders for 126 stores and 25,000 e-commerce orders per day, and we'll maintain these levels through the holiday season before adding more stores and ulta.com orders next year. Greenwood will handle about half of our e-commerce volume at peak during this holiday selling season.
 We launched the first phase of our demand forecasting and inventory optimization tool in early November. We call this system Swift, for Store and Warehouse Inventory Forecasting Tool, and the tool is now piloting in the mass haircare category with expectations that we'll roll it out to all categories next year. With Swift, we can provide more accurate forecast for both stores and e-commerce, resulting in a better inventory position and reducing lost sales from out of stocks. Swift takes replenishment from a manual process to an automated one and helps us be much more accurate about anticipating future demand and building inventory to support seasonal sales based on holiday or other promotional periods. Early results from both the new DC and Swift are encouraging, but we still have a lot of work ahead of us to optimize our supply chain and improve inventory efficiencies.
 So that concludes our business update, and now I'll turn it over to Scott. 
Scott Settersten: Thanks, Mary. Good afternoon, everyone. Third quarter sales were $911 million compared to $746 million last year, an increase of 22.1%. Comparable sales increased 12.8%. Both the retail comp and the salon-only comp were 10.9% and e-commerce growth was 56.3%. The total company comp this quarter was mostly traffic driven, with transaction growth of 10.6% and ticket growth of 2.2%. Retail-only comparable transactions were very strong, up 9.5%, the highest growth so far this year. Retail-only ticket growth of 1.4% was evenly split between units per transaction and average selling price. E-commerce growth was driven almost entirely by traffic, with average ticket increasing in the low single digits.
 Gross profit dollars were up 19.1% to $335.6 million, but gross profit margin deleveraged 90 basis points to 36.9% from 37.8% last year. This decline was primarily driven by planned supply chain investments, including the distribution center in Greenwood, Indiana that we opened in early August. Product and channel mix also weighed on gross profit in the quarter as we saw very strong growth in areas like mass cosmetics and e-commerce, which carry lower margins. SG&A expense increased 20.8% to $218.8 million, down 30 basis points as a percentage of sales to 24% versus 24.3% last year. This improvement was driven by lower variable compensation expense and modest leverage on store labor and other store expenses. These gains were somewhat offset by planned investments in marketing.
 Note that we are on track to keep marketing as a percentage of sales flat for the full year with marketing deleveraged in the back half of the year, balancing the leverage we saw in the first half. The higher marketing spend in the second half is related to investments to grow our brand awareness through national advertising campaign Mary mentioned, which includes television and radio.
 Preopening expense was $6.1 million compared to $6.6 million last year due to 45 stores opened during the quarter compared to 50 new stores opened in Q3 2014. Operating income increased 17.7% to $110.8 million. Operating margin was 12.2%, down 40 basis points versus last year. Our tax rate was 36% versus 37.3% last year primarily due to changes in state income taxes. Net income increased 20.2% to $71.1 million or $1.11 per diluted share versus $59.1 million or $0.91 per diluted share last year.
 Turning now to the balance sheet and cash flow. Inventories were $884.4 million at the end of the quarter compared to $709.7 million at the end of Q3 2014, up 10.9% on a per-store basis, below our comp rate. In addition to the inventory in the new DC, we continue to invest in inventory to improve in-stock levels for our fastest turning items to support our rapid sales growth as well as investing in new brands and the continued rollout of Clinique and Lancôme boutiques.
 Capital expenditures were $94.7 million for the quarter driven by our new store opening program, supply chain and system investments and merchandise fixtures. We are on track to spend about $300 million in CapEx this year. Depreciation and amortization for the third quarter were $42 million and are expected to be about $165 million for the full year. We ended Q3 with $360 million of cash and short-term investments.
 The company repurchased approximately 288,000 shares at a cost of $48 million during the quarter under our 10b5-1 plan. As of the end of the quarter, $239 million remained available under our $400 million share repurchase authorization. Since we began our current buyback program in October of last year, we have repurchased more than 1 million shares for $161 million. The reduction in our diluted share count versus last year added just under $0.01 of earnings per share to the third quarter.
 Turning now to guidance for the fourth quarter. We anticipate sales to be in the range of $1.212 billion to $1.233 billion compared to $1.048 billion last year. We expect comparable sales to increase in the range of 8% to 10% versus 11.1% last year, our toughest comparison of the year. We have planned for our online sales growth to moderate this quarter. We have purposely smoothed out some of the e-commerce promotional activity during the early part of the holiday season to better match demand with our fulfillment capacity to deliver improved guest experience.
 We expect to open about 14 stores in the fourth quarter. This compares to 10 stores opened in Q4 last year. So preopening expense is expected to be up slightly. Earnings per share are expected to be in the range of $1.48 to $1.53 versus $1.35 for Q4 of 2014, which included a $0.02 benefit of nonrecurring tax. We anticipated tax rate of 37% and a fully diluted share count of approximately 64 million.
 As a result of our better-than-expected performance in the third quarter and continued momentum in the early stages of the fourth quarter, we are raising our sales and earnings expectations for the full year. We now expect to deliver earnings per share growth in the low 20s percentage range compared to the $3.96 of adjusted EPS we delivered in 2014. We expect to deliver double-digit comparable sales in the 10% to 11% range for the full year and top line growth in the low 20s percentage range.
 I'll now turn the call over to the conference call host to begin the Q&A session. Operator? 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Chris Horvers with JPMorgan. 
Christopher Horvers: Can you talk about the promotional environment and what you're seeing from a department store channel in the beauty space and whether that had any impacts on merch margins during the quarter? And in a similar vein, as you think about the outlook for the fourth quarter, is there any anticipation of promotional pressure coming from that channel? 
Mary Dillon: Well, thank you, Chris. Let me just start by saying I guess there's always promotion in retail in this time of the year in particular. We're -- if you step back and look at our business and our business results, we feel that we're kind of operating in a different way than most other retailers right now and we're pretty proud of that. So our trends are kind of transcending some of the dynamics like weather and mall traffic or other things. And certainly, from a promotional perspective, we've been actually able to drive healthy comp sales growth with actually pulling back in terms of broad discounting. Now having said that, we're really focused on using our loyalty program, our CRM capabilities, the whole toolkit of products and in-store experience to drive this great guest experience. So I'm not diminishing the fact that we're certainly in a promotional environment. We understand that. But we feel that our business is really well set up to perform really well at holiday because we're positioning ourselves as a great gift-giving destination and the formula is working well for us. 
Christopher Horvers: Understood. And just as one quick follow-up. Scott, was -- do you think -- was there any component in the gross margin that you would consider as a one-time expense related to the new distribution center? 
Scott Settersten: Yes, well, we've been clearly stating throughout the year that third quarter was going to be probably the most significant headwind with respect to the supply chain investments, specifically around the distribution center there in Greenwood, Indiana. So that's the biggest one-time -- I guess, one-time, that's a tough term to use, but that was the biggest single factor as far as the deleverage was concerned in the third quarter. And again, that would -- we expect that to moderate now as we march into the fourth quarter. So I think the biggest challenge for the year in the gross profit line is kind of behind us. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Matthew Fassler with Goldman Sachs. 
Matthew Fassler: I'll ask kind of a two-parter here, tangentially related. First of all, Mary, your initial insights on the economics of the marketing spend, I know this was a very big quarter for your marketing campaign and some of the broadcast advertising you did, some of your initial thoughts on the responses. And then, I guess, tangentially related, the mass business, it sounds like, gained share within the mix. That's something we haven't heard a lot about before. How do you relate that to marketing efforts, potentially, capturing new customers or to other things that are transpiring in the marketplace? 
Mary Dillon: Okay. I love the way everybody's getting 2 questions in. That's pretty tricky. We'll try to get to as many as we can. Just kidding, Matt. Anyway, I guess I'll say a couple of things and maybe I'll ask Dave to add more to it as well. But initial feeling about our marketing mix evolution, I'm thrilled to death, frankly. I mean, this has been a journey that I think we've been on, as you know, for the past couple of years and say how can we evolve our demand creation smartly in a way that's going to just drive healthy, long-term growth in the business. And I couldn't be more pleased. I think every -- the team is just fantastic. We've done a lot of experimentation, been very careful about it to not swing the pendulum too dramatically. But now we're in a position to have this really full kind of marketing mix and we're just really getting started, I guess. And so that's a key part of, we think, one of the key growth levers for us going forward in terms of our ability to continue to get new guests and drive more market share gains with existing guests. And then on the mass side of the house, again, I'd ask [ph] Dave to add more, but I'm thrilled about that too because the whole brand promise of Ulta is, I don't mean to sound commercial here, but All Things Beauty, All in One Place is a very meaningful idea to our guests to be able to get categories and price points and brands. And we're really looking at that as something that's differentiated and ownable for the long term and as a result, all the categories have to be important to us and have to perform and they are. And maybe you could add some more about that,  Dave. 
David Kimbell: Yes, yes, absolutely. On the marketing spend, we just started TV advertising in September, so it's probably a little early for us to fully judge the impact of the return on it. But we are really encouraged. We've seen, as both Mary and Scott talked about, increasing traffic. We're seeing a healthy increase in the key metric for us, which is membership sign-ups, and that was up 20% for the quarter as well. And so we'll continue to watch it, but so far, we're feeling very good about it. And as I think we've talked before, currently we have another cycle of television currently on air supporting our holiday efforts. So it's a tactic that we'll continue to drive, but it's also part of a much broader marketing mix. We think about TV, radio, but heavy digital, really digital in many ways being the center of our marketing efforts in really connecting and driving awareness and engagement with our guests. So we'll really dial that up as well, more PR, social media, those kind of things. So that will be a big part of our ongoing marketing campaigns. And briefly on the mass side, as Mary said, we'll continue to drive growth. Really, that growth has come at the same time we've been growing the prestige side as equally as well. So the growth is happening in all parts of our box, and we want that to continue. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Daniel Hofkin with William Blair. 
Daniel Hofkin: Obviously, terrific results. Before I ask my question, Scott, I have seen that you had been named top large company CFO by FEI, Financial Executives International, recently. So I offer my congrats on that. 
Mary Dillon: That's nice to raise that... 
Scott Settersten: I appreciate that. Thank you. 
Mary Dillon: You get 2 questions. 
Daniel Hofkin: It will be a one question, two-part. Just -- it's really actually just a little clarification on what's been asked already and then one thing about small store performance. You talked about impact of ads, obviously early to assess. But are there a couple things, either in terms of your online business or particular categories, that you think may have seen an outsized benefit from the ads so far? And then as it relates to margin, you indicated that mix was a factor on top of the supply chain stuff. But if you were to look at it on a same mix basis kind of within categories, could you just -- were merchandise margins, would they have been up, flat or down kind of within kind of on a same mix basis? And then my last question is just a quick update on smaller store performance. 
David Kimbell: Yes, just briefly on the advertising, really we're seeing healthy performance across all aspects. Scott and Mary talked about e-commerce, salon and of course, our core retail business categories are strong. So we really see that as supporting our total store, not any individual part of it and so far, that is definitely working for us. 
Scott Settersten: And as far as the margin question is concerned, again, the distribution center drag was the biggest driver that deleveraged year-over-year. And as we mentioned in the prepared remarks, I mean, the mass -- the spike up in the mass comp kind of surprised us a bit. So net-net, year-over-year, merch margins were better, I mean, by and large, the reduced promotional cadence that we had this year versus last year. But the mass comp surprised us a little bit versus our forecast, I guess I would say. So again, a great thing overall for the business, and we're willing to take that part of the business to the bottom line as well, even if it is a little bit lower margin range. 
Mary Dillon: And on small store, we're really pleased with the performance of the 2 stores that we're operating. And really what we're doing is learning about 2 kind of things at once, right, which is one is about operating alternate footprint and then continuing to learn about the smaller market opportunity. Both of those look promising to us, I guess is the way I would say it. So we already have several successful 10,000 square-foot stores in small markets. So a small market is not that new to us. But we see that as continuing to be a future opportunity, and I guess you can just continue to see us experiment with different footprint sizes that will give us more growth opportunities. So whether it's a small -- smaller store in urban or suburban streetscape, we're looking at all of those things. But those 2 stores in and of themselves are performing fine and give us some good insights. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Aram Rubinson with Wolfe Research. 
Aram Rubinson: Question, I guess, I'll leave it to one, just to focus on the distribution center, I suppose, in Greenwood. When you guys think about -- before you opened it, you probably were worried about certain factors, whether it's the cost to build it, operate it, timeliness, et cetera. Just give us a sense as to what you learned so far and whether or not you'll be folding in those kinds of learnings to other DC nodes and how it's maybe changed your future thoughts of what that network is going to look like. 
Mary Dillon: Thank you, Aram, and I guess I can answer that at a pretty high level. The first thing I would just say is actually we are really proud of our entire supply chain and DC team members right now because they work really hard, doing a lot of things at once, right? So the new distribution center, we're pleased with how that's going so far. All our DCs are busy with holiday and e-commerce fulfillment and really improving that year-over-year, so really great. And I guess the main thing I would say is that as we -- we're absolutely planning to take all learnings. It's in the process right now, and we're taking -- getting Greenwood up and running to apply it to the next distribution center. And we've got, in fact, the team from the future distribution center working at Greenwood over holiday right now to both help as well as to help gain insights in terms of how we can apply all the learnings, everything from across the board. So at a high level, I would say we're pleased with how it's going, still improvements to be made for sure, but we're very focused on making sure that we make it even easier, I guess, the next time. 
Scott Settersten: Yes, and I guess I would just add. Again, we have a 5-year road map, right, for our supply chain and merch systems kind of rebuild and we've got a couple existing centers out there, right? So there's -- we're keeping at the back of our mind how the guest experience, how it's going to evolve over the long time and we're going to toggle back and forth to make the best decisions over the long term. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Simeon Siegel with Nomura Securities. 
Simeon Siegel: So I don't know if this is redundant, I guess, Mary, to your -- to the point you were just making. Can you talk about how those learnings at Greenwood will help with Dallas? I mean, it presumably goes quicker and maybe less expensive. So any color on the right way to think about related expenses there, Scott. And then just given the other initiatives, can you give any help with total SG&A dollar growth for the fourth quarter and next year. 
Scott Settersten: Yes, I guess, as far as Greenwood is concerned, again, just to echo what Mary's already said here a couple, we are tickled pink with how the team has executed down there, got the building opened. We're off the ground. We're servicing stores. We're hitting our e-commerce throughput targets there on a daily basis now, which just gives us a lot more confidence on what we're going to be undertaking in Dallas next year. Again, the learnings that we're generating every day there, the ability to apply that quicker. So I mean, to your point, we're working through our 2016 plan as we speak and thinking about how quickly we can ramp up Greenwood now, right, to add more capacity there to make -- to gain more efficiencies and cost savings and then how can we get out of the gate quicker in Dallas next year. So all that's kind of a work in process, and we'll be able to share more details with you on that in March when we give guidance for next year. 
Simeon Siegel: And then Scott, do you just know what percent of your SG&A is variable versus fixed offhand? 
Scott Settersten: No, we don't get into that level of detail, Simeon. I'm sorry. When I look at kind of the aggregate for the fourth quarter, I think by and large, everyone's in the right zip code, I guess, when I look at margin, SG&A, kind of split. I think most people maybe are a little too conservative on the margin line. I think margins for the fourth quarter, the gross profit margin will be closer to flattish compared to last year. Certainly, you can work the math there with the offset on the SG&A line. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. 
Simeon Gutman: So 2 parts in 1 question. Can you just comment on the transaction growth? I think you said it in certain parts of the business, whether it's the same customer, or just tell us maybe the split between the growth coming from new customer versus the same. And second question, unrelated. Thinking about the services in your store, in particular, the salon capacity utilization, I'm assuming it's not 100. I'm sure the industry is not 100 either in that business. But what's -- what is the industry norm? Where are you relative to it? Any context around that? 
David Kimbell: Yes, I'll start with the transaction growth. We're really, again, pleased with what we're seeing and it's coming, I think, really from a variety of places. Certainly, as our member base grows, we're growing members and they're coming more frequently over time. So that's a very strong source of growth for us and will continue to be a focus for us. Our ability to connect with our members through our loyalty program, access to her in traditional vehicles that we've used like print, but also e-mail and digital and social, has increased her connection with us and that's definitely getting her in the store more often. We've also -- Mary mentioned that we've had an increasing success and ability in attracting or reengaging guests that have fallen off of our active member list, and we define active members as somebody that shopped with us in the last 12 months. So going back in time in members that haven't been as active, and we've been successful through our efforts to bring them back into the store. So that's helping with traffic as well, and then we're also really proud of the fact that we're adding new members at an increasing growth rate. So it's coming across the board, and we think that will be -- that's a really strong part of the success that we've had. 
Mary Dillon: And on the services question, I can't tell you exact answer to the capacity question. I can tell you that we see this a great opportunity for our business going forward. That's why it's one of the strategic imperatives, and we're actively and I think aggressively growing the business. We know that when somebody is using, for example, our salon, any of our services, they're going to be coming more often, spending more, they're great guests. Today, only under 7% of our loyalty members are using the salon, for example. So we know there's plenty of upside there across all 3 of services that we provide and we'll continue to be looking at how high is up with that. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Rupesh Parikh with Oppenheimer. 
Erica Eiler: This is Erica Eiler on for Rupesh. So I wanted to switch gears here to the holiday selling season. It sounds like you have some exciting exclusive kits going on. I guess I'm just curious, how do you feel you're positioned this holiday season versus prior years? And then maybe you can talk a little bit about Black Friday, how that performed versus your expectations. Were there any significant differences versus last year? And then maybe just color on what you saw online versus in-store, that will be helpful. 
Mary Dillon: So let me take the Black Friday part to the extent that I can comment on, and then Dave maybe you can take the part for how we're set up for the holiday, okay? So obviously, I can't comment on specific trends in the quarter. The guidance that we've provided incorporates what we've seen to date, here's what I will say though that I'm really pleased with the execution that we're seeing, in-stock levels, staffing in stores, the offers themselves. Probably one of the most significant things is our e-commerce service level, strong improvement. We've really focused on that year-over-year to improve our fulfillment capabilities and delivery speeds. And just for a moment, I actually do just want to call out, this is a really good example of what I think is kind of, I guess, every CEO will say this, but I think pretty unique at Ulta, which is people working together in truly collective ways against a broader kind of purpose. So even just improving e-commerce fulfillment takes a big cross-functional effort, and we're very focused on how our teams continue to improve and collaborate and communicate and get better every day. So -- and that all sets us up well for the future. 
David Kimbell: Yes, and as far as overall kind of holiday execution, we're obviously right in the middle of it and are really feeling great about our preparation and the way we try to bring our brand to market so far this holiday and feel a lot of confidence throughout the rest of this holiday. We have a totally new approach towards our marketing efforts. I mentioned earlier, that includes mass media really for the first time. Our stores, we think, look better than ever. Floor really integrated. We think very strong holiday look that then has been infused in all of our marketing tactics, online and social, digital, magazines. All -- every touch point has a really consistent, coherent look that we're really excited about. Our products, we think, are stronger than ever across all categories. Certainly, prestige cosmetics has some very strong items -- holiday items. Mary mentioned a few of those from key brands like Benefit and IT and Tarte. Just this week, we launched our Gwen Stefani palette with Urban Decay. So there's a lot of newness coming out. NYX, in the mass side, has some great new holiday offers that are, we think, really exciting. And the Ulta brand itself, as always, has very strong holiday, and we think those are better than ever. And haircare is strong for us as well. And finally, our fragrance business is -- this is the biggest time of the year for fragrance, and we have a lot of newness across a variety of brands. Offers such as our robe are some of the biggest things we do throughout the year in that category. So across-the-board, we're feeling really good about our execution, and we'll be watching our results carefully. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Mark Altschwager with Robert Baird. 
Mark Altschwager: I know you don't want to talk about 2016 guidance, but maybe bigger picture in the context of the multiyear plan. That plan calls for annual comps in the 5% to 7% range. Obviously, you've well exceeded that this year so far and comparisons get tougher. But now that you're a year in and you've seen the results of some of these marketing and merchandise initiatives, does that maybe change your thinking at all regarding what the base level comp is that this business is capable of over the planning horizon? 
Scott Settersten: Well, I guess I'll take a shot at this. We're still -- we got to close out 2015, right? We're still a long way from being complete, I guess I would say, to get through the holiday season here. We're feeling great about the business. The underlying trends are very strong. We feel like we have a lot of levers. We're in control of those, right? A lot of new merchandise newness coming through the business, the loyalty programs doing better than what we expected. We've got some of these brand awareness things out that are really kicking in, but we're -- we still have to see the results in some of that, right? We're still in the very early stages. So the long-term guidance we gave last year was 5% to 7%, higher in the earlier years, a little bit more moderate in the out years. We're going to kind of stay consistent with our practice. We're going to give guidance on 2016 next March, early next March and we'll be able to share more details with you on how we see 2016 rolling out and maybe a little bit more about the longer term at that point. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Brian Tunick with Royal Bank of Canada. 
Bilun Boyner: This is Bilun Boyner on for Brian. First, I guess, we wanted to ask if there were any particular differences in prestige and mass trends in Q3. And then from a higher level, I guess, newness or pricing perspective, do you see any differences in industry trends between the 2? I guess then my very quick second question is on uses of cash. Looks like the cash balance is building nicely. So could you maybe remind us how you're thinking about uses of cash? 
David Kimbell: I didn't -- the first part, the difference between prestige and mass... 
Mary Dillon: In terms [ph] of trends... 
Scott Settersten: Trends in the industry, have we seen any differences in trends and what's going on in our pricing, I guess... 
David Kimbell: Yes, pricing and trends in the industry. I mean, certainly, yes, in the broader industry we watch and as it has been for a little while, prestige has been growing in the industry. And in total, as we look at probably the same reports that you do, that's been growing faster than mass. But again, what we're really focused on is driving that total All Things Beauty, All in One Place. What, as Mary has mentioned, what's really working well for us right now is driving greater awareness, getting her into our store more frequently, but then getting her to experience the whole store and that's all categories. And she -- once she gets in, she might come in for mass, she might come in for prestige or hair or fragrance. But then we work hard through our CRM capabilities to get her introduced and engaged in all categories. So again, we're seeing growth across the entire store, and that's something that we'll continue to drive and that's what really what we're focused on despite what's happening outside of the store. 
Scott Settersten: And as far as capital allocation is concerned, I guess, I would say we're very, very excited to be able to invest the way we are in our business and still be able to return significant cash to shareholders, most recently through repurchases. But over the course of the last 3 years, we returned roughly $260 million to shareholders through special dividends and share repurchases. So again, I think that demonstrates management and the board's focus on making sure we do what's right for shareholders over the long term and again, we'll right size that or change tactics as facts and circumstances change. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Ike Boruchow with Wells Fargo. 
Irwin Boruchow: I guess, Mary, when you look at the prestige portion of your business, it seems like the fragrance side of the industry has been a little weaker over the last 12 months. I guess I would think that I'm -- fragrance will be a larger piece of your business during the holiday given it's more of a giftable item. So I guess, how has that been trending for you? And how do you think about the prestige fragrance part of your business for holiday within your plan? 
Mary Dillon: Yes, I mean, it is definitely a bigger part of the business at holiday. We do a lot with our Gifts with Purchase and our guests love that. Our fragrance trends were strong in the last quarter. As you know, it's a bit of a up and down category, I guess I'd say in terms of it's a little bit more trend driven. We think the prestige side is obviously a really strong part of the category that tends to be a little more consistent, I guess, is what I would say. But important category for us. Again, it's part of the overall brand promise. We're just trying to pick our spots to make sure that we got the right portfolio for our guests and for our business. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Oliver Chen with Cowen and Company. 
Oliver Chen: We just had a question regarding out of stocks. It sounds like there's a lot of nice opportunity ahead. Which parts of the store would you say have the best low-hanging fruit in terms of improving the out of stock levels? And then just taking a step back, your traffic has been so impressive. Is there any way for you to prioritize the various aspects that have really been helping you buck the trend and gain share? 
Scott Settersten: Yes, let me take the out of stock question here, first of all. Again, all the supply chain things we're doing and the merchandising systems that we're making significant investments in today are going to help us with our in-stock position over the long term, both making sure we have the right product in the right store on the right shelf across the chain and just make us more efficient throughout the network, from the vendor dock all the way to the shelf in the store. So there are many different elements, I guess I would say, levers along the way. Part of it is the Swift tool that Mary described earlier today. The distribution centers play a big part in that, but there's also space planning tools and other master data things that we're doing. So it's like a continuum. It's a large broad section of things that we're putting in place to help with in-stocks overall. There's no -- I wouldn't say there's any one specific category or brand or anything like that, that we're focused on. It's just the store overall. So the easiest thing I would point to is A and B items, right? So the fastest, most high velocity SKUs were today we can't really work up accurate forecast to share with our vendors, that would be one thing that we're going to improve in the future that's going to help us stay better in stock. So there's no -- I wouldn't point to any one item. There's a number of items that we're going to implement to help us with that and it's going to help across the network. 
Mary Dillon: On the traffic question. First of all, I would say we're proud that our traffic trends are transcending what's really happening at retail, and we're successfully driving a lot of healthy traffic to the stores. It's really not -- there's not exact science to this, I will tell you, and that's probably not [ph] what you want to hear. But the good news is it does feel like -- it looks like a lot of things coming together. So more relevant product portfolio, loyalty program, this broader marketing mix that includes things that can help drive -- are helping to drive awareness and new guests acquisition, CRM, online and in-store experience. So it's kind of like all of them together is really what we think is the magic that's working for us. And we think -- we're confident we'll be able to continue some of those levers, and we think many of them have multiyear runways. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Joe Altobello with Raymond James. 
Joseph Altobello: Just 2 quick ones. I guess, first on the traffic. Obviously, it sticks out, as you guys alluded to, relative to other retailers this season. And the national TV advertising, I think you said started September 7. Did you guys see a pickup in traffic post that advertising launch? Or was it really pretty stable and steady throughout the quarter? Number 1. And number 2, quick one for you, Scott. The tax rate, you said, 37% for the fourth quarter. Is that a good rate to use next year because the difference between 37% and 38% is about $0.10, so it matters. 
David Kimbell: Yes, on the specifics around the TV and the traffic, again, one thing I'd start with is really TV is a big kind of visible one, but it's very much is a holistic integrated marketing campaign across multiple vehicles. But I will say the TV was timed to launch with our 21 Days of Beauty event in September, and we did see very strong traffic and a very nice, healthy increase in traffic during that event and as we -- but it wasn't just that event as evidenced by the traffic throughout the quarter. We feel like -- we feel really positive about how that traffic sustained throughout the quarter. So yes, strong when we came on, but continued strength. 
Scott Settersten: And as far as the tax rate is concerned, I guess I'd split the baby, so to speak. I'd use 37.50% for next year as kind of a best estimate at this stage. 
Operator: We have time for one more question. Our final question comes from Jason Gere with KeyBanc Capital Markets. 
Jason Gere: I guess a question more on shipping. And I was just wondering from the e-commerce -- and I understand that Indiana is just up and running right now. But can you talk about how competitive your shipping is versus maybe some of the other competition out there? And on that note, do you have in all your stores the option for in-store pickup? So I was just wondering if people don't want to wait 3 days or if it's 1 to 2 days, have you seen in-store pickup that might actually contribute to the comp that you saw here that once people come in to pick up then they start browsing and doing a little bit more shopping. So really the question kind of around shipping and how that kind of plays out. 
David Kimbell: Yes, first of all, just no, we do not currently offer in-store pickup, buy online, pick up in the store. We are in the midst of long-term omnichannel road map that -- and that's something that we'll consider, but that's not currently something that's offered today. As it relates to our shipping in total, yes, Greenwood is an important part of it. Improvements we've made in our existing DCs have led to what we think is a very competitive shipping window and time frame. We did -- as we've talked before, we weren't as pleased with some of the customer service that we had last holiday, and so we've worked very hard, including opening a DC but working with our supply chain partners, IT partners to make sure that our service level -- so we feel it's very competitive, and we know it's an ever evolving landscape and we'll continue to make improvements. But we're happy with how we're going to be servicing our guests this holiday season. 
Operator: I would now like to turn the call back over to Mary Dillon for closing remarks. 
Mary Dillon: Thank you. I'd like to first thank our associates for achieving these great results. They continue to make great progress on our strategic imperatives and taking care of our guests, especially during this very busy holiday season. I want to thank all of you for your interest in Ulta Beauty. We look forward to speaking again with you soon. Thank you. 
Operator: This concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect your lines at this time.

===== 2015 Q2  (2015-08-27 17:00:00) =====

 [Operator Instructions] I'll now turn it over to Mary. 
Mary Dillon: Thank you, Laurel. Good afternoon, everyone. I'm pleased to report excellent second quarter results for ULTA Beauty, with strong sales momentum and better-than-expected earnings growth. To recap the headlines, sales grew 19.4%, and we achieved a 10.1% total company comp on top of the 9.6% comp in the second quarter of 2014. Transaction growth accounted for about 2/3 of our comp, with average ticket growth contributing about 1/3. We continue to gain market share across all of our categories, with both prestige and mass color cosmetics achieving the strongest growth.
 Each of our businesses contributed healthy comp sales: an 8.8% comp in retail; a 10.1% comp in salon; and 43.4% growth in e-commerce. Earnings per share increased 22% to $1.15 compared to $0.94 in the second quarter of last year.
 Scott will share the details of our second quarter results in a few minutes. But first, I'd like to provide our quarterly business update through the lens of our 6 strategic imperatives, the framework we're using to drive sustainable sales and earnings growth and long term shareholder value.
 The first imperative is to acquire new guests and deepen loyalty with existing guests. Our loyalty team is driving great performance through the critical ULTAmate Rewards platform, which drives well over 80% of our sales. We now have 16.1 million active members, up 18% over the prior 12-month period. Our store associates are doing a fantastic job converting guests to loyalty members, and they achieved a significant increase in conversion, leading to an acceleration in new member growth. Member retention rate increased, and we continue to see higher frequency of purchases, higher average ticket and higher average sales per member. As part of our effort to increase awareness of and clarity about the ULTA Beauty brand, we've relaunched our brand communications across all touch points to create an integrated message and consistent visual look and feel that positions ULTA Beauty as delivering the fun side of beauty. We believe this work sharpens and differentiates ULTA Beauty in the marketplace and shapes our brand equity through a coordinated approach across all of our marketing vehicles, including advertising, e-mail, ULTAmate Rewards materials, website and mobile apps, digital ads, store signage, social media and customer magazines.
 Based on our successful 2014 test market, our plan is to include national television advertising to support our upcoming 21 Days of Beauty next month as well as again for the important holiday season. This national television advertising campaign marks the first in ULTA Beauty's history, an important step towards driving a strong and sustainable brand position while increasing awareness among beauty enthusiasts and driving new guest acquisition.
 The second strategic imperative is to differentiate by delivering a distinctive and personalized guest experience across all channels. We continue to make progress here with in-store technology, associate training and evolving the labor model to increase guest facing time. We've also had some nice wins enhancing personalization through our marketing tools. Let me give you a few examples. As we continue to improve our ability to personalize our e-mails and make them more relevant to our guests, we're seeing very positive results. By leveraging insights about customer preferences and behaviors, we're able to tailor our communication to be more targeted and more motivating to our guests. During the second quarter, sales per e-mail delivered increased significantly year-over-year as a result of this approach.
 We launched personalized display ads in the second quarter to better target ads that are relevant to customer attributes and shopping behavior, moving away from predominantly static ad formats towards more dynamic ad formats. In addition, we're leveraging offline and online customer insights to make our online advertising more effective.
 Now turning to ULTAmate Rewards loyalty program. We continue to reward our best guest with a differentiated experience, driving increased engagement and satisfaction. In the second quarter, our Platinum members, our guests who spend more than $400 with ULTA Beauty during the year, received many perks, including Platinum-only beauty steals, Platinum bonus points offers, early access to new products, Platinum social contest, free shipping offers and targeted surprise and delight gifts.
 Now moving to the third strategic imperative, which is to offer relevant, innovative and often exclusive products that excite our guests. News and innovation were strong in the second quarter and prestige color cosmetics remained our best comping category. Sales growth was driven by newness across the board, including innovative foundations from Too Faced and Smashbox, Urban Decay's matte lipsticks and the excited Naked Smoking Palette as well as continued rapid growth in IT Cosmetics and IT Brushes for ULTA. The contouring trend is still growing strong, and the newer trend for strobing or highlighting drove comps in contouring kits and highlighters, with newness from Anastasia, LORAC, Laura Geller and Tarte among the best performers.
 We continue to roll out Clinique, Lancôme and Benefit boutiques, and all these brands executed very strong product launches such as Benefit's Roller Lash Mascara, Clinique's Pop Lip Colour + Primer and Lancôme's cushion compact foundation. In addition, we're planning on expanding our Lancôme presence by launching 5 of their best-selling items into every store, not just those with Lancôme boutiques, starting next week. This full chain expansion is a further demonstration that our business model is successfully driving incremental growth for key brand partners.
 Mass cosmetics continues to grow as well, performing well above industry growth rates. NYX, Maybelline and L'Oreal were growth standouts driven by newness and innovation. We also introduced 2 popular indie brands from the U.K., Makeup Revolution and Catrice, into our mass cosmetics assortments on ulta.com and in a limited number of stores.
 The mass category was also helped by solid growth in private label. We reset the ULTA Beauty collection in more than 300 stores at the end of the quarter, with enhanced presentation as well as new formulations. The wall presentation is updated with colored shelf strips and tester tile graphics, making it easier to shop as well as more efficient for our associates to stock the fixtures. We also introduced a fresh series of ULTA Beauty kits offering great value and products that leverage current trends, including contouring, primers and brows. The haircare category was also a big focus for us in the second quarter. We kicked off the quarter with our Love Your Hair event in May, featuring daily beauty steals, in-store events and live chats. July was headlined by our leader event, featuring great deals on jumbo sizes of haircare products across all categories and brands. We also executed an extensive reflow of our pro-hair planogram at the end of the first quarter, which refreshed our assortment and introduced clear solutions-based signage to improve the guest experience. We believe this helps us set the stage for the most successful leader event in our history. Our merchants, inventory and store operations teams worked closely together to ensure strong execution and in-stock levels throughout the event. And this drove significant acceleration in the growth of core brands like Redken. This is a great example of how we can optimize growth on existing brands through a combination of guest insights, brand partnering and strong internal collaboration.
 Other second quarter brand launches included several fragrance introductions, Sam Villa haircare appliances and Pacifica skincare products.
 Next, our fourth strategic imperative, which is to deliver exceptional services in 3 core areas: hair, skin health and brows. Our salon business continued to grow nicely, achieving total sales growth of 19.7% and comp growth of 10.1%, as we continue to improve our offerings and sharpen our messages to our guests.
 Top growth categories were haircuts and color, blowouts and makeup services. Our comp was driven by about 2/3 guest count growth and about 1/3 by average ticket. Particular strength in new guest acquisition was driven by online booking and CRM campaigns, with targeted offers for first-time guests. We continue to attract new guests by offering services like blowouts and quick skin services. Promotions included offers to get the perfect blowout, special events featuring Living Proof's Perfect Hair Day products and 25% off our 20-minute Dermalogica Microfoliant skin treatments for first-time salon guests, all very successful.
 Now during the second quarter, we also trained all of our salon associates on the new fall and winter trends, which were developed in partnership with Redken and renowned stylist, Rodney Cutler, and supported by high-quality training materials, which integrate new styles for haircuts and colors with makeup trends for the very first time. This included product recommendations and technical instruction for how to get the various styles. And I'm sure you might be wondering about some of those might be, so couple of examples. A tortoise shell hair with a suede eye and a rose blonde look with a petrol eye. Now these enhanced training sessions were very well received by our salon associates. We're now presenting these looks and trends in our integrated marketing plans across all associate and guest touch points.
 Turning to our fifth strategic imperative, to grow stores and e-commerce to reach and serve more guests. We opened 20 stores during the quarter, ending the second quarter with 18 -- 817 stores. New store productivity continues to be very strong for the class of 2015 new stores, which are comfortably exceeding their sales plan. We remain on track to open approximately 100 net new stores this year, with plans to open 44 stores in the third quarter and about 15 in the fourth. The real estate pipeline for 2016 looks very good as well, and we've already approved a significant number of sites for next year's store growth plan.
 The two 5,000-square-foot rural stores which we opened last fall continue to perform very well. We're encouraged by the results, and we're still gaining insights on operating a smaller box efficiently. We intend to open more of these small stores when we have the systems in place to make this format more scalable. Meanwhile, we've opened several stores in smaller-than-average markets with our 10,000 square-foot format that are exceeding expectations like our new store in Pikeville, Kentucky.
 So we're very confident that rural markets represent a significant and incremental opportunity for our store opening program. Insights from operating smaller-format stores will also benefit us as we look ahead to urban and other market opportunities.
 On e-commerce side, ulta.com continues its rapid growth, with sales up 43.4%, contributing 120 basis points of the total company comp of 10.1%. The ulta.com and loyalty teams continue to see excellent results from implementing more targeted digital marketing strategies to drive traffic to the site and guest insights to drive trial offers and incremental purchases.
 Sampling is a key driver of growth in ulta.com. Along with our brand partners, we've had strong success with our signature online offers such as our monthly beauty bags with deluxe-sized samples and limited time beauty steals that drive awareness and trial. Our beauty enthusiast guests love these offers. And brand partners also enjoy working with us through our CRM platform to get their samples to the right targeted segments of our customer base. We continue to explore other areas to drive trial and discovery as well.
 The website has been rebranded to incorporate the new elements of the brand personality and color palette and guests have responded very positively to these changes to the online experience. We also continue to benefit from new brands that we've added to our website, including Lancôme, Redken, Matrix, Pureology and It's a 10.
 And finally, we have much to report on our sixth strategic imperative, to invest in infrastructure to support our guest experience and growth and capture scale efficiencies.
 We celebrated the grand opening of our Greenwood, Indiana distribution center on August 3. We started to fulfill a small number of stores and e-commerce orders. We launched with 6 stores, and we're now gradually ramping up this facility, which is operating on a completely different model from our existing DCs and includes all new systems and material handling equipment. While it's still early, we're delighted that the DC is off to a smooth start, the culmination of 2 years of hard work and collaboration across supply chain, IT, stores and the e-commerce teams. Now this DC will ultimately ramp to service 400 stores and 45,000 e-commerce orders when it reaches its full capacity over the next few years. In addition to a more efficient operating model within the distribution centers, our stores will receive fewer, fuller and more stable cartons. Shipments will feature greater categorization, which makes it easier for our store associates to get product from carton to shelf, freeing up labor hours for customer-facing activities rather than tasking. And we're also implementing a number of core merchandising systems and tools to drive productivity as part of the overall supply chain initiative. For example, this fall, we'll launch a product information management system that integrates vendor information into ULTA Beauty systems and aligns product information across all channels to improve data governance. We also plan to roll out a vendor scorecard to collaborate with our brand partners to drive improvements in performance, such as improved inbound lead time consistency, leading to better in-stock levels and an improved guest experience.
 We'll also start to roll out our demand forecasting and inventory optimization tool, which provides forecasting and replenishment models to improve supply chain capabilities. This tool will help us drive higher sales and less clearance and improve vendor fill rates as well as lead to better in-store presentation and higher in-stock levels. We plan to launch one category this fall, then rollout the system to all categories next year.
 And finally, we're on track to open up our fifth distribution center in Dallas next summer and all the core merchandising systems and tools that we're in the process of implementing will work together to support our growth plan and improve the guest and the associate experience. In the aggregate, these new distribution centers, projects and systems are expected to drive significant long-term efficiencies to optimize our supply chain from product source to guests and help us deliver the financial results we've committed to in our 5-year plan.
 That wraps up my update on the strategic imperatives. So now I'll hand it over to Scott. 
Scott Settersten: Thanks, Mary. Good afternoon, everyone. Second quarter sales were $877 million compared to $734 million last year, an increase of 19.4%. Comparable sales increased 10.1%. The retail comp was 8.8%. The salon-only comp was 10.1% and e-commerce growth was 43.4%.
 The total company comp was driven primarily by traffic strength, with transactions up 7% and ticket up 3.1%. Similar to the trend we've seen for the past few quarters, ticket was driven by higher average selling price as a result of strong sales in prestige categories and less reliance on broad discounting.
 Retail-only comparable transactions were very healthy, up 6.3%, even stronger than what we achieved in the first quarter. E-commerce growth was driven primarily by traffic but average ticket also increased.
 Gross profit dollars were up 18.2% to $306.5 million, but gross profit margin deleveraged 40 basis points to 34.9% from 35.3% last year. Gross profit benefited from improvement in product margins due to higher mix of prestige products, offering a more complete assortment on ulta.com and less discounting overall. These benefits, however, were offset by planned supply chain investments, including the startup of our new distribution center in Greenwood, Indiana.
 SG&A expense increased 16.6% to $183.9 million, down 50 basis points as a percentage of sales to 21% versus 21.5% last year. The key driver of this improvement was marketing expense leverage, partly due to stronger-than-expected sales, but also as a result of concentrating more of our marketing expense later in the year. We still plan to keep marketing as a percentage of sales flat for the full year since we will be ramping up our marketing spend in the second half to drive brand awareness through national television and radio campaign.
 Preopening expense was $4.1 million compared to $3.6 million last year, driven by 20 store openings, 1 relocation and 2 remodels during the quarter compared to 19 new stores opened and 4 remodels completed during Q2 2014.
 Operating income increased 20.9% to $118.5 million. Operating margin was up 20 basis points versus last year to 13.5%. Our tax rate was 37.5% versus 38.1% last year, driven primarily by the impact of accounting for equity compensation transactions.
 Net income increased 22% to $74.2 million or $1.15 per diluted share versus $60.8 million or $0.94 per diluted share last year.
 Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. Inventories were $705.7 million at the end of the quarter compared to $541.5 million at the end of Q2 2014, up 14% on a per-store basis. Excluding the investment in inventory to stock the new DC in Greenwood, inventory per door was up 10.9%, roughly in line with our comp growth. This increase was related to maintaining strong in-stock levels for our fastest-turning SKUs to support our rapid sales growth, the addition of new brands and the rollout of Clinique and Lancôme boutiques.
 Capital expenditures were $80.6 million for the quarter, driven by our new store opening program, merchandise fixtures and supply chain and system investments. We are on track to spend about $300 million in CapEx this year. Depreciation and amortization for the second quarter were $39 million and are expected to be about $170 million for the full year. We ended Q2 with $475 million of cash and short-term investments.
 The company repurchased approximately 291,000 shares at a cost of $46 million during the quarter under our 10b5-1 plan as part of our program to return cash to shareholders. As of the end of the quarter, $286 million remained available under the $400 million share repurchase program. We expect to continue to offset dilution with our 10b5-1 plan and still have the flexibility to repurchase opportunistically beyond that.
 Turning now to guidance for 2015. In terms of our outlook for the full year, based on our strong performance in the first half, we are raising our sales and earnings expectations for the year. We expect to open approximately 100 stores in 2015 and remodel 4 stores. We plan to grow e-commerce sales in the 40% range. We expect to drive comparable sales in the 8% to 10% range. We expect to deliver earnings per share growth in the high teens from the $3.96 of adjusted EPS we delivered in 2014, which excludes the $0.02 nonrecurring tax benefit in Q4 of last year. This guidance includes planned supply chain and systems investments and assumes we continue to repurchase shares to offset dilution. We expect a deleverage on the gross profit line and modest leverage on the SG&A line and operating margin is expected to be about flat.
 As a reminder, much of the investment related to our supply chain project will hit gross profit, including higher depreciation expense, which we'll really begin to see in the third quarter.
 We expect our tax rate to be approximately 38%. We expect to spend capital on a $300 million range and to generate free cash flow similar to last year's performance.
 We are very pleased to raise our annual comp guidance and earnings outlook to deliver high teens earnings growth while making significant investments in the business to drive sustainable, long-term market share gains and shareholder value.
 Moving on to specific guidance for the third quarter. We expect sales to be in the range of $869 million to $883 million compared to $745.7 million last year. We anticipate achieving comparable sales in the range of 8% to 10% versus 9.5% last year. We expect to open 44 stores in the third quarter versus 50 stores opened in Q3 last year. So preopening expense should -- expected to be down slightly. Earnings per share are expected to be in the range of $1 to $1.05 versus $0.91 for Q3 last year. We anticipate a tax rate of 36.9% and a fully diluted share count of approximately 64.2 million.
 And with that, I'll turn the call over to our conference call host to begin the Q&A session. Operator? 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] First question comes from the line of Stephanie Wissink from Piper Jaffray. 
Stephanie Wissink: I have 2 questions for you. Mary, if you could just start with some of the new brand initiatives. We've seen some of the rollouts in-store as well as some of your digital communication. Can you talk about some successes there and how you're thinking about strategically deploying those across some new initiatives for the back half? And then just a question on the DC. Can you remind us, once that DC is fully up and running, what the total store capacity will be of your existing infrastructure and when you may need to invest again to support the next rollout of some of the smaller-format stores? 
Mary Dillon: Well, let me just say that the newness that you asked about, I think it's really -- we constantly know that our guests are interested in newness and innovation. And as I mentioned, there's several things that were quite successful in the quarter. So brands like Benefit and Urban Decay with the Smoky Palette, brands like Anastasia, across all categories, Redken Frizz Dismiss. Mass, NYX was a hot brand. So there was really a lot of newness as well as existing brand newness, new brands and just core brand growth. And how that works in terms of our platform, in terms of marketing, is just that's really where we bring it altogether is just making sure that our guests get to understand what we have that's new and exciting. And I think our marketing tactics are breaking through to her at even better ways all the time. So that's going to be a core part of what we do, and I think we're getting better at it all the time, more efficient and more effective. In terms of distribution centers, so this new DC will serve the 400 stores, 45,000 e-commerce orders. We're planning another distribution center that's in development and construction right now in Dallas that will open next year. And that will be sufficient for the capacity that we need for some period of time. We'll continue to evaluate that. Whether it's small or large stores, we would anticipate that to be covered in the network that we're defining. But certainly, that's fluid as we continue to grow and look out to the future, we'll continue to evolve that strategy and our needs. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Oliver Chen from Cowen and Company. 
Oliver Chen: Regarding the holiday plans and inventory optimization, which categories are most ripe for that process? And will that impact holiday? And some retailers are potentially -- in different categories -- are potentially over-inventoried in the marketplace. So how should we think about the main catalyst for you and holiday at large and what might be most different on a year-over-year basis? 
Mary Dillon: Well, thank you, Oliver. I'd say broadly speaking, of course, holiday, we've been focused on it for months. We're excited about it. It's clearly something that is important to us and to our guests as well. I guess what I would say is that, we just try to be clear about making sure that we've got adequate inventory for what we expect to be our top volume items, and we think we're in a good position to do that. So I would say that, that's -- we look at that as a core part of how we do business given our growth trends, and I think our ability to really understand what's going to move. We don't have big concerns about things that don't work during holiday. I think historically, we've been able to manage that really well and have a low amount of products that don't work well but -- so I think we're in good shape there. Is there anything... 
Scott Settersten: No, I would just add that we really, we don't have any concerns about our inventory position. Again, very little in the way of seasonality and what we carry in our stores. I think we probably are one of the best-in-class in retail as far as the ability to work through discontinued product or clearance things and partnering with our brand vendors to do that in the most profitable way possible. 
Oliver Chen: Okay. And just a quick follow-up on the mobile front. Is there any -- where are you in the innings of like innovation there and what are the next chapters for us to look forward to as customers seems really engaged on the mobile frontier as well? 
Mary Dillon: Well, I'll let Dave take it. 
David Kimbell: Yes, that's great, Oliver. Yes, mobile, obviously, is continuing to grow for us and for -- it's increasingly the way consumers want to engage with brands and shop. For us, in the second quarter, about 60% of our traffic came through our mobile applications, mobile website and about 25% of our sales. So it is -- we're well past the early innings on the impact that it's having in the marketplace. And we're continuing to optimize the experience in our total digital footprint, which mobile is a critical one. We're improving our app pretty significantly and trying to make that shopping experience easier. When she's on our mobile website, all of the changes that we're making around trying to increase conversion and increase average order that we're doing both on the desktop service as well as mobile are having an impact. So we're trying to sharpen how -- the offers that we're highlighting, the way we can personalize e-mails that then drive her to the mobile website. So a lot that we're doing. We think -- again, it will increase -- continue to increase is clearly the way that she wants to shop, and it's a big area of focus for us going forward. 
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Daniel Hofkin from William Blair. 
Daniel Hofkin: I'll echo the terrific results. Just a little more color, if I could, and a general trend within retail and omni-channel retailers, obviously, e-commerce sales and sometimes coming at the expense of the in-store business. Clearly, that does not seem to be happening with you guys seeing actually an uptick. Just curious, what you feel like -- you talked about marketing. Are there any -- a couple of things that you feel like are incrementally resonating even a little bit more with the consumer? And then lastly, I'll just editorialize, I'm assuming that the Donald Trump look is not one of the fall and winter looks that you guys are considering. 
Mary Dillon: We put that one off the table. Oh, it's funny. On the e-commerce omni-channel, let me just start broadly, and then maybe I'll ask Dave to add some specifics. But I think a couple of things. One is that we're clear that for us, 2 things. One is that the multichannel shopper is our best shopper. She's driving a lot. It's really pretty incremental business for us. The core insight is that the experience to go shop for beauty is one that largely women want to have happen in the physical bricks-and-mortar space. And our play -- what we're trying to do is make the store experience just so inviting with the right products at the right level of service across the board, and we think that's working for us and is very sustainable. She likes to come and explore, to try and to spend time there with services as well. Obviously, that's something you can't get done online. So for us, we see that as the core part of our business. E-commerce is working in a way that's kind of neat because it's pretty incremental. So the shoppers that we have that are shopping both online and in-store are by far our best shoppers. They're, for example, maybe coming 9 times a year versus store-only, which is like 4 times a year. And that's only a small percentage of our guests that are actually doing that. So we like that. We think growth in e-commerce obviously is going to be incremental and profitable for us and fits with the consumer insight and the model that we're building. 
David Kimbell: Yes, and I'd just add to that. Certainly, we look at the total omni-channel customer as the one that we're most focused on continuing to grow. And so most of the marketing efforts that we're doing are driving both online and in-store activity. So the -- Mary mentioned some of the advertising programs in the second quarter, a fair amount of radio advertising, enhanced digital advertising, both of which through our analysis said drives both in-store and online activities. Certainly, within the digital space itself, our social media activity has increased quite a bit. Our PR is much stronger. We're doing more with social influencers to drive greater engagement. And then as we roll, as Mary mentioned, roll into the third quarter beyond into other tactics that we historically haven't used like TV. We think all of those will contribute to drive, integrate a more loyal guest. She is very attracted to our loyalty program. And that behavior then gets her to shop in both channels. And that's the behavior that we want to continue to drive, and we've had some success doing that so far. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Simeon Siegel from Nomura. 
Simeon Siegel: Sorry if I missed it. Within the traffic increase, can you share the breakdown between new customers versus increased frequency of existing shoppers and then maybe can you talk about where you're still sourcing those customers from? And then just, Scott, given the moving pieces, can you help with the magnitude of the gross margin impacts over the next several quarters? 
Scott Settersten: Yes, I guess, I'll start. We don't really break out new customers versus existing. I mean, we bifurcate the comp. We've talked about the fact that the majority of the comp, 2/3 of it was transactional traffic-based with the remainder being average ticket. And that was primarily driven by average selling price. So units were relatively flat year-over-year, more prestige, again, less promotion, which is driving the basket increase overall. 
David Kimbell: I'd tell you, we are excited here. We're really pleased with both though, our new traffic, our new guest acquisition rate. Mary in her comments mentioned that our membership grew to 16 million guests or about 18%, and that was driven by healthy increases in new guests as well as the strong retention, increase in retention of existing guests. So we feel like we're both attracting new and then keeping -- getting even more of our existing guests engaged in our proposition. 
Scott Settersten: And a little color specific to 2Q as far as margin goes. We're very happy to see core product margins in our retail business, which again as more than 90% of our total sales continue to expand, prestige mix helped, less promotion overall helped. We did have a little bit of headwinds. We didn't have as much fixed store leverage in the second quarter as what we saw earlier in the year or what we saw in a year-ago period. We also had a litany of other smaller items that affected the quarter. Again, we normally don't get into this level of detail. But salon, for example, we mentioned in the script, Mary did, about some training for our salon associates for the fall trend look. We pulled forward some expenses there. So that was a bit more of a headwind than what we expected. And we also had the startup of the DC, which negatively affected gross profit in the quarter. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Rupesh Parikh from Oppenheimer. 
Erica Eiler: This is Erica Eiler on for Rupesh. So I just want to get back to e-commerce here. I mean, it sounds like you've clearly done a lot of to enhance the customer experience online. I was hoping maybe you could talk a little bit more about what you're seeing from consumer purchases online, specifically maybe what the mass/prestige mix of products looks like online versus in stores? And then also just wondering if perhaps consumers are buying more staple-like products, maybe there are foundations or go-to mascaras versus maybe shaded goods or skincare products that consumers may want to experiment with in stores. That would be great. 
David Kimbell: Yes. Great questions. Again, we're very pleased with our overall e-commerce success, and we see a lot of runway going forward. Specifically, some of the questions -- we don't really break down between categories, but what I -- your question about the mass versus prestige, what I would say is that the -- a key part of our total proposition, e-commerce, anywhere, in our brick-and-mortar and e-commerce stores is all things beauty all in one place, the breadth of assortment, the breadth of price points, the breadth of categories. That certainly is what drives our business and differentiates us and we see that within the e-commerce space. So largely, I'd say the assortment and the engagement that we have in our brick-and-mortar stores is largely reflected on e-commerce. There were some categories in e-commerce that we've talked about in the past that we didn't have as full of an assortment, but much of that gap has been closed largely in our professional haircare. So we see that really reflecting what we see in the in-store environment. For staples versus trying new things, I'd say it's a bit of both. We certainly don't see only staple or replenishment-type items being bought online. There's -- that is happening. But what we find, particularly with those guests that are -- that we talked about that are our omni-channel guest that are really our best guest. She's shopping more frequently in total across both our retail stores and our e-commerce site. And she finds items that, yes, she can -- maybe that are replenishment, but she's also indulging in things that she hasn't tried, that are new items. She wants to get it first. She wants to go online right when new offers are up and available. So she's doing a bit of both, and that's absolutely the type of things that we're encouraging. We'll find it -- make it easier for her going forward to replenish those favored items, but also continuing to highlight new and exclusive and first-to-market items that get her excited when they come out. 
Mary Dillon: Yes, and I'll just add, and I mentioned this in the script. Our CRM capability gives us the ability to really get -- to experiment a lot with how to get more personalized and more customized on what we e-mail to whom and really allow her to try things, whether it's Beauty Breaks! or just e-mail to introduce her to new products. So it's really a nice way for our guests to learn about new products and try new categories that they wouldn't have before. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Simeon Gutman from Morgan Stanley. 
Simeon Gutman: Mary, you mentioned evolving labor model in your prepared remarks. Can you update us on your thoughts there? I think at Analyst Day, you suggested you might experiment in some areas in the labor model. And then connected to it, you're being very successful with CRM and marketing. Curious, in places where you're testing increased labor if you're seeing a benefit above and beyond some of the success you're seeing with CRM and targeting. 
Mary Dillon: Thank you, Simeon. Just stepping back, let me just kind of big picture-wise, I guess, what I'd say is that, as we think about it, Kecia Steelman, who's our Head of Store Operations and her leadership team. We've got a very experienced set of store operators. And we're really focused on continuous improvement and excellence in operations and guest service kind of across the board. So while the payroll test is kind of a piece of it, just to give you a broader perspective, I mean, we're really kind of thinking about how do you put the guest and the associate serving the guest in the center of kind of everything we do and really a holistic approach to improvements, whether it's people, processes or tools. So that's everything from identifying the right talent, training and development, store processes, best use of labor hours as we kind of talked about there, all to kind of just really improve that guest experience. So the payroll test is just a part of it. We're learning things. We've extended it to another 60 stores. We've gotten some specific learnings. Things that we're trying that are differently. I don't want to get more specific on it than that because we're still learning. But certainly, we're measuring the impact on sales and units per transaction and whatnot. It's kind of a combination of art and science. It will be core to just what we do all the time. So there's no big kind of aha and one specific thing coming out of it, but think about it as just a piece of a broader focus on how do we get better every day, what we do in-store to serve our guest. 
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Matt McGinley from Evercore ISI. 
Matthew McGinley: My first one is on the inventory. When we look at that 30% inventory growth you had, I think, you said 16% of that was related to getting that DC in stock, and I assume some of that would be safety stock. So I wonder what the -- of that 16%, how much is in-stock versus safety stock? And does that normalize over the year or do we really need to get past the DC that opens in 2016 to see those growth rates drop? And the second one is on advertising. With the testing you were doing last year, I know you were happy with those tests and you expressed how good they were in the test markets you tried it in. So my question is, as you didn't do as much advertising in the second quarter, did those markets where you did the test in continue to outperform the rest of the company or the company average? 
Mary Dillon: Yes, I'll start with that. I'm not -- I wouldn't want to comment about kind of all the specific learnings. Clearly, we feel good about what we've learned and it's been -- we've been, I guess, modifying our marketing mix for some period of time under Dave's leadership and his team. So what I'm excited about is that our marketing is getting more efficient and effective every day. And that's really critical for us for the long term, to drive short-term results and to create a long term strong brand and brand equity. So that I'd say in the last quarter, seeing we added radio advertising, we did a lot of PR, we did a lot of digital, we also continue the tactics that we've always done like tabs in magazines, all of those are getting more effective and efficient with less reliance on discounting. In addition, now as I mentioned, this really starting next month, we're going to layer in national television advertising. We learned from the in-store test that, that was going to be effective for us and so we're going to add that to the mix. So just -- I guess I feel confident in saying that we got a lot of good learnings out of the test and now we're moving forward to implementing all those learnings as we go. But again, it's art and science. So there's never actually one answer and it's never any one stopping point, right? We'll continue to evolve as we go. 
Scott Settersten: And with respect to the inventory, it was roughly $20 million at the end of the quarter, which I'd say is all safety stock because we weren't servicing any stores out of that DC at that point in time, right? We started subsequent to quarter end. So I would say we expect that to be kind of the high watermark on a per-door basis for fiscal 2015. We expect to see some moderation now in the second half of the year and should stay roughly in that zone as we cycle through next year with another DC stacked on top. So once we get through 2016, again, with all of the systems we're putting in place, the DC forecast and replenishment, other floor planning kinds of tools, we expect all of those to help contribute to improved inventory flows and improved turns. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Chris Horvers from JPMorgan. 
Christopher Horvers: So I wanted to follow-up on the gross margin question. How significant was the DC startup cost in the 50 bps? And would you consider it onetime? And then on a related note, can you provide some color on the magnitude of the marketing shift out of 2Q and whether those dollars spread roughly equally in the back half? 
Scott Settersten: Yes, I guess with respect to the gross margin, I'm not going to quantify the basis points here. We try to steer away from specific P&L line guidance. But it's going to be much more significant in the third quarter than it was in the second quarter, okay? So just directionally, second quarter a lot of payroll cost, right? We've got rent expense running through the P&L because we're in startup mode, but the depreciation doesn't really start, and that's really going to be the significant incremental cost running through the gross profit line starting in the third quarter, all right, for all the investment. And again, we called that out in our investor communications, right, it's upwards of $60 million. So it is a significant step-up from what we've done historically. Marketing, kind of along the same lines. We're not trying to get too specific on what dollars moved where, but it's significant. I mean, we saw some in the first quarter. We called that out. We saw more in the second quarter. And again, it's a result of us being smarter during the quarter. We're seeing sales trends. And if we see an opportunity to pull back, we will do that. And we'll keep the dry powder for when the ducks are flying, so to speak. So fourth quarter, there's a lot of shopping, a lot of new guests coming into a lot of new stores that we're opening during the course of the year, and we're going to deploy the marketing where we think it makes the most sense. 
Christopher Horvers: And then -- and just going back to the gross margin question, so understood, the depreciation steps up, but you don't necessarily have the other items sitting in there like the salon training, which would pressure gross margin. I guess what I'm trying to understand is, could gross margin in the back half be down in similar magnitude as it was in the second quarter? 
Scott Settersten: I don't think I want to get to that level of detail. Again, I would just say though, there's always -- every quarter is kind of standalone. There's ins and there's outs. The salon we mentioned this time because that was a bit of an unusual item. E-commerce was strong, right? That leader event and given that's another one-off, it was stronger than we thought it was going to be online, which was great. They were incremental sales. But we had additional freight cost, right? It's heavier product. It costs a little bit more to ship. So it's not -- and we don't think it's productive to get into reconciling the basis points every quarter. The one thing I would point out is, if you're looking at next year, we got a new distribution center coming online next year, right, where we can have a lot of these startup costs and the same. So I wouldn't expect it to create the same level of headwinds just because you're kind of lapping a big event like we had this year, but it will be additional headwind next year. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Joe Altobello from Raymond James. 
Joseph Altobello: Just first question, I just want to go back to the inventory line for a second. I think, Scott, you mentioned earlier, obviously, that, that's going to remain a bit elevated here with the new DC coming online. When do you expect the year-over-year increase in improved door inventories to migrate back to basically same-store sales growth? Is that next year? 
Scott Settersten: Well, I'd say we're going to be in the neighborhood this year. I mean, look at the comp that we're posting, it's an 11 comp. So you're looking at -- x that $20 million of startup inventory, I'd call it, we're at the comp level. So it's not -- I wouldn't view the inventory as being out of control in any way, shape or form. I mean, we feel very comfortable with the inventory that we have. Again, there's little seasonal or fashion risk to the inventory. I mean, to be frank, we spend most of our time trying to figure out how to stay ahead of the trend usually when we're chasing inventory. So we're -- with the cash and the balance sheet strength we have, we're not going to be shy about making some bets going into the fourth quarter, right, on hot products. So we're -- I would say generally speaking, there's nothing to see here, right? We're very comfortable with our inventory position. 
Joseph Altobello: Okay. That's good to hear. And then secondly, in terms of your decision to go into national TV advertising for the first time. Why now? Is there something that you view as a natural extension of your marketing strategy? Was it something that was sort of debated internally or was it just an obvious move on your part? 
Mary Dillon: Yes. It's really been part of our thinking all along and really part of our 5-year plan. The first strategic imperative that we described is driving new guest acquisition and more sales from our current guest. We know that we have a gap in awareness of our brand relative to our competitors, whether it's aided or unaided, and that television advertising is one of the tools, one of the fastest tools to drive awareness. And we've been 2 years into it now. So this wasn't like we're just going to go and jump and do that overnight. We carefully developed brand positioning, creative, tested it, tested the media plan. So I feel confident that the time is right. Also, I would say, we all know has been very competitive marketplace. It's always been and probably always will be. So striking while the iron is hot, I guess, we're in a position to build a long-term sustainable business model here. And we think this is a key part of it, is to really keep pressing ahead with the marketing tools to drive both short-term and long-term results, and we feel it's the right time to do it. We're ready to do it. 
Operator: Next question comes from the line of Kelly Halsor from Buckingham Research. 
Kelly Halsor: I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about the prestige skincare category. It's been a few quarters since you guys have called it out as a top-performing category. So what are you seeing in terms of trends in newness of products and brands beyond the rollout of the branded boutiques? Are there any opportunities to add new brands, especially in light of some of the well-known brands recently announcing plans again to the specialty multichannel in a bigger way? And then secondly, could you provide any more color around the cadence of the DC and the store ramp-up? How many stores do you need to get to start to see some leverage on costs associated with that facility? And just any timing around that would be helpful as well. 
David Kimbell: I'll start with prestige skincare. Prestige skincare, I think, as you're probably aware is not -- has been a little slower than historical the last few years. It has slowed down as a category, although we see it as a critical central category to our overall proposition. And we're excited about the potential. I think it's a mix of great partners that we have in place today, some of our biggest, strongest brands like Philosophy, Dermalogica, Clarisonic. Dermalogica with our partnership with skin services is a key strategic platform for us. We continue to engage our guest and not only have them engaged in products, but have them engaged in services. So we see those largest brands continue to grow and provide opportunity, both today and some of the innovation in the pipeline that we know that they're going to drive going forward. There are additional brands in our box that are relatively new or newer or up and coming. A brand like Juice Beauty is a nice brand that we're excited about, and that's performing quite well. There are, to your question, there are certainly additional brands that we don't carry today. I'm not going to talk about any of them specifically, but there's certainly other brands that we're continuing to explore, with a whole team dedicated to exploring and figuring out which ones would make the most sense in our proposition and our box going forward. So we'll continue to add innovation in the skincare category. We see it as a mix. You're right that there's been some -- a fair amount of, I guess, consolidation, Unilever playing a bigger role in the prestige skincare. We think that's probably only good to get greater emphasis on the category, some new resources, and we think it will drive growth going forward. 
Scott Settersten: And Kelly, the short answer on the leverage question on fixed cost there, we would expect -- we expect to see benefits from the Greenwood facility. We expect to see some benefits next year. Of course, those will be masked somewhat by adding another new DC in the Dallas area. Meaningfully, 2017, I think, is where you would -- we'd be able to see more presence of leverage on the P&L overall. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Mark Altschwager from Robert W. Baird. 
Mark Altschwager: Kind of a bigger-picture question. Mary, we've seen growth in popularity of these beauty subscription services. I think one of your competitors actually recently announced a launch in that area. Can you just give us your thoughts on the merits of that model? Is it something ULTA loyalty guests are asking for? Something you could see ULTA doing in the foreseeable future? And maybe any comment on where your capabilities lie there given the new DC investment. 
David Kimbell: Yes, I'll take that, Mark. We see the real benefit of that whole space as fundamentally driving trial and discovery of products for our guest, and that' something that we've been focused on for a while. We do a lot in that space. We do not currently offer a exact subscription-based model similar to some of the other ones that are out there. And we'll explore all options going forward. Although I'd say what we're really focused on is finding what we think are probably the better ways to drive that discovery and trial. We do a lot with our guests to provide products. We do programs through our e-commerce platform. Beauty Breaks! which are kind of weekly limited-time offers that give hot prices and samples associated with it. You have beauty bags that are extremely popular that give premium-sized samples to our guests and we feel they're more targeted and more relevant, we often partner those with buy-ins on certain products. So there's a -- our customers are more engaged in it. They're expecting these products to come along with it. So their usage, we think, is really good. We're also experimenting in another -- a variety of different ways to again drive this trial and discovery. For example, recently, we had a program with a very popular YouTube blogger, created a sample bag with her favorite items that was exclusively sold through or made available to her followers with a buy-in on our website. So we think it not only drove business, it drove engagement, it sampled products and discovery. So the whole space around trial and discovery is the one that we think we're very active and we've reached hundreds of thousands of guests with those kind of programs, and we'll continue to drive that kind of program going forward because it excites our guests and get them engaged in more and more of our products going forward. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Dana Telsey from Telsey Advisory Group. 
Dana Telsey: As you think about the new guests that are coming in, whether going to the salon or even in the store with prestige, do you think these salon guests, how many of them are coming from loyalty programs? How many of them are coming from the marketing efforts that you're putting into place? And what does this mean for conversion into loyalty members going forward? 
Mary Dillon: Yes, I'm glad you asked that because it's an exciting area for us in terms of growth, future growth, because really, a small percentage of our loyalty guests today are using the salon. We're doing a lot. I'd say, it's coming from a lot of things. One is, we've offered a new online booking service that we know is driving largely incremental new guests, thousands of them, in fact. And then also our marketing programs right now are getting more and more focused on integrating makeup and hair and trend. And they're very exciting. And I think we're actually bringing to our store associates this kind of trend training that we talked about, bringing it to life inside the store. And certainly, every guest that comes into an ULTA store who's a potential new loyalty member, our associates in-store are doing a great job of converting them into the loyalty program because they understand that, that's important for the business. So all those items will work together, we think going to continue to be a key part of our growth story. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Mike Baker from Deutsche Bank. 
Michael Baker: You guys talked about in your prepared remarks a metric of sales per e-mail sent out which is an interesting metric. How long have you -- can you give us some more color on that? How long have you measured that? Has the growth accelerated at all or what does that look like in the past? 
David Kimbell: Yes, we won't get the real -- the specific numbers on it, but it is something that we measured for a while, and we're seeing really, really healthy growth. And that growth in effectiveness of our e-mail campaigns is really fundamentally coming from, I'd say, 2 places. One is better targeting. So we're understanding our consumers' desires, we think, a little bit better and personalizing the e-mails to them. And then the offers, the items and the creative that surrounds them, we think it's better as well. So the e-mails themselves are better, better items, better offers, better programs that are personalized in much sharper ways. And those things have really worked well. So we're sending out more e-mails, but we're getting much more effective and efficient in doing it, and we think it will be a big growth driver for us going forward. 
Michael Baker: Okay. That makes sense. If I could ask one other. Just on the supply chain, I assume we're still in line for that, the hit this year to be 5 percentage points relative to your earnings growth and does that peak -- it seems like that's going to peak probably around the third quarter, is that right? 
Scott Settersten: That's correct. You got that. Yes, third quarter when we flipped the switch at the beginning of the third quarter. And that's when it was, right, just doing a store or 2. And now we're going to ramp it up and it will get more efficient over time. And as we get into the fourth quarter, it's going to service 130, 140 stores. So at that point, it will be more productive and be contributing more or less drag overall, I guess, I should say. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Aram Rubinson from Wolfe Research. 
Aram Rubinson: A lot of retailers have struggled with trying to reduce promotions and still hold sales. You guys are one of the few where you've actually pulled back on promotions and sales have kind of held or accelerated. I know you're still using pretty blunt instruments when it comes to CRM and customer knowledge. I'm just wondering, is there potentially another round of that as you look at kind of the response that your customers have had to it? Do you think that if we or you decided to kind of pull that lever again that you might be able to go another round, perhaps a bit more surgical, but kind of almost repeat that same exercise? 
Mary Dillon: I would say that I don't know that I envision another big change here. This is a gradual process that we've been working on really for some period of time, which is the kind of the careful experimentation, testing and learning, trying things differently and changing such that our marketing mix -- I wouldn't say it's blunt instrument so much anymore. I mean, I understand your question, but I think we now have a really robust array of tools that are getting better and better as it relates to effectiveness and efficiency. So I will just consider this a core part of how we're going to always do our business, which is constantly look for how can we be driving long-term brand equity, which is really important that people understand what ULTA is and they're aware of us. They understand that we are all things beauty all in one place. And then lots of surgical tools to drive the short term day-to-day results that we need. So it's an ongoing piece of how we're going to do the business. Dave and his team are all over it. And that's how we look at it. 
Aram Rubinson: Let me ask it another way. If you were to look at your level of promotion today versus the brand equity, you think ULTA deserves or warrants, do you think those 2 are in balance now or are they still a little out of balance and which way? 
Mary Dillon: Well, we're really just starting the national television advertising as you know. So that's another kind of shift in the balance of the mix. I envision that we'll be able to hold our ADS [ph] ratio pretty consistent over time with the mix being -- getting more in balance. But I'd say it's getting there gradually. It's not wildly out of balance. I think we're moving into a place that will be pretty sustainable for the long term. 
Operator: And it appears there's no further questions at this time. Would you like to make any closing remarks? 
Mary Dillon: Yes. In closing, I'd just like to say I'm very proud of the excellent results that the associates across ULTA Beauty are delivering while making significant progress on all of our initiatives, marketing, merchandising and supply chain. I want to thank you for your interest in ULTA Beauty, and we look forward to speaking with you again soon. Thank you. 
Operator: This concludes today's teleconference. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect your lines at this time.

===== 2015 Q1  (2015-05-28 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Greetings, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the ULTA Beauty First Quarter 2015 Earnings Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Ms. Laurel Lefebvre. Thank you. You may begin. 
Laurel Lefebvre: Thank you. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us for ULTA Beauty's First Quarter 2015 Conference Call. Hosting our call are Mary Dillon, Chief Executive Officer; and Scott Settersten, Chief Financial Officer. Also joining us is Dave Kimbell, Chief Merchandising and Marketing Officer. Before we begin, I'd like to remind you of the company's safe harbor language. The statements contained in this conference call which are not historical facts may be deemed to constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual future results may differ materially from those projected in such statements due to a number of risks and uncertainties, all of which are described in the company's filings with the SEC. We make references during this call to the metric free cash flow, a non-GAAP financial measure defined as cash provided by operating activities minus purchases of property and equipment. I'll now turn the call over to Mary. 
Mary Dillon: Thank you, Laurel. Good afternoon, everyone. I'm delighted to report that 2015 is off to an excellent start at ULTA Beauty with better-than-expected sales and profit growth in the first quarter. 
 To review the headlines, sales grew 21.6%, and we delivered an 11.4% total company comp on top of an 8.7% comp in the first quarter of 2014. We continued to see strong momentum in transaction growth with average ticket growth also contributing to the overall comp. These results were driven by continued market share gains across all categories with particular strength in both prestige and mass color cosmetics. With our best retail comp in 12 quarters, we were also pleased to deliver a 10.3% comp in our salon business and 49.8% growth in e-commerce. We continue to benefit from more targeted marketing through our loyalty and CRM programs. We've also been successful in our effort to drive effectiveness and gain efficiencies in traditional marketing programs enabling us to reinvest in advertising to drive higher brand awareness and long-term growth. 
 Earnings per share increased 35% to $1.04, compared to $0.77 in the first quarter of last year. Scott will talk in more detail later about our first quarter financial results and raised outlook in just a moment. But first, I'd like to provide an update on our business through the lens of our 6 strategic imperatives. 
 As a reminder, we developed this long-term strategic framework last fall to guide our path to continue to deliver market share gains and long-term sales and earnings growth. 
 The first imperative is to acquire new guests and deepen loyalty with existing guests. To update you on our loyalty program, membership in our ULTAmate Rewards program has now reached 15.5 million active members, a healthy increase resulting from an increased retention rate and strong growth in new members in the first quarter. We believe improved retention signals that both the strength of the program is strong and the benefits of converting to one program last year. New membership was driven by great in-store execution by our associates converting nonmembers into members and guest recognition of the benefits of the program. Member comp sales were very strong driven both by more loyalty members shopping and higher sales per member. 
 Our loyalty program and increasing capabilities to deliver more targeted and personalized offers to our CRM platform continue to drive strong traffic and sales growth. While we will always focus on offering our guests a strong value proposition at ULTA Beauty, in the first quarter, we were able to maintain very healthy traffic while trimming the depth and breadth of some of our promotions. We continue to focus on new customer acquisition by reallocating some marketing dollars into awareness and acquisition vehicles. After successful tests of advertising in the third quarter of last year, we invested in a national radio campaign during the holiday season and, based on the success there, ran a national radio campaign for 21 Days of Beauty this quarter, which drove very strong traffic growth during the event. 
 Our increased use of tools like advertising and social media give us another opportunity to create an emotional connection between our guests and ULTA Beauty. Our Mother's Day social media campaign is a great example of this. The campaign was based on the insight that most people don't remember the last time they told their mom that she's beautiful, and ULTA Beauty invited people to send her this message via social media. And of course, we encouraged them to get her a Mother's Day gift at ULTA as well. Thousands of people shared messages, photos and videos at #MyBeautifulMom. The original campaign video was viewed 1.4 million times on social media channels and garnered more than 100 million media impressions. 
 We plan to continue to use a full array of marketing strategies and tactics, including traditional and digital advertising, PR, CRM and magazines to acquire new guests and deepen loyalty with existing guests. 
 The second strategic imperative is to differentiate by delivering distinctive and personalized guest experiences across all channels. We continue to see good results with the clienteling app we initially tested in 30 stores. We're now rolling out an upgraded version of the app to an additional 30 stores this quarter. The new version will give our prestige associates the ability to track and review the preferences, purchases and loyalty points of our guests enabling more efficient follow-up and feedback collection and more personalized interactions in every visit to our stores. The store operations team is planning to extend the pilot to additional districts and continue to measure how the application improves the guest experience and increases engagement and loyalty. 
 Another way we're making the guest experience more engaging and personalized is through exciting in-store and online events. We continue to expand our repertoire of activities, include -- increasing resources to host live chats at ulta.com, personal appearance in our stores and master classes featuring our brand partners, many of whom have earned celebrity status with our guests. 
 And finally, we've upped our game in training our associates to support a great guest experience. Over the past year, we've added 5 training courses focused on guest service and sales, including a program devoted to increasing ULTAmate Rewards program membership. We've also added more than 50 brand-specific product knowledge training videos that all store associates can access on demand through ULTA Beauty's online university. Most recently, we delivered robust leadership and store training to all of our general managers and field leadership teams at our recent general managers conference in April. 
 The third strategic imperative is offering relevant, innovative and often exclusive products that excite our guests. Our guests are responding very well to the product assortment that our talented merchant team continues to curate and evolve. Many of the new brands and products launched last year in our prestige cosmetics category continue to show strong momentum, including It Cosmetics, It Brushes for ULTA, and new products from Urban Decay and bareMinerals. We're increasing our focus on offering exclusive products with more and more items marked new and only at ULTA in our marketing communications. 
 During the first quarter, we drove increased traffic with our signature 21 Days of Beauty event as well as our Mother's Day gift with purchase program, which highlighted many recently launched fragrances. Our prestige boutiques featuring Benefit, Clinique and Lancôme products continue to expand and perform very well. In our private-label business, we enhanced the ULTA Beauty collection with the introduction of the ULTA Luxe and the ULTA Romance bath and body products. We also introduced a new private brand of nail products called Whim, a high-shine nail lacquer line available in 58 shades. In the professional hair category, we completed significant refloat [ph] projects in all of our stores to reallocate space, optimize adjacencies and assortments, and add trend-right new brands, including John Masters Organics, Obliphica Professional and Peter Coppola. All 3 brands add dynamic innovation our current assortment. 
 Turning to e-commerce. ULTA.com sales benefited from expanding the assortment to include most of the professional haircare brands we carry in-store, adding Lancôme products and continued success with sampling and limited time beauty steal offers. 
 From a trend perspective, we're seeing explosive growth in contouring palettes as that trend is still going strong as well as continued interest in brows, lip and mascara. On the skincare side, innovative treatments and masks targeting specific face and body areas and featuring innovation and ingredient delivery, such as hydrogels and infusion patches, are all emerging trends. 
 Next, our fourth strategic imperative -- delivering exceptional services in 3 core areas: hair, skin health and brows. Total salon sales grew 20.5%, and comp sales were up 10.3% demonstrating continued momentum in the strong trends we've been seeing in our services business. Haircuts and color, blowouts and makeup services all comped double digits during the quarter. We launched our spring cut and color trend collection designed by ULTA Beauty artistic team and Rodney Cutler, Redken's expert and celebrity stylist. We supported the launch with ample training, and this new collection received rave reviews from our associates, who found they could easily translate these great looks to their guests. 
 At a recent general managers' conference, we announced a new product partnership with Sam Villa, Redken's education artistic director, to sell his professional quality hair tools. Sam personally provided master classes for our top salon associates at the conference. The addition of Dermalogica facial peel services last year continued to drive growth in our skin services category. We've improved staffing, retention and productivity of our skin therapists, who received high-quality training from Dermalogica to provide guests with expert advice on skin services and products. New guest acquisition was very healthy during the quarter with an encouraging response from our offers targeting new salon and skincare guests. Online booking continues to grow nicely with more than 2/3 of these appointments from new salon guests. 
 To update you on our Brow services offering, we currently have more than 600 Benefit Brow boutiques. Brow tinting services have now expanded to about 450 stores. Both products and services are driving excellent performance for our Benefit boutiques. We plan to pilot online booking capability for the Benefit Brow Bars later this year as well. 
 Turning to our fifth strategic imperative: growing stores and e-commerce to reach and serve more guests. So starting with stores. We opened up 24 stores during the quarter and closed 1 store, ending the quarter with 797 stores. New-store productivity continues to exceed expectation. We entered Alaska for the first time during the quarter with new stores in Anchorage and Fairbanks. Both stores opened very strong, and Fairbanks has earned its distinction of achieving the best grand opening sales in ULTA Beauty's history. 
 Tomorrow morning at our quarterly town hall meeting, we'll be celebrating the milestone of opening our 800th store in Ammon, Idaho. Our two 5,000-square-foot stores continue to perform very well, and we intend to add additional small stores next year as we improve systems capabilities and implement space-planning tools to manage assortment and supply chain more efficiently. We're on track to open 100 net new stores this year. 
 For the remainder of the year, we expect to open about 20 stores in the second quarter, about 40 in the third quarter and about 15 in the fourth. As a reminder, about 1/3 of the 2015 program will be in new markets and 2/3 in existing or fill-in markets. 
 Turning to e-commerce. ULTA.com continues to grow rapidly with sales increasing 49.8% contributing 170 basis points to the total company comp. We were successful with digital acquisition efforts during the first quarter driving significantly more unique visitors to the site. At the same time, improvements on our website experience and merchandising strategies drove conversion up 12%. 
 Moving onto our sixth strategic imperative: investing in infrastructure to support our guest experience and growth and capture scale efficiencies. To update you on our supply chain project. We're currently testing our systems and operating model in the new distribution center in Greenwood, Indiana, and proceeding with training programs for new associates to be ready for inventory to begin flowing in next month. We're on track to begin shipping orders for e-commerce customers and fulfilling stores in the third quarter, and I'm pleased with how the team is working to ensure the operational readiness of the building. We plan to wrap up this facility over time to reach its full capacity of 400 stores and 45,000 e-commerce orders per day and be ready to support our holiday sales plan this year for both stores and online. 
 While the supply chain project is currently a major focus of the organization, we're also rolling out other important tools to drive productivity in stores. A task manager application has now been deployed to the entire chain as part of our general managers' conference training activities. The store operations team is now using the system to better manage tasks in store and begin increased visibility on task completion and compliance. The store operations team is working with IT to create additional reporting capabilities that will allow the store teams to optimize guest-facing hours to further improve the guest experience. That completes my update on our strategic imperatives, and now I'll hand it over to Scott. 
Scott Settersten: Thanks, Mary. Good afternoon, everyone. First quarter sales were $868 million compared to $714 million last year, an increase of 21.6%. Comparable sales increased 11.4%. The retail comp was 9.7%. The salon-only comp was 10.3%, and e-commerce growth was 49.8%. The total company comp was driven primarily by traffic strength with transactions up 7.2% and ticket up 4.2%. 
 Similar to recent trends, the ticket increase was driven by a higher average selling price resulting from strong sales in prestige categories and less discounting overall. Retail-only comparable transactions were very healthy, up 6%, and e-commerce growth was driven by both increased traffic and conversion. 
 Gross profit dollars were up 23.3% to $303.2 million, and gross profit margin leveraged 40 basis points to 34.9% from 34.5% last year. Gross profit benefited from strong retail margins resulting from a strong mix of prestige products, lapping the loyalty program conversion that took place in February of 2014 and modest leverage on fixed store costs. ULTA.com's margin rate improved year-over-year due in part to an improved product mix with many more brands of professional haircare products that we offer in-store now available on our website. 
 SG&A expense increased 18.5% to $192.5 million, down 60 basis points as a percentage of sales to 22.2% versus 22.8% last year. The key drivers of this improvement were marketing and store payroll leverage on better-than-expected sales as well as the shift in timing of marketing expense. As Mary mentioned, we are capturing efficiencies in marketing spend that we plan to redeploy later in the year to drive greater brand awareness. We anticipate marketing expense as a percentage of sales will be flat for the full year compared to 2014. 
 Preopening expense was $3.1 million compared to $2.6 million last year driven by 24 store openings and one relocation during the quarter compared to 21 new stores opened during Q1 2014. Operating income increased 33% to $107.6 million. Operating margin was up 110 basis points versus last year at 12.4%. Our tax rate was 38% versus 38.4% last year driven primarily by the impact of accounting for equity compensation transactions. Net income increased 34% to $66.9 million or $1.04 per diluted share versus $50 million or $0.77 per diluted share last year. 
 Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. Inventories were $662.9 million at the end of the quarter compared to $531.4 million at the end of Q1 2014, up 8.9% on a per-store basis. The increase is primarily driven by a focus on maintaining strong in-stock levels for A&B [ph] SKUs in light of our sales momentum along with the addition of new brands and the Clinique and Lancôme boutiques rolling out this year. 
 Capital expenditures were $56.6 million for the quarter driven by our new-store opening program, merchandise fixtures, supply chain investments, and systems. We plan to spend about $300 million in CapEx this year. 
 Depreciation and amortization for the first quarter were $38 million and are expected to be $170 million for the full year. We generated about $12 million of free cash flow in the first quarter and ended Q1 with $536 million of cash and short-term investments. The company repurchased approximately 192,000 shares at a cost of $28 million during the quarter under our 10b5-1 plan as part of our program to return cash to shareholders. As of the end of the quarter, $332 million remained available under the $400 million share-repurchase program. We expect to continue to offset dilution with our 10b5-1 plan and still have the flexibility to repurchase opportunistically beyond that. 
 Turning now to guidance for 2015. In terms of our outlook for the full year, based on our strong performance in the first quarter, we are raising our sales and earnings expectations for the year. We expect to open 100 stores and remodel 4 stores; grow e-commerce sales in the 40% range; drive comparable sales in the 7% to 9% range; and deliver earnings per share growth at the high end of our previous guidance range of 15% to 17% from the $3.96 of adjusted EPS we delivered in 2014, which excludes the $0.02 nonrecurring tax benefit in Q4 of 2014. This guidance includes planned supply chain and systems investments and assumes we continue to repurchase shares to offset dilution. 
 Some of you may be wondering why we are not raising guidance more significantly for the year in light of the strength of our Q1 results. We mentioned at the beginning of the year that you should expect a bit more variability in our quarterly earnings performance due to the timing of investments like our supply chain project, the addition of prestige boutiques, and marketing and advertising. As a result, we expect to see our softest earnings growth in the third and fourth quarters this year. 
 We feel very good about the strong sales momentum in our business. At the same time, some of the earnings upside we saw in the first quarter was related to timing of marketing expense that we now plan to deploy in the second half of the year. We also are now planning to pull forward some of the supply chain headcount investments originally planned for next year into the back half of this year with the goal of realizing the benefits from some of our new system investments sooner than originally planned. Also, we believe it is prudent to maintain a fairly conservative view of the year until we are past one of our most significant operational milestones maybe in the history of the company, which is the opening and start-up of our newest distribution center in Greenwood just outside of Indianapolis. As a reminder, the Indy DC is twice the size of any of our current DCs and will have all new systems and processes. Once the Indy DC is operational, we expect to begin shipping to a handful of stores in early August. We'll reassess the status of the project and, of course, overall business performance, and we'll plan to update our guidance for the second half of the year at that point if appropriate. 
 Currently for the year, we expect deleverage on the gross profit line and modest leverage on the SG&A line, and operating margin is expected to be about flat. As a reminder, much of the investment related to our supply chain project will hit gross profit, including higher depreciation expense. We expect our tax rate to be approximately 38%. We expect to spend capital in the $300 million range and to generate free cash flow similar to last year's performance. 
 In summary, we're very pleased to bring up our annual comp guidance and our earnings outlook with the expectation to deliver high-teens earnings growth while making significant investments in the business to support sustainable long-term growth and shareholder value. In the short term, the current quarter is also shaping up to deliver strong performance. In terms of specific guidance for the second quarter, we expect sales to be in the range of $854 million to $868 million compared to $734.2 million last year. We anticipate achieving comparable sales increase in the range of 7% to 9% versus 9.6% last year. We expect to open 20 stores in the second quarter versus 19 stores opened in Q2 last year, so preopening expense is expected to be relatively flat. Earnings per share are expected to be in the range of $1.07 to $1.12 versus $0.94 for Q2 of 2014. We anticipate a tax rate of 37.6% and a fully diluted share count of approximately 64.3 million. With that, I'll turn the call over to our conference call host to begin the Q&A session. Operator? 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Ike Boruchow with Sterne Agee. 
Irwin Boruchow: I guess, Mary, you've talked pretty extensively about new-customer acquisition and conversion since you joined the company, and it does really look like your strategies are bearing fruit given the traffic numbers you just put up again. But are there any metrics you can maybe share with us on the quarter that could better illustrate the improvements you're seeing, maybe nonloyalty sales or traffic versus loyalty, or conversion rates of new customers into loyalty? Anything like that would be very helpful. 
Mary Dillon: Yes. Well, thank you. We're actually very pleased to see the progress. And as we've said in our 5-year plan that we saw lots of opportunity for us to drive growth for ULTA over time by acquiring new guests and having more loyalty from our existing guests. And that is exactly how it's playing out. In terms of specifics, Dave Kimbell is here as well. Would you like to add a couple points to Ike's question. 
David Kimbell: Sure. There's a lot of things that we think are driving the improvement in traffic and which is obviously contributing to our overall growth, and we look at a few main things. One, we're really happy with the continued advancements in our overall assortment adding a lot of new products, exclusive products, and most if not all of our biggest, most important brand partners are bringing great news that it's driving excitement and wealth among our members. Our loyalty program, Mary mentioned, we grew that over 17%, which is an increasing rate versus last year to 15.5 million. And that was a very important part of our overall growth. And that -- a couple of things we think drove that. We did do, we think, a better job getting nonmembers into the store. But importantly, we converted them in-store into members at a higher rate than in the past. But also contributing to that was an increase in retention. I don't think we shared specifics around retention rates in the past, but we're very pleased with what we're seeing around retention overall. And then the other kind of components of traffic overall. Our marketing, we believe, is improving, and its efficiency and effectiveness in driving traffic into store, both the traditional vehicles that we've had as well as adding new vehicles like radio. And then finally, the services component. We've seen strong growth across all elements of services, which naturally drives traffic on the hair side and then importantly as well, a lot of growth in Brows with our partnership with Benefit. So across the board, a lot of things driving new guests and traffic into our stores. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. 
Simeon Gutman: I don't know if it was mentioned, store performance across age cohorts, and I think the comp number probably speaks for itself. And then connected to that, if you look at the store base in terms of stores in penetrated markets versus stores in new markets, is there anything unexpected in the way that you would've predicted how that performance would look? 
Scott Settersten: Hey, Simeon, overall, when we look at the stack -- the age door stack, I mean, as you alluded to there, when you're producing comps this strong, those older vintage stores are definitely a huge contributor both on the comp line and, even more importantly, on the earnings line, right. Those are very efficient stores for us. And as we look through the stack this quarter, again, those older stores, we say roughly 2005 and older stores are very healthy low to mid-single comps. So they're additive to the comp overall. When we look at -- when we look across geographic regions, we look new stores, old stores, we haven't seen any kind of variability there. I mean, all the stores are generally about the same. When you look at that new-store model, you'd be surprised at how close it is when you look at the overall chain and how strong the performance is in almost every one of the stores. 
Simeon Gutman: Okay, and my follow-up, Scott, you mentioned the DC and being somewhat conservative given where the process is. Can you just shed some light on where exactly you are, anything that's surprising you with, I guess, the weeks now leading up until that DC gets opened? 
Mary Dillon: Yes, let me take that. Actually, we're very pleased with the progress and very confident with the team that we have in place, the approach that we're taking. As I had mentioned earlier, we're going to be doing inbound shipments starting next month, and everything is on track. We feel confident about our readiness. But we are taking a somewhat prudent approach because, as Scott said, it's a complex new building for us that's larger, double the size of our other DCs and new systems. But we've got contingency plans in place if things aren't perfectly running. But we feel very confident with how it's proceeding so far. So everything's on track. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Daniel Hofkin with William Blair. 
Daniel Hofkin: Just a little bit of a follow-up on the -- kind of the performance. Are you seeing any change in sort of the cadence of new product coming out of the vendors or, let's say, the broader beauty space? Or would you attribute, sounds like obviously, quite a number of your initiatives are really gaining traction. Just curious how you would -- whether you would attribute anything to, let's say, a better product flow? That's my first question. And then I have a quick follow-up. 
Mary Dillon: Yes, I think Dave answered it well. It's really, I'd say, a combination of factors. We feel very good about the brands that we offer, the new products that we've launched. This -- the beauty industry is healthy, vibrant, and there's lots of innovation and new product launches either within existing brands or new brands. But really, for us, the results are a combination of not just what we offer but everything we're bringing to market in terms of how we're creating demand in differentiating the ULTA proposition and using our tools to efficiently and effectively drive awareness and drive traffic. So I think it's really all those things together that we feel are helping to drive our growth. 
Daniel Hofkin: So I guess, fair to say it's not that there's necessarily been acceleration on the broader industry growth rate or even within certain categories. It's more kind of what's going on in your stores and on your website and how you're conveying it. 
Mary Dillon: Yes. I mean, I think everybody knows that the general trends in beauty are positive. So prestige is doing pretty well, high-single-digit growth, and mass is up as well. The industry is healthy and growing. But it's really -- we're, I think, benefiting from the fact that we are this all things beauty all in one place. So what we have is a proposition that nobody else offers. And so it also insulates us if there's any segments that aren't performing as well. But again, I'd say it's a combination of what we're experiencing what others are in beauty, but we're gaining share across every category because I think the results show that we have something differentiated that's appealing to our guests. 
Daniel Hofkin: That's great. And then just a quick follow-up on the marketing. So it sounds like it's not a delay in planned spend. It's that you're seeing greater efficiency that kind of, let's say, freed up some spending in the quarter and allows you to redeploy it later. Is that a fair way to characterize it? 
Scott Settersten: Directionally, Dan. There's a couple things that play here. Part of it is what I call a deferral, right, of a spend. Some that we had planned earlier in the year. So some of that moved back in the year. Some of it is efficiencies that we're capturing that were unplanned that we captured during the first quarter. We were able to toggle back a little bit,  and we're saving that as dry powder for later in the year as well for some broader brand building kind of things. So there's a couple elements at work. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Aram Rubinson with Wolfe Research. 
Aram Rubinson: There are a lot of competitors taking aim at the beauty space, whether it's the drugstores, some of the department stores, et cetera. The only one that seems to be pulling back in terms of space allocation at the margin is yourself, i.e., taking the space growth down from over 20% to about 14%. So my question is 2 things. Number one, do you think that's actually benefited your comps by pulling back on the space such that maybe your brand had a certain amount of growth ahead and now it's just kind of being split amongst fewer stores and, therefore, adding to comps? And then second, do you think it's also helping in terms of focus? So by refocusing the organization, do you think that's slowing the pace of growth, in hindsight, has actually helped the comp? 
Mary Dillon: So we're talking about store growth, right. First of all, thank you for the question. Yes, the rate of store growth that we laid out in our plan, we think, is aggressive and appropriate for our stores, 100 stores a year over the next 5 years. And yes, we had a year with 125 and that, as we said, was kind of a peak year. And 100 a year is very manageable for us and we think still quite aggressive in the marketplace. So we are all systems full steam ahead as it relates to our getting to scale and growing our proposition, and we certainly know that this is a competitive industry. It's been for a long time, and it will continue to be. But again, I would say that our pace of growth, we think, is appropriate, and our market share gains -- and our comp gains, I think, really demonstrate that what we're offering as a proposition is differentiated and appealing in the industry. 
Aram Rubinson: And so would you say that it's true or not true that by throttling back on the pace of growth, you've refocused the company on comp growth, and therefore, that in turn has been a benefit to comps by throttling back the new-store growth rate? 
Mary Dillon: You might give me credit for that. I like it. But honestly, I would -- the way I'd say that is I wouldn't really consider it so much a throttle back because 100 stores a year is still pretty aggressive growth rate, albeit less than 125. Having said that, you're absolutely right that what I'm doing with focusing myself and my team down is doing 2 things at once, which is growing our store presence as well as making sure that we tend to same-store growth at every single store that we have and driving growth, whether it's an older store and, certainly, newer stores, our expectation, given that really frankly, small share that we have in the marketplace today is that we ought to be able to drive growth across all of our fleet, and that's why we've been investing in learning about how do we evolve our marketing mix, such that it's not just marketing to existing guests but really attracting new guests. And that's part of what's allowed us to be able to do both new store growth as well as comp growth. 
Aram Rubinson: And since I'll qualify that as a clarification, my follow-up would be, it seems from looking at your purchases of inventory going into this first quarter that you've been leaning into inventory pretty hard. You're still leaning into inventory it looks like from our calculations going into the second quarter. But my question is, can you give us an example like a realized example of say, hey, 21 Days of Beauty, we've kind of done this and carried it differently this year than last year, so we can kind of crystallize that thought? 
Scott Settersten: Yes. I don't think there's any one specific category or SKU or anything I would talk to. I mean, again, Aram, we've talked a bit about systems, right, and how we're kind of lagging behind. So a lot of our inventory buys and trying to talk with our vendors to try to get better flow to our network is really manual. And it's more of a hatchet approach than a scalpel. And that's really what the systems investments are going to allow us to progress to at some point here in the near future. So we're just really trying to go along on the hottest A&B [ph] SKUs that we have because we know there's no risk there, right. We're going to sell those regardless. So that's a part of the inventory growth you're seeing. You're also seeing we have to buy ahead on the boutiques, right. And again, it takes a while for those to get up into scale within the store so we're heavier there. We've got additional safety stocks. We're putting in a brand-new DC, again, that's twice the size of any existing facility. So it's going to take a while for that to work its way out. Again, if I look at the full year, I would expect the inventory per door to be below the comp, comfortably below the comp by the time we cycle through to the end of the year. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Rupesh Parikh with Oppenheimer and Co. 
Rupesh Parikh: I had a question just on e-commerce. So we're seeing again strong performance in your e-commerce business. Are you seeing anything different from a consumer behavior perspective versus some of your recent quarters? 
David Kimbell: No. I wouldn't say anything different. I think we're really pleased with how we continue to evolve our e-commerce proposition. There are a lot of things we think that have contributed to that growth. We've made investments in improving the site experience through either different ways of communicating trends and merchandising our products and content, beauty destination, other social media tactics, a lot of investments in there to try to drive engagement. Our new items are perhaps a key driver. If there was one shift, as we've added and particularly in our professional hairline, we added some significant new variance in the first quarter, and those are already starting to change the mix a little bit. So we've probably attracted some new guests there that we haven't had in the past. But I think overall, it's around [ph] to continue to optimize our traffic through stronger acquisition and converting them to a stronger site performance, and that's continuing into the first quarter. 
Rupesh Parikh: And then maybe just follow-up again, on e-commerce. We hear a lot about brick-and-mortar returns just becoming more aggressive in-store. Are you guys seeing anything different or anything -- any significant changes on the e-commerce front from some of your competitors? 
David Kimbell: Anything different than what they're doing as far as... 
Rupesh Parikh: Yes, or anything that they can change in the competitive landscape online? 
David Kimbell: It is like the entire industry, right, beauty's a pretty competitive space. There's a lot going on within that space. I think what we're focused on is continuing to evolve and make sure that we're delivering the comprehensive omni-channel experience. What Mary mentioned a few of the things, a few of the key initiatives that we have that touch our guests both in-store and online, and there's -- a lot that we're doing. I think fulfillment is the key component of it, speed and fulfillment. And that's a big focus for us. Our DC and supply chain investments will allow us to get even better than that -- better at that. We're investing -- we're partnering with Google on some programs in a few markets, in 5 markets across the country for same-day delivery. So there's a lot of competition, but there's a lot that we're doing to try to evolve our proposition to make sure that it remains quite strong and attractive to our guests. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Simeon Siegel with Nomura Securities. 
Simeon Siegel: So just a follow-up on that. If you look at e-commerce strength, are you finding the growth driven more by omni-channel customers? Or is that online-only shoppers? And then, can you talk about the opportunity or the progress in converting the loyalty members into online shoppers? 
David Kimbell: Yes. Definitely, the growth is with our omni-channel guests. By far, those guests are significantly higher than online-only guests. So what we're finding is as we grow our in-store member profile, we're successfully converting them to online, which is exactly what we want to do. We want to serve her wherever she wants to be served and get her buying online then coming back in store. So that's a big part of that overall profile. And we're ultimately very pleased with the profile of that guest, how frequently she's coming back, the retention online, and we'll continue to drive those tactics to have her shop in both channels and use our services as well. 
Simeon Siegel: Okay, thanks. And then just what is the average ticket online versus stores at this point? 
Scott Settersten: Rough numbers, it's 40 -- low 40s in-store and low 60s online. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Joe Altobello with Raymond James. 
Joseph Altobello: First question, I guess, is a housekeeping one for Scott. Could you quantify how much marketing was deferred out of the first quarter? And how much you contributed to the upside on the bottom line? And maybe where those dollars are going to be going to in the second half, specifically? Is it going to be broad-based across your advertising? Or is one particular mode going to get most of that? 
Scott Settersten: Yes, Joe. I'm not going to quantify what the savings benefit was in the first quarter. I guess I would just point -- I would say that most of it is going to shift to the back half of the year. And again, we haven't made specific decisions on when we're going to deploy that. It kind of depends on how the business is performing, what we see competitors doing and what we think is most appropriate for the long term. So we had planned going into this year to do some investing for the long term, right. The more brand awareness things. So that is in the plan. And we've got some dry powder now that we identified in the first quarter that we're going to add, right, to the arsenal, potentially, if we think there's a need to use it. 
Joseph Altobello: Okay, got you. And then secondly, in terms of the drag that you guys had anticipated this year and next year from supply chain and systems investment. I think, and correct me if I'm wrong, it was about 500 basis points in both years, and it sounds like you're going to be accelerating some of that spending into this year. So how do we think about that cadence for this year and next? Is it more like 700 basis point drag this year on EPS growth and maybe 300 next year? 
Scott Settersten: Yes. I'm not going to be able to get into that level of detail with you, Joe. But I will tell you that we, the management team and the board, spends a lot of time talking about our guidance policies, how much and how often. And we've been talking to investors that the quarters are going to be more variable, more lumpy as we get into some of these investments with our supply chain in other parts of the business. So I'm not going to get into this kind of detail every quarter, but seeing this as kind of the first time and we're coming up, right. We're 1 quarter out here on the supply chain being turned on. Let me give you a little bit more color on the back half of the year. So if you look at EPS consensus for third and fourth quarter, I would say you take it out roughly equal weight out of both quarters from an EPS perspective. I'd say in the third quarter, if you're looking at it more from a P&L line item, you take 80% of it out of the gross profit line and 20% out of the SG&A line. And then for the fourth quarter, you'd allocate equal weight between gross profit and SG&A. 
Joseph Altobello: Okay, great. One last one if I could. In terms of the gross margin upside. The comp number, obviously, was pretty eye-popping, but the other upside to drive the gross margin, you had a similar comp last quarter when gross margin was down. But it seemed like the one differentiating factor this quarter was you did anniversary the loyalty conversion from last year. Was that a big driver? Or was there something else that was driving that? 
Scott Settersten: No. I mean, there was again -- there was kind of a mix of elements that benefited us during the quarter. So loyalty, right, wasn't as much of a drag as it was 1 year ago. It was roughly 20 basis points last year. We had e-commerce, margin expansion. We had the professional haircare assortment we added in the first quarter. That helped the mix overall. But we also continued to see healthy expansion in the core retail merchandise margins as well. So all good news from the core of the business. Unfortunately, when you look in the back half of the year, some of that's going to be covered up, right, with some of the deleverage we're going to see from some of our supply chain investments. But we're very happy with how the business is performing overall. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Kelly Halsor with Buckingham Research Group. 
Kelly Halsor: Could we dig in a little further around the retail comp growth in the quarter, which was really impressive? There are a number of moving parts there. So could you just parse out for us a little further what the key drivers were, particularly around the impact of new stores entering the comp base? And if you could help us quantify that impact for the overall comp growth? And also, just how you view the product introductions versus your company-specific initiatives and anymore color around the opportunity from a brand or product perspective that gives you confidence that you can continue to deliver a solid comp growth as you lap brand introductions from last year? 
Scott Settersten: Yes, let me start with the overall comps. So again, 7.2% transactions and more than 4% on the ticket side of things. So when you -- from the new-store perspective or the chain itself, I mean, we're getting a lot of benefit from new stores, right. And that's part of the reason when we updated our long-term financial targets for the Street last fall, we pointed to that, right. I mean, we expect to get a nice benefit from all those new stores, 100, 125, 100 a year now, falling into that comp waterfall. So there's a significant amount of the comp goodness that's coming from the very strong performance of our new stores overall. 
Mary Dillon: Yes, so let me just add a couple of other points, which is that our guidance assumes strong level of newness and innovation throughout the year. We increased the strength of the guidance on comp for the rest of the year. In the first quarter, we had some pretty big things to jump over in terms of launches a year ago on IT Cosmetics and IT Brushes. So we're now anniversary-ing those. So we'll be jumping over those, I should say, throughout the rest of the year. So that's just something to keep in mind. As I look forward though in terms of opportunity, first of all, we're always trying for a balance of traffic and ticket. And so we think we're precluding that we can do that. And we -- I feel very optimistic as we look at joint business planning with our vendor partners about their pipeline of news and innovation as well as our own ability to continue to tweak our demand creation capabilities and get more effective and efficient as it relates to how we use -- deploy our marketing spend. So I think the same formula will continue to hold. We think these are strong comps that we're guiding to and feel good about them and optimistic and we believe we'll continue to deliver. 
Kelly Halsor: Okay, great. Thank you for the color there. And Mary, just secondly, there has been a lot of buzz around the contouring trend, which you called out in your remarks. And I believe it has been around as a category for a while. But it seems you've seen steam [ph] over the spring. Have you seen that interest in the category kind of tick up this quarter? And has there been any additional investments in the category by your major brands? And then just lastly, if so, what inning do you think we are in with this trend? Thanks. 
Mary Dillon: The contouring inning question. That's a great question. Contouring is a technique that's been around for ages, really. It's just gotten very popular recently, I think, through the combination of certain celebrities who are famous for it as well as social media. We have certain brands that were big in contouring a while ago. It started -- probably began the trend like Anastasia. But other -- many other new product launches, including our own ULTA Beauty contour palette, that's done quite well. So I don't know. I think we're still in the early innings of contouring, but great thing about beauty is there's just lots of exciting cyclical trends. So Brow is big and is going to continue to be big. We think lip is big. So these things will just continue to cycle in and out. And our job is to really just be on top of it and work with our vendor partners to make sure we're bringing exciting products across all price points, frankly, to our guests, which is something that uniquely is done at ULTA. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Christopher Horvers with JPMorgan Chase. 
Christopher Horvers: So wanted to follow-up on the DC question. So there's a new DC alleviating in-stock issue in the stores and a capacity issue online, such that you think you're actually missing sales, or does the benefit show up from the perspective that it alleviates an operational cost issue from manual processes and higher safety stocks? So just -- really just trying to understand what benefit and how's it show -- how it shows up, particularly as you get into the fourth quarter where the e-commerce business is substantial? 
Mary Dillon: Right. Well, let me just start by saying that our supply chain transformation is really a multiyear approach. It's not just a one-shot thing. So we're opening up the distribution center Indianapolis -- this, in the third quarter. But we plan to do another one next year. The whole goal overall is for us to do a few things which -- and you've hit on some of them, which is continuing to build infrastructure to support our growth have enhanced capabilities and drive efficiencies. So it should really -- we should begin -- we will begin, I shouldn't say should. We will begin to see benefits even this year as it relates to e-commerce in-stocks in stores, but it will be a multiyear benefit to us. And so part of that's going to be increased frequency of delivery to stores, which we're always focused on in-stocks, but we know we can always improve, and that'll help us there. There's other aspects of these new distribution centers that will help our stores in terms of their labor efficiency. For example, store-ready, cartonization, so easier to stock the shelves. Certainly being able to assort in segments better, so that as we have different store formats or seem to even do more customize or localize assortments, we can do that, as well as certainly e-commerce processing time, which is the goal. So all of those are macro goals that will play out over the next several years. 
Christopher Horvers: So as you think about last year, is there a number where you could say, well, our in-stocks in the stores last year were on average x in the fourth quarter, and we felt like we left some amount of sales on the table and, similarly, on the e-commerce side? 
Scott Settersten: Yes, there's not one algorithm, I guess. I mean, we feel naturally that's something that we struggled with in-stocks generally speaking. But it's not just around the DCs. I mean, it's these other systems that we're referring to. We need all of them to kind of work in unison to help us solve some of the in-stock challenges that we just -- that are just embedded in our processes today because a lot of the stuff is manual, right. So we need the DCs there to do -- to help the throughput on the network, right. But we also need forecasting replenishment to help our vendors, manufacture the product in time so we get it in time, right, and help them with their lead times. And then we need some of the floor and space-planning tools to help us get the stores set up right and be able to measure productivity of the inventory. So we need all those things kind of to work together, and that's why it's kind of a multiyear thing. And it's not just about the buildings themselves. So again, once we get all this in place, it's going to take us a little while to get there. But we expect to see big benefits from improved inventory, in-stocks and productivity and working capital improvements and making the stores look more productive by getting them shelf-ready product and all that kind of stuff to make to, again, improve the guest experience across the spectrum, whether it's in the store or the online experience. 
Mary Dillon: And the costs and benefits of everything we just described are built into the 5-year financial targets that we communicated last fall. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Matt McGinley with Evercore ISI. 
Matthew McGinley: My first question is on the e-comm impact on the gross margin. I know that based on shipping and fulfillment costs, the e-comm has historically been dilutive to gross margin, but with the growth that you're seeing in that part of the business, are we getting to the point now where it's either less of a drag or it's going to be margin neutral? Or is that still pretty far off in the future where that would be kind of comparable from a margin standpoint? 
Scott Settersten: Yes. I would say it's less of a headwind, right. So we saw margin expansion in e-commerce business in the first quarter, which we've been telling investors we expect to see that over time as we improve the assortment online, and we did that, demonstrated that with some of the professional haircare things and Lancôme being added online in the first quarter. So that's come to fruition. I mean, there is a structural cost element to that business with the free shipping and some of the infrastructure things that we have to do here in the near term. That would make it very difficult to see it kind of be -- produce margins that are on par with the retail business, which again, our model is so much more mature in that part of the business, right. So again, it's something that we look at critically and analyze on a regular basis. In fact, we work to try to improve, but I doubt that it would ever get to the point that it would be on par. 
Matthew McGinley: My second question is a balance sheet question as it relates to the accrued liabilities. In your accrued liabilities, I think you have about gift cards which I think you guys -- that did pretty well in the fourth quarter and then growth in your loyalty rewards. So my question is how much of that $10 million decline in the accrued liability came from gift cards versus the growth in loyalty? And if it was a substantial decline in gift cards, how much did that impact the comp in the quarter? 
Scott Settersten: Yes. I'm not sure what comparison you're making on the balance sheet exactly -- if you're looking at year end balances or if you're looking at the prior year balance? 
Matthew McGinley: Yes, so year end. You're -- from year end to now, you're down about $10 million. 
Scott Settersten: Yes, I'd say the majority of that is really the incentive comp accrual. So at year end, you got a full provision in there for a year where you overperformed to initial expectations and now in the first quarter, you're kind -- right, you're just building that reserve for the full year. So to your question, the loyalty reserve is higher year-over-year as are the gift card liabilities. 
Matthew McGinley: And then did the gift cards actually help the comp very much in the quarter? Or did it not? 
Scott Settersten: Yes, I mean, it's -- relatively speaking, it's not a huge part of that, the retail of the total comp. But it is beneficial. I mean, we've seen gift card sales up 20% plus year-over-year the first quarter. So it's stronger than the house. And normally, I think most people understand that when those guests come back to shop, they're usually buying more full-priced products, and they're spending more than the value of the gift card they have in their hand. So it's a great story. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Fassler with Goldman Sachs. 
Matthew Fassler: My first question relates to your clienteling effort. If you could go into a bit more detail about what you've seen and what you've learned? It seems like a fairly unique effort for a business with a fairly high frequency of customer visits. So how additive is it -- what are some of the puts and takes that you've taken from your test of this effort? 
Mary Dillon: Yes, this one, Matt, I would say, we're in the early stages of. And we've tested in 30 stores. We've now rolled out to about 30 more. And it -- our associates are very excited about this as they love to serve our guests. And they love any opportunity they can to make it easier to interact and to know her -- the guest sales history or interests or loyalty points. So we saw -- we're getting positive response from our store associates and our guests. But it's pretty early right now to give you the result. But I'm pretty confident that's what we're going to roll out to the chain. Anything we can do to make it easier for our associates to serve our guests is something that we know can be very productive for us. 
Matthew Fassler: Got it. And then secondly, on gross margin. This was, I think, essentially your second-best gross margin showing in 3 years, and I realize that you deferred some of the investment that you thought about later in the year. And you had good things to say about the promotional client that -- which was also different from what we're hearing from other sectors of retailing. So can you talk about the seasonality of promotions? Are promotions really now just a fourth quarter concern, and also, as you move deeper into prestige, does that shield you more from promotional pressure, and then finally, with that in mind, what kind of promotional backdrop are you contemplating in the margin guidance that you give us for the rest of the year? 
Mary Dillon: Let me start with the fact that we always need to understand that we need to provide a great value to our guests. And so in a competitive industry, promotion is always going to be part of it. It certainly, as you know, it's more intense at times of holiday. But we step back and look at how we create a great just value equation for the ULTA guests. And I'd like to think we're getting better every day using our tools to get more efficient and effective by being more personalized and more targeted and less broadscaled in this kind of discount. So first and foremost, as she comes to ULTA, she loves the fact that she can buy product and brands across multiple price points and categories, which is great. And then if she is part of the loyalty program, which is most of our guests right now, she's able to earn points as she uses this currency, essentially, whenever she consolidates more of her purchases at ULTA. And that's a great value. So that wouldn't be necessarily seen as a "discounted" promotion. But it -- to our guests, it certainly behaves that way. And so we think that mosaic of things that drive awareness and brand clarity and demand, as well as discounts that are given to her the way that's very targeted and personalized are going to be part of our equation going forward. Now during more intense holiday periods, certainly like Mother's Day or holiday, that ramps up a bit, and I don't think that'll change necessarily. But we're just trying to break through the clutter by creating more of an emotional connection, being more targeted and personalized, seeing ULTA as a great gift destination and now competing on every front in every single category. And in your question about prestige, I would say the same holds. I mean, for us, the way that we are great value to our guests is that she can use her loyalty points across all categories, and that is something that she values. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Mark Altschwager with Robert W. Baird. 
Mark Altschwager: Mary, you talked about putting greater emphasis, greater focus on exclusive products. But what does the mix of exclusive look like today? How do you see that evolving, and maybe just talk about the puts and takes here as you look to bring more of the prestige brands in-house? 
Mary Dillon: Do you want to take that, Dave? 
David Kimbell: Sure. Yes. The truly exclusive brands are still a relatively small part of our overall business. But the way I guess we think about it is a steady stream of new brands, some of which are exclusive, a great example of that, Mary has mentioned a couple of times, it is our IT Brush line that launched last year. And it continues to be a strong driver for us but also finding other brands that might not be fully exclusive but are -- give us a unique proposition and assortment, Meaningful Beauty is an example of that. Mally cosmetics, other brands that aren't totally exclusive but have limited distribution. We're doing that really across the entire assortment, which is I think one of the reasons we're seeing some success right now. Another example is the Big brand. It isn't new from us, but it isn't sold everywhere. It's mix, and we're seeing nice growth through that. While not exclusive, we're doing a lot of great partnership with them in bringing their brand to life in unique ways in our stores. We're doing that across the portfolio. From mass to Prestige, haircare. Haircare is another example. Take our -- one of our largest brands, Redken, obviously not unique to us but -- and how we did some replanning, reflowing in the first quarter in how we're merchandising that in-store and seeing some nice benefit from it. So for us, it is definitely a mix of bringing new exclusive brands, which we have a track record, and we'll continue to do, and we feel confident in our pipeline of those going forward but also partnering with big established brands across all different categories. And then finally, our ULTA brand is an important part of our overall mix. We're seeing nice growth of that. We launched remaining heavy here into trends. We launched an eyeshadow palette this quarter that performed very well. So we'll see that play a role in our mix going forward into the future as well. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Jason Gere with KeyBanc. 
Jason Gere: Actually, all of my questions have been answered. So I'll just pass on to the next caller. 
Operator: Our next question comes the line of Steph Wissink with Piper Jaffray. 
Stephanie Wissink: Scott, most of my questions have been asked as well but just 2 quick housekeeping. Scott, I think in your prepared remarks, you mentioned Lancôme and Clinique boutique filling out in the back half. Could you just give us an update on the number of stores that will have those boutiques -- how many stores will have both boutique service [ph] of one or the other? And then also, Mary, I think you've given us some great color on prestige versus mass. But I'm just wondering if you'd be willing to give us some mix of brands between those 2 and the mix of revenues just to give us some sense of how they're relating to one another? 
Scott Settersten: Hey, Steph. We're trying to move away from getting too specific with the number of boutiques. We don't really think it's all that helpful to folks. I mean, the fact of the matter is, it's the total offering and assortment that we have in our store that's driving the comp. It's not one brand over another. It's everything working in unison inside the 4 walls. So again, we don't want to get too detailed about the number and in what quarters and what time periods they roll in. 
Mary Dillon: And just to comment on this. We talked about that we had shifted mix up a bit to prestige in the past couple years. Ultimately, for us, the magic is really in maintaining a really robust mix of different categories, brands and price points at ULTA because our guests really value that. She sees it as a savvy move to able to come in and get an exciting product maybe from ULTA Beauty mix or other mass brands as well as mix that in with prestige exciting products that she can get as well. So for us, we don't break out the mix, and also I would just say that we expect that mix to be a mix and continue to be that over time. And that's part of our proposition of all things beauty all in one place. 
Stephanie Wissink: Thanks. That's helpful. Maybe just a follow up then on the boutique side. So with the boutiques rolling out to the back half, how is the economics or how are the economics of those determined with the partner? Is it similar to the other service boutiques that you have? Or is it slightly different on a merchandising strategy? 
Scott Settersten: No. I wouldn't say there's any significant difference. I'm looking at Dave across the table here. I mean, we work very closely as partners in determining, looking at the analysis, making sure that ROIs make sense and determining what locations would work best for the deployment of those boutiques. So it's agreed to in a combination and a partnership between us and the brands. 
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, at this time, I would like to turn the floor back to Mary Dillon for closing comments. 
Mary Dillon: Great. Thank you. I would just like to thank our ULTA Beauty associates for all the great work they've done to start -- deliver a really fantastic start to this year, and thanks to all of you for your interest in ULTA Beauty, and we look forward to talking to you again soon. Thank you. 
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.

===== 2014 Q4  (2015-03-12 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Greetings, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Ulta Beauty Fourth Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. 
 I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Ms. Laurel Lefebvre. Thank you, Laurel, you may begin.

We make references during this call to the metric free cash flow, a non-GAAP financial measure defined as cash provided by operating activities, minus purchases of property and equipment. 
 I'll now turn the call over to Mary. 
Mary Dillon: Thank you, Laurel. Good afternoon, everyone. Ulta wrapped up a very strong year of sales and profit growth, excellent performance in the fourth quarter. The whole Ulta team and I are very proud to celebrate that this is our first $1 billion sales quarter.
 To review the numbers. Sales grew 20.7%, and we delivered an 11.1% total company comp on top of the 9.2% comp in the fourth quarter of 2013. Our best comp of the year was driven by our strongest traffic growth of the year, while average ticket also contributed nicely to the overall results. The key drivers of our performance were continued strength in prestige and mass color cosmetics, a successful holiday selling season, execution of more effective marketing and CRM strategies, double-digit comps in our salon business and 55% comp sales growth in e-commerce. Earnings per share were up 24% to $1.35 compared to $1.09 last year. Scott will cover the details of our financial results for the fourth quarter, as well as our guidance for fiscal 2015 in the current quarter in just a few moments. But first, I'd like to provide an update on our 6 strategic imperatives. This is the long-term strategic framework we developed last year designed to deliver continued market share gains and strong, sustainable sales and earnings growth.
 The first imperative is to acquire new guests and deepen loyalty with existing guests. Our loyalty program in growing CRM capabilities continue to be highly effective tools to increase loyalty and grow our share of wallet with our members. As of the end of the fourth quarter, our ULTAmate Rewards program has grown to reach 15 million active members. Having all of our guests at a single platform for almost all of 2014 delivered significant benefits to us. Customer reaction has been overwhelmingly positive. Sales from loyalty members increased about 6% in 2014, driven by both higher purchase frequency and higher spend per transaction. We also saw a healthy increase in member retention last year. And finally, we were successful in targeting less engaged segments of our loyalty customer base with specific offers to reengage those customers.
 While we are delighted to acquire millions of new loyalty members last year, we believe there are a lot more beauty enthusiasts out there waiting to discover Ulta. So increasing brand awareness is a continued opportunity for us. We were encouraged by the results of our TV advertising test in select markets last fall where we saw comps increased versus the control group as well as an increase in new member sign-ups. Message testing demonstrated that our campaign was relevant and memorable. We also launched a national holiday radio campaign, which reached millions of prospective new guests and resulted in a strong consumer recall. We also heightened our focus on earned media, with outreach to long lead publications and beauty bloggers to increase awareness of our holiday offering.
 As a result of these efforts, aided awareness of Ulta jumped up 7 points year-over-year. Looking ahead, we expect to implement radio, TV and digital advertising campaigns in conjunction with various promotional events throughout the year. We plan to fund these brand awareness building activities by reducing Sunday newspaper inserts and other print vehicles, as well as through our ongoing efforts to reduce our reliance on broad price discounting in favor of more targeted marketing activities.
 During the fourth quarter, we experimented with CRM offers focused on acquiring new customers in our salon business. Fewer than 7% of our active loyalty members are salon customers, which provides us with a great opportunity to mine our loyalty customer base. In fact, we were able to acquire thousands of new salon customers by testing various offers and marketing channels with targeted customer segments. We believe our focus on new customer acquisition, in conjunction with an elevated presentation of our salon business and direct mail pieces and in our website, contributed to a significant increase in new salon guest count and an acceleration in our salon sales performance. Our second strategic imperative is to differentiate by delivering a distinctive and personalized guest experience across all channels. Investments in in-store technology provide solutions that help our store associates to be even more effective. We've tested and are now rolling out to the entire chain a test management solution and an inventory management application, both delivered on mobile devices. These tools are designed to optimize productivity and create efficiencies for our store associates which, importantly, will allow them to spend more time assisting our guests. We're also leveraging in-store technology to support a more personalized guest experience with our new clienteling app which is currently being piloted in 30 stores. The app will replace the paper-based consultation process and enables store associates to interact with guests on the floor in a number of ways that were previously only possible at point of sale. Associates who use the app to sign up guests for ULTAmate Rewards can review point balances and past purchases and create guest profiles with their preferences and interests in order to better recommend products.
 We're also implementing the learnings from our recent payroll test-and-learn initiative to enhance the guest experience. We continue to study the impact of adding additional labor hours to create more guest-facing time in various types of stores and in different areas of the store. And we're planning to implement additional hours in another 60 stores this year. We expect this additional labor expense to be self-funding through higher sales and conversion.
 The third strategic imperative is offering relevant, innovative and often exclusive products that excite our guests. While we continue to see great customer response to our recent launches like IT cosmetics and our exclusive IT Brushes, there was strong news and innovation throughout the Prestige Cosmetics assortment. During the fourth quarter, we partnered with bareMinerals to ensure a successful launch of their new product, Complexion Rescue. Urban Decay, Benefit, Anastasia, Tarte and Too Faced were top-performing brands, featuring lots of newness, such as Anastasia's blockbuster contouring palette and Urban Decay's limited edition Naked on the Run palette. Clinique and Lancôme brands were also very strong. Following on the success of our Clinique and Lancôme boutiques, we're continuing to partner with both of these great brands and are rolling out additional boutiques throughout 2015. We're also excited to expand the number of stores offering Clarins skin care products after launching in a small number of stores and online in the third quarter.
 Another standout was the mass cosmetics category. Here, we achieved growth well above the industry and delivered double-digit comps. Brands like NYX and the overall lip category drove the performance. Now we also had a strong holiday selling season where we increased focus on Ulta as a great gifting destination. The categories of personal care appliances, fragrance and bath, all performed very well. In addition to the strong holiday product assortment and offers, we invested at customer-facing payroll and inventory on our most popular items to enhance the guest experience.
 Another highlight of our holiday season was the significant lift in sales with Ulta gift cards. We created new designs, utilized more display locations and boosted the presence of gift cards in direct mail, e-mails, our website and social media. This focus drove strong sales performance and redemptions contributed to our sales momentum post-holiday. Professional hair care also performed well in the quarter, driven by customer engagement with our semiannual leader event, featuring compelling prices on jumbo sizes of professional hair care products. In January, following the success of our newly branded Happy, Healthy Hair starts at Ulta, we launched a new campaign for skin called Glowing Gorgeous Skin starts at Ulta. Our goal was to distinguish Ulta as a skin care authority by delivering a cohesive guest experience and programming 21 days of daily events, featuring new products from our top skin care brands, including new high-tech tools featured on skin rejuvenation.
 Next, our fourth strategic imperative, delivering exceptional services in 3 core areas: hair, skin health and brows. Our salon business grew 20.9% and comped 11% for the quarter, contributing 10 basis points to the retail comp. Our best categories were cut and color, blowouts and makeup application services. Our online appointment booking capability has been ramping nicely since launching last summer. We booked 53,000 appointments online in the fourth quarter and 75% of those were new salon guests.
 We leveraged our storewide skin event in January to take advantage of the biggest month of skin care sales in the industry. We highlighted Dermalogica skin services with special offers and gifts with purchase. Our newest skin service, Dermalogica's Power Resurfacing Peel, has exceeded expectations since it launched.
 To update you on our brow services offering, we finished the year with almost 600 Benefit Brow boutiques. Nearly 400 stores are now also performing brow tinting services. These boutiques continue to perform extremely well with both products and services.
 Turning to our fifth strategic imperative, growing stores in e-commerce to reach and serve more guests. Let's start with stores. We opened 10 stores during the quarter and closed 1, ending the year with 774 stores, increasing total square footage by about 14% for the year. New store productivity remains very strong and the class of 2014 stores handily exceeded expectations. We're very pleased with the 2 small stores we opened last fall, which are beating their sales plan and generating store level earnings higher than what we modeled to earn a strong return on investment. We continue to evaluate performance and guest behavior to gain operational insight and to prepare for the scalability of this format. We expect to open more small store format stores over time and, in the meantime, we remain focused on opening 10,000 square-foot stores.
 Looking ahead to our real estate program for 2015. We're on track to open approximately 100 new stores this year and are seeing plenty of availability of high-quality real estate sites. In terms of the pace of store openings this year, we'll open about 20 in both the first and second quarters, about 45 in the third quarter and about 15 in the fourth. Possibly 1/3 of the 2015 program will be in new markets and 2/3 in existing or fill-in markets.
 Turning to e-commerce. Ulta.com's growth of 55.2% contributed 230 basis points to the total company comp. E-commerce represented 4.6% of total company sales in 2014, on our way to our goal of growing to 10% of our business for the next 5 years. We believe ulta.com's impressive growth was primarily a result of higher customer engagement, driven by more relevant content and offers. This was evidenced by higher open-click and conversion rates for our promotional e-mails, which drove sales productivity far above the increase in the number of e-mails we sent. From a product perspective, the Prestige Cosmetics category remains very strong online. We also drove excellent growth in professional hair care and mass cosmetics by adding new brands in pro hair and elevating Ulta brand products on the website. While the ulta.com team had a great year in 2014, we're excited about the continued growth potential as we make strides in offering an even more compelling assortment online. In early February, we launched key professional hair care brands on our website, including Redken, Pureology and Matrix, previously only available in-store. And just last week, we began selling Lancôme on our website, a significant step-forward for our Prestige assortment.
 Moving onto our sixth strategic imperative. Investing in infrastructure to support our guest experience and growth and catch for scale efficiencies. Throughout our organization, planning and ensuring the successful execution of our supply chain transformation is a top priority. The new distribution center in Greenwood, Indiana, is right on track to begin to fulfill demand in the third quarter of this year. The building has all new systems and a new operating model and is designed to ramp up to provide capacity for more than 100 stores and significant e-commerce volume by next holiday season. This will be very important going forward as we know we can drive tremendous demand on ulta.com during the Black Friday, Cyber Monday weekend. In December, we stretched our ability to deliver a consistent guest experience since our speed to fulfill orders was constrained by our supply chain capabilities during this very busy time of the year. We expect to make significant progress on fulfillment speed next holiday season as we ramp up our Greenwich facility. We also recently selected a location for our next distribution center in the Southwest. This facility will be in the Dallas market and we plan to open it in the second half of 2016.
 That wraps up my update on our strategic imperatives. Before I turn it over to Scott, I'd like to announce some changes to our leadership team. Janet Taake, Chief Merchandising Officer, has decided to retire after a phenomenal 6-year career at Ulta Beauty. During Janet's tenure, she oversaw a dramatic evolution of our merchandise offering. She and her team added more than 100 major new brands to our assortment, developed our current store format, which significantly increased the presence of Prestige brands in our mix and bought tremendous discipline to the merchandise function. Janet and her team have developed excellent relationships with our vendors and established Ulta in the marketplace as a collaborative, entrepreneurial and highly ethical business partner. We're all extremely grateful for Janet's many contributions to our success and she will surely be missed by me and the entire organization. She's agreed to stay with us through May 1 to ensure a smooth transition. This change gives us an opportunity to create an integrated merchandising and marketing team structure by organizing these functions under one leader. Dave Kimbell, previously Chief Marketing Officer, will now lead merchandising in addition to his current responsibilities over marketing, CRM, loyalty and e-commerce in the newly created role of Chief Merchandising and Marketing Officer. Prior to joining Ulta, in his previous role at U.S. cellular, Dave was responsible for all aspects of marketing and merchandising, including pricing, better negotiations, promotions and inventory. In addition, he spent several years on the vendor side of CPG at Procter and Gamble and PepsiCo, where he gained extensive experience in maximizing retailer and vendor partnerships. I believe this new structure will bring many benefits that will help drive Ulta's continued growth. With the seamless breaking of product assortment, promotions, marketing communications, e-commerce and store design, the guest experience can become even more distinctive and powerful. Now 2 of our most respected and experienced senior merchants, Tara Simon and Julie Tomasi, have been promoted to Senior Vice Presidents, both reporting to Dave. Tara has been with Ulta for 3 years as Vice President of Merchandising, managing the Prestige Cosmetics category. In addition to her new role, Tara's responsibilities will expand to include Prestige skin care, fragrance and trend development. Julie has been with Ulta for 5 years, most recently as Vice President of Merchandising, managing the professional hair care, professional nail and personal care appliances categories. In her new role, Julie's responsibilities will expand to include all of the mass merchandising categories, private label and pricing. We are very fortunate to have these strong leaders on the team to take on increased responsibilities and enable the creation of a structure that will further strengthen the organization and drive continued success for Ulta. 
 So with that, I'll hand it over to Scott. 
Scott Settersten: Thanks, Mary. Good afternoon, everyone. Fourth quarter sales were $1.048 billion compared to $868 million last year, an increase of 20.7%. Comparable sales increased 11.1%. The retail comp, including salon, was 8.8%. The total company comp was driven by a healthy combination of transaction and ticket, with transactions up 7.7% and ticket up 3.4%. The ticket increase was driven by increases in average selling price, driven by strong sales of Prestige categories and less discounting overall. Retail-only comparable transactions were very strong, up 5.7%. Gross profit dollars were up 19.1% to $349.7 million, and gross profit margin decreased 40 basis points to 33.4% from 33.8% last year. There were 2 primary drivers of this decline: increased cost associated with the ULTAmate Rewards loyalty program and the impact of e-commerce margin. We have previously discussed with you all of the great benefits associated with our loyalty program, and importantly, since early 2014, having all of our guests on the same loyalty platform. But as expected, while it drives more sales and gross margin dollars, it is a bit more expensive on a rate basis, since guests are much more engaged in the program and take advantage of the benefits to a higher degree than the previous certificate program. We have now anniversary-ed the loyalty program conversion that took place in February of 2014, so we don't expect to experience this level of rate pressure going forward.
 On the e-commerce side. The deleverage comes from ulta.com's lower margins due to product mix, less efficient supply chain capabilities and shipping costs. Offsetting this mix impact were improved retail product margins, reflecting reduced reliance on price discounting and modest leverage on rent expense. SG&A expense increased 18.6% to $210.7 million, down 40 basis points as a percentage of sales to 20.1% versus 20.5% last year. The key drivers of this improvement were payroll and marketing leverage on stronger-than-expected sales, offset by investments in people to drive our strategic initiatives, as well as increased appreciation of IT systems. Pre-opening expense was $1.6 million compared to $1.8 million last year, driven by 10 store openings during the quarter compared to 11 new stores opened during Q4 2013. Operating income increased 20.4% to $137.5 million. Operating margin was flat to last year at 13.1%. Interest income was $231,000 net of credit facility fees. Our line of credit remains undrawn. Our tax rate of 36.6% included about $0.02 of earnings per share benefit related to a nonrecurring deferred tax adjustment. Net income increased 23.5% to $87.3 million or $1.35 per diluted share versus $70.7 million or $1.09 per diluted share last year. Excluding the nonrecurring tax benefit, net income increased 21.6% to $86 million and earnings per share increased 22%.
 Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. Inventories were $581.2 million at the end of the quarter compared to $457.9 million at the end of Q4 2013, up 10.7% on a per-store basis. We have been fairly aggressive in investing in our highest velocity SKUs to keep up with the strong demand we're experiencing. We're pleased with the quality of our inventory coming out of holiday. And thus far, we have not seen any material impact from the West Coast port issues. We continue to stay close to our vendors to assess and mitigate any potential impact down the road.
 Capital expenditures were $76.6 million for the quarter, driven by our new store opening program, supply chain investments and systems. We spent $249 million in capital for the full year, slightly lower than planned. About 45% of our 2014 capital spend was for new stores, remodels and relocations. About 15% was for merchandising, store maintenance and other capital. The remaining 40% was for supply chain, systems and e-commerce investments.
 Depreciation and amortization for the fourth quarter were $35.7 million and $131.8 million for the full year. We generated about $148 million of free cash flow for the year and ended the year with $539 million of cash and short-term investments. The company repurchased approximately 235,000 shares at a cost of $30 million during the quarter under our 10b5-1 plan as part of our program to return cash to shareholders. We spent about $40 million on share repurchases in 2014 since implementing our plan in September last year. Effective March 17, our board has approved an increased authorization for our current repurchase plan, adding $100 million to our existing $300 million share repurchase authorization put in place last year. We expect to continue to offset dilution with our 10b5-1 plan and still have the flexibility to repurchase opportunistically beyond that.
 Turning now to our guidance for 2015. In terms of our outlook for the full year, we expect to achieve results in line with our long-term guidance provided last fall, updated from the new 2014 baseline reflecting our earnings upside in the back half of the year. More specifically, we expect to open 100 stores in 2015 and remodel 4 stores; grow e-commerce sales in the 40% range; drive comparable sales in the 6% to 8% range; and deliver earnings per share growth in the range of 15% to 17% from the $3.96 of adjusted EPS we delivered in 2014, which excludes the $0.02 nonrecurring tax benefit in Q4. This guidance includes planned supply chain and systems investments and assumes we continue to repurchase shares to offset dilution. We expect deleverage on the gross profit line and modest leverage on the SG&A line. And operating margins are expected to remain about flat. Our tax rate is expected to be approximately 38%. We expect a bit more variability in our quarterly earnings performance due to the timing of our supply chain investments, the addition of Prestige boutiques and the fact that we will be comping over some very successful product launches in the second and third quarters of 2014.
 As a result, we expect stronger performance in the first and fourth quarters and somewhat softer earnings performance in the second and third quarters. We expect CapEx to be in the $300 million range and to generate free cash flow similar to our 2014 performance.
 In terms of specific guidance for Q1 2015, we expect sales to be in the range of $833 million to $847 million compared to $713.8 million last year. We anticipate achieving comparable sales increase in the range of 7% to 9% versus 8.7% last year. Again, we have our easiest comp comparisons in Q1, so we expect comps will moderate a bit after the first quarter as we lap some of the terrific brand and product launches like IT Cosmetics, IT Brushes and a new foundation from bareMinerals that helped drive strong comps starting in Q2 of last year. We expect to open 20 stores in the first quarter versus 21 stores opened in Q1 last year. So preopening expense is expected to be relatively flat. Earnings per share are expected to be in the range of $0.88 to $0.93 versus $0.77 for Q1 of 2014. We anticipate a tax rate of 38% and a fully diluted share count of approximately 64.4 million. With that, I'll turn the call over to our conference call host to begin the Q&A session. Operator? 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Oliver Chen with Cowen and Company. 
Oliver Chen: Regarding your comments in the opportunities ahead on the supply chain front, could you characterize to us where you are in terms of where you see the longer-term going? And specifically, I was also curious about fulfillment, planning and allocation. And also, related to your comment on e-commerce and supply chain capabilities, do you see the margin kind of improving as your capabilities improve in this discipline? I also had a question about awareness. 
Mary Dillon: Okay, Oliver, thank you, and let me just start with a kind of broad stroke on the supply chain. As you know, it's a multi-year project. And I guess I would just say it really touches several aspects of the business. The overall goals are going to be building infrastructure to support the growth that we have planned, also, to enhance capabilities that we know we need to be a really relevant omni-channel retailer our customers want to shop and then, of course, also drive efficiencies over time. So really, this multi-year plan has several benefits that we were excited about. Examples, increasing delivery frequency to help improve in-stock conditions, having the cartons arrive at the stores in an "easier to stock to shelf" kind of format. We call that store-ready. Even looking to see if we can be more efficient with our footprint and leverage inventory across our footprint to fulfill omni-channel orders. Forecasting replenishment, yes, that's certainly part of it. Down the road, as we have more store format, like the small stores, ensuring that, that's easier to scale and to operate, that's also part of it. And also, that we continue to improve the processing time on our e-commerce business. So all of those are aspects and benefits that are expected and built into the 5-year plan relative to the supply chain investment. E-commerce, yes, we do expect that, that margin will improve as we get more efficient. The 2 new distribution centers are really being built from the start with that in mind, to really fulfill e-commerce as well as store orders as efficiently as possible. So -- as well as we continue to improve some of the mix of what we sell in e-com. 
Oliver Chen: And also, on the awareness frontier. This has been a nice theme for your strategic plan. Where do you -- where would you contextualize customers is coming from as you make these nice leaps? And as you post-game holiday, it was a really great execution. But if you had to think about it from a post-game perspective, were -- are there any things that you would do slightly differently as you think about next year? 
Mary Dillon: Okay. Well, we are constantly in a mode of continuous improvement, seriously. So I think we're always looking at what worked well, what we could've done better. And honestly, we're very pleased with how the quarter turned out. But there's always areas that we can continue to improve. The -- your question about where the customers are coming from. We're-- we know that we have opportunity gap in our awareness relative to some of our competition. And that's opportunity for us. And that's why we've been working to balance the mix of how we do our marketing to drive, to have awareness-generating tactics, and that's proving to work for us. If you step way back, we have, as you know, about just under 3% share of the beauty market in the U.S. So our guest is -- loves us and she's loyal and coming more often. But there's 2 sources. One is beauty enthusiast who perhaps have not been in an Ulta ever or not been in an Ulta for a long time or current guests that are maybe spending money across different retailers, hardly they spend everything all on 1 place or any 1 category. But as she's increasing, giving us more of her share of wallet. And our loyalty program is a key part of that. It really provides a great incentive to spend your beauty dollar at Ulta. Because the points are valuable and the more you spend, the more valuable they get for our guests. So it's really current guest spending more with us as well as new guest spending with us instead of other places. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. 
Simeon Gutman: I have one question for you, Mary. And then I don't know if Janet is there. But if she's not, I'll ask it of you as well. 
Mary Dillon: She is here. Yes, she is here. 
Simeon Gutman: Okay, great. So first, on the momentum in the business, very strong. And I'm guessing it's a combination of a lot of things. More curious about the marketing side, how effective you're getting at customer targeting. Are you able to sort of attract the pulse of people responding to your offers and seeing a higher response rate and able to track it on a real time basis? 
Mary Dillon: Yes. And you know what, maybe David -- David and Janet are both here. So perhaps we can tag team a little, but I'd say the momentum on the business that we're seeing, it really cuts across a lot of dimensions, which is great, and our job is to keep those levers all working. But really, if you think about it, new product launches and new product news was a big part of the fourth quarter. So Bare Escentuals, Urban Decay, IT, Benefit, Clinique, Lancôme, are all good examples. Our loyalty program, all -- everybody on one program. Actually, even improving our in-store sign-up. And then yes, this notion of our improved marketing strategies and tactics, it's kind of this combination of using different types of pieces of the mix as well as really positioning ourselves, I guess, as more of a beauty authority. So all of those combined, and I mentioned in the script gift cards as well. So clearly, a lot of different things are working for us in the quarter. Do you want to say anything to that, Dave? 
David Kimbell: Yes, I mean, I think we made -- we continue to do a lot of the things that have worked for us historically behind many of the print vehicles, our magazines worked well in reaching our existing guests. We've also introduced and improved several of the tactics that we go to market with. Mary mentioned in the script, for the first time, bringing in radio into the mix, which we think was a really strong addition to our promotional activity over that key holiday season. We also, to your question specifically about improving the effectiveness, there's a lot that we can read around our guests' responsiveness to our activities. And one area in particular that I highlight is the impact we're having with our e-mail. So as we get better information around our guests, we are able to more personalize the communication, the offers, the type of information, the frequency of the information that we're delivering to her. And so we saw a dramatic increase in the effectiveness, which is measured by, essentially, sales per e-mail in the fourth quarter. So we feel like we're expanding as well as getting sharper in the types of things that we're doing. 
Simeon Gutman: Okay, and then for Janet, congratulations on your retirement. I just wanted -- you have this unique 6-year or so perspective at Ulta in dealing with brands. And so I wanted to actually try something all-encompassing of sort of what's changed in brand perception of Ulta then versus now? How they look at online versus -- you mentioned you won Lancôme. Is that inevitable for Prestige brands to allow Ulta to sell it? Or do you think their own online ambitions will get in the way? And then also, do you think there's much an appetite for them to look outside of Ulta to other specialty retailers to sell the Prestige product to? 
Janet Taake: That is more than one question. 
Simeon Gutman: They're all for you. 
Janet Taake: Well, thank you so much. First of all, I think that what I would say about vendors, my team has great relationships with the vendors in the marketplace across all categories we do business with. And we have had for some time. And I think that continues to grow. Our vendor partners really enjoy our straightforward approach to how we run our business and also, that it truly is a win-win for them. We hold our vendors accountable to our comp and we look at our business that way every single day. Yes, we're a fast-growth retailer. But I really think they appreciate that we want to win at a comp level, which is so important to us. So we really partner with them to try to make that guest experience the best possible experience it can be. And with that, I think that there are a lot of vendors that are interested in Ulta based on the respect that we have in the marketplace, which I'm quite proud of. As far as online, we've made a significant progress, as Mary had mentioned, this past year. The largest gap, just to refresh your memory, was really in professional hair care. And we added 12 brands in 2014 and then 3 at the beginning of this year. So we we've closed the significant gap there. And we're very, very excited about Lancôme coming online. We're truly closing the gap down -- there is few that are not available online at this particular point in time. But I'm always hopeful that we'll get it to 0, for sure. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Daniel Hofkin with William Blair. 
Daniel Hofkin: Just wanted to delve a little bit, if possible, into the gross margin. In terms of buckets, it sounds like -- is it fair to say that basically, in terms of the directional changes and even maybe the magnitude, that most of the aspects, the puts and takes, were as good or better than expected despite some of the mix shift and the impact of loyalty and e-commerce? 
Scott Settersten: Yes. I'd say that's right on target, Dan. I mean, it's -- there's always a few bright unplanned surprises that you managed against during the course of any quarter or year. In the fourth quarter, like Mary mentioned, we had a few challenges in our e-commerce fulfillment side of the business because again, as always, the demand always seems to exceed our expectations. And so we had a few more, I'd say, inefficiencies, labor inefficiencies there that we had to deal with, and some additional freight expense to make sure we try to meet guest expectations as best we could so we reacted to that. But really, I'd say that was probably the one, I'd say, on the negative side, a ledger. On the positive side, I mean, everything seemed to work spectacularly in the stores. Execution was good, in-stocks were fantastic. And so we are very pleased with the overall performance on the retail side of the business. 
Daniel Hofkin: And it sounded like you've said that the less discounting and certainly, Prestige being among the strongest general categories. So is it fair to kind of infer that the general underlying product or merchandise margin trend is -- continues to be kind of a key component area, it sounds like. Is that fair to say? 
Scott Settersten: Yes. Yes, let me repeat that. The core retail product margins, so 90% plus of the business, they were better year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter, all right? So the core of the business is very healthy, and we're just managing along in our e-commerce side of the business, and the loyalty thing is kind of a one-time hit, I would say. And now that we're anniversary-ed, again, we wouldn't expect to see that kind of pressure on margin rate going forward. 
Daniel Hofkin: Okay. And then in terms of the brands you have, can you just provide a quick update on where we are at this point with Lancôme and Clinique? I know you said you're planning to add some of each, and if there's any color you can shed on that here at the beginning of the year, that will be great. 
Mary Dillon: Yes, as I mentioned in the script, Dan, we are planning to expand our boutiques for both of those brands. I'm not going to get into specifics. But we're excited. We've got great partnerships, great momentum on the brands, and we'll be rolling out to more stores. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Aram Rubinson with Wolfe Research. 
Aram Rubinson: I wanted to ask you a question about online. It looks like you had, by our math, about a $55 million increase in e-commerce sales in '14 over '15, so like the equivalent of about 13 stores. So I'm just kind of wondering, a, where that e-commerce shopper is coming from? Can you give us something about geography, demographics? And maybe does opening fewer stores kind of almost feed that business in a way because you're getting to satisfy that customer without putting up the bricks? 
Mary Dillon: Yes, go ahead, Dave. 
David Kimbell: Yes, this is Dave. No, I don't think it's associated with our store growth. Obviously, we opened 100 stores last year. And where that growth is coming from, where our best customer is coming from, is we really get an incremental transactions from her. What we see is our -- those guests, which is the majority of our online business, are coming in and buying both in-store and online. So we get actually, close to -- actually, a little bit more than double the number of transactions from a guest that is actively buying online and in-store versus a guest who's just buying in-store. So our -- really, it's fundamental and a key part of our overall omni-channel efforts is to be -- have the experience where and when she wants it. And what we find is there's times where it's easier for her to buy what she's looking for. She's attracted to something online and she is at home and she wants to get it. But we also know a big need for us is to get her into store. And she's doing both. So we see that as really an incremental purchase and an incremental opportunity for us to drive growth and not relate it to the store growth piece of it. 
Aram Rubinson: And if you had to just kind of pick a number, or guess, what kind of -- what comps are coming from existing customers versus new, just a ballpark? 
David Kimbell: Do you mean in the online space? Or are you talking... 
Aram Rubinson: No, I was thinking more in the stores. Just curious how many more new customers you seem to be bringing new into the tent. 
David Kimbell: Well, we said that -- I mean we said we're projecting millions of new customers every year. Retention remains really high. So we have good, strong retention. But we continue to attract new customers. I will say, one of our opportunities going forward, the reason we're trying to build awareness, is to bring even more new guests going in. But we've high retention. We've high percentage of sales that come from our guests. And that's a key driver of our business, continuing to delight them and drive strong performance with that group. 
Aram Rubinson: All right. And the last thing, just a little bit of housekeeping. In Q1, in the guidance, what kind of investments does that include? And then I'll hang up. 
Scott Settersten: It includes a litany of things. And many of those things, Mary described in her prepared remarks. So there's new investments going in, in stores, with test management system, we've got new mobile technology, app systems going in stores with iPads to allow us to be more engaging with our guests in the stores. Of course, the biggest investment is the Midwest DC, which is going to ramp up. It's ready to open summer of 2015. So there's a fair amount of gross margin deleverage. That's where most of that expense flows through the P&L, and it will ramp up. I mean, it's there in the first quarter, but the heaviest -- it's mostly back-end-loaded in 2015. Third and fourth quarters is the heaviest expense. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Chris Horvers with JPMorgan Chase. 
Christopher Horvers: So I wanted to follow up on the e-mail personalization opportunity. Can you talk about where you are from a segmentation process? How finely can you group your customer base in the different types of buckets that you're using? Can you get down to, say, I know these 10,000 people are bareMinerals customers and so I'm going to send them an e-mail, and perhaps, other buckets that you're using and how personal will you be a year from now? 
Mary Dillon: So Chris, I'll tell you what. That is part of the secret sauce in some ways that I want to be careful about how much we say because it's really an important lever for us. And I've got to tell you, I think our team is -- I know they're all over this, and we're very deep in our knowledge, our precision, our ability to target and use this to various effects. But I wouldn't want to say more than that because it's really an important tool for us. But we're excited about it. I think it's just going to continue to be a great lever for us. 
Christopher Horvers: So I guess maybe you could characterize it in terms of the classic baseball innings, like, where do you think you are versus, let's say, best-in-class in retail, not versus, let's say, online retailers but best-in-class in retail? 
Mary Dillon: Yes. I think we're probably still in the early innings, right? I mean, I think our capabilities that -- we've had the loyalty program for a long time. But it's really like now that we're at this 1 platform-everybody, that just simplifies our life. It makes it more powerful. And the team is really actively experimenting with lots of ways to leverage that. But -- so I think we're really in the early stages. 
Christopher Horvers: Okay. And then as a follow-up, you raised the share buyback program by $100 million and, let's say, we assume the stock's at $1.60 tomorrow, that's about 2.3 million, 2.4 million shares open to buy. Can you talk about how many shares you need to be repurchased this year to offset share dilution? And is the idea of raising the authorization so early? Is that to allow increased flexibility, to be more opportunistic? 
Scott Settersten: Yes, we wanted to maintain maximum flexibility. So again, the plan, the stated plan, our 10b5-1 plan, the focus is on offsetting dilution, which we said I don't know if I have the number of shares that it takes. But it's roughly 500,000, I think, was our early model, 500,000 shares a year roughly, which equates to about 1%, as we've said, of earnings growth. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Evren Kopelman with Wells Fargo. 
Evren Kopelman: My question is for Scott on the guidance. The first quarter comp guidance is -- the 7% to 9%, it's very strong, of course, nothing to complain about, but it's significantly below the 11% you just delivered. Is that just conservatism built in to guidance? Or have you seen the business slowed down in Q1 so far? 
Scott Settersten: Yes. We don't -- as you know, we don't talk about current quarter performance. But we had weather just like everyone else did in February, right? So we take everything into account that the current conditions reflect. So we feel very confident, strong momentum coming out of fourth quarter. We mentioned gift cards. There's carryover from that post January. There's good newness in the pipeline coming online. There's good tailwinds coming from the new store classes that are starting to roll into the comp base. So again, we try to look at all the facts and all the levers at our disposal and try to come up with the most prudent guidance that we can. 
Evren Kopelman: And then 2 housekeeping. One is the quarterly store opening cadence. Is that going to be similar to 2014? And then in your EPS growth guidance for the year, does that assume that 64.4 million that you guided for Q1? Or does it assume more buybacks to lower the share count? 
Scott Settersten: Yes. I think the store program, by and large, pretty much mirrors 2014. 
Mary Dillon: We said 20, 20, 45 and 15. 
Scott Settersten: Right, right. Which I think is roughly about what we did last year. So like-for-like, more or less. And on the shares again, I think for the full year, 64.4 -- you're going to build in roughly 400,000 to 500,000 shares, right, of buybacks, which would equate to the dilution effect that we described. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Jason Gere with KeyBanc. 
Jason Gere: Just a couple of questions. I guess the first, more clarification on the gross margin, I guess, deleverage this year. Is that primarily because of the new DC in the second half of the year? Because I know you talked about the loyalty card anniversary-ing. So just wondering if there's anything else in there that we should be taking into consideration. 
Scott Settersten: No, Jason. That's primarily it, kind of what we described as part of our long-term guidance, that we expected to continue to deliver very strong earnings growth going forward, adjusted for the investment, primarily for the DC. But there are other related investments around core systems, around merchandising and other store things that we described in our remarks that we feel we need to support strong, healthy earnings growth in the future. 
Jason Gere: Okay. And then longer term, I know just back in the fall, you gave the long-term EPS guidance. I think it's low 20%. And obviously, that would imply -- start to see a pickup in margins. In this year, I think you're implying really flat margins even though comps will be pretty nice. So I'm just wondering how you think about the long-term margin opportunity. Who out there in specialty retail really you benchmarked yourself to? Because certainly, a 12% kind of operating margins, it seems to be you're under-earning on that end and recognizing that there are investments now that will probably go on for another year or so. But really, where do you kind of benchmark yourself to? And what could be kind of that longer-term opportunity? I'm not asking you to quantify but just kind of how you look at it. 
Scott Settersten: We still feel very confident with the guidance that we provided last fall, which we think is very realistic to get to a mid-teens operating margin over the long term, over the 5-year period. Again, in '15 and '16, operating margins are going to be flattish because of some of the supply chain, DC and other core system investments that we'll be making. But once we get past that, we expect it to be making significant progress towards that target, the mid-teens operating margin target in '17 and beyond. So lots of goodness coming out of these investments. That's what we expect. Unfortunately, we have to make the investments upfront, and you start seeing the benefits more in the outer years. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Ike Boruchow with Sterne Agee. 
Irwin Boruchow: I guess, Scott, thanks for the help on the variability on how to use your play-out. Can you help us when you talk about Q2 and Q3 being tougher? Is that more so on the gross profit and SG&A lines and on margins? Or should we assume that it also -- because you mentioned some tough product launch compares, should we also assume that, that's also an impact on the comps? 
Scott Settersten: It's a mix of both. I mean, Q2, if you line them up, the stacked year-over-year, you'll see last year was, what, a 30% EPS growth year-over-year. So when you just start doing the math, you can see that it's a tougher comparison. Part of it is being derived from the comp, the tough comp compares with some of these product launches, which were very strong last year, and some of it is just to build on the deleverage in gross in supply chain costs that are going to affect the P&L. So it's really a combination of the 2. 
Irwin Boruchow: Right, I mean, I asked because the strongest comp of the year was in Q4 this year, and so you're saying Q2 and Q3 are the toughest compares. That's what I was trying to clear up, if it's just margin or if it's also comp. 
Scott Settersten: No, it's a combination of the 2. I mean, margin -- I'd say the margin piece is more of a Q3, Q4, and sales is more of a Q2, Q3 kind of thing. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Joe Altobello with Raymond James. 
Joseph Altobello: Just a couple of questions on some of the tests you guys did this quarter. It sounds like the advertising test went fairly well with the comps above the control group. Was that the same for the increased staffing in the 60 stores you tested this quarter? 
Mary Dillon: Yes. The payroll testing model, we're really pleased with the learning. Kecia Steelman, who's our head of store operations, has really dug deep and been all over this. It's actually a little bit less of a clean test than an advertising test in some ways, right? The inputs are little bit different because it's about store by store, managing that payroll, hiring, getting the right people there and managing that to an outcome that you want. So what we saw and that's why we feel confident that there are stores that we're going to go after this and we're going to increase labor hours because we believe it's going to pay for itself in terms of increased sales, frankly, by having more guest-facing time and more conversion. So it's -- but it's also something that because it's subtle, it's a little trickier to manage. We're going to walk before we run. So it's not -- what we know is that over time, as we continue to play out the supply chain investment for our associates in the stores, it will get easier to have more guest-facing time. And that's exciting. In the meantime, we want to see if we can accelerate that. But we're going to kind of take it step-by-step. 
Joseph Altobello: Okay. So any learnings early on from that test at all? 
Mary Dillon: Just said it, particularly, when we executed really well, where we held the General Manager accountable to a new sales target with those new increased hours and where that store was able to hire the right person quickly and get the right people trained and in position, it did -- it was efficacious for us. That's why we are confident to add more labor hours in a certain subset of stores because we think, managed right, it's going to be a good investment for us. And it's really about that overall guest experience as well. And when our -- a guest wants to interact with our associates, our associates want to be there to help them. And so that really is a flywheel that helps the business and we like where it's going. 
Joseph Altobello: Got it. Okay. And just moving on to the smaller format store test. It sound like you guys are going slow there. If it's successful, how many locations do you think you could have in terms of that smaller format over time? 
Mary Dillon: So what we've talked about, up to about a couple of hundred stores incremental to the 1,200 stores that we've already mapped out for our large format. And yes, I mean, we love how they're performing. They are great stores, great team, and the guests love them. And it's really, I believe, in pacing. Again, walk before you run. So it's a little tricky to operate as a completely different store format, which it is, but we're really pleased with where it's going. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Mark Altschwager with Robert W. Baird. 
Mark Altschwager: Just a quick follow-up on the small stores. I know it's early, but any metrics you can share on just the productivity you're seeing there or average gross margins versus your typical store? And then separately, what pieces need to be in place from a distribution standpoint in order to enable the scalability of that concept? 
Mary Dillon: Yes. I'm not going to share a lot of the details on this because it's really early and I want to protect some of that insight. But I will just tell you that we've set certain sales and productivity targets and we're exceeding them. So -- and they'd be the normal kind of targets that we've set for any store. So we feel good about that. It's really about forecasting replenishment models that I think are going to be the key to getting us to a position to more easily run those store formats. So it's not that far off. I mean, it's not like we're going to wait a super long time to do this because we're excited about the prospects. And I'll tell you what, the guests in these small towns were very excited that we showed up, so it's a great opportunity for us. 
Mark Altschwager: Great. And then just one more quick one. I think you're 2 quarters in with this new POS system. Have you seen any benefits from that? Any metrics you can share on that front? 
Scott Settersten: We don't really have any metrics we can share. 
Mary Dillon: No. 
Scott Settersten: I would tell you that the rollout went very smooth. I mean, this was 1 that was pretty high risk and we accelerated it to make sure we could get it in before holidays. So things went very smooth, all things considered. We did get some step-up in the technology as far as cyber protection as part of that system, so we are very happy that we were able to accelerate the implementation of that. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Fassler with Goldman Sachs. 
Matthew Fassler: I want to start by talking about the loyalty program. You spoke about the loyalty program having a diminishing impact on margins as you've now cycled the moved to a single platform. Can you talk about the typical sales maturation curve that you've seen from customers after they've ramped on to that platform? Is it a multiyear curve? Is the big sales kick in year 1? Just how we should think about the impact on sales of cycling that as well? 
Scott Settersten: Matt, historically, what we -- as you well know, we've been experimenting with this model for quite some time. So historically, as we rolled it out to new markets, we saw a sales hit in year 1 as people kind of get comfortable with the program. And we saw that kind of moderate over the course of the year. So the going-in assumption was like a 1-year kind of cycle time to get back to it, what I'd call an equilibrium with the guests. This rollout, the conversion that we did with 50% of the country in 2014, we didn't see that. We saw sales actually accelerate from our expectations. And of course, right, that equated to more points being earned and more of a margin headwind because of that. Because people are more engaged, it's easier to understand. So... 
Matthew Fassler: And if you think about what your Q has typically looked like and whether you think it will be any different for this round? 
Scott Settersten: Yes. We haven't really seen that. Again, it's a different scale now. We got the whole country on this program. I can just tell you from the inside, we are very excited about what this program provides for the company and the opportunities that we're going to have to drive more engagement, more focused offers to our guests by using our CRM tool. And again, we're in the very early stages of this. 
Matthew Fassler: And then one other question. You've dealt with this, I think, a number of different ways so far this afternoon. If you think about the acceleration that you saw in the online business, in a quarter where you have the highest volumes, that acceleration, is that much more meaningful? Would you tie that in directly to CRM efforts and customer acquisition? And I guess, are you seeing customer acquisition disproportionately commence online? Or is it evenly distributed or proportionately distributed across channels? 
David Kimbell: Yes, a couple of things. First, we are seeing an over-index of new customer acquisition online, although it's still a minority of our customer -- new customer acquisition. The things that are driving our growth from the e-commerce is absolutely a combination of a number of key factors. It is a great portfolio of products, first and foremost. They're really attracted -- the same things they're attracted to in store, they're attracted to online. And we had great success behind many of the launches and the products that Mary touched on. We also, as Janet described, added several new products throughout the course of the fourth quarter and even into this year. We've been successful at driving traffic to our site. So our customer acquisition and traffic-driving activity has really been exceeding our expectation and then, once they get there, some of the changes we've made within the site experience to convert them had been working. And then, I'd say, the other activities within loyalty, to your point around e-mail and other communication, even our magazines and really every touch point that we have, encourages or reminds her to come online just as much as it does remind her to come in store. So all that seems to be working. 
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, we have time for one more question. Steph Wissink with Piper Jaffray. 
Stephanie Wissink: All the best wishes to you, Janet, really a remarkable finish to your Ulta career. My question is actually for you. Specifically, just to give us a status update on the percentage of SKUs in the mix now that cross over between stores and e-commerce. And then a big follow-up question to the panel, just if you think about the influence of content and I think, Mary, you mentioned this in your prepared remarks, whether it's your own content or content that's created by your vendors, how important is that, do you think, to building your competitive advantage in the marketplace? 
Mary Dillon: Yes. I'll start with the content. And well, absolutely, I mean we're very focused on that. And this is a category industry that is so driven by trend and content, new discoveries. So yes, we're building content, we're working with our vendor partners to acquire more content. And you'll see more of that to come from us for sure. 
Janet Taake: As far as online SKUs, basically, now, with the additions that we made in professional hair care in Lancôme, we're well within a very high range of what we have in store. We have over 20,000 SKUs in store. So it will be comparable online. As I mentioned before, it's a very -- it's a handful of brands that are in-store that are truly not online for sale today. So we have made significant progress in 2014. 
Mary Dillon: Okay. So in closing, I'd like to thank our 22,000 dedicated associates for a really terrific 2014 and their tireless efforts to differentiate Ulta Beauty and to continue our strong momentum into 2015 and beyond. And thanks to all of you for your interest in our company. I look forward to speaking with you all again soon. Thank you. 
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.

===== 2014 Q3  (2014-12-04 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Greetings, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Ulta Beauty Third Quarter 2014 Earnings Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.
 I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Ms. Laurel Lefebvre. Thank you. You may begin. 
Laurel Lefebvre: Thank you. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us for Ulta Beauty's Third Quarter 2014 Conference Call. Hosting our call are Mary Dillon, Chief Executive Officer; and Scott Settersten, Chief Financial Officer. Also joining us are Janet Taake, Chief Merchandising Officer; and Dave Kimbell, Chief Marketing Officer.

 We make references during this call to the metric free cash flow, a non-GAAP financial measure defined as cash provided by operating activities, minus purchases of property and equipment.
 I'll now turn the call over to Mary. 
Mary Dillon: Thank you, Laurel. Good afternoon, everyone. I'm pleased to announce the Ulta team delivered excellent sales and earnings growth in the third quarter. 
 To recap the numbers, sales grew 20.5%, and we delivered a 9.5% total company comp on top of a 6.8% comp in the third quarter of 2013, both including the impact of e-commerce growth. Our 9.5% comp was nicely balanced between transactions and ticket. The key drivers of our performance were: Continued strength in prestige and mass color cosmetics; the successful introduction of new products and brands; a more effective and well-executed marketing strategy; double-digit comps in our salon business; and rapid growth in e-commerce. ulta.com performed very well, driving 46.7% comp sales growth. Gross margin was healthy as we continue our efforts to deliver more targeted offers and moderate our reliance on broad-based price discounts. Earnings per share were up 30% to $0.91 versus $0.70 of GAAP EPS last year.
 Scott will cover the detailed financial results for the third quarter and our guidance for the fourth quarter in a moment. But before that, I'd like to provide an update on our 6 strategic imperatives. As you know, we recently updated our strategic plan and 5-year financial target and provided additional insight into the components of our long-range plan at our Analyst Day in October. We believe this plan represents a strong set of strategic imperatives and specific initiatives that will allow Ulta to continue its market share gains and deliver strong sustainable sales and earnings growth.
 Now I'll spend a few minutes updating you on activities underlying each of the 6 strategic imperatives. The first imperative is to acquire new guests and deepen loyalty with existing guests. As we discussed, we believe that 1 source of future growth is through the acquisition of new guests. In order to do that, we know there's an opportunity to first drive awareness of Ulta, as well as clarity about the overall Ulta experience. In the past several months, we've sharpened our brand positioning, developed an advertising campaign and began an in-market test to measure the impact of TV, print, radio and digital advertising in 6 representative markets around the country. We recently completed the test and are now analyzing the trend-out data. Preliminary indications are positive, and we expect this test to influence our marketing strategy for 2015.
 Another key aspect of this brand-building strategy is to leverage PR to increase awareness and establish Ulta as a leading beauty authority. We continue to drive millions of earned media impressions in the third quarter through broadcast and print PR opportunities in support of grand openings and product launches. In addition, throughout the month of October, we partnered with The Ellen DeGeneres Show to highlight our long-standing support of the Breast Cancer Research Foundation. The total number of media impressions Ulta received from the Ellen partnership approached 500 million. In addition, due to increased awareness of our Cut-A-Thon, our salon teams provided 26% more free haircuts with a donation to the BCRF than last year. We've raised millions of dollars this year for BCRF, a cause important to our guests and our associates, and we've taken an important step towards increasing awareness of Ulta.
 Another critical initiative in support of the first strategic imperative is growing and further leveraging our loyalty program and CRM capabilities to increase loyalty and grow share of wallet with our members. At the end of the third quarter, our ULTAmate Rewards program had grown 16.1% year-over-year, reaching 14.5 million active members. Our strong comp growth across retail, salon and e-commerce was driven by loyalty member sales growth. Average sales per member increased compared to last year, equally influenced by greater shopping frequency and higher spend per transaction. We continue to increase the effectiveness of our targeted CRM campaigns in order to drive incremental sales, improve retention and engage members in our service offerings.
 Now on to the second strategic imperative, which is to differentiate by delivering a distinctive and personalized guest experience across all channels. A key initiative is assessing higher staffing levels to determine the impact on sales and the guest experience. During the third quarter, we tested different labor models with increased customer-facing hours in 60 stores across the country. Similar to the advertising test, we're currently measuring several financial and customer satisfaction of retention metrics to assess how to incorporate a more effective labor model as we go forward.
 On the digital side, we've also been busy improving the guest experience. We've introduced live interactive chats with key vendors on a regular basis. We've launched a new iPad app and added content to the site to inspire, educate and share. We've also implemented a new technology in ulta.com to enable video commerce or shoppable videos where guests can click to buy merchandise shown in videos that are created by passionate Ulta bloggers.
 Our third strategic imperative is to offer relevant, innovative and often exclusive products that excite our guests. Newness continues to be a significant driver of our business, and our merchandising team is doing an excellent job expanding and curating our portfolio. 
 During the third quarter, we rolled out across the chain a specialized fixture to house an exclusive collection of makeup brushes in partnership with IT Cosmetics. With 66 SKUs across multiple price points, these brushes have been an instant hit with our guests. 
 We also launched a premium skincare, Algenist; haircare brand, Keranique; as well as new fragrances from Michael Kors. We rolled out popular color cosmetics brand, BECCA, to 282 stores as well. With its broad range of shades, this brand is a great addition to our portfolio and very relevant to women of color.
 Looking ahead to the holiday season, we're excited about the many exclusive holiday items we've introduced in partnership with our prestige brands and the strong gift-with-purchase program to support our fragrance offering. We recently introduced a bath collection for the Ulta brand with new fragrances and packaging. We've also significantly upgraded our gift card program and merchandising in time for the holiday season. So we believe our merchandise assortment, combined with our robust marketing plan, anchored on a Gift Gorgeously theme that includes radio, advertising, PR, social, digital and in-store marketing, will resonate with our guests.
 Now moving on to the fourth strategic imperative: delivering exceptional services in 3 core areas: hair, skin health and brows. The salon business grew 20.5% and comp-ed 10% for the quarter, adding 10 basis points to the retail comp. This performance was driven primarily by increases in average ticket. But guest count was also positive and strengthened during the quarter. Our strongest comp-ing categories were hair color, blowouts, skin services and makeup services. Skin services had their best comp all year due in large part to the launch of a new peel service that builds repeat business.
 We are pleased to see an acceleration in new guest acquisition throughout the quarter, supported by our new online booking capability. During the quarter, 36,000 appointments were booked online, and more than 80% of those were new salon guests. Beginning in October, we launched a CRM campaign designed to acquire new salon guests from our existing loyalty customer base with targeted offers for hair, brow and skin services. As we noted in our investor conference in October, salon customers spend 2.5x more than non-salon guests and shop twice as frequently, but they represent less than 7% of our loyalty program members. So converting more of our ULTAmate Rewards program members to become salon customers is a good opportunity for us.
 Turning to brow services. We now have about 600 Benefit Brow Bars and are performing brow tinting services in almost 400 of these. Benefit boutiques continue to perform very well, with strength in both products and services.
 The fifth strategic imperative is to grow stores and e-commerce to reach and serve more guests. We opened 50 stores during the quarter, ending the third quarter with 765 stores. We remodeled 5 stores in the third quarter and relocated 2. We've already completed our 100-store program this year, with an additional 10 stores opened early in the fourth quarter. And after closing 1 later in Q4, we expect to end the year with 774 opened stores. This represents an increase in square footage of just under 15% for the year.
 New store productivity remains strong, with the class of 2014 stores outperforming its sales budget. Looking ahead to 2015, we expect to open 100 full-sized stores, and we have already approved close to 90 sites.
 In terms of the small store test, we opened 2 5,000 square foot stores in September, 1 in Vernal, Utah and 1 in Morganton, North Carolina. These stores feature curated assortment with every major category represented, lower fixture heights for increased visibility and a full guest experience with a 3-chair salon, Dermalogica skin services and a Benefit Brow Bar. In these 2 stores, we're piling a new capability for guests to order in-store on an iPad and have the product shipped for free from our DC to their home in order to give our guests access to our full assortment.
 We continue to monitor the performance of these stores, and in their initial weeks, they're exceeding their sales budgets and confirming our hypothesis that these stores would be extremely well received by guests and that they're likely to have a higher mix of prestige product sales versus the chain. We expect to learn a lot about operating small stores during this test to help us be successful in rural and urban markets in the future.
 On the e-commerce side, ulta.com's growth of 46.7% contributed 130 basis points to the total company comp. e-commerce is expected to represent about 5% of total sales this year, on our way to our goal of growing to a 10% of our business in the next 5 years.
 We're now anniversary-ing the significant improvements to the new website that we launched just over a year ago. So we expect the top line to moderate over time. But we continue to add more content and enhance the site performance. And we also expect to see improved fulfillment capabilities as we execute our supply chain project.
 Which brings me to our sixth strategic imperative: investing in infrastructure to support our guest experience and growth, and capture scale efficiencies. The Greenwood, Indiana distribution center is under construction and is expected to open mid-next year. We're currently looking for a location in the South for our fifth DC to open in 2016. These buildings will have all new systems and operating models, driving more efficiency, increasing replenishment speed and improving in-stocks while making it easier for store associates to stock shelves and free up their time to spend with our guests.
 Other noteworthy efficiency projects include our new point-of-sale system. The chain-wide rollout was completed at the end of the third quarter. The new POS simplifies the cashier role, enables omni-channel capabilities and reduces costs. We're also piloting a mobile app for store associates to streamline receiving and inventory functions in 10 stores and a store management tool in 13 stores. 
 This completes my update on our strategic imperatives, so now I'll hand it over to Scott. 
Scott Settersten: Thanks, Mary. Good afternoon, everyone. Third quarter sales were $745.7 million compared to $618.8 million last year, an increase of 20.5%. Comparable sales increased 9.5%. The retail comp, which includes salon, was 8.2%. The total company comp was driven by a healthy combination of transaction and ticket, with transactions up 5.4% and ticket up 4.1%. The ticket increase was driven entirely by average selling price, as our business continues to mix up to more prestige categories and we succeed in our efforts to rely more on our CRM capabilities and targeted offers versus broad-based couponing. Retail-only comparable transactions were up a solid 4.4%.
 Gross profit dollars were up 21.6% to $281.8 million, and gross profit margin increased 40 basis points to 37.8% from 37.4% last year. The primary drivers of this improvement were leverage on fixed store cost on a strong comp and higher product margins, offset by incremental supply chain costs due to our expanding e-commerce business.
 SG&A expense increased 19.7% to $181.1 million, down 20 basis points as a percentage of sales to 24.3% versus 24.5% last year or 24.2%, excluding the severance charge last year.
 Despite our investments in the test-and-learn initiatives, like the payroll and brand awareness marketing tests, we were able to leverage SG&A due to the stronger-than-expected top line, which drove payroll and marketing expense leverage, offset by deleverage in corporate overhead expense. The corporate overhead deleverage was primarily driven by a higher variable compensation expense due to better-than-expected performance as well as depreciation of IT systems and consulting expense.
 Preopening expense was $6.6 million compared to $7.5 million last year, driven by 50 store openings compared to 55 new stores opened during Q3 2013.
 Operating margin increased 80 basis points to 12.6% versus 11.8% last year. Interest income was $254,000 net of credit facility fees. Our line of credit remains undrawn. 
 Our tax rate was 37.3% versus 37.7% last year. This tax rate favorability added less than $0.01 of earnings per share and was due to the impact of equity compensation on our tax rate.
 Net income increased 30.1% to $59.1 million or $0.91 per diluted share versus $45.4 million or $0.70 per diluted share last year or $0.72 per share, excluding the severance charge last year.
 Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. Inventories were $709.7 million at the end of the quarter compared to $582.3 million at the end of Q3 2013, up 5.8% on a per-store basis. We achieved our goal of keeping inventory per-door growth below comp growth despite investing in additional inventory on bestsellers ahead of the holiday selling season to keep pace with our strong sales momentum. In-stock levels are strong, and we have not experienced any meaningful issues from the recent West Coast court delays.
 Capital expenditures were $78.4 million for the quarter, driven by our new store opening program, supply chain investment and systems. We are on track to spend $265 million in capital for the full year.
 Depreciation and amortization for the third quarter were $33.7 million. We ended the quarter with $395 million of cash and short-term investments. The company repurchased approximately 86,000 shares at a cost of $10 million during the quarter under our 10b5-1 plan as part of our program to return cash to shareholders.
 In terms of specific guidance for Q4 2014. We expect to generate sales in the range of $997 million to $1.014 billion compared to $868.1 million last year. We anticipate achieving comparable sales increase in the range of 6% to 8% versus 9.2% last year. Recall that comp performance from last year's Q4 benefited by approximately 200 basis points due to the negative impact of Superstorm Sandy and the timing impact of the 53rd week of fiscal 2012.
 New store openings in the fourth quarter are already complete, with 10 stores opened versus 11 stores opened in Q4 last year, so preopening expense is expected to be flat. 
 Earnings per share are expected to be in the range of $1.21 to $1.26 versus $1.09 for Q4 2013. We anticipate a tax rate of 37.9% and a fully diluted share count of approximately 64.6 million.
 Turning to the outlook for the full year 2014. Based on the strong performance of the first 3 quarters, we are raising our earnings growth expectation to the low 20s percentage range for the full year. Full year comparable sales are expected to be in the range of 8% to 9%.
 As a reminder, the long-term plan we announced in September laid out our 5-year financial targets. We expect to: Open 100 stores per year; grow e-commerce to 10% of our sales; drive comparable sales in the 5% to 7% range; and grow earnings per share in the low 20s percentage range each year. However, we expect a reduction of this growth rate in the mid-single digit percentage range in both 2015 and 2016 due to planned supply chain and systems investments.
 Operating margins are expected to remain flattish for the next couple of years before heading up towards our long-term mid-teens target. We plan to provide specific guidance for next year, as usual, on our Q4 call in March.
 And finally, for fiscal year 2015, we plan to accelerate our earnings announcement calendar to be more in line with our peers and expect to announce our quarterly results about 1 week earlier than our historical practice. The dates for next year's earnings announcements are posted on the Investor Relations page of our website.
 And with that, I'll turn the call over to our conference call host to begin the Q&A session. Operator? 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. 
Simeon Gutman: It's Simeon Gutman, Morgan Stanley. Two questions. First, on gross margin and gross margin management. You talked about getting better at, I guess, promotions and targeting and being more selective. If you do what you did this quarter to drive some of the improvement and you run it out over the next few, should we see gross margin expansion similar to what we saw in this quarter? And then my second question is if you see next year better gross profit dollar growth, either through sales or through better gross margin, are there investments either -- you mentioned supply chain and systems, are there any of those investments that you can accelerate just to pull them forward if the business is performing better? 
Scott Settersten: Yes, Simeon, I guess I'll take a crack at the first one here. As far as gross profit expansion was concerned for the third quarter, as I look out at the next couple, specifically the fourth quarter, I wouldn't expect to see the same kind of expansion that we just saw in the third quarter. I mean, the fourth quarter, I think you know the holiday season is a little bit different animal for us, with the competitive set kind of changing. We have, again, a large number of new stores entering into the overall base here. So there's a bit more fixed store cost deleverage coming in the fourth quarter that will drift the next couple of quarters as well. So again, we think our guidance includes all those ramifications, and we think it's prudent under the circumstances. As far as thinking forward a little bit about investments, I mean, it's -- you heard us describe all of this at our Analyst Day back in October. It's a pretty aggressive plan. There's a lot of heavy lifting as far as the investments are concerned over the next couple of years. I think we're probably as accelerated, probably, as we feel comfortable at, at this stage in the game. Of course, we'd always course correct as we see things change in the business. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Gary Balter with Crédit Suisse. 
Andrew Kinder: It's actually Andrew on for Gary. My question is regarding prestige brand wins. This quarter, your market share gains from department stores seem to accelerate, and in response, we heard companies like Estée Lauder mention that they're going to expand their assortment with the specialty channel. Could you just comment on your outlook for prestige brand wins, particularly as the smaller format stores lessen channel conflict? 
Mary Dillon: Thank you, Andrew. Yes. We're really, really thrilled with the performance of the brands that we've been adding to the mix. And I think I talked about 1 example. Cosmetics was a big win for us in the quarter with the expansion of the brush line and whatnot. There's many examples of that. We continue to just look forward at our growth, and we think we are a great place to grow. We're pleased with the performance that we have with our brands. And we'll always look to continue to really, I guess, best meet our guest's needs. And as she continues to be interested in more prestige brands, we'll continue to look at those as well. So thank you. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Aram Rubinson with Wolfe Research. 
Aram Rubinson: Two questions. First, now that Q3 last year is in the rearview mirror, can we do a little postmortem on what exactly happened then? I didn't know if you'd got any extra clarity as you kind of cycled through it. 
Mary Dillon: That's your first question, okay. Aram, thank you. So I guess there's a few things going on there, right. One is that last year, we had this -- I guess you'd call it the fiscal cliff effect that we think had an impact on traffic and consumer sentiment that we saw at the end of the quarter. And we were also cycling up against a very promotional year-ago quarter. And so some of those factors, we think, actually -- that in conjunction with we were starting to pull back a bit in some of our promotional intensity, put those together, we think those are some of the factors that drove some of the impact to the comp that we saw in that quarter. This year, as we look at it, I think it's obviously a, overall, much healthier consumer sentiment happening. While there's still pressure on household budgets in a lot of ways, obviously, the overall economic outlook and economy, jobs are more positive. And we are still continuing to really be cautious but smart about balancing our investment and targeted offers with price discounts. We think we're getting a little bit better at that, probably more knowledge as we've done this a little bit more over time. So those are kind of the things. Those -- in each year, every quarter has something new as it relates to new products, and some are going to perform better than others, right. So that's always a part of the equation. So we feel like we have a pretty good understanding of all that and confident that the drivers that got us to this quarter result are ones that we can -- we think we can continue to drive in the future. 
Aram Rubinson: And a follow-up was, I don't think this was asked at the Analyst Day, but can tell us how likely you are to try to incubate brands in something like kind of a VC [ph] format, and maybe if so, timing or monies you might allocate to such an endeavor? 
Mary Dillon: Certainly, the notion of having a really robust pipeline of products, so products and brands that our guests want, that they know of already and products and brands that we can bring to market in partnership or invest in, are all in the consideration set for us. We want to really be known as the beauty authority. And certainly, the more things that are exclusive to us, the better over time, right. I don't think that'll ever be an -- at the highest part of what we do, but certainly, we'll want to grow that. Having said that, we're just really, I think, beginning to develop that capability, take some investment of time and people to do that. And so that's certainly a focus for us in 2015 is to build out strategy, capability and plans there because I think it's very exciting and interesting to think about consumer insight, combined with great merchandising and retail execution as part of our strategy. But it's early for us yet to be. We have so many other priorities right now, frankly, that that's what we're focused on. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Ike Boruchow with Sterne Agee. 
Irwin Boruchow: Two quick ones. I think the first one for Scott. In terms of the next 18 to 24 months on the investment side, is there going to be -- as we model out our quarters, is there going to be some lumpiness that we should keep in mind? You guys talked about the next distribution center opening up and the timing of that. Just curious how we should think about timing on SG&A, if there's anything you can add. And then also, Mary, when we think about ticket growth of 4%, can you comment? Is that a function of category mix to prestige? Is that a function of less discounts? Is it both? Is it more one or the other? Just trying to understand that a little bit better. 
Mary Dillon: I'll start with that one, because that's actually easier, which is that it really is a combination of both. Ike, I would say that it's a mix of to prestige, it's less discounting. Those together have really been the drivers. 
Scott Settersten: And as far as the investment cycle is concerned here over the near term, the next 18, 24, 36 months, so I mean, you're -- again, clearly, we're going to -- Indianapolis is underway here, that building slated to be online mid-2015, shortly followed thereafter with a new distribution center in the south going online approximately the same time of the year in 2016, kind of a carbon copy. So the short answer is yes, we do expect our quarter-to-quarter performance to be a bit lumpier than it has been historically. I know we've talked to many investors about that over the last couple of years. That's one of the reasons why we've kind of backed away from more detailed guidance that we've done in the past. As a reminder, most of the investment is going to be flowing through the gross profit line in the P&L. There will be a minor part, I think, flowing through SG&A for some consulting things. But by and large, all these in capital investments will amortize through gross profit. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Daniel Hofkin with William Blair. 
Daniel Hofkin: Just a couple of quick questions. First, as you think about kind of pulling back in some of the broad-based, as you called it, coupon advertising, what -- as you see that, where is that kind of manifesting itself? Is that just showing up in a little bit higher average ticket? Or is there any other impacts through the ticket or traffic dynamic there? That would be my first question. 
Mary Dillon: Well, yes, I would say a couple of things. One is that this is not a dramatic wholesale pullback on discounts. We're doing it carefully, I think smartly. What we're doing is looking at frequency and depth of circulation, of price-related discounts, but reducing that. But on the flipside, really leveraging our CRM platform and our loyalty program to incent our guests in a more personalized and targeted, we think, more effective and efficient way, right. So it's a little hard to measure all those impacts at any one moment in time, but certainly, where we can see that play out is in ticket improvement, margin improvement. And we think that's working for us. So -- but again, I've said this before, I believe in walk before you run. So Dave Kimbell and his team are doing a lot of work around just really making sure we continue to fine-tune, test and learn, understand all the demand dynamics so that we can be -- we always need to be a value to our guests is a way to think about it. And it's -- there's no one exact way to define that. But the more relevant we can be with the offerings and then how we position those and communicate those to her, the more that value equation is less about just come in because you have a coupon or a discount. That said, a lot of our guests like our coupons and our discounts, right. So it does play out in terms of the ticket dynamic. And we think it's -- obviously, it's one of the assumptions we build into our long-range plan is that we'll continue to be able to do that. Because the other place that this plays out is that less money spent on discounting, within the context of our P&L, offers us more opportunity to spend on driving awareness and the whole new guest acquisition part of our strategy, which is, we think, an opportunity -- we know it's an opportunity as we go forward. New guests don't discover you just by accident. Sometimes they do because we've opened up a store, which is great, but we're investing and testing and learning in, actually, marketplace programs already that are about using all forms of ways to communicate, whether it's traditional or new media, to drive new guest acquisition. So some of that sort of efficiencies there will be used to drive new guest growth. 
Daniel Hofkin: That's great. And then it looked like there were a couple other brands that maybe you're testing out a little bit. It looked like Clarins in one of your markets in skincare. Is that specific brand? Or is that something that you're thinking about as a potential for a broader rollout over time or others like that? 
Mary Dillon: I'll ask our expert head merchant here to weigh in on that one. Janet? 
Janet Taake: Sure. We did just recently refocus on Clarins in our stores. We've had Clarins, but what we did do -- so technically, it's not new, but once again, we really focused it more in our Chicago area. It's a beautiful brand, and we're also very thrilled to offer it on our website as well. And that's -- no further information other than that. And we're just really excited to learn more about this beautiful brand in our assortment. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Joe Altobello with Raymond James. 
Joseph Altobello: I guess first question is on the site, the ulta.com site. What percent of visitors to your site are loyalty members? And how successful do you think that site has been so far at funneling those visitors into your brick-and-mortar stores. 
Mary Dillon: I will ask Dave to take that for us. Dave? 
David Kimbell: Yes. I don't think we'll have the exact percentage of guests versus non-guests that visit our site. We know we over-index on our site in our ability to attract new guests. So we get a greater percentage of new members from our site than it represents of our total sales. So it is a strong channel for us to continue to attract new guests. And as we shared a little bit in our Analyst Day, we have a small percentage of our guests that are actively shopping in between the channels today. But we are doing a lot to encourage them, and we're seeing growth in that activity. So we continue to bring initiatives into the marketplace, designed specifically to get an online guest into our stores, try to drive her in to use a salon service or to shop one of the -- one of our brands in stores and vice versa. When we have a brick-and-mortar customer, make sure he's aware of our online because those guests are some of our best guests and we're going to continue to try to drive that integration across channels. 
Joseph Altobello: Okay. But is that something that you guys are tracking and measuring on a quarterly basis or a monthly basis? 
David Kimbell: Yes, we are certainly tracking that. 
Joseph Altobello: Okay. Got it. And then secondly, in terms of the consumer environment, I think earlier, you guys mentioned that you're very encouraged by what you're seeing so far from a consumer standpoint. This holiday season, how does it look from a promotional standpoint versus last year? 
Mary Dillon: Well, this is the crystal ball part of the show, right. Just kidding. But certainly, the -- I would say a couple of things on the consumer sentiment. I think it's a mixed bag a little bit. I mean, there's certainly a positive economic news that create this more upbeat climate: stock market, employment, GDP. But there's also a lot of pressure on household budget. So if you look at increased costs in health care, food, rent, technology and incomes aren't growing that fast. So I think -- the good news is either way, Ulta's really well-positioned because of our breadth of assortment, our overall value proposition. So we're seeing that play out. As it relates to holiday, then I think the same thing rolls forward. We expect it to continue to be a very competitive time. It's always a time of year that we compete in a broader, I guess, competitive frame because it's more about gift giving, and beauty is part of that, right. It's not only that we're competing against beauty retailers. Certainly, the last couple of years, they've been very promotional. I think what we've been reading in terms of what other retailers are saying so far about the start to the holiday season is we can expect that to continue. So I think that some guests will have more money to spend and some less, but everybody's going to be competing for that share of wallet during the holiday period. We expect that. We feel well positioned with what we've got ready for holiday. I will just add that. We've got a really great lineup in terms of our product offerings and our marketing plans. Our stores are ready. Our DCs are ready. Our e-commerce platform's really performing well. So we feel good about it, but we expect it and that's put into our guidance that we expect that. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Fassler with Goldman Sachs. 
Matthew Fassler: The first question I want to ask is essentially a follow-up to that. So you spoke about the different promotional tools that you have available to you and how you have deployed them to your advantage. Do you expect to continue to just stick with those in the fourth quarter when perhaps the promotional environment tends to intensify and you face more players or you feel like you can use some of your -- or do you have to revert, if I may, to some of the more traditional marketing tactics that you would have used in years past? 
Mary Dillon: Yes, our plan for the fourth quarter is to continue to build on what's working. So I mean, certainly, the -- one of our best tools is our CRM capability, and that holds true even more so during holiday, right, when people are very busy and trying to sort out what to purchase in terms of gifts. One of the things that we've done is we've really -- we've taken our website and organized it around this theme of Give Gorgeously as a section. And it really makes it easy for people to understand kind of if you're looking for gifts for teens or for men or whatever. So we can communicate to our guests directly via email about gifts and certainly hot prices and great products, and we're doing that. And that said, there's also other tactics that we'll continue to use that are about driving traffic and about great prices. So it's really, I think, a combination or a continuation of what we've been doing, with an expectation that there's more competition and, hence, a little more promotion than another quarter. 
Matthew Fassler: That's helpful. And then 2 quick follow-ups for Scott. Scott, can you talk about the magnitude, at least directionally, of merch margin or product margin expansion that you saw here in Q3 relative to what you saw in the earlier part of the year? 
Scott Settersten: Yes. I mean, we started off the year, I think, guiding, right, expansion and margin over the course of the year. Again, in the early part of the year, it was a smaller part of the mix overall. And we're happy to see that play out the way we expected. So we saw 10 basis points of expansion in merch margin year-over-year in the third quarter. We don't expect that necessarily to repeat in the fourth quarter. We'll see how it plays out. We have good plans in place, we think, to try to maintain our momentum there and try to do what we can to expand it. But it is a bit of a different animal in the fourth quarter. And we'll do what we have in the past, right, to protect our market share gains. 
Matthew Fassler: And then finally, just ballpark inventory thought process as we model out year-end. 
Scott Settersten: Yes, we're very happy with -- overall with our inventories. Again, we were up 5.8% year-over-year, which is a little elevated from what we've seen earlier in the year, but we are very confident those are a and b [ph] SKUs that we're buying aggressively because the business is strong. And we're confident that that's going to continue through the fourth quarter. So... 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Evren Kopelman with Wells Fargo. 
Evren Kopelman: I wanted to ask a little bit about industry product trends. We haven't talked about that very much so far. It sounds like color cosmetics have been an area of strength. Do you expect that to continue for you in the next few quarters? Any other trends you're seeing from a product perspective that we should be watching? 
Janet Taake: Sure. From prestige, it has been strong for us quarter-over-quarter for some time now. And a lot of that has really been driven from the evolution of our portfolio over the last several years, the addition of new brands. And we still have brands we've introduced this year that will continue to have increases in next year. So we haven't comp-ed over them yet. So there will be opportunity there. And it's been a strong category for us. And we feel that it will continue. And as far as any trends, there are a lot of different trends, but in color specifically, brow has been a very strong trend this year, continues along with lip. Some of these that we may have mentioned in the past, eye and face, all categories in color have been strong; some of it, new brand introduction, some of it, new innovation. Along with skincare, mask and serums continue to trend very strong. And there are other things, but those are probably the highlights. 
Evren Kopelman: And then on the test-and-learn initiative you've had in place, are those continuing into Q4 and Q1? Or are they being replaced by other tests? I'm just asking more from a -- how to model it from an expense perspective. 
Mary Dillon: Yes. Well, just in terms of the actual tests themselves, there pretty much was -- the third quarter was where we did the testing and spent most of the money. There are some that's into the fourth quarter but a small part of it. Test and learn ongoing is going to be part of our mindset, but I don't expect it to be the kind of investment that we made this year, frankly, because we really were kind of really trying to do a lot at once, and it wasn't planned in our budget. As we look forward, it's part of, again, how we're going to run the business, and it's already built into our guidance in the 5-year plan. 
Scott Settersten: Just to put a point on that, Evren, so of the $10 million that we described starting out the year, most of that now is in the rearview mirror. There's a bit that's still embedded in the fourth quarter, but it's not worth really discussing. And as Mary said, there'll always be -- we'll always have an increment built in, in future years for test-and-learn. It won't be to the same magnitude that it was in 2014. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Mark Altschwager with Robert W. Baird. 
Mark Altschwager: Could you talk a bit more about some of the site enhancement you've made on Get Inspired, Beauty Consultation, Share & Play? Just what are the early learnings there? And any metrics you can share on traffic and conversion that you've been able to attribute to these initiatives? 
David Kimbell: Yes. I don't think we've shared specific metrics related to some of those elements. But I will tell you what -- we're very happy with how the site enhancements are -- have continued to improve the experience overall. And we've invested, as you mentioned, a couple of those but continuing to look for ways to both engage our customers more in beauty and our brands through our content destination, yes, the beauty destination that you talked about, video content that we've been bringing online, shoppable videos, a variety of different ways to try to get consumers to see us as -- increasingly see us as a beauty expert and a leader in the space. And we can see content as a way to do that. And that, we know, has driven traffic and engagement on our site. We've also looked for ways to enhance that shopping experience once we get them there. So things through our cart overlay and how we'll expand -- enhancing that, we did that through the third quarter, even programs like our salon appointments that Mary mentioned in her script. We've enhanced how we're describing and highlighting promos through some different fly-out capabilities. So we're continuing to both enhance and expand the guest experience to attract her there. And once she's there, converged -- convert her. And we believe and we know, through all of our tracking, that it's working. It continues to drive. We had, as you saw in the results, a very strong quarter, and that was driven in -- at least in part by these enhancements and the continued improvement of our site performance overall. 
Mark Altschwager: Great. And then, Mary or Scott, could you just address what you saw in the business around Thanksgiving week and Black Friday, how did your approach differ versus last year and just biggest takeaways overall from that week? 
Mary Dillon: Yes, sure. Well, we're really pleased with our merchandise offers, our marketing communications. I'd say relative to last year, we just continue, I think, to get more honed at understanding our guest and what she needs and really picking our spots. And so I'm pleased with -- I think the team did a great job. And the traffic and sales that came from it that it drove, we're pleased with. Scott already talked about inventory. We're happy with our in-stock position, which is great; with our website performance, which Dave just touched on. Our e-commerce fulfillment capabilities worked really well for us. So the guidance that we've given for Q4 doesn't embed already to what we saw in the -- at the holiday, and we're pleased with it. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Steph Wissink with Piper Jaffray. 
Simeon Gutman: [indiscernible]. 
Mary Dillon: We can't hear you very well. Steph? Operator, why don't we go to the next question? We'll see if we can get Steph back in a bit. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Jill Nelson with Johnson Rice. 
Jill Caruthers: Could you talk about maybe some initial learnings you've gained from the higher staffing model? I know it's in the early stages, but any initial insights? 
Mary Dillon: Yes. We're going to -- we're still in the process of really looking at the trend-out data, the customer satisfaction metrics. We tested a couple of different staffing-type models at different levels. I'd have to say we're pleased with the results. It's certainly -- we had a hypothesis. I don't think it was hard to confirm, but that the more guest-facing time that we can give our stores, the better in terms of conversion and ticket. And we saw that really -- now it's really just a matter of sort of to what extent do you want to invest and how much is return. But we know over time with the supply chain investments and IT investments that these -- the customer-facing hours will naturally become more available to our associates in stores. It'll just take a while for those to play out. So as we build our plan for 2015, we'll certainly be taking those learnings into consideration. I don't expect that it will be a wholesale dramatic change to our store staffing model, but certainly, whether it relates to markets, volume levels, categories, there's a lot that we can play with there. 
Jill Caruthers: Okay. And then just a follow-up. You talked about 100 full-size store openings for 2015. Could you talk about what that implies about kind of that smaller 5,000 square-foot box? Is it still in test mode? Or could that be maybe an incremental add to the 100 planned for next year? 
Mary Dillon: Yes, it's still -- our overall plan in terms of our store growth really was about the traditional store format, the large store format. And we have always said that the small store, we would see the incremental to that. I'm not sure exactly when we're going to start doing more of them. So far, we have 2. The test is early. We're really pleased with the results. But it is a different operating model, everything from learning about how to manage the fact that we have fewer SKUs in the store, so making sure we can allow our guests to be able to order from the store and have it shipped to her home; a different kind of labor model; certainly, a different kind of replenishment model, so all those things will take a little time. We like what we're seeing, but we really want to make sure that as we expand this concept, and we are encouraged about that, but that we really set ourselves up for great success as we do that. 
Scott Settersten: And it's really key for us. We want to monitor during the holiday season now because of the spike in sales and the number of footsteps that come through the door to make sure we can manage all that and to the levels that we want to. So... 
Mary Dillon: But we're encouraged, yes. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Dana Telsey with Telsey Advisory Group. 
Dana Telsey: As you think about the services component, do you have a percentage of sales target from services? And as you look beyond Brow Bar, are there other services that you may add and how their margin and contribution is versus product? And then lastly, given that the salon customers spend 2.5x more than non-salon guests and shop more frequently, do you see -- how do you see that interacting with the loyalty programs since now they represent less than 7%. Could it be more? 
Mary Dillon: Yes, absolutely. We -- one of the reasons that it's one of the pillars that we put into our strategic plan is that we're very excited and committed to the notion of services as a growth driver for us in the future for all the reasons that you understand, right. So I think, Dave, we mentioned this. This is our best guest. The service salon guest comes more frequently and spends more than any other guests. And it really enhances our beauty authority. And it also enhances the sort of bricks-and-mortar reason for being. There's many others than just that, but it's certainly part of the equation, that we think is part of our unique proposition, right, the services and the breadth of categories and types of brands all in 1 place. So we've just started, I'd say, in this. We're already doing some CRM to make our -- get our current loyalty members aware. We've seen positive response on that. We've added this online booking tool which was -- drove a lot of new guest acquisition, which was great. I mean a small number so far because we just started, but 80% of those folks booking online were new guests to us. So I guess the other thing to think about in terms of the types of services, we want to be really known and great at what we're really known and really great at, which is salon, which is about hair, our brows and our skin services through Dermalogica. There's a lot of growth that can be had within all of those, and that's what our focus is going to be versus continuing to add new -- new services would be added within the context of the service pillars that we already offer. So for example, in hair, you can imagine there's lots of things, whether it's doing even more blowouts, which we do today, or special-occasion hair. In brows, we just started doing something just for holidays, which is about blinging out brows. Did I get that right, Janet? 
Janet Taake: Yes. 
Mary Dillon: But besides pimping, doing fun brow services that add a special holiday sparkle, I guess I'd call it. So there's lots of ways, I think, to grow within the service core that we have today. 
Operator: Our next question is from Steph Wissinik with Piper Jaffray. 
Simeon Gutman: Sorry about that. Just a question quickly on your mobile traffic to your site. Have you been tracking that? And anything you're learning from your mobile app. 
David Kimbell: Yes. We absolutely continue to see that taking -- becoming a bigger, bigger part of our overall business. And the strong growth in the third quarter, and we've seen that actually continue. So what we're -- we launched a new iPad app in the third quarter. We've seen that increase. We will expect to see there in peak periods that both the traffic can be up to -- 50% of our traffic can be through our mobile applications, any of our mobile applications, a little less of the orders. But certainly, the traffic engagement and learning of our products would be increasingly on one of our mobile applications. And so we're investing heavily to make sure that's a strong part of our plan going forward. 
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, at this time, there are no further questions. I would like to turn the floor back to management for closing comments. 
Mary Dillon: I just want to say thank you, all, for your attention and interest in Ulta and to all of the Ulta associates for a great job in the third quarter and your readiness and execution for the holiday season. So thank you very much. 
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.

===== 2014 Q2  (2014-09-11 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Greetings, and welcome to the Ulta Beauty Second Quarter 2014 Earnings Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.
 I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Ms. Laurel Lefebvre, Vice President, Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin. 
Laurel Lefebvre: Thank you. Good afternoon, and thanks for joining us for Ulta Beauty's Second Quarter 2014 Conference Call. Hosting our call are Mary Dillon, Chief Executive Officer; and Scott Settersten, Chief Financial Officer.
 Also joining us are Janet Taake, Chief Merchandising Officer; and Dave Kimbell, Chief Marketing Officer.

 During this call we make references to the metric free cash flow, a non-GAAP financial measure defined as cash provided by operating activities, minus purchases of property and equipment.
 I'll now turn the call over to Mary. 
Mary Dillon: Thank you, Laurel. Good afternoon, everyone. We're delighted to announce very strong second quarter results and to share the outcome of our updated strategic plan and financial targets. I'll talk about our long-term vision, 5-year financial targets and strategic imperatives today, then following up with more detail at Analyst Day in Chicago next month.
 First, a quick review of the second quarter headlines. We grew the top line 22% and drove the best comp we've achieved since the second quarter of 2012. Total company comparable sales were 9.6% on top of an 8.4% comp in the second quarter of 2013, both including the impact of ulta.com. Strength in prestige and mass cosmetics, boosted by some very successful new products and brands, as well as rapid growth in e-commerce, drove these exceptional results.
 We were pleased to see transaction growth contribute more than ticket growth to our same-store sales. Solid gross margin performance reflected strong sales of prestige and professional haircare categories, coupled with fewer discounts compared to a year ago.
 Earnings per share grew 34%, with strong flow-through from better-than-expected sales, healthy product margins and some benefit from the timing of marketing expenses. Scott will discuss the second quarter in more detail and the outlook for the rest of 2014 in just a few moments.
 Now I'd like to walk you through a review of our strategic planning process and our new 5-year financial targets. As a reminder, we set out several months ago to refresh our strategic plan. This process was led by me and my full senior team. We formed a fact-based, guest-centric and total enterprise view of the guest experience that we want to deliver in the future and determine what is required to do so. We feel confident about the opportunity to continue to drive growth in guest satisfaction in the years ahead.
 Our approach was to understand Ulta's current strengths and opportunities and then project guest needs, the potential competitive set and the omnichannel landscape of the future. We define Ulta's path from the perspectives of brand positioning, guest experience, products and services portfolio and store and e-commerce expansion plans. We also projected the IT and supply chain requirements to achieve our strategy, then considered the financial impact of all those factors to establish a 5-year plan that delivers sustainable growth and strong shareholder returns.
 To summarize the primary outcomes of this work, we've identified 6 strategic imperatives as the foundation of continued strong growth. We've identified areas of focus and investment that give us confidence that we can maintain strong top and bottom line growth rates. We developed a 5-year financial model to support the strategic framework. And finally, we developed a capital allocation strategy.
 We think about this strategic plan as evolutionary, not revolutionary. At the outset, we recognized that our core business model is strong. The original insight of our founders that women want a shopping experience that reflects the entire range of her beauty purchases is still very relevant today, almost 25 years after the first store opened. So the core of what Ulta is all about is not changing. This was about sharpening our view and getting even more focused on delivering a relevant and differentiated business model that drives sustainable profitable growth.
 In fact, we believe many of the key drivers of our past results still have plenty of runway and will continue to deliver, namely, new store growth; expansion of our prestige assortment; a strong, compelling loyalty program; a clear guest target, a woman we refer to as the beauty enthusiast, she represents about half of the spend in the beauty category, she's highly engaged in newness and discovery; a highly differentiated offering with an unmatched breadth of assortment across categories, brands and services; and rapid e-commerce growth.
 We also agreed on key opportunities we want to focus on to ensure long-term sustainable growth. And those include increasing Ulta's brand awareness and acquiring more new customers; becoming less reliant on discounting over time in a careful and measured way; and developing the omnichannel capabilities our guests expect us to offer to keep pace with the marketplace. Examples of these capabilities will include ordering in-store and delivery to home and checking availability of inventory online, as well as others.
 We established our vision for the future of Ulta to be the unmatched beauty authority by providing women a compelling, unique and on-trend array of products and experiences. We aspire to become the favorite beauty destination, the most loved and admired by our guests, associates, communities, partners and investors.
 Supporting this vision, we articulated 6 strategic imperatives that we believe will drive sustainable growth for Ulta: One, acquire new guests and deepen loyalty with existing guests; two, differentiate by delivering a distinctive and personalized guest experience across all channels; three, offer relevant, innovative and often exclusive products that excite our guests; four, deliver exceptional services in 3 core areas,  hair, skin health and brows; five, grow stores and e-commerce to reach and serve more guests; and six, invest in infrastructure to support our guest experience and growth and capture scale efficiencies.
 At the upcoming Analyst Day, we plan to give you more color on each of these 6 strategic imperatives and show you how we'll bring the Ulta brand experience to life for our guests. 
 The main components of our new 5-year financial targets are as follows. We expect to maintain comparable sales growth in the 5% to 7% range. We plan to open approximately 100 stores per year. For the next couple of years, these are expected to be almost entirely our 10,000 square foot prototype, pending findings from our upcoming small-store test. We anticipate that e-commerce will grow to represent about 10% of our sales. This model is expected to deliver earnings per share growth in the low 20% range over the next 5 years, excluding the impact of the supply chain investment.
 As you know, we're making significant investments in systems and supply chain, including a multiyear supply chain transformation designed to improve our inventory productivity, in-stocks and to free up labor in stores to be more customer facing.
 This supply chain work will also enable omnichannel capabilities to position us to keep up with changing consumers' expectations in the years ahead. This investment is expected to reduce our earnings per share growth rate by percentage points in the mid-single digits in 2015 and '16. After which, we anticipate EPS growth will return to the low 20% range. And these targets exclude any benefit from share repurchases.
 Despite these investments, operating margin is expected to remain stable for the next couple of years before heading up towards our long-term mid-teens target.
 These targeted range are not meant to represent specific guidance for 2015. We'll provide guidance for 2015 at the time we normally announce annual guidance, which will be on our March 2015 earnings call.
  Now turning to our capital allocation strategy. We recognize that we have more cash than we need on the balance sheet today, and this cash is expected to grow significantly over time as our business grows and our CapEx needs moderate. We plan to maintain our strong balance sheet and maintain enough cash to invest in organic growth, as well as to keep some dry powder for potential acquisitions or partnerships in the future. And we do plan to buy back shares going forward.
 We expect to offset dilution and, beyond that, give ourselves a flexibility to buy back more aggressively based on market conditions. Today, we announced a new share repurchase authorization for $300 million, which replaces our existing program. We announced our intention to implement a 10b5-1 plan to give us that flexibility.
 I believe our plan represents a strong set of strategic imperatives and initiatives and that our results will place Ulta in the top tier of high-performing retailers. We'll continue to drive market share gains and deliver strong sustainable sales and earnings growth, making our company a very attractive investment.
 I also know that we have the best associates in the industry who love what they do and are excited to bring more beauty into the lives of our guests.
 So let me turn over now to Scott to cover the quarter and updates to our 2014 guidance. 
Scott Settersten: Thanks, Mary. Good afternoon, everyone.
 Second quarter sales were $734.2 million compared to $601 million last year, an increase of 22.2%. Comparable sales increased 9.6%. The retail-only comp was 8.3% with the salon business comping slightly higher at 8.4%. E-commerce growth of 54.9% added 130 basis points to the comp. 
 We were very pleased with the balance between transaction and ticket increases, with transactions up 5.8% and ticket up 3.8%. The ticket increase was driven by a modest increase in units per transaction, but mostly by higher average selling price due to strength in prestige categories and less discounting overall. Retail-only comparable transactions increased 5%, a significant acceleration compared to the first quarter.
 Since we're spending quite a bit of time on this call discussing the strategic plan and long-term financial targets, we thought we would share a condensed version of our usual discussion of our business drivers. From a real estate perspective, we opened 19 stores during Q2 ending the quarter with 715 stores. We also completed 4 remodels. New store productivity remains strong, and we're also seeing solid comps in our more mature stores as all classes of stores are benefiting from the momentum in new brand and product launches.
 On the merchandising front, newness continues to be a major driver of our business. After rolling out IT Cosmetics and Mally to every store during first quarter, these new brands were solid contributors to our growth. We are also pleased with the success of our chain-wide expansion of Urban Decay and excellent results in our Clinique, Lancôme and Benefit boutiques.
 Exciting new product launches during the quarter included an innovative liquid foundation from bareMinerals, a highly anticipated eyeliner to complement Benefit's best-selling They're Real Mascara, as well as new fragrances like Armani Sì and Marc Jacobs Daisy Dream.
 To update you on our loyalty program and CRM. We now have 14 million active members and are very pleased with the performance of the markets that were converted to the ULTAmate Rewards point-based program in February. Having all customers on one platform allows us to communicate the benefits of the loyalty program more efficiently and deliver CRM campaigns across the entire loyalty customer base compared to just half our customers before the conversion.
 On the marketing side. Second quarter highlights included our Love Your Hair event, which we enhanced with content more focused on education and benefits versus just price promotions. We also saw excellent results from our semiannual event promoting jumbo sizes of haircare products at great prices.
 Finally, turning to ulta.com. We continue to see strong performance from our e-commerce business. In July, we released exciting new features and functionalities to the site, designed to enhance the discovery and browse experience with the addition of rich editorial content. New pages for Get Inspired, Beauty Consultation and Share & Play focus on trends, new arrivals, best-kept secrets, advice and social content. We added online booking capability for our salon appointments for all stores. We also began to host live chats on ulta.com featuring some of our vendor partners like the founders of the brand Carol's Daughter and Tarte, which were very well received by our guests.
 Finally, we released our first iPad app in July, designed to provide our guests with a unique opportunity to browse, discover and share our products.
 Turning back to the P&L. Gross profit dollars increased 22.3% to $259.3 million. Gross profit margin was flat year-over-year at 35.3%, primarily driven by stronger-than-expected sales of prestige cosmetics and professional haircare products, as well as a modest rent and occupancy leverage on higher-than-expected same-store sales. This was offset by a slight deleverage in supply chain expense due to costs associated with the expansion of e-commerce fulfillment capabilities in our Chambersburg distribution center.
 SG&A expenses rose 17.4% to $157.8 million, down 90 basis points as a percentage of sales at 21.5% versus 22.4% last year, primarily due to leverage on strong sales as well as timing of marketing spend.
 We also pushed some of the planned expenses related to test-and-learn initiatives later in the year. About half of our earnings outperformance in the quarter was due to the impact of SG&A expenses moved later in the year.
 Preopening expense was $3.6 million compared to $4.8 million in Q2 of 2013, driven by 19 store openings during the quarter compared to 33 new stores opened last year. Operating margin increased 120 basis points to 13.3% versus 12.1% in Q2 of last year. Net income increased 35.4% to $60.8 million or $0.94 per diluted share versus $44.9 million or $0.70 per diluted share last year. Earnings per share grew 34.3%.
 Turning to the balance sheet. Inventories were $541.5 million at the end of the quarter compared to $461.2 million at the end of Q2 2013, driven by 106 net new stores opened since August last year. Inventories were flat on a per-store basis as our supply chain and store teams continued to keep inventory very clean.
 Capital expenditures were $55 million for the quarter, driven primarily by our new store opening program, as well as supply chain and IT investments. And depreciation and amortization for the quarter were $31.9 million.
 We moved $100 million of the cash on our balance sheet to short-term investments with a maturity of less than 12 months and, as a result, ended the quarter with $363 million in cash. Our free cash flow year-to-date is about $39 million, and we're well on track to generate more than $100 million in free cash flow this year.
 With a very strong first half of the year under our belt, we are raising our view of our full year performance. We anticipate comparable sales to increase in the 7% to 8% range and total sales to increase in the 20% range for the year. We expect that earnings per share will be in the 20% range this year, excluding any impact related to share repurchase activity. We expect to invest about $265 million in capital in 2014.
 Turning now more specifically to the third quarter of 2014. We expect sales to increase in the range of $724 million to $736 million versus $618.8 million last year. We expect comparable sales to increase in the range of 6% to 8%. Preopening expense is expected to come in around $7.1 million, with 50 stores planned to open in the third quarter. We expect to achieve earnings per share in the range of $0.79 to $0.84 compared to $0.70 in Q3 of last year. Our tax rate is expected to be approximately 38.2% and our fully diluted share count will be approximately 64.8 million, excluding any potential share repurchase activity.
 With that, I'll turn the call over to our conference call host to begin the Q&A session. Operator? 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from the line of Mr. Brian Tunick with JPMorgan Chase. 
Brian Tunick: Two questions. One, maybe just some more color on the SG&A timing shift, how that's changed and what we should be thinking there. And then maybe on the -- Mary, can you talk about the 1,200-store target? I know in the guidance, you talked about around 100 stores a year. But just ahead of the Analyst Day, I guess, can you talk about sort of, is at least 1,200 stores in the big format and then small markets can add to that? And does that change as you think about e-commerce becoming 10% of sales? Just curious about what you think long term about the 1,200-store target. 
Mary Dillon: Sure, Brian, thank you. And let me start with the store question. So as I said, we're reiterating that our target has been and continues to be at least 1,200 stores and that, we think about that as really our current 10,000 square foot format and our suburban-type market. And we'll talk more about this at Analyst Day, but one of the things that we're learning about right now is the small-store format that we're opening up 2 of this year. We're going to learn a lot about that. So given how our stores are performing, we think that's a pretty good target, possibly conservative target. If we find a small-format city of interest, those would largely be incremental to our 10,000 square foot format. We're starting those in some more rural markets and in the future potentially urban markets. That would be down the road. New stores continue to be a great investment and they continue to perform. And we think about, relative to our strategic plan, getting more stores is a great way for us to get more guests. Beauty is a business that really is contingent on new experience that involves the physical experience. And as we see our guest experience in the future being able to really delight our guests, obviously, stores and e-commerce can work really well together, we think, to deliver on that. Our store expansion's always going to be contingent on finding high-quality sites. We have a very robust and rigorous process, but we continue to see plenty of excellent real estate opportunities in the years to come. 
Scott Settersten: And as far as the SG&A question is concerned, as we mentioned in our prepared remarks, roughly half of the beat for the quarter is SG&A-related kind of expenses, so call it $0.05. Roughly half of that is marketing; the other half is test-and-learn. So the test-and-learn program was delayed a little bit, more than what we expected when we gave second quarter guidance. So we thought it was better to wait until we have those projects properly scoped and metrics aligned so we knew how to measure success at the completion of the test period. And on the advertising or marketing side, those were efficiencies that were identified by our marketing teams in the first half of the year or second quarter that we expect to redeploy in fourth quarter to drive more new customer acquisition kind of activities. 
Operator: Our next question is coming from the line of Daniel Hofkin with William Blair & Co. 
Daniel Hofkin: Just wanted to -- first, with regard to the comp and obviously, a very strong performance, where are you seeing kind of the most upside across the age of stores? Is it pretty balanced or is it more newer comping stores? Just that would be my first question. 
Scott Settersten: Dan, I would say the general rule of thumb is when you have strong performance being driven by these new brand launches and exciting new things that merchants are bringing into the business, it really -- rising tides lift all boats in this business. I know I've said that before to many of our investors. I mean, it's not a single class of store or a vintage of stores or older stores versus newer stores. It really helps drive productivity in the whole fleet. 
Daniel Hofkin: Okay. Great. And then with regard to the long-term plan, particularly impressed about on the comp sales outlook. Obviously, some of that is that the new plan includes e-commerce, whereas I think the old one, 3 to 5, did not. But could you comment on what are some of the things that -- what are some of the components of that or what are the things that you expect to kind of help drive a stronger underlying comp? 
Mary Dillon: Sure. Well, first of all, we're in a growing industry, right. Especially the prestige side of beauty has been showing good growth and we participate heavily in that. As we look at our guests and look at her needs in the future, we believe that there's more market share that we can gain with the beauty enthusiasts and that our insights about how to meet our needs continue to deepen every day. So in that sense, we think there's plenty of opportunity for growth. We also know that, we've talked about this, the majority of our current growth is coming from our current loyalty members, which is great, and they love what Ulta has to offer. But an area of opportunity for us, as a big part of our test-and-learn this summer or this fall now, is about how do we get new guests to become aware of and try or either retry, perhaps, Ulta. So we think about it almost as a relaunch of the Ulta proposition. And again, there's plenty of women that are in this consumer segment that we believe would be very attracted to our proposition. So new guest acquisition, e-commerce growth, as you said, store growth, all those 6 strategic imperatives are largely around driving -- are different ways to drive growth. 
Operator: Our next question is coming from the line of Aram Rubinson with Wolfe Research. 
Aram Rubinson: I wanted to ask you a bit about your current capabilities. We hear a lot about investments, a little bit last year, this year and obviously, for the next 2. Can you just give us a sense as to what you're capable of today and what you'd like to be capable of, whether it's warehouse management systems or merchandise systems or financial systems or distribution? Just can you give us a little bit of a lay of the land of where you are now with all of these capabilities and what you think you're missing and where you'll be in those couple of years that you can do that you can't do now? 
Mary Dillon: Yes, well, first of all, Aram, our business is obviously running pretty darn well today, right. So we obviously have some core capabilities that we're using every day to execute the business. What we have identified is a couple of things. One is, as everybody knows, retail is changing rapidly in terms of guest expectations. So the omnichannel aspect of our capability is one we need to invest and to grow. We anticipate that the guest in the future is going to want a seamless experience and one that we don't necessarily offer today. It's not a big barrier to our growth, I'd say, as you see the performance that we're having. But we know that that's going to be something that she's going to need to have in the future. So a more seamless ability to buy something, bring it back to the store, order in store, have it shipped at home, be able to know in advance what we have in inventory in our stores. All those kind of basic shopping and retail capabilities are part of what we'll be investing in. Also, just as a part of this investment is really just around growth. As we continue to go down this growth path, which is a strong growth path, and we continue to drive a number of our stores, we need more capacity in the system. And so that's part of the investment, too, which are just pretty straightforward. And also, we just think overall end-to-end, we could have a more efficient system than we have today. So whether it's how we receive our orders and work with our vendors, how our stores are stocked as the product comes into the stores, there's plenty -- and how we forecast and replenish, we know that there's ways that we can be smoother, I guess faster, have less out of stocks. All those things that we know will just help our business be more -- a better experience for our guests and drive some efficiencies in the long run. 
Aram Rubinson: So if I can just drill down into that just a little bit. So I mean, are we on an automated replenishment? Do we have kind of store scheduling for labor? Just trying to figure out. Do we have a space optimization program? Do we have price optimization? Are all these things kind of totally new or are they -- I'm just trying to understand whether you have these capabilities or not. 
Scott Settersten: Yes, I don't know if we want to go through a specific laundry list of what's in and what's out, Aram. But I will say, what you described predominantly, we don't operate in that kind of environment today. So we've got good systems in our stores. Over the last couple of years, we've made some investments in store laboring, and we're working on task management in the stores. We're just about ready to finalize our rollout with a new POS system, which we think will be best-in-class kind of checkout experience for our guests, so again, early stages of that. On the supply chain and the merchandise organization, I think you've heard and I think many of our long-term investors have heard us say that we still do things kind of the hard way. We muscle through a lot of things that we know factually that there's better, more efficient ways to do that, whether it's forecast and replenishment, which Mary mentioned, and helping our vendors help us forecast the business and get it to our DCs more effectively and getting it to our stores, right, in the right kind of what I would say, delivery mode, boxes so it's shelf ready, ready to -- so that we can take time out of the backroom and get it into more guest-facing time. 
Operator: Our next question is coming from the line of Oliver Chen with Citigroup. 
Oliver Chen: Regarding the outlook for the gross margin. Your inventories are under really good control at this point. The gross margin comparison, as we look at it, is a little bit harder than easier in the fourth quarter. Is the expectation that you'll be able to keep promotions under control versus last year? And how are you seeing kind of the promotional environment unfold as we approach holiday? 
Mary Dillon: Okay. Oliver, thank you. The promotional environment, right, that's -- we expect that as we get into the holiday, it will continue to be a competitive promotional holiday. I don't think there's any reason to think that, that will -- it's always going to be like that, right. Now the overall sentiment right now, consumer sentiment, is strong. And I think we hear retailers feeling pretty optimistic about their inventory situation going into holiday. But nonetheless, we know that's a competitive time. We're also seeing some success. And again, I would say we're walking before we run. But we're, I think, every day getting better at how we can use some of our tools like our CRM capabilities to be more targeted with our offers and drive value in ways that are less about price discounting. So would we need to be more promotional than last year? I doubt it. Will it be a promotional holiday? We'd expect that. But we feel, as you can see in our guidance, optimistic about the rest of the year. 
Scott Settersten: And, Oliver, I would just add, as far as rate goes, again, gross profit margin rate overall was flat year-to-year in the quarter. And you may recall last quarterly call, we mentioned loyalty program, right, is still going to be a headwind for us for the rest of the year. There's still some product mix challenges that we have. We did a good job this quarter overcoming some of that, and we have more of that planned for the rest of the year. So we'll do our -- do the best we can to make sure we keep that all in balance. 
Oliver Chen: Okay. And, Mary, on the product side, one of the strategic highlights is the focus on hair, skincare -- skin health and brows. Is that consistent with how you have been? Or are there categories that you may deemphasize as you focus on these 3? And… 
Mary Dillon: Yes, those -- I'm sorry, go ahead. 
Oliver Chen: And I was also just curious about articulating your thoughts on your competitive advantage versus department stores. 
Mary Dillon: Sure, okay. Well, first of all, that strategic imperative, actually, I was talking about services. And actually, one of the earlier questions was about levers for growth. And I should have mentioned we do see that our services are absolutely one of the areas that strategically are important to us, to your point, one of our points of differentiation, and we believe an area that we can focus on to drive future growth. Our salon guest -- salon's a small part of our business today as you know. That's our best guest, though. She comes more frequently, she spends more and she loves the experience. And we've kind of carved about 3 pillars that we think we excel in today and can excel in even more in the future. And it's about the hair, basically cut and color, and also hair services that involve trend like braids, things like that. On the skin side, as you know, we have a partnership with Dermalogica, and we have trained aestheticians at our stores; a small part of our business today in terms of that service. We know that could be an -- it will be an area of growth. And then lastly, brows, particularly through our partnership with Benefit and the Brow Bars. So we look at those 3 pillars of service as areas that we will focus on and drive. We're experimenting already today with how to drive more new guests to try our salon and come back. And those often, not as much as I'd like, but often have products attached to them. So you can imagine that's a great flywheel for us. So that's an area, and it really dovetails, I guess, with your second question, which is part of the work we do in the strategic plan is to just really step back and say, what is our competitive advantage today and what would it be in the future? And it's a competitive industry. Everybody's interested in beauty. It's a growth industry, but we've got advantages that we think we can really push and accelerate. And it is about this total guest experience that we think will get even better as we allow our associates in store to have even more guest-facing time, as perhaps our systems get more efficient in some of the ways that Scott described. And at Ulta, she'll be able to get an experience that's very different and unique. It's different than the department stores, different than mass outlets and different than other specialty stores and that -- and we plan that, that will be kind of our cores. We differentiate and we'll lead with that. 
Operator: Our next question is coming from the line of Gary Balter with Crédit Suisse.
 [Technical Difficulty] 
Operator: It appears there's a connection issue with Mr. Balter's line. We'll move on to the next question, coming from the line of Matthew Fassler with Goldman Sachs. 
Matthew Fassler: My first question relates to capital. Obviously, you talked about the SG&A impact of some of the investments you're going to make. Can you talk about, as the store growth, I guess, flattens out, whether the investments that you're making contemplate any kind of bump in CapEx? And then also related to capital, you talked about buying back stock at least at the level you would need to offset dilution. What is the typical dilution you would see in a given year from options issuance? 
Scott Settersten: As far as the CapEx question is concerned, we're projecting $265 million for 2014. Directionally, that might be at a slightly more elevated rate over the next couple of years as we get through the supply chain cycle year event. But it would -- we expect it to moderate once we get past 2016, generally speaking. And as far as dilution or dilution is concerned we'd expect that to be roughly maybe 1 percentage point, Matt, you could estimate is what the buyback dilutive offset would be. 
Matthew Fassler: Got it. One other quick financial question and a strategic one. As we think about the $0.05 or so that you deferred from the second quarter to the remainder of the year, should we think about it as being roughly half and half Q3, Q4 based on the comments you made earlier? 
Scott Settersten: Yes, I think that's a good approximation. 
Matthew Fassler: Great. And then finally, I know you'll have an extensive strategic discussion in Chicago in a few weeks, but very briefly on mobile. And my interest and you talked about having the iPad app, which, on the one hand, I guess you're not the first retailer; on the other hand, it's because of the opportunity. Can you talk about how you think your customer and your category deploys mobile differently than for other retail categories? And what you think its potential is relative to the online business that you've been doing already? 
Mary Dillon: Sure. Well, obviously, mobile is a growing part of our business as it is for everybody, and we know that that's increasingly a way that our guests engage with our brand as well as others. Probably one of the biggest opportunities for us with mobile is the ability for her to be learning about content, about brands and products and services, whether she's in our store or not in our store or outside of our store. As well as for our associates; a part of our technology plan is to allow them to have more access to mobile technology in the stores so that she can be an even bigger expert on every brand that we offer than she is today. Frankly, our associates, it's hard to be able to do that all the time. Having more access to mobile information helps get us to the same position that our guests are in. Mobile transactions are continuing to grow as a percentage of our transactions, and we'll expect that to continue to happen. 
Operator: Our next question is coming from the line of Ike Boruchow with Sterne Agee. 
Irwin Boruchow: Mary, I wanted to know, can we dive in a little bit on the new marketing -- new customer acquisition side and things that you've been doing and tests you've been doing regionally with some new marketing and your CRM capabilities? Then to take that a step further, could you comment on the traffic increase you saw in the quarter and maybe how much of that was new customer traffic and how that compares with the prior couple of quarters? 
Mary Dillon: Well, you know what? Really, at the Analyst Day, we'll have more color on some of the test-and-learns and the experiments that we're doing. There's a couple of different things going on. One is we have an end market advertising test that just started in several markets to see just sort of in a general way can we drive new customer acquisition through basically driving awareness through a more mass media and digital media kind of approach? So that's something that's just started, and we'll know a lot more about that soon. And that's one way. We know that basically top of mind awareness for Ulta is not as high as it can be. And we believe that by driving that awareness and positioning the brand in a way that we know we represent, which is this great place for women to discover and have fun with beauty, that we think there's upside there. So we'll learn more about that. And certainly, Dave Kimbell and his team are also using our CRM capability to run, I guess, several small-scale experiments right now around how can we either get guests who are coming as often as we'd like, to see what could incent her to come more often, or using multiple forms of either social marketing to see if we can target new prospective guests to try Ulta. So a lot of that is in process, and we feel optimistic that that'll be part of our growth strategy going forward. 
Irwin Boruchow: Could you comment if you -- are you already beginning to see some of the fruits of your labor on the new customer acquisition front? 
Mary Dillon: Yes. Most of our sales right now are really being driven by our current guests. And she's coming more often and spending more, which is great. So it's really, I'd say, early stages. Now our e-commerce business is one of the ways that we are seeing some new customer acquisition, and that, again, will be an area for growth for us as well. 
Operator: Our next question is again coming from the line of Gary Balter. 
Gary Balter: Following up on Ike's question a little bit. Mary, when you first came and met with a lot of the sales side people, one of your concerns was that Ulta isn't as well-known as people like Sephora, and you were trying to figure out how do we improve that. Obviously, you've had great traffic drivers this quarter. As you -- without giving all the answers to the October 15 meeting, what's your perception now of Ulta? Do you feel that you've made some nice progress in terms of the customer understanding who you are and have you closed the gap a lot? And have you changed your perception of it? 
Mary Dillon: Okay. Thank you, Gary. I would characterize that less of a concern that I saw and more of an opportunity, and I still see it today because I think we're really in the early stages of driving that new customer acquisition. So most of what we're doing right now, we're refining the tactics that we've used previously, and I think getting even better at them. But they're largely targeted at our current loyalty members and that's largely where our growth is coming from, which is great. It says that our current guests love us, they're coming more often and spending more, and we're getting growth on e-commerce, and some of that is new guests. But we believe, again, why we're confident about the long-term targets that we're providing is that there's still that opportunity. So I would say really, Gary, I wouldn't feel -- I don't think it's very different today in terms of the awareness and sharpness of the perception of Ulta. But we have done the work to identify more insights about our current guests, prospective guests and how to position and really drive awareness to the brand. And we'll know more as these tests run, so I don't want to overpromise. We don't know yet what the response will be, but that work is still in process and we'll know a lot soon. 
Operator: Our next question is coming from the line of Neely Tamminga with Piper Jaffray. 
Neely Tamminga: Just 2 quick questions, hyper-specific here. On the new POS system, what are some of the key functionalities that are making you guys feel excited about launching this new POS system, number one? And number two, what sort of kind of key metrics or problems or KPIs, however you want to look at it, on the e-commerce business are you looking to address over the next couple of years? I mean, is it really kind of about bounce rate through the e-mail campaigns? Is it about cart abandonment? Like give us some sense of what you're going to improve on the e-commerce side, too. 
Mary Dillon: Okay. Thank you. So the POS front, I'd say a couple of key categories would benefit us. One is speed of transaction, which we know there's always a little bit of a learning curve, but our associates, or the ones who are using it, love it. And they are seeing the benefits of it. So we know that that'll help speed the transaction, as well as going to give us the ability to have more information about our guest when she comes in. So over time, we believe that that's going to help us to even be more personalized in terms of what we offer her. And also, one of the capabilities is going to be to be able to order in the store and have it delivered to your home. So we think about, for example, on our small-store tests, those are smaller stores, not going to carry every single SKU. So the ability for our guests to be able to still have access to everything that we sell will be a benefit as well. Those are just a few of them. Dave, do you want to comment on the e-com metrics? 
David Kimbell: Yes, absolutely. As we look at e-commerce, first of all, we're really pleased with the results that we've had so far. We're really just about a year into the relaunch of our site and really happy with that. And because we're really still relatively new and that there's a lot of foundational pieces, that we're really still very much focused on driving traffic. We continue to have success in getting new customers and potential customers to come to our site. We saw traffic increase pretty significantly in the second quarter last year through -- this year through sharper, more sophisticated customer acquisition efforts. So we'll continue to do that. Our conversion rate, through optimization of our site experience, we really significantly improved a year ago. And we're continuing to fine-tune that experience, things through the check-out process, the way the cart works. We're making improvements through that site experience to make sure we're, as you mentioned, limiting cart abandonment and maximizing conversion. And our AOB, as we get -- as we improve our merchandising approach, get learnings about what's working in the e-commerce environment, maximize the understanding of our best guest and how she's experiencing both our brick-and-mortar retail and our online and personalize and to customize our marketing to her, we think we're making progress on AOB through our merchandise, and we'll continue to do that. So a lot of it is really foundational and we're going to continue to focus on those efforts going forward. 
Operator: Our next question is coming from the line of Evren Kopelman with Wells Fargo. 
Evren Kopelman: Two questions. First is on the comp growth, the strong comp growth in the quarter. Do you have a sense of how much that conversion of the half the people to the new loyalty program in the first quarter, how much that is helping traffic this year as people are getting more e-mails about their points and things like that? And then the second question is on the e-commerce. Can you discuss how you expect the product mix and the margin to evolve over your long-term horizon? 
Scott Settersten: As far as the comp drivers for the quarter, I guess I will tell you, we're not going to be able to just aggregate the comp loyalty versus non or new versus old customer, existing customer. We can say with certainty that typically, historically what we saw when we implemented the loyalty programs is that it took a while for the customers to kind of come back. The sales performance was a little weaker on conversion. And then we kind of cycled back through the course of like a full 1-year period, we kind of get the comp back. This time, again hopefully, we learned some lessons on our last conversion cycle. This time we've seen sales kind of maintain, so we haven't seen any degradation or any weakness in sales with those people that have been converted. So that was a really great sign for us that the conversion has gone very well. As far as product margin mix is concerned, I think we're talking about 2014, Evren. We talked overall on margin rate that we still have this loyalty headwind. We will expect to have that for the remainder of 2014. We're still seeing one of our more important categories, professional male, has been a bit weaker than what we are expecting this year, so that's a headwind on our margin rate as well. Again, the merchant team is working hard to try to mitigate that. We saw some of that in the second quarter with better performance than we were expecting, and we'll continue to do that in the back half of the year. 
Operator: Our next question is coming from the line of Joe Altobello with Oppenheimer. 
Joseph Altobello: I just want to start with the e-commerce target you guys talked about earlier, the 10% of sales. How does that benchmark against some of your peers in what they're doing today, for example? And then secondly, in terms of the required investment to get there, are we talking a step function or is it more incremental investment on the infrastructure side to allow for that 10% of sales from e-commerce? 
David Kimbell: Yes. I think competitively, we feel there's a wide range of our competitors and we're actually probably not as much focused on where our competitors are. We think 10% is a really both attainable and smart place for us to be. Our focus within e-commerce, as we've talked before, is to make sure we're serving our customer where she needs to be, where she wants to be served, but also finding ways to get her to experience our full breadth of offerings, including our in-store products and services. And we think 10% is the right guide path to get us -- target to get us to that. As far as the investments? 
Scott Settersten: Yes. We saw most of it, the step-up in investments, back in 2012 and 2013, and I think we've talked about that and called those numbers out. That was really the step function, I think, as you use that term. Future investments are embedded in the supply chain numbers that we've given today and built into the overall CapEx that we'll talk about in more detail as we get to the future. So again, I wouldn't expect there to be any kind of an extraordinary step-up in the investment call for that business. 
Joseph Altobello: Okay, Scott. And then secondly, in terms of acquisitions, you referenced that earlier. Are you talking more square footage acquisitions or could you guys, in fact, purchase brands or partner with companies on brands? 
Mary Dillon: Yes. We haven't defined all that yet. But generally speaking, I'd say we would have more of an interest in things that we could -- that would strengthen what we offer to our guests. We think we're pretty darn good at what we do, but we know there's opportunities out there to bring her news and innovation and exclusiveness. So that would be more likely the area we'd focus on, but we don't have anything planned right now. 
Operator: Our next question is coming from the line of Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. 
Simeon Gutman: Stepping back a little bit with regard to investments, next couple of years, they'll be a little heavier. When they go away, when they subside and earnings growth reaccelerates, does that reflect the cost of them just being lifted? Or does it factor in that the business itself becomes more efficient? So in other words, are you baking in anything, any benefits in those out years? 
Scott Settersten: Yes. There's definitely benefits from our supply chain investments from some of the other, what I'd call, just pure P&L kind of charges that we're thinking about, like marketing, incremental marketing efforts, whether or not we tweak the store payroll model at all, which is yet to be determined. We're still testing that. But anything that we would contemplate along those lines, we would fully expect to see top line comp benefits come out of those. 
Simeon Gutman: Okay. And then switching gears to product. I think Mary mentioned expand prestige, which I think has been a focus for a long time. Does the prestige mix just grow simply by the natural mix shift in the business; you're adding brands, you're introducing new products? Or does it contemplate some type of some space increase or even reallocation over time? 
Mary Dillon: Well, I'd say it's a little of both. I mean, what we're seeing is that our guest is really responding to prestige brands right now. Certainly not only that, but that certainly is a strong area of growth for us. And some of the brands that we've launched or new products that have been introduced in some of our brands have done quite well this year. And in fact, we've expanded space for some of those brands. So we imagine it'll be a pipeline of new products and expansion of existing brands. And what that mix exactly is going to be will be determined as we look -- as we march forward over time. 
Operator: Our next question is coming from the line of Mark Altschwager with Robert W. Baird. 
Mark Altschwager: Just a couple of quick follow-ups. First, on the gross margin side. I think the comments in the Q and you mentioned earlier that merchandise margin was about flat. But I was hoping you could parse that out a bit because it sounds like you benefited from both mix and fewer discounts. So I'm just trying to understand where you saw the offset there. 
Scott Settersten: Yes. We're not going to be able to quantify everything for you, Mark. But as I think I mentioned earlier here, we still have -- the loyalty conversion is still going to be a headwind for us throughout the course of the year. Product mix, again every quarter has a little bit different levers that we pull as a merchant team. So we try to plan ahead to make sure we have a good balance of ticket drivers and traffic drivers embedded in our marketing materials. We've been able to offset some of the drag that we've seen from some deceleration in pro-nail. We've been able to offset that luckily with strength in the prestige line here over the first half of the year. E-commerce, I know we've mentioned that in the past. I mean, e-commerce rate is dilutive to us overall. But that's a business that we're going to continue to compete in very well, I believe, and we'll continue to expand merchandising opportunities there as well, which should help mitigate some of that over the long term, as well as continuing to scale up that business will help as well, so. 
Mark Altschwager: And then just following up on the services. As you look at the long-range plan, where do you see services as the optimal mix of overall sales? And how does that play into the longer-range margin expectation? 
Mary Dillon: Well, we haven't set a specific target yet for the size of services. We know we're going to grow it. We think that, as I said, we have data that shows that our guests who are participating in our services right now are great guests because they come on a frequent basis, they love the experience and then she often buys other add-on products. So while services in general are lower margins than our retail product, that guest is a very valuable guest to us. And we'll continue to look for ways to drive awareness, not just of Ulta as a retailer but Ulta as a beauty authority, with our service as a critical component of that. And that's a very sticky part of the equation for us. 
Operator: Our next question is coming from the line of John Kernan with Cowen. 
John Kernan: Just on the outlook. With ticket and traffic both trending in the right direction, why would comps decelerate a bit in the back half of the year? And then, can you help us understand long term what your market share in beauty will look like in 5 years versus now, particularly in the prestige offering? 
Mary Dillon: Well, it'll be bigger. I'm just kidding. But I mean, we definitely expect to grow our market share, and that's part of our vision is that we're going to continue to really be a stronger player in this industry and we'll grow share. In terms of the outlook for the year, listen, we're really pleased with our second quarter results, and we've reflected that by raising guidance from a mid-teen to about 20% sales and earnings growth. Some of the upside that Scott talked about, some of it was new product launches, which is great. Some of it was expense timing shifts, which is fine. We expect to see positive sale and share trends as we complete the year. 
Operator: Our next question is coming from the line of Dana Telsey with Telsey Advisory Group. 
Dana Telsey: Can you talk a little bit about as you think about the longer-term investments beyond supply chain over the next 2 years, how do you see operating margin being impacted? Or is that when we should begin to see some leverage in the model? 
Scott Settersten: Yes. We expect operating margin to remain rather flattish over the next couple of years, which we think is an excellent result considering the amount of investments that we're going to be making over the next 2 years, especially in the areas of supply chain. I alluded to earlier, maybe not as clearly as I should, but we believe that there are significant efficiencies that are going to come out of this supply chain implementation that are going to help drive top line and operating margin performance overall once we get through the 2016 time frame. At that point, we expect that our operating margin then will start making significant progress towards our mid-teens target, which we've talked about for some time. 
Mary Dillon: And let me just add that we've talked a lot about the investments that we're making this year and what we're calling "test-and-learn." And those are some experiments around hypotheses that we have about how we can drive the business, investing in things like advertising, investing in things like more attention to salon, perhaps more guest-facing time in our stores. The reason we're testing it is that we hold ourselves to a standard of getting a return on that investment. So as we look at those  "investments," the reason that our 5-year plan leads to improving that operating margin is that we will only choose the things to "invest in" that drive that kind of return that'll help us -- that will allow us deliver those results. 
Dana Telsey: And as you think of the size of those investments over time, are they going to be bigger at the beginning of this time period? Or how do you think of the scale of them? 
Scott Settersten: Yes, I mean directionally, they're more significant in the near term than they are, so they moderate. Again, once we get through -- 2015 and 2016 are the big step-up years, I would say, generally speaking. And then they moderate once we get past 2016. 
Operator: Our next question is coming from the line of Jill Nelson with Johnson Rice. 
Jill Caruthers: You saw nice traffic gains, which exceeded ticket gains for the first time in quite a few quarters. Could you talk about kind of that variance going forward and how do you see ticket versus traffic playing out in your kind of long-term 5% to 7% comp growth? 
Mary Dillon: Well, yes, we're very pleased that we saw the strong growth in retail transactions that we did in the second quarter. I would just say that long term, short term, every quarter, our goals really have a good balance between transaction and ticket, and we work together as a team to put plans in place that we believe will continue to do that. So it's not a science, right. So some quarters, it's going to play out a little differently. Some of our new products like Urban Decay, Benefit, some of the new products in those lines, launch of IT, Mally, they were significant contributors, as well as a strong pro-hair event, the leader event that Scott mentioned earlier. And our marketing and merchandising teams continue to work together to create, I'd say, even more compelling communications every quarter. So our goal here is to really just maintain a balance going forward. 
Jill Caruthers: Okay. And then, could you talk about kind of the role of prestige boutiques going forward; kind of your thought process of how many boutiques you're looking at adding in the 100 new stores per year kind of plan and just their role in the long-term goals? 
Mary Dillon: Sure. Well, our guests love the prestige boutiques. We're very pleased with the business. Janet Taake and her team work closely with our vendor partners on those opportunities. And we hope and expect to continue to grow those. 
Operator: Our next question is coming from the line of Janet Kloppenburg with JJK Research. 
Janet Kloppenburg: I just had a couple of quick questions. There's been some talk in the beauty industry over the last couple of weeks that the mass business, mass brands are being cannibalized by the prestige business, and Estée Lauder and L'Oréal have both talked about that. I was wondering if you could talk about that change and how that may affect your business going forward, or if you even agree with that trend that is being witnessed by some of the big suppliers. And also, I was wondering on the e-com being dilutive to margins, if we should expect it to be equally dilutive in fiscal '15 and fiscal '16, or it will start to get some scale from that channel as we go forward. 
Mary Dillon: Sure. On the categories, I would say if you step back and just think about our business model, our guests, what she needs and expects, she is always looking for a balance; the ability to go across the store and to buy different types of products at different price points that meet her needs. So I can't comment on the trend that you're describing that people are talking about. What I would say in our business, we're seeing a good balance there. And so we expect to continue to be able to drive that kind of balance within Ulta. Second question? 
Scott Settersten: As far as e-commerce contribution might be considered or scalability of that business, I mean, if we just carve that out as a stand-alone operating business, I think anyone would be happy to have it. I mean, it generates a lot of operating income for the business. We're improving our merchandise rates there. So gross margin -- gross profit margin, in general, is improving. And we continue to see scale in that business. So these growth rates do that kind of inherently, and we expect more of it in the future. 
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, at this time, I would like to turn the floor back over to Mary Dillon for any closing remarks. 
Mary Dillon: In closing, I'd like to thank all of our Ulta Beauty associates in our stores and our distribution centers, our headquarters. They've all really worked hard to deliver excellent results this quarter, and they're working hard to implement the strategies that we've shared with you today to continue to drive strong top and bottom line growth. Go, team Ulta! I also want to thank all of you for your interest in Ulta Beauty, and I look forward to speaking with you soon. Thank you. 
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, at this time, you may disconnect your lines. This does conclude today's teleconference. Have a wonderful day.

===== 2014 Q1  (2014-06-10 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Greetings, and welcome to the ULTA Beauty First Quarter 2014 Earnings Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. 
 I would now turn the conference over to your host, Laurel Lefebvre, Vice President, Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin. 
Laurel Lefebvre: Thank you. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us for ULTA Beauty's First Quarter 2014 Conference Call. Hosting our call are Mary Dillon, Chief Executive Officer; and Scott Settersten, Chief Financial Officer. Also joining us are Janet Taake, Chief Merchandising Officer; and Dave Kimbell, Chief Marketing Officer.

We make references during this call to the metric free cash flow, a non-GAAP financial measure defined as cash provided by operating activities minus purchases of property and equipment. 
 I'll now turn the call over to Mary. 
Mary Dillon: Thank you, Laurel. Good afternoon, everyone. I'm pleased to report a strong start to the year, with better-than-expected sales and earnings growth in the first quarter. The team's accomplishments included driving continued momentum in our online business, successfully rolling out new brands, completing a smooth conversion of our loyalty program onto one platform and closely managing inventories. In addition, transactions at comp retail stores turned positive, reversing the slight decline in the second half of 2013. 
 We're also making excellent progress with our strategic planning work, and we're on track to deliver our long-term vision and 5-year financial targets, which we plan to announce on our second quarter earnings call in September and follow up with an Analyst Day in October.
 As I said last quarter, the strategy work is designed to refresh our vision and chart a course for an evolution of our business model and to create a playbook for sustainable, profitable growth.
 To recap the numbers for the first quarter, we grew sales 22.5% and delivered an 8.7% total company comp on top of a 6.7% comp in the first quarter of 2013, both including the impact of online sales growth. Our e-commerce business performed very well, driving 72.3% comparable sales growth.
 Similar to the past several quarters, Prestige Cosmetics and skincare were the strongest categories. We were pleased to see transactions turn positive at retail, with a healthier balance between transactions and average ticket driving the strong comp in the quarter.
 Earnings per share were up 18.5% to $0.77 versus $0.65 last year, driven primarily by better-than-expected sales and some planned expenses shifted later in the year.
 Scott will cover the detailed financial results for the first quarter and our guidance for the second quarter in fiscal 2014 in a moment. But before that, I'd like to provide an update on our 5 growth strategies: new store growth; new products, services and brands; our loyalty program; marketing; and ulta.com.
 Starting with real estate. We opened 21 stores during the quarter, ending the first quarter with 696 stores. We're on track to deliver our planned 100 store program this year for an increase in square footage of approximately 15%. New stores continued to open up strong, and the class of 2014 stores is exceeding its sales budget. Rents remain stable, and we continue to fill our real estate pipeline with high-quality sites.
 For the remainder of the year, we expect to open 20 stores in the second quarter, 50 in the third and 9 in the fourth.
 We also expect to complete 12 remodels this year and are planning to complete a smaller scale remodel of our mass cosmetics planogram in about 60 stores over the summer. We haven't seen anything in the market or in our stores' performance to change our long-term view on the potential for 1,200 of our full-size 10,000-square-foot stores in the U.S. Today, we view the potential for smaller stores largely incremental to the 1,200-store target. But of course, we expect to learn a lot about the potential for smaller box once we open up 2 5,000-square-foot test stores later this year in smaller markets.
 Turning now to merchandising. Our merchant team delivered a strong first quarter with the strongest comp gains in prestige color and skincare. IT Cosmetics and Mali, launched last year in selected stores, are now fully rolled out to the entire chain. IT also is the only retail chain offering these popular brands, and our guests are delighted to find their products in our stores and online.
 We also expanded space for Urban Decay in all of our stores, showcasing the Naked franchise. Our nearly 500 Benefit boutiques continue to perform very well with new product launches and the rollout of brow tinting services to additional stores.
 Newness is always a significant driver of our comps with contributions from recent brand addition such as Japonesque, Meaningful Beauty and SheaMoisture. 
 The fragrance category was energized by 2 big launches, Dolce & Gabbana's Dolce and Ralph Lauren's Midnight Romance.
 Now turning to services. Our salon team drove solid results in the first quarter, maintaining good top line momentum and contributing to the total company comp. The salon business' strong comps were driven by both increases in average ticket and positive guest count. Retention of salon managers and stylists continued to improve, bolstering our strong performance as tenure is highly correlated with sales in the salon business.
 We executed several successful promotions focused on hair, color and skin treatments to drive awareness and trial and developed a strong integrated services message for salon services and Benefit brow services in our direct mail and email communications.
 Moving on to an update on our loyalty program and customer relationship platform. We now have 13.4 million active loyalty members who shopped with us in the past 12 months, and we've completed the conversion of all members to the ULTAmate Rewards program as of the end of February. We see a great deal of excitement about the program from our newly converted guests regarding the benefits and the flexibility of the program, as well as the new benefit of the loyalty program, offering a free CK One mascara on each guest's birthday.
 So far, we've seen strong performance in comp store sales and margin dollar growth from the recently converted regions, driven by both transaction growth and higher average ticket. Our loyalty program provides a valuable database of customer and purchase information that we can use to deliver increasingly personalized offers.
 Having all of our guests on the points-based program enables more efficient use of our CRM platform and will continue to improve the effectiveness of our targeted campaign.
 Now, turning to marketing. Continued partnership between our merchant and marketing teams is enhancing the effectiveness of our communication, including direct mail, website and promotion, which we believe is helping to drive comps. During the first quarter, we executed successful programs like our signature 21 Days of Beauty, featuring beauty steals and in-store events with an increased focus on social media. Our trends of spring report positioned ULTA as a beauty authority, and we enhanced our Mother's Day promotion with a stronger Gift with Purchase program and several new fragrance launches.
 Our marketing collateral continues to evolve as we build a more compelling and emotional connection with our guests. Our marketing team is also making good progress on refining our brand positioning, carrying out a marketing mix analysis, and executing the test-and-learn initiatives we talked about last March, all with the goal of driving ULTA's continued profitable growth through new guest acquisition and less reliance on discounts.
 Wrapping up our fifth growth strategy, our e-commerce business. Ulta.com continue to see strong sales momentum in the first quarter with top line comp growth of 72.3%, contributing nearly 2 points of comp to our same-store sales. We continued to enhance the online shopping experience through new releases of the platform. The latest improvement include a product Q&A platform called Ask ULTA on the site and the addition of brand stores to highlight collections and breadth of assortment, as well as promote services like the Benefit Brow Bars.
 We continued to invest in omnichannel capabilities like the newly launched feature called Find In Store, which enables guests to check the availability of many popular SKUs in their local stores. We also continued to increase fulfillment capacity to support the rapid growth in our e-commerce business.
 This completes the update on our growth strategy, so I'll now hand it over to Scott. 
Scott Settersten: Thanks, Mary. Good afternoon, everyone. First quarter sales were $713.8 million compared to $582.7 million last year, an increase of 22.5%. Comparable sales increased 8.7%. The retail comp, which includes salon, was 6.8%, and e-commerce growth of 72.3% added 190 basis points to the comp.
 The transaction and ticket contributions to the total company comp were more balanced, with transactions up 2.5% and ticket up 6.2%. The ticket increase was driven by roughly 20% units and 80% average selling price as our business continues to mix up to more prestige categories, which are generally at higher price points.
 We were very pleased to see that retail-only comparable transactions increased 120 basis points, almost a 2-point sequential improvement from Q4.
 Gross profit dollars increased 20.6% to $246 million. As we expected, gross profit margin declined 50 basis points to 34.5% from 35% in Q1 of last year. While retail project -- product margins were strong, the overall product margin rate was down about 40 basis points, driven by a number of factors including a higher mix of ulta.com sales, some product mix shifts within prestige and the impact from converting the remaining 50% of the country to the ULTAmate Rewards program, which delivers more gross margin dollars but at a slightly lower rate.
 For the full year, we anticipate product margins will be slightly higher than last year, based on some of the newness in the category mix we're planning for the rest of the year.
 As a reminder, the ulta.com impact to our margin rate is primarily due to sales mix. As most of you know, we do not currently sell the full assortment of our professional hair care products online. So having a lower mix of that higher-margin product online does dilute our e-commerce rate somewhat compared to bricks and mortar. However, from a margin dollar perspective, we believe that a significant portion of our e-commerce sales are incremental, as we have seen that our guests who engage with us across both channels also spend more in store. While it is natural to focus on the margin rate as a stand-alone measure, we are focused on the big picture, which is that we are capturing more beauty dollars overall, and that is good news for both ULTA and shareholders.
 We're delighted with the tremendous growth and market share gains we're seeing in Prestige Cosmetics and skincare. While high margin, they are not as high margin as some of the other prestige categories we sell. In the first quarter, those mix shifts had a slight impact on overall margin rate. We expect to see these mix impacts mitigate as we go through the year.
 I would also remind you that having all our guests on the ULTAmate Rewards program has a modest impact on gross margin rate. We know our guests are much more engaged with this more flexible, attractive program, so they use it more. We expect the program to deliver higher sales and gross margin dollars, but the margin rate is a bit lower than our previous certificate-based program.
 The remaining 10 basis points of deleverage relates to fixed store costs, which we expect to continue for the full year as we add 100 new stores this year on top of 125 last year and 100 in 2012.
 Taking a long-term view, the modest deleverage we expect to see in 2014 is minor in comparison to the increased market share we are capturing with these stores and the long-term gross profit and cash flow these investments will generate in the coming years.
 We are very happy with new store productivity. Our 2012 and 2013 classes of new stores continue to exceed our internal sales and investment return targets. And store openings in the first quarter of this year exceeded their grand opening sales targets. Our store model has proven to work well in all geographies, and we continue to review and approve high-quality sites, consistent with our historical practices.
 Back to the P&L. SG&A expenses rose 22.1% to $162.4 million, flat as a percentage of sales at 22.8% due to planned investments in marketing, supply chain, e-commerce and store labor, but better-than-expected driven by strong expense controls and some planned expenses that were delayed and pushed later in the year.
 Preopening expense was $2.6 million compared to $3.2 million in Q1 of 2013, driven by 21 store openings during the quarter compared to 28 new stores opened during Q1 of 2013. Operating margin decreased 30 basis points to 11.3% versus 11.6% in Q1 of last year. Net income increased 19.4% to $50 million, or $0.77 per diluted share, versus $41.8 million, or $0.65 per diluted share, last year. EPS grew 18.5%.
 Turning to the balance sheet. Inventories were $531.4 million at the end of the quarter compared to $442.1 million at the end of Q1 2013, driven by 120 net new stores opened since May last year.
 Inventories were down 50 basis points on a per-store basis as our supply chain and store teams have done a nice job keeping inventory very clean through a large number of product transitions. Capital expenditures were $39.1 million for the quarter, driven primarily by our new store opening program, as well as supply chain and IT investments. And depreciation and amortization for the quarter was $30.4 million.
 We generated about $34.6 million of free cash flow for the quarter and ended the first quarter with $457 million in cash on the balance sheet.
 While we delivered a first quarter above expectations and have a solid start to our second quarter, we believe it is prudent to maintain our view of full year guidance until we get a bit more of the year under our belt. If the environment remains stable, we’d expect to do better.
 We expect to open about 100 new stores this year, along with 12 remodels. We anticipate comparable sales to increase in the 4% to 6% range and total sales to increase in the mid-teens range for the year.
 As a reminder, P&L investments for the year include: Supply chain expenses to support the planned 2015 opening of a fourth DC.; marketing to convert 50% of the country to the ULTAmate Rewards loyalty program; and investments to increase training for both store and salon associates to improve the guest experience; as well as some test-and-learn initiatives around brand awareness and new guest acquisition, most of which are occurring in the back half of the year.
 We expect that earnings per share will grow in the mid-teens percentage range this year, excluding any potential accretion from share repurchases. Our existing authorization has about $113 million remaining.
 We expect to invest about $265 million in capital in 2014, with approximately $117 million earmarked for new stores, remodels and relocations; $28 million for merchandise fixtures; $50 million for IT systems, including e-commerce; $45 million for supply chain projects; and about $25 million for maintenance CapEx.
 Turning more specifically to the second quarter of 2014. We expect sales to increase in the range of $706 million to $717 million versus $601 million last year. We expect comparable sales to increase in the range of 5% to 7%. Preopening expense is expected to come in around $3.4 million, with 20 stores planned to open in the second quarter.
 We expect to achieve earnings per share in the range of $0.78 to $0.83 compared to $0.70 in Q2 of last year. Our tax rate is expected to be approximately 38.4%, and our fully diluted share count will be approximately 64.8 million, excluding any potential share repurchase activity.
 Before we move on to the Q&A, I'd like to give you an update on our supply chain investments.
 In April, we signed a lease for our new distribution center near Indianapolis, which we expect to open mid-2015. This facility will be about double the size of our existing buildings and will have all new warehouse management and control systems. The new facility will also have more sophisticated material handling technology and, ultimately, a more efficient operating model compared to our current facilities. This model will take inventory lead time out of our supply chain by allowing more frequent shipments, which will improve store in-stocks and inventory turns. It will also create labor efficiencies in the distribution center and allow us to deliver a more shelf-ready product to our stores. Having the product delivered more frequently and shelf-ready will allow our store associates to get the product on the shelf faster and more efficiently and improve in-stocks and product presentation.
 The new DC and systems are the first phase of a multiyear network optimization project as we continue to evaluate our supply chain capabilities and capacity to support future growth.
 We expect this project to generate a good return on investment over the longer term from benefits, including speeding up the supply chain, improve labor efficiencies and providing more inventory flexibility to drive improved inventory turns.
 This is clearly an important investment, and we are all highly focused on execution to ensure that it delivers the expected operating and financial benefits.
 With that, I'll turn the call over to our conference call host to begin the Q&A. Operator? 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Neely Tamminga with Piper Jaffray. 
Kayla Berg: This is Kayla Berg on for Neely Tamminga. Just wondering, digging deeper into your e-commerce sales, can you guys tell based on your loyalty data how your customer is choosing e-commerce versus a store visit? Said another way, within your loyalty base, how much is she using the site to buy products versus going into the store? And with that example, what does her purchasing behavior look like online versus in-store, again looking at your loyalty customer base, maybe looking at average transaction size and dollars or units? And how does that look differently online versus in-store? 
David Kimbell: Yes, this is Dave Kimbell. We absolutely see a lot of cross purchase activity within our membership database, between the website and our stores. I don't think we're prepared to share specific details around some of the specific questions that you have, but it is -- as our e-commerce capability has grown over the last 18 months and become a bigger part of our business, one of the things that we're particularly excited about is our ability to reach her where and when she wants to shop with us. So importantly, our members are finding that to be very -- a very convenient way for them to shop. So they're visiting both stores and e-commerce, and that's certainly something that we're encouraging as we continue to leverage e-commerce as a way to drive customers back into our stores. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Aram Rubinson with Wolfe Research. 
Aram Rubinson: Two things. First of all, on the new store productivity, I know historically you've talked about 70% or in that range. Our calculation for this quarter was around 74%. And to get to your guidance for second quarter, I think I needed at least 75%. So the question is, what are you doing differently there? And is it a function of also opening fewer stores that maybe we can cherry pick just the best, and if that's sustainable? And then I have a follow-up. 
Scott Settersten: No, Aram. I wouldn't say there's anything specific that we're doing any differently to drive new store productivity. I think we're just seeing a natural maturation of the stores we've put in place over the last 2 years. Notably, we observed that first quarter this year, the stores coming out of the gate, the 21 new stores in the first quarter, were just exceptionally strong. So nothing special that we're doing, other than our normal great day-to-day activities to support new store openings. 
Aram Rubinson: Okay. Because sometimes, when you choose fewer stores, you get a better hit rate, I guess, is kind of what I was trying to get at. That's not what you're seeing just yet, you're saying? 
Scott Settersten: No, we're not seeing any of that. 
Aram Rubinson: And then my second question is, in the 10-Q, it says our long-term strategy is to drive -- operating profit is expected to increase as a result of our ability to expand merchandise margin and leverage our fixed costs with comparable store sales increases and operating efficiencies, offset by incremental investments in people, et cetera. Wondering if that word, "offset," is kind of to be read fully offset or partially offset? 
Scott Settersten: I would -- my response to that would be partially offset. And I think we've shared that with many, many investors that we've talked to over the course of the last year. We still believe that a mid-teens operating margin target is a reasonable one for ULTA and one we feel capable of achieving over the longer term. Again, we've got some investments that we're making in the near term, notably in supply chain, e-commerce, cycling our hypergrowth new store program here over the course of the last couple of years. We feel like once we get through that, we're going to see benefits coming from those investments. And we're also going to see continued mix up in the prestige part of our business, which we think will drive improved operating margins over the long term. 
Aram Rubinson: And comps of 8.7% don't hurt either. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Gary Balter with Credit Suisse. 
Gary Balter: Two questions. One is, you mentioned that -- obviously, traffic went up. How much of that do you tie in with the rollout of the loyalty program, the ULTAmate Rewards, to all the customers? And what does that imply for future quarters? 
Mary Dillon: Gary, it's Mary. Thank you. I'd say there were several factors that we believe drove the transactions, and we're encouraged to see that improvement. Over the long term, we're going to want to continue to have that kind of balance. But it's really a combination of things. It's probably hard to parse out just one thing. But certainly, rolling out the loyalty program is part of it. But we also have had some great newness in brands that we talked about, like IT and Mally; space expansion; more compelling marketing and merchandising, I'd say, overall in our materials, in-store and online. So really, a combination of those things altogether, we believe, is what drove that to happen. 
Gary Balter: And, Mary, just following up, you mentioned, when you're talking about the really strong results in e-commerce, that you had a new release of the platform or some upgrade. Where are you in the e-commerce rollout of your platform? And what do we expect in the future? 
Mary Dillon: Sure. I'll ask Dave to take that. 
David Kimbell: Yes, yes. Absolutely. We're continuing to expand our capabilities. So as you're probably aware, last year, late last year, we launched our new site that has been performing very well and is one of the drivers of our success. And we continue to add new capabilities. I think a couple of things that Mary referred to earlier: brand stores with a new capability in partnership with some of the key brands; we have a new feature around Ask Ulta, where customers can engage with us and ask specific questions around products or beauty tips; and then we continued to expand our capabilities. We've got, as Mary mentioned, our inventory availability online, both on our site and then within Google, which is -- we found to be a great convenience for our customers in Q1. We've had about 0.25 million views of inventory on our site, and that's important not only to connect with our customers today but to set ourselves up for future omnichannel capabilities. We've built in some live chat capabilities, we've redesigned our loyalty and guest services. So there’s a variety of things as we continue to build our web and digital experience that we think will be critical to continue the strong growth that we've had in that space. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Oliver Chen with Citi. 
Oliver Chen: Regarding your comments on the evolution of gross margin, what is going to drive the category mix positive impact there? And also, the breakout, getting the 20% unit growth was impressive. Was that a trend that will continue? And could you just give us color on what's working on the unit growth side? 
Mary Dillon: Oliver, thank you. First of all on the gross profit margin, let me just start at a high level. As Scott described, there's a few different items that drove some margin deleverage in the quarter, and some of those headwinds will continue for the year. But we do expect to see modest improvement for the full year. And really, it's a couple of things, one is a newness that we have in the pipeline and also as we continue to evolve our promotional strategy and pull back on some discounts carefully, we think that those 2 things alone will help us. 
Oliver Chen: And on the unit front, do you expect the momentum and kind of breakout to continue at this rate between AUR versus units? 
Mary Dillon: Yes. You know what? I think we're trying to really drive a healthy balance of all that over time. So some of the test-and-learn programs that we're doing this year are really trying to see how we can lever that sales equation even further. So we're looking at it across the board. So part of this is obviously, first and foremost, getting new guests to Ulta and then having our current guests come more often, shop more often. So whether she's buying more units per transaction or higher-priced items in her basket, all of those are, frankly, good levers for us to explore, that we think are all going to be part of our future growth. 
Oliver Chen: And, Mary, on the customer acquisition front, what would you prioritize as the top catalyst for the continued momentum in terms of realizing the opportunity there? And we’re looking forward to the Investor Day, if you could just give us a few thoughts on the nature of what we may expect to hear about, that'd be great. 
Mary Dillon: Well, I can't preview Investor Day, but what I can tell you is that -- and consistently, we've said that, and we know from a data perspective, that awareness of Ulta just as a retailer is lower than really it can be. So it starts with just getting more guests at our -- in our sort of sweet spot of our target to become aware of Ulta and then to become aware of what we're about. So part -- really this -- the long-term work that we're doing is really about how do we -- I guess you can almost call it relaunch the brand to people who maybe have not been in an Ulta for a long time or maybe never been in an Ulta or don't really what we're like right now versus what we were, perhaps, a long time ago. So we think there's a lot of opportunity there, and it starts with awareness, clarity of what we stand for, and then it's about continuing to do what we do really well, which is offer her a differentiated experience in the store, most importantly, with an array of great products and services that she can only get at Ulta. So it's really all those things together. So I can't prioritize only one, because they're all, I think, exciting opportunities for us. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Brian Tunick with JPMorgan. 
Bilun Boyner: This is Bilun Boyner filling in for Brian. We wanted to ask about your product introductions for the rest of the year. Are there any product launches or emerging trends you're really excited about for the rest of the year? And do you have any updates to your Clinique and Lancôme shop and shopper allotments? 
Janet Taake: Thank you for asking a question. As far as future -- any new products or rollouts, we would not share at this point in time. Of course, we always are focused on newness, whether it be product exclusives or new brands, but I would not be specific. And back to Clinique and Lancôme, we opened a significant amount of doors last year, I think I mentioned on our last call, and we're very pleased with that business. And we continue to monitor. But it's like a new store. It ramps over time. So we're partnering with our vendors to make sure that we maximize the business together. And I really don't have any other updates other than that, that we are very pleased with both businesses. And as far as the trends, some of the trends continue. Lips has been very strong. We see that continuing this year and as we move forward into fall. Also, anti-aging continues to be strong for us. And we're also seeing complexion or face being very strong as Q1 ended. And I think it’ll continue. 
Bilun Boyner: And can you update us on the store maturity term? I know you mentioned new stores exceed expectations, but I wanted to see if there’s a change in your comp assumptions by store age, particularly given the product mix is somewhat changing and e-commerce is now a growing part of the business? 
Scott Settersten: Yes. There hasn't been any change in the core model and what we see the performance of those new stores compared to what we share in our standard kind of investor deck. So no, new stores still very productive, in line with our expectations. And the stores that are beyond 5 years old, again, in a healthy comp environment, they're additive to the comp. They're all comping in very healthy low- to mid-single digit range. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Fassler with Goldman Sachs. 
Matthew Fassler: I have 2 questions, the first relates to gross margin. You made some comments about the mix within prestige and the notion that the prestige products that you sold more of in Q1 might be a little lower margin than some of the prestige products, perhaps, that you sold in the past and that you expect to sell going forward. Any color as to the drivers of that trend and what changes you expect to see that will make prestige more of a pure positive to the gross margin rate? 
Mary Dillon: Matt, what I would say is that prestige is a pretty big category, right? So there's a lot of different brands that we have that are in the price that we call Prestige, and some of them have -- they have different margins. All of them are good, strong margin and good, high price points, right? But within that, there are certain brands that are somewhat higher or lower. So it's really just about that. It's a little bit of a shift within that. As we look at our pipeline for the rest of the year and what we expect in terms of newness, we believe that will moderate and shift to positive. 
Matthew Fassler: So you have visibility to launches and such that make you feel that way? 
Mary Dillon: Yes. 
Matthew Fassler: Great. And then my second question, I believe at the outset of the year you spoke about $0.10 of investment, most of it in SG&A and the initiatives that you've spoken about in the past and again today. Scott, if you haven't done so, and I may have missed it, could you quantify how much of that $0.10 you booked in Q1? And to the extent that you said some investments were deferred to later in the year, how much of what you originally expected to spend in Q1 did you push out to later in 2014? 
Scott Settersten: Yes. It was virtually 0 in Q1, to answer the question directly. And it's all back-half loaded to 2014, I would say. Directionally, it’s heaviest in Q3. That's where we're really going to be able to get some actions in place. And then it'll continue on into the fourth quarter. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Daniel Hofkin with William Blair. 
Daniel Hofkin: Just a couple of follow-up questions. One, if I could ask the Clinique and Lancôme question slightly differently. Would you -- at this point, do you feel like, over time, there’s still a meaningful opportunity to add one or both of those brands or others on that stature to the -- a meaningful part of the chain that don't already have them? 
Janet Taake: This is Janet. So thank you for the question. We're pleased with the business. As I said, there's opportunity. We're hopeful that we'll continue to expand both brands, and there's opportunity for others. So that's -- and at this point, as I mentioned, that's -- I have no further update. 
Daniel Hofkin: Okay. And then just a follow-up on the thoughts around the promotional cadence. It sounds -- you didn't call it out in the first quarter, so is it fair to say it was not a meaningful difference year-over-year in the first quarter? 
Mary Dillon: Well, you know what? Part of -- we actually slightly pulled back on our promotions versus a year ago. I wouldn't say it's so significant that it's super meaningful yet, but it’s a trend that we are encouraged by because strategically, we think it's important. And one of the things -- I believe that it's just a sort of, "walk before you run," and something like this, right. So value is important to our guests, and we need to make sure that we offer value. But we have done some things to sort of modify our mix and our offer strategy. Dave talked about our CRM platform. We're leveraging that to deliver more relevant offers. We're expanding our digital reach to drive awareness. And yes, I would say that we're balancing the  value equation with offers that are more relevant, more personalized, perhaps even a more emotional connection, you might say, to our guests. So we are making some changes there that are having an improvement in terms of our promotion level. It's going to be difficult for analysts, I think, to track that going forward. Because as we get more segmented and more personalized, it won't be as obvious to everybody what we're doing, because we won't be doing the same offers to everybody. But we're encouraged by that. And again, that's an important part of how we think about the long term for the business. 
Daniel Hofkin: Okay. So I mean, basically, it's -- you're also clearly aiming at more effective and higher payback on the promotions that you run? So that seems to be part of it too? 
Mary Dillon: Yes. 
Daniel Hofkin: And then just thinking about as the year progresses, the reason I asked the question is obviously, second half of last year, and there were some unique external dynamics that worked at all retailers or grappling with, but what -- I guess at this stage, is there something about the second half, this coming second half, that you'd expect to allow you to be maybe less promotional than you were in the second half of last year, or at least similar year-over-year based on maybe the new -- the fully rolled ULTAmate Rewards program or other -- a more targeted promotion that kind of helps that? 
Mary Dillon: Right. Well, I feel good about where we are, and I feel good -- I really believe that every day, we're raising our game as it relates to our ability to be more fine-tuned with our promotions and, as you said, use that to drive more incremental, profitable sales. That's the ultimate game here. So really, as I look at our full year, it's still early in the year. And we are -- we feel it's prudent to hold where we are until we get deeper into the year. To your point, we don't really know what holiday holds. But I do think that I feel good about where we are and that we are going to continue to raise our game. If our sales momentum continues and if our upcoming newness performs better-than-expected, we could see some upside. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Ike Boruchow with Sterne Agee. 
Irwin Boruchow: A quick clarification. Scott, did I hear correctly that even x the e-com business, that your traffic levels were positive for Q1? I think 1% you said? 
Scott Settersten: Yes, that's correct. 1.2%, actually, right. So it's a 200 basis points improvement from what we saw in the fourth quarter. 
Irwin Boruchow: Right. Okay. So I guess my question is I think, most retailers saw a sequential deceleration, or a lot of retailers saw sequential deceleration in their traffic trends. Is there anything you can point to in terms of what you guys did to improve your own traffic levels from Q4? 
Scott Settersten: Yes, I wouldn't say there's any one particular thing, as Mary mentioned. The way we've seen it and measured it, it looks like it's a combination of things, right. So it's some of the great new products we introduced in the first quarter, whether it's expanding Urban Decay or IT Cosmetics and adding to what we offer in the box, continuing to improve our marketing and merchandising inside the stores. We expect to -- we expect that the back half of the year will have some easier compares. So we would expect the transaction trend being positive to continue through the rest of the year. 
Irwin Boruchow: Okay, great. And then just one more on the gross margin line. So it looks like the comps came in a couple of points above your guidance, but the gross margin looked a little weaker to us. I think you clarified this, but I just want to double check. It sounds like your like-for-like retail margins were just like you planned them, and this was just a function of sales came from different channels and different products, and that -- and because of that, the profitability was less. Is that a fair assessment of the gross margin for Q1? 
Scott Settersten: Yes, that's fair. I mean, again, the retail product margins, as we define, which is 90% of the business, I mean, we are very healthy. Mary mentioned a slight pullback on some of the promotional level there, so it helped us be able to maintain margin rate on that. But it's just some of the other mix items that we saw during the first quarter. And again, we see a number of those things being able to either mitigate or moderate as we get further into the year. 
Irwin Boruchow: To that point, can you give us just some color on Q2? I know you gave us the comp and the sales and EPS, but in terms of how you expect gross margin to play out for the second quarter? 
Scott Settersten: Yes. Sorry, Ike, we're not getting into that level of detail on guidance any longer. So we kind of stopped doing that when we kicked off 2014. So... 
Irwin Boruchow: But you'd expect those headwinds to dissipate is what you're saying on the gross margin line? 
Scott Settersten: Well, I -- directionally, the loyalty headwind is going to be with us for the rest of the year. E-commerce, we would expect that to moderate because we're going to continue to expand our assortment there, and the business continues to scale. So we would expect some moderation there. And then on the product mix, again, directionally, we expect that to improve as we get deeper into the year because we do have some nice newness in the Q, which is going to be rate accretive to us in the back half. So... 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Evren Kopelman with Wells Fargo. 
Evren Kopelman: First question is can you compare/contrast the environment that you saw in the first quarter, compared to the fourth quarter, if you needed to be more or less promotional, if others around you, either in the beauty category or other product categories you compete with, if you could share some thoughts on that, that would be great? 
Mary Dillon: Well, certainly, the fourth quarter of last year was really promotional as we saw across all retail, right. So in gift-giving categories that we might compete with -- we compete with everybody at the time of the year, right, so even with -- outside of beauty, we also had a very promotional quarter. This year, I would say that within beauty, I would say it's not necessarily less promotional. And this is a very competitive environment, as you know, and everybody's fighting for share. We've gotten, I think, better every day as it relates to how we do our promotions and how we target them and use them to get our guests to come in and buy more often and buy it with less discount. So I think -- certainly, I would say the broader promotional environment, less intense, but within beauty, pretty, pretty competitive. 
Evren Kopelman: Okay. Another question is, have you seen any changes in your -- the kind of the pace of new customer additions compared to prior years? And how do you anticipate that to change going forward? 
Mary Dillon: Well, let me say one thing, which is the big part of this test-and-learn that we’ve referenced. And we'll be running some of these awareness and new guest acquisition tests as we get further into the year. The whole goal of that is to drive new guest acquisition, but do it in different ways, right. So right now, we've got a great 13 million-plus people in our loyalty program, and that's a strong program. It's driving the majority of our sales, which is great. We think there's opportunity to have a lot more people as loyalty members to ULTA in the future, right? And so to do that, you have to actually make sure that you're communicating in effective and efficient ways to get people's attention and to get them aware of Ulta, right. So that's why we're doing those tests, is to see, is there an opportunity for us, which we believe there is, to drive new guest acquisition through a range of tactics from traditional media to social media, in search optimization. So there's plenty of ways for us to do that. And we think that's going to be the big learning for us this summer and into the fall, that we can then leverage as we look forward. 
Evren Kopelman: Great. And so I guess one last one is on the mature stores, kind of the older stores, how was the -- maybe you could share some color on how those stores performed relative to the rest of the chain? 
Scott Settersten: Yes. Again, our new store model is intact. New stores are performing as expected. And again, it's a healthy comp increase year-over-year. And as we would expect, those older stores are contributing to the comp increases. So we're seeing healthy, low digit into the mid-digit kind of comp year-over-year in some of those more mature stores. So very happy with the productivity of those stores right now. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of David Wu with Telsey Advisory Group. 
David Wu: Can you elaborate more on the 2 5,000-square-foot stores that you're planning to test in the smaller markets? And any color around the expected 4-wall profitability in merchandising differences versus the full-sized stores? 
Mary Dillon: Right. David, well, first of all, I have to keep it at a pretty high level because we're still in the planning phases, and we haven't really publicly communicated a lot about this yet. But I'll say -- we're all very excited about the opportunity. It's really an opportunity to go into -- right now, I'd say, just consider them smaller markets, similar -- sort of, in some ways, to where we operate today, but just smaller markets with less dense populations. The stores will be 5,000-square-foot stores. We think about it as really bringing the Ulta experience into a market where, frankly, we think, our women targets are going to be very excited, our women -- future guests are going to be very excited about having an Ulta experience. So it'll be curated down certainly. We -- less space. But we'll have a salon in every store. We'll have a mix of products similar to what we have today in every store. It gives us an opportunity to experiment a little bit with fixtures and lighting and things like that, but most importantly will be for us to learn about the economics. We feel like we're very confident the economics will be strong and good, but we need to learn that. We also need to learn about labor model and service model. So more to come on that. 
David Wu: And are those locations also based in power centers? 
Mary Dillon: Yes, I don't know if I want to disclose where they are exactly yet. But yes, similar real estate strategy to today. 
David Wu: Got it. And obviously, maybe too early to tell, but what do you think the smaller-format store potential could be over time? 
Mary Dillon: Yes, too early to tell would be a good way. I mean, it's really something -- we've modeled it certainly as not -- we see that it looks like it'll be quite accretive, I guess, I'd say. We see it as an incremental opportunity to our real estate strategy and overall business strategy. So part of what we're defining in our 5-year plan is -- through these tests is what is that potential. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Joe Altobello with Oppenheimer. 
Joseph Altobello: Just want to go back to something that you mentioned earlier, Scott, about the sort of directional cadence of gross margin this year, maybe even next year. If I understand you correctly, it sounds like this year, you're looking for a little bit of gross margin expansion, but most of that’s going to be offset by the investments you're making on the SG&A side. As you look ahead to '15, I would imagine the headwinds that dissipate later this year eventually go away effectively. So you're going to get better gross margin expansion next year, and then the $0.10 of mostly SG&A investments that happens this year probably dissipates as well. So would you guys expect to see even greater gross margin expansion next year, given what you're investing this year? 
Scott Settersten: Yes, Joe. I don't think I'm prepared to go all the way out there with you on that line of questioning. But I would clarify on the gross profit line. We did mention product margins. So retail product margins we expect to be slightly up year-over-year for full 2014. But that's going to be offset somewhat by some of the investment headwinds that will go through that line, most notably fixed or product deleverage for the full year. So gross profit may be slightly up for the year, but in the flat to slightly up kind of area, I would say. And that $0.10 worth of SG&A, you're right. That's where it goes. That's where the test-and-learn is. It's hard to say right now how that's going to play out. We want to see what the results are and then take actions from there on what we want to invest in, in the future or what path we'd like to follow. So... 
Joseph Altobello: Okay. I thought I'd give it a shot. That's all. But in terms of the evolution of the promotion strategy, obviously it sounds like you're easing up there a little bit. And I know one quarter is a very small sample size because a lot of how that plays out will have to do with what your competition is doing, et cetera. So are you guys worried at all that your core customer base has become accustomed to promotion and, as you ease up on that lever, that they may look to go elsewhere? Or is that not a concern at this point? 
Mary Dillon: Well, that's exactly why we're I would say walk before you run in this kind of thing. And so far, I think it looks very encouraging. Again, value is part of the question that guests have come to expect from Ulta. It's really across a lot of different dimensions, gift with purchases, free samples, beauty steals, and then of course our loyalty program. And then there's discounts like coupons and postcards. So as we're pulling those apart and we're doing some analytical work to pull it apart, as well as just experimentation, I really very much believe, and the early data would suggest, that we are not -- we don't have guests that are overly reliant. There may be a segment that is like that. That's probably true for every business. But for the most part, we are confident that as we understand her better and we personalize offers to her more, and we bring in the things that she is excited about trying and buying, that there is a lot of runway there. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of John Kernan with Cowen and Company. 
John Kernan: Scott, I think in your prepared remarks, you talked about if the environment remains stable, you'd expect to put -- do a little bit better than your outlook for the year. Does that imply you need to keep doing 9% comps? Or is there some type of line item you think you have good visibility into that could drive perhaps some upside to the current outlook? 
Scott Settersten: No. We're just -- we're looking -- the glass is half full, right. We're looking at business. We're just coming out of a great first quarter where our guidance, especially in the comp line, was a little ahead of our full year guidance targets. And again, we're doing the same with the second quarter because sales are strong. We're seeing good strength in some of the newness that we're introducing to our guests. So we just want people to realize that if things continue on the plane that we're on today, we would expect to see some upside as we go through the year. 
John Kernan: Okay, that's helpful. And then just can you -- ticket has obviously been a big driver of the comp. Can you remind us what inning you think you're in, in terms of that continuing to be a comp driver as the prestige becomes a bigger part of the mix? 
Scott Settersten: We would expect -- again, big picture, we are focused on trying to have a nice, healthy balance between ticket and traffic driving our business. So we see -- ticket, recently over the last 3 or 4 quarters, has been a heavier contributor to the comp. We're starting to see now transactions, right, where traffic -- we're trying to get back and balance here, and we would expect that phenomena to occur as we get through the rest of 2014. We think we're on track to have more normalized and a better balance between the 2 comprising our total. 
Mary Dillon: Right. And the only thing I would add is it's not only about shifting more of the mix to prestige. It's also about more units per transaction for our guests. We have a lot of items in the store, plenty of opportunities for her to pick up more in her basket every time she shops. So we think we can drive that balance over time. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Jason Gere with KeyBanc. 
Jason Gere: I guess, just noticing the balance sheet and all the cash that you're -- you're sitting on $7 a share. So can maybe you update us just on the thinking in terms of the uses of cash at this point? Is this something maybe you'll talk more at the Analyst Day? But clearly, with no debt and -- you have a very attractive enterprise value to EBITDA, I was just wondering first off if you can just maybe give a little color on how you can put that cash to work? 
Scott Settersten: Yes, Jason. We discuss uses of cash and capital allocation with our board on a regular basis. Right now, our current -- our best thinking is the best investment is to continue to drive organic growth in the business. So we're investing in new stores, we're expanding our supply chain capabilities and driving our e-commerce growth as best we can, so we're assessing capital allocation as part of the long-term strategy work that we're doing as a group. We will be able to give you more color on our plans for the future and long term when we meet with you in the fall. 
Jason Gere: Okay. No, that's good. And then just a second question. As e-commerce gets a little bit better -- and forgive me if you did talk about this earlier -- can you talk about what the average, I guess, purchase size was online versus in the store? And the reason why I'm asking is just -- when I think about the customer coming into the store, usually, they have -- they know what they're looking for, but there's always those impulse items, too. When you're online, sometimes you don't have the time for the impulse items. So just wondering, as you see this shift move, how do you get that customer who's shopping online to kind of buy more than what they're just looking for? 
David Kimbell: Yes. Absolutely, it's a big opportunity for us. I'd say you're right in general, that the e-com has -- there's opportunity for us to continue to grow that. I think we're pleased with, really, all measures within our e-commerce business right now: traffic, conversion and average order. But as we get smarter with our cadence of promotion and communication on the web, we think we'll have opportunity to continue to drive that. And so much of that will be driven by our deeper understanding of our customers and targeting message and communication through some of the new capabilities I talked about within our website. So yes, we do have opportunity to continue to grow average order in our e-commerce. We've made progress on that over the last several quarters as we've launched our new site and continue to see opportunity there. 
Jason Gere: Do you -- I mean, can you quantify the difference between average order online versus average order of a loyalty card member versus a non-loyalty card member? Just something that you can provide, just to give a little color so we can see what the potential opportunity may be? 
Scott Settersten: Yes, I don't -- not on the loyalty side of things. But generally speaking, a bricks and mortar transaction is, round numbers, call it, $35 a ring normally. And e-commerce is north of $50, and a lot of that is the free shipping offers and things like that, which generally tend to drive up average order value. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Jill Nelson with Johnson Rice. 
Jill Caruthers: Sorry to add another gross margin question, but just trying to understand first quarter decline on the merchandise margin line. Given last quarter -- I'm sorry, last year, in the first quarter, you were hit by kind of a onetime event with the Gift with Purchase issue. And so just trying to compare that to how you performed this first quarter and then just in contrast of the improvement you're expecting for the remainder of the year. 
Scott Settersten: Yes. A new quarter, a new set of challenges, right, and opportunities to manage. So I was hoping I would never have to talk about one quarter last year, the GWP thing again, but thanks. Thanks for reminding me, Jill. I would just reiterate what I said previously, which is the core retail product margins that we see in the business, which again is 90% plus of our business, is in really good shape. And part of it is our ability to kind of slightly back off on promotional level, as well as continue to improve the mix of the overall box, with adding additional prestige kinds of brands and items to our mix overall. So that's a great thing for the business. I did mention that loyalty, we -- there's a bit of a rate hit that we take on that, and I would expect that to continue for the rest of the year. And again, that's a long-term -- good for Ulta. Loyalty is one of our best, biggest, most important assets that we have. E-commerce, we've talked about that for the last year or so. I mean, that's the nature of that business. We continue to build the assortment out there. We'll continue to do that throughout 2014, and we expect the rate to improve there in the long term, with better assortment and more scale to that business to help cover some of the investment spending we had to do. And then lastly, the product mix, the shifts we saw in prestige, we expect that to moderate as we get deeper into the year. And again, I'd just say again, we've got some nice things in the Q. I'm looking at Janet, my merchant partner here. We've got some great things in the Q for the back half of the year that we expect to help margin rates. 
Jill Caruthers: All right, appreciate it. And just a last question. Inventory per store was down this quarter. Kind of how are you looking at that metric for the remainder of the year? 
Scott Settersten: Yes, we -- that's another thing we've kind of grappled with for the last year or so. I mean, we've made some important investments in inventory, both to help general in-stock levels in the stores. And then with the boutiques, we've made some significant inventory investments as well. Those have been good for the business, good, long-term investments for us. We've kind of cycled all that now, and so we feel like we're in a really good position. And we expect the per-door inventory increases to be well below the comp increases for the year. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Mark Altschwager with Robert W. Baird. 
Mark Altschwager: You touched on the mix shift going on within prestige, but could you update us on the performance of mass versus prestige, and whether you're seeing any evidence of broadening the strength across price points? 
Scott Settersten: We haven't seen any shift really in the total box shop, so to speak. So we still – customers, she's coming into shop prestige. That's what's drawing her into the store. But we also know, when she checks out, there's still mass items in her basket. She's cross shopping the store, and that's really one of the secrets to Ulta's success, is we can capture both parts of her shopping trip. 
Mark Altschwager: Great. And then could you just talk a little bit about the store experience? And you've been investing a lot in training. What metrics are you looking at to gauge whether the investments are translating into a better, more differentiated experience? 
Mary Dillon: Right. Well, we're early on in the test-and-learn on those. So we're doing a couple of things. One is just increasing moderately our overall base level of training for our associates. But really, as we look at the test-and-learn, it's really about how -- learning about if we were to ramp it up even further and frankly have more guest spacing time, even more knowledge to our associates, maybe through technology. And we -- the key measures, of course, will be, does that drive incremental, profitable growth? So we have to measure that over some period of time. But we're pretty confident that while our guest does not want to be -- she sometimes doesn't want some help and other times she does, we believe we know the right way to do that. But we believe that for many of our guests with more knowledge, more recommendations from our associates, she may increase the units per transaction, and we'll measure that closely and make sure that, that kind of investment would work over time. Having said that, a lot of our supply chain investments will also, we hope over time, allow our associates to have more customer-facing time. So without incremental investments, we believe that's also going to be one of the ways that we can drive growth. 
Operator: We have no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the floor back over to Mary Dillon for closing remarks. 
Mary Dillon: In closing, I'd like to thank all of our ULTA beauty associates who delivered a great quarter while working to refine our strategy to drive sustainable, long-term growth. And thanks to all of you for your interest in ULTA Beauty. I look forward to speaking with you soon. 
Operator: Thank you. This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time and thank you for your participation.

===== 2013 Q4  (2014-03-13 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Greetings, and welcome to the Ulta Beauty Fourth Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Laurel Lefebvre, Vice President, Investor Relations. Thank you. Ms. Lefebvre, you may begin. 
Laurel Lefebvre: Thank you. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us for Ulta Beauty's fourth quarter 2013 conference call. Hosting our call are Mary Dillon, Chief Executive Officer; and Scott Settersten, Chief Financial Officer. Also joining us are Janet Taake, Chief Merchandising Officer; and Dave Kimbell, Chief Marketing Officer.

We make references during this call to the metric free cash flow, a non-GAAP financial measure defined as cash provided by operating activities minus purchases of property and equipment. We also refer to non-GAAP sales and earnings growth in 2013, adjusted for the 53rd week of fiscal 2012 and severance. 
 I'll now turn the call over to Mary. 
Mary Dillon: Thank you, Laurel. Good afternoon, everyone. Ulta Beauty achieved excellent sales growth in the fourth quarter, supported by a continued momentum in our e-commerce business. We delivered solid EPS growth in keeping with our expectations that we would need to invest some margin dollars to drive market share gains during a promotional holiday season. We also made significant forward progress in each of our 5 key strategies. 
 To recap the headlines. We grew sales 14.4% or 23.3% adjusted for the extra week in the fourth quarter of 2012. We delivered a 9.2% total company comp on top of an 8.6% comp in the fourth quarter of 2012, both including the impact of online sales growth. Our e-commerce business performed very well, driving 82.5% comp sales growth, which contributed 260 basis points to the comp. Similar to the rest of the year, prestige cosmetics and skincare were the strongest categories, while we continue to see weaker industry trends in the nail and fragrance categories. We were encouraged to see improvement in the transaction trends with a sequential improvement compared to the third quarter. While still slightly negative for retail stores, transactions increased about 1% including e-commerce, despite difficult traffic [ph] trends in the retail environment overall. Our comps continued to be mostly driven by tickets, about 1/3 of the increase coming from units per transaction and about 2/3 coming from average selling price. Earnings per share were up 9% to $1.09 or up 14.7% adjusted for the 53rd week last year. Scott will provide more details on our financial results for the quarter and on our guidance for 2014 in a couple of minutes. 
 But first, I want to update you on recent progress on the 5 components of our growth strategy: new store performance; new products, services and brands; our loyalty program; marketing; and ulta.com. 
 Starting with real estate. We opened 11 stores during the fourth quarter to complete the most ambitious store opening program in our company's history. We're very proud of our growth and development team's execution in delivering this new store program, as well as the hard work of the store operations, merchandising, supply chain and HR teams to get these stores staffed, merchandised and ready to serve our guests. New store productivity continues to be strong. We're on track with our plans to open about 100 stores in 2014, representing about -- approximately 15% square footage growth. This is a purposeful decision in our part, as we said last quarter, to moderate our pace of store growth. 
 New stores continue to provide excellent returns and will continue to be an important part of our growth strategy. We expect about 40% of these new stores to be in new markets, and about 60% are planned for filling in existing markets. We anticipate about 1/3 of the stores to be in new real estate, and the remaining 2/3 are planned for existing shopping centers. We expect about 15% of the 2014 class of stores will be in enclosed malls, adding to the 52 mall stores we have in the portfolio today. The rest will be in power centers or strip malls. 
 In terms of the pace of new store openings, we expect to open 19 in the first quarter, 19 in the second quarter, 43 in the third quarter and 19 in the fourth. We also plan to open 2 5,000-square-foot or small-format stores during the second half of the year in smaller markets with fewer households than what's typically required to support a 10,000-square-foot store. We're in the early stages of developing and testing this model, but we're very encouraged by the potential to extend our store growth and delight more new guests with a great Ulta Beauty experience. 
 We also plan to remodel about 12 stores to our latest store format this year and refloat the mass cosmetics planograms in about 60 stores to replace some dated fixtures and to create a more vibrant and consistent shopping experience in that category. Today, we have only 38 stores in older formats, about 5% of the fleet. We're very proud of our consistent and contemporary store portfolio. 
 Now -- turning now to merchandising. I'm delighted to announce that Janet Taake was recently promoted to Chief Merchandising Officer. Janet and her team have done a phenomenal job expanding our portfolio with new brands, products and services over the past several years and developing valuable partnerships with key vendors. They've also worked in concert with our marketing, e-commerce, operations and replenishment teams to make sure we launch new brands and products effectively. The recent launch of Urban Decay's Naked3 eyeshadow palette is a great example of this, where the merchants, CRM, e-commerce, supply chain and store teams worked together with our vendor partner to ensure customers got excited about the new products and had a great experience buying it from Ulta. 
 Our merchant team delivered a solid fourth quarter, with strong comp gains in prestige color and skincare offset by softness in traditional gift-giving categories like fragrance, bath and personal care appliances. While industry weakness in fragrance and nail polish have been well documented, there were several bright spots, including the successful launch of the fragrance, Our Moment by One Direction, driven by a major 360-degree launch, including print, email, social media, PR and digital marketing. We also saw strength in lower price point items like rollerball fragrances, and we made improvements to our holiday gift with purchase program, which helped drive sales in the fragrance category despite industry softness. 
 We were also pleased with our January performance with prestige skincare taking center stage with our Love Your Skin event, featuring daily in-store events. From a trend standpoint, our lip category continues to be a standout in delivering excellent growth. Skincare and anti-aging products remain high-growth categories as well, with new brands and products from Perricone, Meaningful Beauty and Philosophy contributing to the category's strong performance. 
 Looking ahead, we're excited that IT Cosmetics and Mally, launched last year in selected stores, will be rolling out to the entire chain later this quarter. Our customers have enthusiastically embraced these brands in our stores and online. 
 Turning to services. Our salon team delivered solid results in the fourth quarter to cap a great year where they contributed to the total company comp by improving retention of salon associates and refining offers to drive trial and awareness. In the fourth quarter, we rolled out eyelash application services in all stores. The salon artistic team created a lot of excitement by representing Ulta at Fashion Week in New York in early February, where they created the model hairstyles for various designers' runway shows. 
 Looking forward, we expect to add new services at our salons this year and roll out guest enhancements like text confirmations for appointments and 24/7 online appointment booking. We'll also feature salon services more prominently in our direct-mail campaign to communicate to our customers that Ulta is a destination for trend-right hair, skin and brow services. 
 Now moving on to an update on our loyalty program and customer relationship platform. We now have 13 million active loyalty members who have shopped with us within the past 12 months. We recently converted all of our customers to the ULTAmate Rewards program and the team executed a very smooth transition. Having all of our customers on one program, which uses points as currency, will enable a more efficient use of our CRM platform for targeted offers. And we've been working with our CRM platform for just over a year now, and we continue to test and fine-tune our offers, as well as work more closely with our vendors to develop compelling CRM campaigns. As a result of our improved ability to segment and target customers, we've been able to grow our conversion rates and drive more sales per marketing contact, which, in turn, helped us deliver strong comp growth in the fourth quarter. 
 Now turning to marketing. First, I'd like announce that Dave Kimbell has joined Ulta Beauty as our Chief Marketing Officer. Both the marketing team and e-commerce team report to Dave. Dave brings to Ulta his extensive experience in building consumer brands, including beauty products at Procter & Gamble and brands at Quaker foods and Seventh Generation. Dave was most recently CMO at U.S. Cellular, where he oversaw a team responsible for advertising, digital and e-commerce, retail design, pricing, promotion and consumer insights and analytics. Dave created a seamless and integrated a multichannel customer experience, which drove strong e-commerce growth. Dave will lead our efforts to drive greater awareness and clarity about the Ulta brand, increase customer acquisition and optimize the balance across promotional and brand-building activities over time. In addition, Dave will lead our omni-channel marketing and e-commerce efforts. 
 Now turning to marketing highlights from the fourth quarter. We were encouraged to stabilize the trend in transactions with our increased promotions to drive traffic and protect market share. During the holiday season, we also expanded our beauty sales program with hot offers in social media and ulta.com. In January, our signature Love Your Skin event, supported with a fully integrated digital and print campaign, drove a strong finish to the quarter. 
 Looking ahead to the first quarter, we're excited about our continuing digital brand-building efforts; our direct-mail campaign, featuring our spring trend report; and our highly anticipated 21 Days of Beauty promotion later this month with an amazing array of offers and events. 
 Now wrapping up with our fifth growth strategy, our e-commerce business. The fourth quarter was very strong for ulta.com with particular strength in prestige cosmetics, skincare and holiday promotional products. We benefited from our improved e-commerce platform that was launched in the fall, as well as increased fulfillment capabilities with the expansion of our northeast distribution center, which began shipping e-commerce orders this fall. With 83% comp growth for the quarter, ulta.com exceeded our expectations. While Black Friday and Cyber Monday were very successful, the team maintained strong momentum post-holiday as well. We're confident our e-commerce business will continue to deliver rapid growth in 2014 but will likely begin to moderate off a larger base, with top line growth expected in the 50% to 60% range. So this wraps up my update on our 5 growth strategies. 
 Before I turn over to Scott, I'd like to also give you a progress report on our strategy work and share my thoughts on our guidance for 2014. Ulta is a great business. I am very optimistic about our future. We're well positioned in the marketplace, and our core business model remains strong. I want Ulta to be the most popular destination for beauty products, services and experiences for women when and however she wants to shop. The long-range strategy we're developing will ensure that we deliver on this vision. We'll chart a course that allows us to continue to deliver an exceptional guest experience, be a terrific place to work and drive profitable growth for years to come. 
 We have a wonderful foundation to build on. We operate in the large and growing beauty industry. We offer many popular and exclusive brands. We have a track record of performance that's one of the best in retail. We offer a differentiated guest experience that involves products as well as services. We have excellent store economics. We also have a powerful and developing CRM capability and, of course, a great leadership team and passionate associates. That said, we cannot stand still. We see a clear line of sight to continue growth in the near term. However, we also need to invest in the strategies that will drive growth for the long term. Doing this now, while we're operating from a position of strength, will enable us to drive healthy, long-term performance for Ulta. 
 In our strategic planning work, we're taking the long view, projecting the consumer category in a competitive environment well into the future, refreshing our vision in how Ulta needs to continue to evolve our business model and developing a 5-year growth plan. Through this work, we'll create a playbook to anticipate and meet the guests' changing needs in a unique and differentiated fashion and to deliver profitable growth for our investors. Again, we're in an exciting -- we're in a very exciting growth business with passionate guests and associates and terrific vendor partners, a great basis for our future. 
 Now once we've completed this work in the fall, we'll share the resulting vision, strategies and 5-year financial targets. This work has already given us some clear insights that have helped inform our view for the current year with clarity around some of the investments, I believe, will drive future growth. Two of our biggest opportunities focus on the customer, acquiring new guests and making sure we continue to deliver a relevant and differentiated guest experience. As you are all well aware, retail is changing rapidly and customer expectations continue to rise and change as well. We need to invest to test and learn the most effective ways to increase awareness of Ulta, to drive new customers to our stores and website and to become less reliant on discounts over the long run. We also need to build the omni-channel capabilities that customers expect us to have and provide even better service in our stores. With our tremendous growth in prestige cosmetics and skincare over the past few years, customers today have higher expectations for our product knowledge and service standards and we need to respond to that. We believe that these investments in 2014 will help us to prioritize the best strategies to drive comp growth, as well as margin improvement. Our plan to deliver mid-teens earning growth in 2014 allows us the flexibility to make important investments today that we believe will set us up for future growth and success. 
 With that, I'll hand it over to Scott. 
Scott Settersten: Thanks, Mary. Good afternoon, everyone. We recorded total sales of $868.1 million compared to $758.8 million last year, an increase of 14.4%. Excluding the impact of approximately $55 million of sales in the 53rd week last year, sales growth on a 13-week-to-13-week basis was 23.3%. Comp store sales increased 9.2%. The retail comp was 6.6% and e-commerce growth of 83% added 260 basis points to the comp. Salon contributed slightly to the overall comp. 
 I would like to remind you that this comp performance benefited by more than 200 basis points due to comparisons to 2012 super storm Sandy negative impact and the timing effect of the extra week last year. Recall our comp compared weeks 40 to 52 of last year to those same weeks this year and excludes the 53rd week, which was an unusually large sales week for us. The underlying comp, excluding these factors, was more like 7%. 
 Gross profit dollars increased 13.1% to $293.6 million and gross profit margin declined 40 basis points to 33.8% from 34.2% in Q4 of last year, driven by strength in our prestige categories, offset by higher-than-expected promotional activity to drive sales. 
 SG&A expenses rose 15.4% to $177.6 million, up 20 basis points as a percentage of sales to 20.5% due to planned investments in supply chain, e-commerce and store labor but a bit better than expected, driven by strong expense controls. For example, we were more efficient with marketing spend by distributing more offers digitally via email and social media rather than printing directly on pieces. 
 Preopening expense was $1.8 million compared to $1.9 million in Q4 2012, driven by 11 store openings during the quarter compared to 13 new stores opened during Q4 of last year. Operating margin decreased 60 basis points to 13.1% versus 13.7% in Q4 of the prior year. 
 Net income increased 9.5% to $70.7 million or $1.09 per diluted share versus $64.5 million or $1 per diluted share last year. EPS grew 9% or 14.7%, excluding the approximately $0.05 attributed to the extra week in 2012. 
 Turning to the balance sheet. Inventories were $457.9 million at the end of the quarter compared to $361.1 million at the end of Q4 2012, up 3.3% on a per-store basis. This is consistent with our plans. Where after making permanent investments in inventory at the end of last year to improve in-stock levels and continuing to invest in prestige boutiques, we expected the inventory per door growth below comp growth by year end. 
 Capital expenditures were $49.1 million for the quarter, driven primarily by our new store opening program; and depreciation and amortization for the quarter were $28.7 million. Capital expenditures for the full year were $226 million. Roughly 60% of our capital spend was for new stores, remodels and relocations. The remaining 40% was for merchandise fixtures, including prestige boutiques, supply chain investments primarily related to the e-commerce expansion in Chambersburg, as well as IT investments including ulta.com and maintenance CapEx. We generated about $102 million of free cash flow for the year and ended the year with $419 million in cash. 
 Turning now to guidance for 2014. We expect to open about 100 new stores this year, and we'll increase our remodel program to about 12 stores. We anticipate comparable sales to increase in the 4% to 6% range. This is expected to yield top line growth in the mid-teens range for the year. P&L investments for the year include supply chain expenses to support the planned 2015 opening of a fourth DC, marketing to convert 50% of the country to the ULTAmate Rewards loyalty program and investments in increased trainings for both store and salon associates to improve the customer experience. 
 In addition, as Mary mentioned, all of the strategy work we have done so far identified significant opportunities to acquire new customers and drive a higher awareness of our brand. We also need to create a better customer experience with more omni-channel capabilities and more knowledgeable associates. We intend to allocate a pool of dollars to test and measure initiatives that we believe are critical to our long-term growth, as well as invest in some headcount to move these key initiatives forward. These initiatives to support future growth are expected to impact EPS by about $0.10. As a result, we expect that earnings per share will grow in the mid-teens percentage range this year, including those incremental initiatives representing $0.10 of earnings per share and excluding any potential accretion from share repurchases. As a reminder, we have an authorization in place with about $113 million remaining. 
 This outlook assumes the current economic and consumer environment remains stable in 2014. If macroeconomic conditions improve, we expect to do better. And we expect to invest about $265 million in capital in 2014, with approximately $115 million earmarked for new stores, remodels and relocations; $30 million for merchandise fixtures for existing stores; $50 million for IT systems, including e-commerce; $50 million for supply chain; and about $20 million for maintenance CapEx. 
 Turning more specifically to the first quarter of 2014. Going forward, we will provide quarterly guidance for sales, comps and EPS, but we'll no longer break out our expectations for gross margin and SG&A. We expect sales to increase in the range of $693 million to $704 million versus $582.7 million last year. We expect comparable sales to increase in the range of 5% to 7%. Preopening expense is expected to come in around $2.5 million, with 19 stores planned to open in the first quarter. We expect to achieve earnings per share in the range of $0.70 to $0.75 compared to $0.65 in Q1 of last year. 
 You may be expecting Q1 to be our strongest quarter relative to an easy gross margin comparison from Q1 of last year. In fact, we will see certain expenses hit Q1 that will make it a tougher quarter relative to the rest of the year. We will have costs related to the changes to the senior management team and consulting expense related to our strategy project with a significant portion of the work occurring in the first quarter. We're also incurring incremental marketing expenses related to the conversion of our loyalty program. At the same time, the first quarter represents the greatest headwind in terms of P&L deleverage due to the large number of younger stores that are still less than fully productive. Our tax rate is expected to be approximately 38.3% and our fully diluted share count will be approximately 64.9 million, excluding any share repurchase activity. 
 With that, I'll turn the call over to our conference call host to begin the Q&A session. Operator? 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Aram Rubinson with Wolfe Research. 
Aram Rubinson: A question around, well, 2 things, really. One is if you can help us -- tell us what you learned about your customer from fiddling with the promotional cadence in Q4? Just wondering whether it's mass or whether it's prestige, kind of what the customer's response was to changes in promotional strategy on either side of the store? 
Mary Dillon: This is Mary. Let me just say a couple of things. One is that we -- I guess, I would say that there's probably a tale of 2 customers that we see overall in our business. There's folks that are feeling probably pretty upbeat about their earnings and about the overall economic environment, tending to buy prestige. We saw on our ticket -- a pretty strong uptick in ticket. So there are folks certainly that are less promotional and buying our higher-margin prestige items. There's other folks, I would say, kind of the other part of our consumer base that are going to be more sensitive to promotions, more sensitive to the economic environment and probably more attracted to promotion. So those folks were, as we ramped up our promotional cadence, we think that was the right thing to do for that customer. So overall, for the quarter, we saw an improvement in traffic but still, most of our results in our comps was driven by ticket. So as I look at that overall, and that's just part of our test and learn, is we want to continue to dissect further what are the best drivers of incremental profitable growth as we use promotions, more or less, to drive results in any given period. 
Aram Rubinson: And just to quickly follow up, can you tell us what that increase in ticket looked like in the fourth quarter and also what promotional environment is embedded in '14, if you're expecting to be kind of more or less the same as 2013? 
Mary Dillon: Yes. Right now, I think we don't have any reason to think that '14 will be different than '13. So that -- we're assuming something pretty similar to that. In terms of the transaction versus ticket, so again, I would say, really pleased that we saw a sequential improvement in transactions in the fourth quarter. We were up about a point -- 1.2 in transaction and 8 in ticket for the total comp of 9.2. Transactions in the retail store were slightly down in stores, and they were offset by growth in salon and e-commerce. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Oliver Chen with Citigroup. 
Oliver Chen: Regarding your guidance for the first quarter and in your comps, the February has been pretty rough on everybody. Are you thinking that March and April could be better than February? And are there kind of thoughts around the dynamics you saw in February? Also, is e-com kind of experiencing seeing similar trends with respect to how the weather has impacted? Or is there -- if there's a dynamic there that you could share with us, that would be great. 
Scott Settersten: The guidance that we were providing, the 5% comp guidance includes, as it always has in the past, everything we know right up to the last minute. 
Mary Dillon: 5% to 7%. 
Scott Settersten: 5% to 7%, excuse me, which includes the current consumer environment and what's going on in the category. To the part of the question about e-commerce, funny enough, when we saw some of the toughest weather days in January, we didn't really see a huge spike in the e-commerce business, which kind of flew in the face of common sense from our vantage point. So it just seems like we have a good momentum there. We've made a lot of progress in our ability to merchandise that and expand the assortment online. We made good progress on expanding our margin rate there as well. So we're very happy with the over-performance of that business. 
Oliver Chen: Okay. And on the promotional strategies, what's your best strategy there in terms of things we should highlight or look to kind of offset or mitigate or work through what seems to be a continuation of the promotional landscape? 
Mary Dillon: Well, I'll say a couple of things. One is that we continue to learn from everything that we do and so finding -- as we think about even promotion on our holiday for next year, we'll step back and look at what worked well and what didn't work as well and we'll continue to refine our strategies for that. Understanding the shift in consumer shopping patterns to online, you see how that plays out in a holiday period, thinking about how they look at Ulta in terms of gift-giving versus buying for herself. Those are all things that we're considering as we think about how to continue to refine. But we certainly know that, that's the core [ph] that we're going to continue to be aggressive to grow our market share. And so I would expect it to continue to be a promotional time. The other thing I would say though is that one of the test-and-learn things that we're working -- we're going to do right away is we're going to do a deeper analytic work to quantify overall, setting aside holiday, just the incremental sales and profit impacts of all of our promotional initiatives, which will help us to get even more efficient and effective with that area of spending. So that's going to be an important area for us as we look to the future and how we balance non-promotional traffic and volume with promotional. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Ike Boruchow from Sterne Agee. 
Irwin Boruchow: I guess for Mary, the comments that you made about the investments into the brand, is there anything you can tell us about studies that you've done, that you can kind of see where your unaided brand awareness is today versus some of your peers and maybe how you think that could change over time? And then, I guess, one quick one for Scott. On the comp guidance for the year, can you help us think about what's embedded in that in terms of ticket and traffic? 
Mary Dillon: Yes, I'll start with the -- I'm not going to cite specific numbers. But certainly, we understand where we are, both in terms of aided and unaided awareness, and I consider this to be a great opportunity for us. We're not as high as we can be. And both in terms of awareness of Ulta, and I would say understanding the equity -- the brand equity of Ulta, what is it that we represent? What's the experience about? So both of those are areas that we know there's plenty of room to drive awareness at both of the store, what we offer in the store, the fact that we have the salon and services. All of that is going to be key areas for us as we test and learn this year. Because you -- to drive awareness, so consumers are bombarded with lots of messages all the time, right? So we have to be very purposeful in what and how we try to drive awareness and new guests to Ulta. Fortunately, there's plenty of ways to do that and one of the ways that we're going to be testing and learning is around more sophisticated customer-acquisition efforts, for example, as well as more traditional tactics. So there's, I think, some good opportunity there for us. 
Scott Settersten: And Ike, I would say, in the near term, we don't see any drastic sea changes as far as the makeup of the comp is concerned. So in the near term, we still expect ticket to be the primary driver of the comp. Although some of the initiatives -- the growth initiatives that we talked to, we're going to be focused on ways of trying to drive increased traffic, through either brand awareness activities or other things that we can do within the store. 
Irwin Boruchow: And one quick follow-up. You guys are actually one of the rare retailers that hasn't used weather as an excuse for the quarter. Is there anything you can mention about store closures or weather may be negatively impacting the comp for the quarter, maybe what it could've been or just to give some color around that? I would assume it was, at least, slightly negative to your traffic and your comp. 
Mary Dillon: Well, we certainly weren't immune to the weather. I think we had about 400 store closure days. Fortunately, a lot of our transactions are replenishments and items that perhaps our guest, if she can't buy that day, will come back and buy another day. So we didn't feel that -- could we have done somewhat better? Perhaps. But overall, we didn't see weather as a big -- having a big impact on our performance. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Gary Balter with Crédit Suisse. 
Gary Balter: Mary, you wrote in the press release, you may have mentioned it, that you had 25 significant new brands that helped in the comps. Can you talk about what's some of the bigger brands and brand additions were? 
Mary Dillon: Yes. Thank you, Gary. It's actually one of the, I think, most exciting parts of our story is that our guests, they love to come and find new things at Ulta. And Janet and her team have done a great job with that, so I'm going to ask Janet to take that question. 
Janet Taake: Gary, just quickly, some of the things that we launched last year, we launched Perricone around Mother's Day last year, which was a nice add to our skincare portfolio. We added Meaningful Beauty in the third quarter last year, another skincare brand. And color, we launched it in about 50% of our doors last fall. And as Mary mentioned in our prepared remarks, we're taking it to all doors in this quarter. We put Mally in a handful of doors, but we had Lipstick Queen. We had many -- there were several different brands throughout the entire store. We also launched Jane in the mass arena. So we added brands across all of the businesses, including professional haircare. We talk a lot about prestige, but we really added brands across all categories. So those are some of the highlights. 
Gary Balter: And just, Scott, could you go into bit more detail possibly on the product gross margin and how we should think about what the impact was in fourth quarter? And how -- I know you said -- I think you already said you're not going to talk about the gross margin, but if you want to give us any thoughts about how we model it out for the rest of the -- for this year. 
Scott Settersten: Yes. I guess, I can reference to give you a little color on the fourth quarter. So with gross profit rate was down 40 basis points. And as we've talked about it on our third quarter call, we're always ready to invest a bit of margin rate to protect our market share gains, and we did that. We had to do it in the fourth quarter. We -- also how it shook out. I would say that the 40 basis points, just to give you a little more specificity on that, it wasn't -- part of it was due to mix in the business overall. So as e-commerce continues to grow at an accelerated pace and becomes a larger part of our overall growth profile. While we've been very successful increasing the margin rate in that business, as you look at it individually year-over-year, it does put a bit of a bite on overall margin rate because it does contribute at a somewhat lower rate than our bricks and mortar. 
Gary Balter: And [indiscernible] going forward? You're not... 
Scott Settersten: We would expect that phenomena to continue a bit. Although we will continue to focus on merchandising there and other marketing tactics in e-commerce to help drive a better margin rate in 2014. That's part of our plan. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Fassler with Goldman Sachs. 
Matthew Fassler: My first question relates to the loyalty program conversion. I guess it's great to hear about this happening with no hitches and no evident costs, given that, I think, the second stage or the conversion of the prior stage had been a bit more challenging. Can you talk about what improved in your process as you converted this -- the rest of the country to the current model of the loyalty program? 
Scott Settersten: Yes. We talked about this a number of times before, explaining to people some of the hard lessons we learned on the first time around, Matt, that I'm sure we've had these conversations with you as well. So the team, we were just better prepared. We had a better communication strategy to our customer. We kind of transitioned them out of the old certificate program into the points program in a more seamless manner so it was clear to them, and it was communicated as a big step-up with an improvement in the loyalty program overall. So we're very happy. The team did a great job getting us through that in a very transparent way. And just to be clear on the margin rate, we talk about loyalty. And it is a bit of a headwind on our margin rate for next year as we -- again, we discussed this in the past. But in the long term, it drives incremental comp sales and incremental gross profit margin dollars. 
Matthew Fassler: Great. And then my second question, Mary, a call or 2 ago, you spoke about the changes that you're making in supply chain -- that you had made in supply chain and human resources. After the close today, another company, not a competitor, talked about hiring someone who had been your CIO. I'm just curious, any other changes -- any changes in the management team since the last conference call? As I know you've been centrally organizing the team in -- with your vision. 
Mary Dillon: Right, absolutely. Matt, thank you. Well, first of all, as I mentioned, 2 changes, our folks who are in the room here with us today. So Janet Taake, being promoted to Chief Merchandising Officer; and then the addition of Dave Kimbell as the Chief Marketing Officer. Yes. And right now, we -- found -- and Steve Junk is our Interim Chief Information Officer. Steve's been at Ulta for many years and has great deep experience. Our CIO went to another company and fortunately, Steve is able to step in and play that role for us and he's doing a fantastic job. And over time, we'll probably look to have somebody in that role for a long term. But right now, Steve is running the ship for us and doing a great job. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Brian Tunick with JPMorgan Chase & Company. 
Bilun Boyner: This is Bilun Boyner on for Brian today. I guess, I just wanted to ask about the supply chain, DC and the omni-channel investment that is still in your $0.10 incremental SG&A impact guidance. Clearly, there are ongoing investments. But where would you say we are in that process? Are we towards the tail end of the chunk of those investments? I guess, by our math, they impacted earnings last year by about $0.03 to $0.04, so do you think it is reasonable to expect a similar impact this year from those and then they should start to minimize into next year? 
Scott Settersten: Yes. Let me take that one. The $0.03 that you referred to in 2013, the way we described it to folks is that was kind of a down payment on a longer-term supply chain project that we have that we talked to with investors quite a bit in 2013. So that was consulting work to help us kind of blueprint what the future supply chain would look like. Now we're shifting in to actually constructing the supply chain, and we're looking at a new -- a fourth building coming online in the middle of 2015. So now, we're moving to more of a [indiscernible] kind of phase of the project as we find a location, put up a building and get it staffed up and pre-opened and ready to go in 2015. So that'll be the first step. On a longer range, supply chain re-formulation, let's call it, we're going to look and make some significant improvements in the way we do business. We expect that to drive significant efficiencies across the supply chain over the long term. But it's going to be a multiyear project, and it's going to include going back and looking at some of our existing facilities and perhaps doing some retrofit work there so... 
Bilun Boyner: Okay, that's helpful. And then my second question is on the salon and the Ulta brand. Clearly, there are big differentiating factors here. Can you help us better understand what your vision is for them and where you see the opportunities, maybe how we should expect to see you really play them to your strength going forward and in 2014? 
Mary Dillon: I'm sorry. Did you say salon? 
Bilun Boyner: Yes. 
Mary Dillon: And Ulta brands. 
Bilun Boyner: Yes, yes, yes. 
Mary Dillon: Yes. Right now, I mean, the services part of our business is not that big. But we consider it a really great strategic asset in that for the long term, having a place to go to get a great haircut and color, skin services, with all the different kind of services we can imagine adding, will be something that really differentiates us. And as well, our salon guest is our best guest. She comes frequently and she purchases more than just the services. So that's a great part of our business. As we're looking at our strategic planning work, we'll consider options around how we think about that going forward. With the Ulta brand as well, we've got a really nice brand of products, a very large brand of color and skincare and sun care. And we've relaunched many of those with new packaging. We're going to be merchandising them even more effectively in 2014, and that's a -- we think that's a good basis off of which to grow as well. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Daniel Hofkin with William Blair & Company. 
Daniel Hofkin: Nice job navigating a noisy environment with a healthy comp. Just wanted to understand a little bit better, maybe bridge the -- kind of the updated EPS growth guidance for 2014 with the prior guidance from December. So all of the $0.10 is incremental, correct? 
Mary Dillon: Yes. I will just state that really -- the change in our view from December is really centered around our belief that we have the opportunity to leverage off our position of strength right now, and invest in initiatives that we think are important to drive the future -- best way to drive future long-term and profitable growth. So that is all incremental and it's around the different areas that we described, which is brand awareness, getting more new guests, improving the guest experience, as well as making sure that we resource our company with the talent and skills that we need to drive that long-term success. 
Daniel Hofkin: And the $0.10 includes all of those items? 
Mary Dillon: Yes. 
Daniel Hofkin: Okay. So if my math is right, that's about a 3-percentage-point impact. Let's say, going from previously, give or take, around 20% expected growth to now about mid-teens, it's, give or take, 1 to 3 percentage points additional. And I'm just wondering if you can kind of bridge that remaining gap a little bit. Was it -- are you expecting kind of a little more gross margin investment based on what you saw through the holiday period, that kind of thing or just maybe help tie that up? 
Mary Dillon: I know -- I mean, what we said is that we would be around high teens similar to 2013, and we're guiding to mid-teens right now so... 
Daniel Hofkin: Okay. Maybe I didn't catch that right before. I thought the previous thought was around 20% at the midpoint. 
Mary Dillon: Yes. Dan, we were trying to not give a single point estimate for the guidance but say that the next year was going to be very similar and not try to give a very detailed guidance but in that range. So you're right, if it was exactly the same, it would be there. But with more of a range in mid-teens, that 3 points is really the difference between our view then and today. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Neely Tamminga with Piper Jaffray. 
Neely Tamminga: Neely Tamminga from Piper Jaffray. I was just wondering if we could talk a little bit about mobile and maybe get into a little bit more of the nitty-gritty, some of your specific initiatives for mobile in 2014. You guys have made some great strides in your app over the last 6 months and really starting to tie loyalty there. And just wondering how you're -- how you are seeing your mobile shoppers, which are probably your more engaged shoppers, how are they using the app and are they adapting into the technology and what more can you offer them in 2014? 
David Kimbell: It's Dave Kimbell. I'll take that one. Mobile has been an increasing part of our business and as part of our total kind of e-commerce sales platform, and it's now representing about probably 1/4 of our total e-commerce sales. So it's a bigger part and growing very quickly. The new app, as you said, has been a big improvement for us, and we're going to continue to find ways to drive that, to market differently within the mobile space, to look for different offers in different times. Of course, mobile does provide us some -- with some unique opportunities to reach our consumer in very relevant places at relevant times. We're looking at creating some in-store applications, expanding WiFi in our stores, which will also allow her to use those services more seamlessly within our stores and continue to find new ways to improve the effectiveness of the app across different platforms, including phone and tablet. So we see that as a big platform where we've been very successful. It's growing, but we also think we're kind of just scratching the surface on fully maximizing the opportunity in that space. 
Neely Tamminga: Dave, could you actually be looking at implementing some iBeacons potentially in 2014? 
David Kimbell: I'm sorry. Some what? 
Neely Tamminga: iBeacons. 
David Kimbell: That isn't necessarily in our pipeline, but we're going to take a look at everything that's available to us as we look at new ways to create that experience. Mary talked about broader omni-channel and, of course, mobile is a big part of that. So as we look at -- there's a robust pipeline of ideas that we have both in this year and over the next 3 years to try to create a more seamless experience. So we'll look at all those things and try to drive that going forward. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Joseph Altobello with Oppenheimer. 
Morey Marcus: This is Morey Marcus in for Joseph. My first question has -- just going back to incremental investments and going back to 2013, back in Q2, you discussed there's going to be around $0.13. What did it actually end up being? 
Scott Settersten: It ended up being at roughly $0.13. Again, the pacing during the quarter has changed a little bit throughout the year as we've kind of toggled back and forth with some of these things. And you recall, we talked about supply chain. The $0.03 that was related to supply chain we slowed down a little bit during the course of the year. So quarter-to-quarter, it changed a bit. 
Morey Marcus: Okay, great. And then going back to the headwinds of the loyalty program for 2014, I know you said you really won't go into margins that much, but can you talk about, I guess, the timing of that impact? Do you expect it to be evenly distributed throughout the year or like kind of like [indiscernible] around quarter? 
Scott Settersten: No. It's evenly distributed throughout the year. So the way the margin rate headwind comes into being is way they earn the points and the way they redeem points. So it's kind of evenly spread throughout the course of the year. And then by the time we cycle through a full year cycle is where we expect it to be kind of back at a breakeven from a pure dollars standpoint. So at that point, is where the comp increases start to materialize and we start seeing better gross margin dollars. 
Morey Marcus: Okay. And then my last question, and I may have missed this, did the reduced reliance on price promotion have a significant impact on the quarter? And also, have you possibly rethought the strategy going forward? 
Scott Settersten: No. We actually were more promotional in the fourth quarter than we had originally expected earlier in the year and a bit more than we were expecting even at -- when we gave guidance for the fourth quarter. So with the tough holiday, we invested where we thought it was appropriate. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Jason Gere with KeyBanc. 
Jason Gere: Maybe I'll dovetail off of that last question. So I know you're not giving specific guidance about the gross margin SG&A but I just kind of want to talk a little bit about this past year, gross margin a little bit more promotional. It was flat year-over-year. The year before, you had strong gross margin. So as we think about the -- I guess, the cost of doing business, do you think that the levels that we're seeing now will kind of stay intact? And then as we think about operating margin expansion over time, which I know you'll talk about in the fall, is this really going to be relying on the SG&A leverage, especially as, I guess, we kind of anniversary some of these higher investments that you need to make over this year and I don't know if, potentially, next year as well? So I'm just wondering if you can just maybe kind of maybe guide a little bit on that. 
Scott Settersten: Yes. Jason, I would say directionally, if we look in the first quarter this year, we'd expect to see some merchandise margin expansion. So the whole notion of us trying to do a better job with zeroing in on offers with customers and trying to toggle back and forth there and try to pull back a bit on the discounts to drive the business, we're still on that path. We believe in that. Last year, we saw good response to that at the early part of the year. We -- when we saw a bit of rough waters, we reacted to that in the fourth quarter. So that's still part of our plan, and we still expect to see some merchandise margin expansion in 2014. 
Jason Gere: So we should see gross margin then somewhere between '12 and -- what you achieved in '12 and '13. I mean, obviously, not putting an exact number to it but there will be gross margin expansion this year. 
Scott Settersten: I wouldn't go quite that far. I'll finish my thought here. We're going to see merchandise margin expansion. That's going to be offset by fixed store cost deleverage, especially the first half of 2014. We've got 125 new stores coming in -- into the maturity curve here and it's still very early days for those stores, so it puts pressure on us most noticeably in the first half of the year. When we look out longer term, it's not really a story of SG&A leverage. I mean, we expect that to be part of operating margin expansion over the long term. But we -- the key drivers are really prestige mix of the business. Again, it's a richer part. We expect that to add, albeit probably not at the same rate we've seen over the last couple of years. We expect e-commerce, again, better merchandising there. And marketing tactics, we expect that to improve rate -- operating rate here in the future and supply chain investments. We're making a lot of significant investments there now. They're creating some headwinds for us over the near term. But over the long term, they're going to create a lot of efficiencies for us across the chain. 
Mary Dillon: Yes. And I will just add that back to the test and learn theme here, for the longer haul, we know we can and will focus on how can we drive demand for Ulta in a way that's even more profitable over time, right? So it's -- whether it's about new guests who discover us, more footsteps in the store, more targeted promotions, more of a balance on spending that drives awareness in new guests versus price discounts, those are the kind of things that -- it's all part of the business and then that's also part of what we're going to investigate, test and assess as we go forward to say, "How can we continue to get even more efficient in terms of how we create demand across the business?" 
Jason Gere: Okay. And just for clarification, of the $0.10, how much hits SG&A? How much is gross margin? Can you just -- is there any breakdown there? 
Scott Settersten: The majority of it hits the SG&A line. 
Jason Gere: That's what I thought. Okay. And then the last question is housekeeping. Just with fewer stores open this year, how should we think about the preopening expense for this year? Is there -- can you guide at least on that for the full year? I know you gave for the quarter, but just wondering if... 
Scott Settersten: Yes. I think we provided the store count by quarter, right? For the full year, I think you guys can probably do the math on what the average is and... 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Evren Kopelman from Wells Fargo. 
Evren Kopelman: Two questions. First, on the Lancôme and Clinique, do you plan to add any more of those boutiques this year and what's kind of a long-term thinking there on the expansion? Maybe what have you seen in terms of the impact to the stores that they are in? The second question is on the share repurchases. We've only seen you repurchase stock once on an opportunistic basis. Should we expect a more regular program or kind of expect you to continue to be opportunistic there? 
Janet Taake: I'll take the first question on Clinique and Lancôme. Just a reminder, we opened over 80 boutiques last year between Clinique and Lancôme. So from a sales perspective, we will get benefit. But those stores are still ramping in the stores that we opened them in and basically, we wouldn't break out specific information beyond that. What I would say is we're very pleased with the performance in all the boutiques that we have between Clinique and Lancôme, and we are hopeful that we will be expanding both those brands in the future. But today, I have nothing to really announce or share with you at this time. 
Scott Settersten: And as far as the repurchase activity is concerned, management and the board continue to review best uses of excess cash and returning value to shareholders. We will continue to buy back shares opportunistically, and we will be maintaining our investment discipline and returns on that kind of thing. We'll be framing up our long-term capital allocation and shareholder return methodology. That's part and parcel of our strategy work that we're in right now and that -- you can expect that we'll be sharing details with you on that in the fall when we communicate the entire strategy. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Mark Altschwager with Robert W. Baird. 
Mark Altschwager: I just want to touch quickly on the trends with fulfillment. Can you talk about where you are with in-stock rates in the stores? And how much opportunity is there to drive better conversion through the supply chain investments and improvements in that area? And similarly, can you talk about how you're going to balance the breadth and depth of SKUs as you test these smaller-format stores? 
Mary Dillon: Yes. Those are all great questions. Certainly, the -- our view on the supply chain investment over time is to do several things for us. We build the infrastructure that we need for growth, capabilities to meet guest expectations across channel, optimize our end-to-end efficiencies. Certainly, a piece of that is stronger allocation, forecasting and replenishment capabilities. So all of those are areas that we know and plan -- and have a plan for in terms of how we continue to improve. Our in-stock position, we feel, is good. We look at that obviously every day, every week. There's some transitions happening as we to start the year in terms of some planograms, new brands in, et cetera, and that creates a little bit of some transition. But overall, we were very pleased with our in-stock rate this year. Our supply chain team worked really hard against some pretty tough weather situations as we ended the year, and we came out feeling very good about our position. 
Mark Altschwager: And then just the balancing of the breadth and depth with the smaller format? 
Mary Dillon: Oh, yes. That's a great question. We're in the early stages of nailing that down and that is something that we'll obviously be working on as we finish our plans to open up the 2 small stores this year, small format. There's the overall idea here. I mean, there's certainly been some thinking on it already but it's to bring an Ulta experience to our guest in a smaller way, in a smaller-format way. So obviously, that's going to take some curating of the number of SKUs that we offer. But we expect that it will continue to be the kind of experience where she has everything from prestige to mass brands, that she has the salon that she can use. So all of that will be in the experience set and it's a matter of how do we curate from there. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Jill Nelson with Johnson Rice. 
Jill Caruthers: I just have a couple of quick clarification questions. Did you mention in the fourth quarter that gift items were weak? Or were you just mainly talking about kind of the fragrance, which is a main gift category for holiday? 
Mary Dillon: Well, I would say items that are typically gift-giving that we would see -- were softer in terms of the category. So fragrance, personal care, appliances, et cetera. That was, I think, a broader industry trend, not just an Ulta trend. 
Jill Caruthers: Okay. And did you see any lifts in certain categories when you did increase the promotion? Just trying to see if you saw some nice correlation with traffic and when you did increase promotional activity. 
Mary Dillon: Yes, I would say it was just pretty much across the board. 
Jill Caruthers: Okay. And then just a question on inventory plans. How should we look at the inventory growth for the remainder of the year if you're looking to have it grow on a per-store basis below comp expectations? 
Scott Settersten: Yes, we would. Jill, we would expect it to 2014 as we continue on the trend that we see here at the end of the year. We expect our comp -- our inventory per door to be well below comp store growth. We believe we've got good processes, systems and people in place to maintain the discipline there. I mean, in -- during 2013, we were kind of lapping some unusual items with some inventory investments that we saw that caused some variability early in the year, but we believe now we're back on track where we want to be. 
Jill Caruthers: All right. And then just last one, given some of the recent management changes, is there any other positions that remain open or you're looking to add new folks to? 
Mary Dillon: I'm really pleased with our management team. I think we're gelling really nicely and right now, we're -- I think we're in a good place. We may -- we -- businesses always change and evolve, so you never say never but we're good. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Dana Telsey with Telsey Advisory Group. 
Dana Telsey: Can you talk a little bit -- any more color on the new store productivity levels? What you saw and how does it compare to the prior years? And then just lastly, what type of comp do you need to leverage expenses? And it's very exciting about all the new brands in 2013, how many brands in 2014? 
Scott Settersten: Dana, as far as the new store productivity is concerned, we continue to be very pleased with productivity in new stores and the investment returns that it's generating for our shareholders. If you adjust the comp, the 9.2 comp for e-commerce and super storm Sandy measurement, the calendar shift, the stores are generally in the same vicinity as they were back in the third quarter and the way they were for most of 2013. So the new store model is intact. New stores are comping just the way we expect in years 1 through 5. And some of the older stores, of course, are in the healthy low single-digit range. So kind of where we expect them to be and frankly, with the environment that we're in right now, we're fairly happy with that performance. We think we can do better on that. That's a focus in 2014 for us to try to figure out how to better drive comps in some of our more mature stores. 
Janet Taake: As far as new brands, as Mary mentioned, IT is rolling to all doors and Mally to all doors. And beyond that, I would really refrain from mentioning any new brands coming in. But we're always working on new brands, new products, exclusive products for our guests to surprise and delight her. So there will be more coming down the pipeline. 
Operator: There are no further questions at this time. I'd like to turn the floor back to management for closing comments. 
Mary Dillon: Thank you. In closing, I'd like to thank all of our Ulta Beauty associates who worked very hard to drive excellent top line growth and deliver solid earnings growth in 2014 despite a very volatile consumer environment. We opened 125 stores, dramatically improved our e-commerce business and continued to enhance our merchandise assortment, loyalty program and marketing capabilities, all while laying the groundwork for continued strong performance. Thank you, all, for your interest in Ulta Beauty, and I look forward to speaking with all of you soon. 
Operator: This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.

I'm pleased to report solid top line performance in the third quarter and, in particular, rapid growth in our e-commerce business despite a tougher-than-expected sales environment. After seeing good momentum in the second quarter and early in the third quarter, our sales trends in retail customer transactions softened somewhat in late September and October. 
 We adjusted our promotional strategy to drive transactions and deliver healthy top line growth but gave up a bit of margin in the process. We nonetheless delivered solid earnings growth in line with sales growth, excluding severance charges, and made good progress in each of our key strategies.
 To recap the headlines, we grew sales 22.4% and delivered a 6.8% total company comp, following an 8.9% comp in the third quarter of 2012, both including the impact of online sales growth. E-commerce built on a strong momentum with 74% growth, contributing 170 basis points to the comp.
 Prestige Cosmetics and skincare continue to be the strongest categories while we experienced some softness in the nail and fragrance categories, consistent with industry-wide trends. Our comp was driven entirely by ticket, evenly split between units per transaction and average selling price, while transactions were slightly negative.
 Part of this transaction decline was driven by this year's strategy of reducing and better targeting our coupons and price promotions intended to reduce reliance on such discounts over time. We also believe we experienced a wider weakness in traffic that many retailers felt in the third quarter. In light of this change in trend, we elected late in the quarter to increase our promotions in order to protect our market share gains in an incrementally tougher retail landscape.
 GAAP earnings per share were $0.70, up 18%. Earnings per share, excluding severance charges and retention costs, were $0.72, up 22%. Charges for severance and retention costs resulted from changes at the senior management level to strengthen media capabilities in supply chain and human resources.
 We achieved slightly less gross margin expansion than we planned as a result of our increased level of promotion to drive sales late in the quarter. Investments in supply chain, e-commerce and labor came in as expected.
 The current trend in the business and the overall heightened promotional environment for the holiday season are making us more cautious on earnings expectations for the fourth quarter and heading into next year. As you've seen in the press release, we've lowered our earning growth rate expectations for the fourth quarter and the full year of 2013.
 In addition, while we're still in the midst of the budgeting process and haven't finalized our plan for 2014, based on what we know today about our square footage plans likely in the 15% range and several investments we need to prioritize to drive sustainable long-term growth, we expect that our earnings growth next year will likely be in a similar range to the current year.
 Looking even further ahead, I'm sure you're all anxious to understand how this more muted view of the end of the current year and next year fits into our long-term sales and earnings algorithm. Right now, our first priority is to focus on delivering a strong holiday for Ulta and to continue to deliver market share gains.
 We're also focused on the long-term view and are currently conducting an in-depth and future-focused strategic planning process to align and prioritize our growth strategies, as well as the additional investments we'll need to make -- we'll need to make to remain a high-performance and high-growth company. 
 Since I joined Ulta Beauty in July, I've continued to be impressed by the strength of our business model and the passion of our associates. I'm confident in our ability to offer a differentiated total experience for our guests now and into the future, whether in our store, our salon or online.
 Over the next several years, it's clear that our square footage growth will necessarily moderate off a larger base, and we'll need to find new ways to grow. I believe there are significant opportunities ahead for Ulta in areas such as driving higher brand awareness; developing smaller and urban store formats; increasing our digital presence, both online and in-store; and growing our capabilities to enable initiatives like localization of assortment.
 I've also seen we need to upgrade our capabilities in certain areas which will require additional investment over a multi-year horizon in order to achieve our growth aspirations. Some of the areas we plan to invest in include: customer-facing training in our stores and salons; systems investments to improve the customer experience; digital marketing to drive brand awareness and a multi-year supply chain project, including a new warehouse in 2015.
 As we complete our in-depth strategic planning process over the next several months, we plan to be in a position to update our long-term growth targets. We expect to remain a high-performance, high-growth company while building an even stronger foundation for the future.
 Scott will provide more details on our financial results for the third quarter and our guidance in a moment, but first I'd like to update you on recent progress on the 5 components of our strategy to build an even stronger business for the long term: store growth; new products, services and brands; our loyalty program; marketing and ulta.com.
 Starting with real estate. We opened up 55 stores during the quarter, the most new stores we've ever opened in one quarter. With additional 10 stores already open in the early fourth quarter and one planned for January, we are close to completion of our 2013 real estate program of 125 stores and remain very pleased with the team's execution of store openings and the productivity of our new stores.
 We're still finalizing our plans for our 2014 real estate program and expect to grow square footage approximately 15%. We also plan to remodel several more stores than we did this year and are still finalizing the scope of the remodel program.
 We also anticipate a large number of smaller in-store projects such as additional prestige boutiques and reflowing the mass cosmetics planogram in some of the older stores to make the shopping experience in that category more consistent across the chain. We believe this balanced approach will lead to continued excellent store performance, but will obviously have an impact on the top line following 2 years of 22% to 23% square footage growth.
 Turning now to merchandising. We continue to expand our portfolio with new brands, products and services. In fact, it's been my pleasure over the past several months to meet many of our key vendor partners to learn about their businesses and brands and collaborate on how we'll continue to partner together.
 Recent launches of IT Cosmetics and Mally have been very strong out of the gate, and we're seeing excellent performance from brands like Urban Decay and many of the exclusive kits we've developed with them and several other prestige brands.
 In the personal care appliances category, the innovative Curl Secret from Conair has been a hit with our customers, and we expect it to be a big seller through the holidays.
 To update you on the rollout of Lancôme and Clinique boutiques, as of the end of Q3, we've completed the buildout of these prestige boutiques that we planned for this year. We now have 100 stores with Clinique boutiques and 105 stores with Lancôme boutiques. Customers are responding very well to our offering in both brands, which add to our positioning as a beauty destination.
 We continue to see rapid growth also in the Benefit brand. We now have Benefit Brow Bars in 500 stores, and 225 of these stores are offering the new service of brow tinting, which is off to a great start. A strong services offering combined with a steady stream of launches of successful products are making Benefit one of the fastest-growing brands in our portfolio.
 Looking ahead, we see a strong pipeline of new brands and innovation in the beauty industry. While we don't generally launch many new brands in the fourth quarter, as we're focusing on holiday, we're excited to announce exclusively at Ulta, the Japonesque Color Collection, a beautifully packaged line of prestige cosmetics from the brand famous for high-quality brushes. 
 We also introduced the new Pedi Sonic from Clarisonic, adding to this brand's high-growth portfolio of skin care tools. The highly anticipated Urban Decay Naked3 palette will be launching next week, with a significant marketing plan to take advantage of that franchise's cult following.
 Turning to salon. The salon team continues to have a great year with strong top line performance, which again this quarter, contributed to the total company comp. With solid execution and promotions, expansion of services like lash extensions and programs that are improving the tenure of our stylists, the salon team is gaining share. We continue to see significant opportunity to drive awareness and trial of our services offering and differentiate Ulta as the perfect beauty destination.
 Moving on to an update on our loyalty programs and customer relationship management platform. We currently have 12.5 million active loyalty members who have shopped within the last 12 months, up 18% compared to last year, in part driven by a loyalty sweepstakes program during the quarter which drove strong new customer acquisition.
 We continue to see increases in retention in our loyalty customer base, and average sales per existing customer are growing. We're on track to convert all our customers to the ULTAmate Rewards program in the first quarter of 2014. Having all our customers on the points-based program will enable more efficient use of our CRM platform.
 And now turning to marketing. During the quarter, we executed our signature 21 Days of Beauty event, featuring special deals and events focused on prestige brands. We continue our support of the Breast Cancer Research Foundation in October through the sale of products in our stores, events like our Salon Cut-A-Thon and other events and programs designed to raise awareness of the cause.
 In November, we ran a 2-week event in 100 stores called Brows Across America to highlight Benefit brow services. This program exceeded expectations, driving incremental sales, as well as awareness and excitement in our stores.
 We also continued to evolve our tactics to reduce reliance on price promotions, such as tailoring our offers and better segmentation of our customer base and increased brand equity events like the ones just mentioned. While this change did have a somewhat dampening effect on the transactions versus a year ago, we do feel this is a better way to build our business over the long term. We'll continue to refine this strategy, and we'll be nimble with our promotional cadence so we can respond to changes in the environment the way we did late in the quarter. We're confident we're building better tools and better insights to pursue a stronger promotion strategy in the long run.
 Looking ahead to the fourth quarter and important holiday season, we're focused on continuing to grow market share to a strong set of offerings, including a strength in gift with purchase program and marketing campaigns designed around some of our hottest new fragrances.
 Next week, we're launching a marketing campaign designed to generate excitement about the launch of the Urban Decay Naked3 palette, offering fans a chance to buy the latest palette in advance of the official launch.
 And wrapping up with our fifth growth strategy, our e-commerce business. Q3 was an excellent quarter for ulta.com, demonstrating continued momentum on the top line despite tough prior year comparisons and a major site relaunch. Our limited-time Beauty Breaks!, our sample beauty bags and CRM program all contributed to better-than-expected sales growth.
 Ulta.com delivered continued margin improvement through growing scale, better supply chain capabilities and a favorable product mix. The biggest news for ulta.com is the launch of our new website, a significant step forward for us. The platform was rolled out over a period of several weeks to make sure the new site was operating the way we planned.
 The new site enhances visibility to our product assortment, highlighting bestsellers and featuring products across all categories. Search capabilities were vastly improved, and brands were recognized for better visibility.
 Ulta is one of the first retailers to feature Responsive Web Design, a new technology that enables a consistent browsing experience regardless of the device the customer is using, be it a laptop, mobile phone or tablet. The new site is receiving positive consumer feedback on the usability improvements and browsing experience, and we're seeing an increase in conversion rates on the new site. I'd like to congratulate our entire team for their great execution and focus in delivering a top-notch website and supporting a successful Black Friday and Cyber Monday.
 On the supply chain side, we continue to ramp up the volume of e-commerce orders fulfilled out of our Northeast D.C. Chambersburg is well-staffed for the holidays and operating very effectively. Our associates supporting our e-commerce business in both Romeoville and Chambersburg are working very hard to support customer demand throughout this holiday season.
 This completes my updates of the progress on our 5 growth priorities. And with that, now I'll hand it over to Scott. 
Scott Settersten: Thanks, Mary. Good afternoon, everyone. We recorded total sales of $618.8 million compared to $505.6 million last year, an increase of 22.4%, with a comp store sales increase of 6.8%. The retail comp was 5.1%, and e-commerce growth of 74% added 170 basis points to the comp.
 Gross profit dollars increased 24.9% to $231.7 million, and gross profit margin rose 70 basis points to 37.4% from 36.7% in Q3 of last year, driven by strength in our prestige categories and better-than-expected leverage of fixed costs.
 While strong, this margin expansion was a bit less than our guidance due to an uptick in promotional activity later in the quarter to drive sales amid weaker-than-expected consumer traffic.
 SG&A expenses, excluding the impact of the severance charges Mary mentioned, rose 26.7% to $149.5 million, up 90 basis points as a percentage of sales to 24.2%. This was driven by the planned investments on our new website, supply chain project, store labor and brand awareness that we've discussed previously, in line with our expectations.
 Preopening expense increased to $7.5 million compared to $6.3 million last year, driven by 55 store openings during the quarter compared to 49 new stores opened during Q3 of last year. Operating margin, including the severance charges, decreased 30 basis points to 11.8% versus 12.1% last year.
 Net income increased 19.1% to $45.4 million, or $0.70 per diluted share, versus $38.2 million, or $0.59 per diluted share, last year. Excluding the severance charges, EPS was $0.72, or 22% growth.
 Turning to the balance sheet. Inventories were $582.3 million at the end of the quarter compared to $462.8 million at the end of Q3 2012, up 1.7% on a per-store basis. This is consistent with our plan for the year where, after making permanent investments in inventory at the end of last year to improve InStyle levels and continuing to invest in prestige boutiques, we expect to see inventory per door growth below comp growth by the end of the year.
 Capital expenditures were $78.9 million for the quarter, driven primarily by our new store opening program. And depreciation and amortization for the quarter were $27 million.
 Turning now to guidance for the fourth quarter. Based on current sales trends, less certainty about consumer sentiment and what appears to be shaping up to be a highly promotional holiday season, we believe it is prudent to take a more cautious view of the fourth quarter from a margin perspective since we are focused, as we have always been, on maintaining strong market share gains.
 We expect sales to increase in the range of $853 million to $867 million versus $758.8 million last year, which included an extra week. We expect comparable store sales to increase in the range of 7% to 9%. Our same-store sales comparison for the quarter is based on weeks 40 to 52.
 We have 2 elements at work in Q4 that drive the comp metric but do not translate to earnings: first, we benefit from the comparison to the disruption we experienced due to the Superstorm Sandy disaster, which negatively impacted last year's Q4 comp by roughly 100 basis points; second, we have an easier comparison as a result of not lapping the 53rd week of 2012, which was a strong sales week. Absent these one-time impacts, our comp guidance would be 5% to 7%.
 We will open 11 new stores in the fourth quarter to complete our 2013 plan versus 13 in last year's fourth quarter, so preopening expense is expected to be in line with last year. We expect to achieve earnings per share in the range of $1.07 to $1.10 compared to last year, which it was $1, which included about $0.05 of benefit from the extra week.
 Gross profit margin is now expected to be flat as we prepare to participate in a highly promotional holiday season. SG&A rate is expected to increase 50 basis points versus last year's 20.3% rate due to planned investments in the business. Operating margin may be expected to decrease approximately 50 basis points.
 Our tax rate is expected to be approximately 38.2%, and our fully diluted share count will be approximately 65 million.
 Turning now to the full year 2013. In light of the weaker-than-expected back half of the year and conservative earnings view on Q4, we now expect 2013 to come in at an earnings growth rate in the 20% range, adjusted for the 53rd week last year, compared to our previous expectation of mid-20s percentage EPS growth.
 We expect the full year comp to be in the range of 7% to 8%, and CapEx will be approximately $225 million. As you know, we give specific guidance about the coming year on our Q4 conference call in March. We are not changing that practice.
 At this point in the year, we are deep in our planning process for 2014. While we are not yet prepared to give specific guidance for next year, we wanted to share some of our preliminary views. First, we expect square footage growth to moderate off a larger base to about 15% versus 22% this year. Second, while the beauty category overall continues to grow, industry growth in both prestige and mass had been less robust in recent years, and a deceleration has continued during 2013. We have also seen weaker trends in several categories, including nail and fragrance, consistent with the industry. Third, we expect to continue to invest for the future in areas that will improve the guest experience and give us stronger multi-channel capabilities, primarily in the areas of supply chain and in-store technology improvements.
 We are still in the process of making decisions for 2014 to deliver the best possible results while investing for the future. However, assuming industry growth dynamics remain unchanged and a less certain consumer macro environment continues into next year, we believe it is prudent to plan for earnings growth similar to 2013, as we may have to maintain a more promotional posture to maintain market share gains.
 As Mary mentioned, we have some work to do on our long-range plan before providing a definitive update on our longer-term growth expectations. So stay tuned for more details on the multi-year view beyond 2014.
 On a final note, I'd like to remind you all that on our June conference call, we announced that we were discontinuing our practice of announcing holiday sales in early January. With that, I'll turn the call over to our conference call host to begin the Q&A session. Operator? 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Oliver Chen of Citigroup. 
Nancy Hilliker: This is Nancy Hilliker filling in for Oliver Chen. I -- my first question is related really to the promotional strategy. Have you guys seen a difference in promotion, different ideas that you have been testing over the past quarter and the past month? And then is there any approach to maybe competitors offering prestige beauty online? Are you seeing any approach -- a different approach to strategy in terms of that as well? 
Mary Dillon: Well, let me take a start at this, which is in terms of promotions, I would say that over the course of the year, we have been, I think, smartly experimenting with different ways to drive consumer retention and value with less discounting. So through the use of our CRM capabilities and some tweaks to some of our other tactics, we've been learning and experimenting with what our parameters are around how we can sort of drive long-term growth with little bit less reliance on promotion. And as we said, as we saw the environment start to change towards the end of the third quarter, the great thing is that we were able to nimbly, I would say, adjust and adapt to that because we have tools that we can turn very quickly. So we're going to continue to look for ways for the long haul. We can reduce some reliance on promotion and price discounts. But also, as we said in the call, we want to play to win, and we're going to continue to be aggressive in the fourth quarter, as we expect it to be very promotional. 
Nancy Hilliker: And then any -- just as a follow-up, any thoughts as to the online competitors? Are there any other promotional strategies maybe that you can use to continue to gain market share? 
Mary Dillon: Well, first of all, it's a -- there's a lot of activity in this category, that's for sure, and we are certainly aggressive. Our e-commerce performance in the quarter, we're very proud about that, and particularly the change for our new website, which is performing extremely well with even stronger conversion. So we're constantly watching the competitive environment certainly. And I don't think there's anything that we've seen that surprised us, but we know we should be in a stance to continue to be aggressive. And again, with our tools being more nimble and facile, and I think more consumer-friendly on our website, it gives us the opportunity to continue to play very strong. 
Operator: The next question is from Brian Tunick of JPMorgan. 
Brian Tunick: I guess just looking ahead for a second first, Scott, does it make sense, broadly speaking, that if you're guiding us for 15% square footage growth and for earnings growth next year to be similar to this year, that, that would embed a 50-, 60-basis-point operating margin expansion? And just wondering, if that's true, what buckets or what areas would be gross or SG&A that you would expect operating margin expansion? And then does your view that the earnings -- or your guidance is under a view going forward, does that take away the midteen operating margin that the previous management team had offered to the Street before, given how you guys are now looking at the business model with slowing category growth? 
Scott Settersten: Thanks, Brian. I guess the first thing I would say is we're not giving any specific guidance for 2014 at this point in time. But being mindful of your question, I think directionally, we would think 2014 would shape up much in the way that 2013 did, with the emphasis and the strategy being on trying to lever back on the promotional environment overall and continuing to develop the guest experience in the store to drive the business, long-term profitable growth of the guest experience in our stores. So big picture, I would say it's more in the merchandise margin and gross profit line, directionally speaking, for 2014. Again, much like it was in 2013. As with respect to the midteens operating margin target, again, I would say that we're suspending that initially by what we're seeing here for the near term on 2014 and what we think the guidance targets are for 2014. 
Operator: The next question is from Aram Rubinson of Wolfe Research. 
Aram Rubinson: You guys have a very high dollars per square foot level, around $415, and it seems like you are trying to figure out the balance between how much of that is kind of sticky customers and how much of that might be cherry pickers, because you're struggling maybe to balance the promotional cadence. If you were to kind of look at your customer base and say, hey, that $415, if we had kind of the right customers in the store for the brand, where do you think that sales per square foot number would actually be? I'm just trying to figure out how much of there might be at risk. And then if you can also just tell us how you're fiddling with the promotional cadence, just to kind of make sure that, that drop-off, if there is one, doesn't happen too quick? 
Mary Dillon: Well, let me just start in a couple of ways. One is that we -- as we described in terms of the full year expectations, this is -- we are still performing at a strong level in terms of top line growth and really, one of the top in the industry. So we're not troubled by what we're seeing in terms of our customer trends. What we are doing is reacting to an environment that looks to be more promotional and also being mindful of future investments that we believe need to be made to continue to support our growing business. So our base of customers right now is strong. I mean, we've got a really strong loyalty membership group of customers who are very responsive, and we're learning as we're tweaking some of our tactics about how to really personalize and customize offers to them in a way that we believe will drive, as it is, more units per transaction. And that's a good thing. So the way that we're thinking about our promotional tactics right now, I would say, is really not dramatic. These are small changes around the edges to learn about the sensitivity, and we're doing them at the time that the marketplace is maybe a little bit volatile and consumer sentiment is a little bit unpredictable. The good news is that we can ratchet back, which is what we've done, to our more traditional cadence. But I believe we've got the best tools that we've ever had to continue to test and learn. And we know that there's a lot of guests who -- there's a lot for them to discover at Ulta and a lot of products that, when we bring it to their attention via some of our e-mails and Beauty Breaks! and whatnot, we're seeing great response. So we'll continue to play with that and drive our growth. 
Aram Rubinson: And just to follow up and recap this quarter, as far as I can tell, you did kind of hit your earnings target and you did hit your sales target, and you did have gross margins up with merchandise margins from the 10-Q saying that, that was kind of up 60 basis points. And your inventories weren't too out of whack. So I guess I'm just wondering as well, if you're doing any kind of bar setting as a new CEO coming in or -- because the numbers look good overall, at least for Ulta, to what you had issued in terms of guidance. 
Mary Dillon: Well, that's an accurate reflection of our performance relative to guidance. And really, what we're doing today is just what we think is our best view of what to expect in the fourth quarter, given the environment as well as our preliminary view of 2014. Ulta is and will still continue to be a high-growth company, and the 2014 look that we're giving, which isn't guidance, but the early view, is still a very high-growth company. But it is different than what was stated before. I would say this isn't about bar setting, but it is about -- as Scott said and I said in my comments, this is also a great time for us just to take a step back and really create a 10-year view of Ulta. It's been a very successful company for many years, but like any business, the environment changes, whether it's the consumer environment, the categories we compete in, the competitive environment. So we really want to take a very thoughtful and deep view of our strategic planning. There's going to be plenty of choices we believe we have for future growth. We want to prioritize those and then come back with guidance based on that work. 
Operator: The next question is from Gary Balter of Credit Suisse. 
Gary Balter: Mary, the tone that we're hearing is different than on your last quarter. So is it -- could you walk us through kind of -- in the last 3 months or maybe it's longer than that, what are the elements within the company that you felt aren't executing, that require the investments that you're talking about that kind of say, let's slow the growth, let's reinvest, let's pull out with a better company? Where is the focus right now for where you need to make those investments? 
Mary Dillon: Well, I guess I would say a couple of things. One is we're also in an environment that's changing and fluid in the marketplace. So as we said in the third quarter, we did see a change in our trend towards the end of the quarter, and we're reacting to that. So I feel very optimistic and upbeat about our prospects. And again, we're going to come out of this year with a very top performance in terms of top and bottom line. But it's somewhat different than what we would have guided, even really just coming in -- out of the -- in the middle of the second quarter. So that's different, and that would give us a reason to say let's look at our preliminary view of 2014 and provide the best transparency to that, that we can. Beyond that, I feel very optimistic about our future growth prospects. I'd say the only thing that's different is, as I learned about our business, I continue to be very optimistic. But I think we're going to have to be choiceful in terms of how we pick our spots for future growth. There's investments that will continue to be required as we look at a competitive environment that's increasingly omni-channel. Consumer views are changing, categories are evolving. So it's really not anything more than -- regardless of how this quarter performed, we would have been doing the strategic planning, frankly, and really want to come out in the future with our best view of what that future growth looks like. And I continue -- we very much expect Ulta to continue to be a high-growth, high-performance company. That stance has not changed. 
Gary Balter: Okay. And just following up and then I'll get off, the -- you mentioned a few times, including in this answer, competitive environment is changing and got tougher. What -- could you be a little more specific on what's changed from expectations? Because everybody kind of expected a difficult Christmas period. 
Mary Dillon: I was talking about [ph] more of a long term view which was that as we know that there's more people competing in beauty and really the need to be able to really operate in a very omni-channel environment, which is part of what our investment in our supply chain and ITs are going to allow us to do. In terms of the short term, I would just say, as we saw some impacts on our traffic -- I mean, our transactions, is that -- towards the end of the second quarter relative to our promotional changes, we felt that it's probably a little bit more promotionally sensitive than we might have thought going into the fourth quarter. But not dramatically so. 
Operator: The next question is from Evren Kopelman of Wells Fargo. 
Evren Kopelman: I wanted to ask in terms of the slowdown you saw at the end of the quarter, is it primarily a nail and fragrance category issue that you mentioned? Or did you see a slowdown in the growth rates of even the outperforming categories like the prestige skincare fragrance and salon? 
Scott Settersten: Yes. Hey, Evren, a couple of data points again for people who follow the industry fairly closely. If you look back over the last couple of years, so 8 to 10 quarters, you would notice that both prestige and mass color cosmetic categories were really at the high-water mark at the end of fiscal 2011. So both of those categories were just into the double-digit year-over-year growth rates at that point in time, and they've both been on a slow deceleration over the course of the last 2 years so that we ended our Q3 -- I think mass color year-over-year was flat, and prestige color was low to mid-single-digits. So we're bucking those headwinds as well overall in our box besides the category -- the nail and the fragrance deceleration that has been talked about in the open marketplace here for the last couple of quarters. So there's a number of headwinds that we have category-wise that, to this point in time, we've been able to mitigate fairly well, even with the pullback on some of the promotional things that we're doing for the business. So people are curious as to the timing of things. Coming out of Q2, we felt really good about where we were. Our plans were working, we felt comfortable with where we were through the guidance phase of the last quarter's call. And really, this transaction trend went south on us late September and really heavily into October. So we're taking a really close look at that both from an internal view on what did we do that could have changed the guest perception or shopping patterns, or was it more macro kinds of things that have kind of stacked on top of each other here over time. So again, we're deep into the investigation process on all of those things, and you can -- rest assured, we're working hard to try to find the answer. 
Evren Kopelman: Great. That makes sense. The other question is your younger stores typically comp stronger than your older ones as the younger ones mature. Have you seen any changes to that historical trend? Or can we expect that to continue? 
Scott Settersten: No. The comp stack for the third quarter is pretty similar to what we had back in the first quarter so you can remember back, we did a 6.7% all-in comp in the first quarter. We're doing a 6.80% or so. By and large, the stores look the same. Still the stores from 0 to 5 years, that comp ramp looks exactly the same as what's reflected in our model. When you get beyond year 5, years 6 through 15 is roughly in the -- it's in the solid low-single digit range. And then when you get beyond the 15-year range, it's more or less a net 0. So consistent with what we would expect at this kind of comp level. So again, we feel -- we're pleased with the 2013 slate of new stores and no change in the ramps. 
Operator: The next question is from Ike Boruchow with Sterne Agee. 
Irwin Boruchow: I guess my question is the last time we heard from you, you were guiding a 5% to 7% comp for both Q3 and the year, which I think essentially implied a 5% to 7% comp for Q4. So to guide it now a 7% to 9% comp for Q4 with sales that are so far below the Street is just a little confusing. So I guess can you just help us understand the Q4 top line outlook and how does that compare to your view of what the Q4 sales number was going to be 3 months ago? 
Scott Settersten: Yes. We tried to give you a realistic view of the business. Again, I mentioned in my prepared comments that there's 200 basis points in that 7% to 9%, Ike, that's really just a basic measurement, the arithmetic measure versus last year. So it's not really reflective of the core of the business. The core business is still operating at a 5% to 7%. 
Irwin Boruchow: But when we think about the outlook for Q4 coming down, is that a function -- I mean, you said more promotional environment. So obviously, margins lower than you had planned. But are the sales -- the total sales dollars, are those also -- where you're putting them now, are they lower than where you thought 3 months ago? Or is that not -- is that somewhat unchanged? 
Scott Settersten: They are somewhat lower. I mean, we did see a dropoff in retail sales late in the third quarter, which we mentioned here, driven by transaction deceleration. So we have taken down our internal view of what we expect retail sales to be in the fourth quarter. So yes, that has been taken down somewhat. 
Operator: The next question is from Daniel Hofkin of William Blair. 
Daniel Hofkin: Just to follow up on that question, I guess still not completely clear. Like, where -- if you have -- I totally get that last year's comparison was affected by Sandy. That ought to benefit your comp growth and your total sales growth, it would seem, this year. So we're just trying to understand what appears to be, and again, maybe it's just the calendar shift that you described, but what appears to be a mismatch between the comp that you're projecting and the total sales growth, which has a much smaller spread relative to the comp than we're used to seeing. That's the first question. 
Scott Settersten: Dan, I don't think I really have anything more to share on that one other than the 200 -- we're calling it 200 basis points roughly of the year-over-year comparison. And we have taken down our retail estimates, our retail comp estimates for the fourth quarter that are really -- really, it's the competitive environment and the conservative view that we're taking on the fourth quarter and what the margin rate investment is going to be to maintain those sales levels. 
Daniel Hofkin: So are you implying that you're expecting a moderation in new store performance or, let's say, non-comp store performance in the balance of the year that's maybe more significant? 
Scott Settersten: No. I don't think so. I mean, our stores are continuing to perform at the levels that we expect them to. We may not see an overperformance kind of environment, like maybe that you've seen in the past or have been reflected in models just through the delivering of actual results. Historically, stores have -- our new store program has way overdelivered what our initial expectations were. So naturally, in an environment where comps are a bit more challenged, there's going to be some kind of headwinds on those new stores. I mean, they're not immune to what's going on with the macro consumer environment. So that might be a bit [indiscernible] if you're looking at it from a modeling perspective. 
Operator: The next question is from Matthew Fassler of Goldman Sachs. 
Matthew Fassler: First question I would ask, you talked about severance and some changes that you're making in supply chain and HR. Could you give us any more details on the changes that you made there? 
Mary Dillon: Yes, sure. That was related to 2 changes at the executive team level in terms of the HR and the supply chain functions and just my judgment about capabilities that we needed there for the future. So we've got a great strong team here, we made a couple of changes and we're moving forward. 
Matthew Fassler: So, Mary, did you replace the senior executives in those roles with internal people at this stage? 
Mary Dillon: One was internal and one was external. 
Matthew Fassler: Okay. My second question relates to the real estate plans. So this year, obviously, you were in the -- you're going to end up in the low to mid-20s. You were pretty close to that last year. And I guess in '11 and prior to that, I guess you had peaked at 15%, but that was sort of coming out of a downturn. So I guess as I combine the move to 15% next year with your discussion of developing urban and smaller store prototypes, what's your sense of the blue sky footprint potential for the existing format as you have it? And would you say that's changed at all from perhaps what you guys have talked about prior to the time you came to the company? 
Scott Settersten: No, Matt. Our view is on the 1,200-store potential for our 10,000 square foot box. Nothing's changed with respect to any of that. Again, what we're faced with here in the near term, we think, is just -- it's whatever, a pendulum swing that will come and it will go, and consumer and category itself will bounce back here. Again, over the long term, we feel really good about our model and about the category overall. As we look at next year, it's really a balance. I think we've said before that 125 stores this year was kind on the outer reaches of what we felt like we could do comfortably, both supporting it with operating disciplines and training and all the other things we have to do with our new store associates. As we look to next year, we want to do a few more remodels, so that's kind of -- again, those are more or less like a new store, so that kind adds in -- gets you to your total buildout. And then there's a few more things internally that we want to do, kind of in-store projects with planogram changes in the mass area and a few other things we want to do. So all in all, we feel really comfortable with where we are, and it's more of a balanced approach next year. 
Matthew Fassler: Got it. And one last quick one. So if you think about the promotional environment, I guess, last year in the fourth quarter, the gross margin had a bit of a setback. It almost seems like there are other seasonal entrants into the business or some of your competitors choose to turn up the juice at this time of year. It seems to be a recurring pattern. Is it the year-round players who you find aggravating the competitive backdrop? Or are there more seasonal players, be it general merchants or others, who tend to refocus on this around holiday, who seem to be gumming up the works a bit from a margin perspective? 
Scott Settersten: Well, one thing I do want to point out is that in the fourth quarter, even though we're guiding gross profits flat year-over-year, we are expecting merchandise margin to expand by roughly 50 basis points. So our plan of trying to balance the promotional environment here whilst continuing to drive a great value orientation for our customer is still in place. What we've seen here develop recently -- again, everybody sees this in the news, right? Our mailboxes are full every night, our e-mail accounts are full. We see the fashion and soft good guys out there with 50% off the whole store on the first week in a holiday. I mean, that -- nobody really expected that. I mean, we knew it was going to be competitive, but we didn't know it was going to be to this extent. So looking at it again objectively, in a balanced way, we said we need to compete here to maintain our gains. But when I think back -- and this is one of the benefits, I guess, for being around for a while, right? Thinking back, analogizing back to really -- the last time we saw discussions about inventory levels with these soft good players and the need to get through this stuff before the end of the holiday season was back in 2008, and that was a tough environment for everyone. And we'll take the same view this year as we did then, a balanced view between investing margin and chasing the comp number. So we'll be very mindful of that. 
Mary Dillon: Yes. I just want to add one thing, which is that up until a recent shift in trend, these tweaks to our promotional strategy were encouraging to us. So in no way, shape or form did we step back from that as a longer-term way for us to continue to drive top line and bottom line, because we know we're getting smarter, we can test and learn. And yet, if the environment changed, we can respond to it. But we're going to continue to drive that over the long haul. 
Operator: The next question is from David Wu of Telsey Advisory Group. 
David Wu: First, in terms of next year's square footage guidance of 15% growth, which obviously -- that's at the low end of your long-term target range of 15% to 20%, and I understand that you're planning to do more remodels next year. But can you talk about whether -- or why you're not opening up more stores next year and if you're perhaps seeing any real estate limitations out there, and if you're still sort of sticking to your long-term 15% to 20% square footage growth target range? 
Mary Dillon: Well, let me just start by saying that 125 stores this year, we've said, is probably about the peak in terms of really just executing with excellence. Every time we open up new stores, we do a great job identifying real estate and constructing those stores. We also have to hire folks and staff them and train them and have them ready for our guests. So we feel good about that number and really believe that, coming down off of that, is really just a way for next year to make sure that we're striking that right balance. We're not concerned about our ability to find the right real estate and to build those stores, and we're not concerned about the productivity of our store model. We just think this is a better pace for us right now. 
David Wu: Great. And can you talk more about your strategy for the brand boutiques, including your initial plans for next year and what the longer-term opportunity could be? 
Mary Dillon: Well, as you know, we are really thrilled with the fact that our assortment continues to evolve. Our team here has done a great job partnering with really great vendors and iconic brands, and that's been part of the magic of Ulta, frankly. And it's great. So as I said in my prepared comments, we've gone to 100 Clinique store boutiques and 105 Lancôme boutiques this year, which is great. Benefit boutique doing exceptionally well, and we're going to continue to build out that strategy. So I can't tell you specifics today, but you can imagine that, that's high on our hit list of things to continue to build on. 
David Wu: Great. In terms of the higher promotions, are you expecting this to impact your non-prestige business? Or are you becoming more promotional also on the prestige side? 
Scott Settersten: No. By and large, again, when we talk about promotions and discounting, that is non-prestige kind of business. So prestige product, that category, by and large, there is no discounting allowed. It's an SRP out the door. 
David Wu: Got it. So in terms of then the slower traffic and sales that you saw towards the tail end of September and into October, did that mainly impact then sort of the non-prestige side? Or did you also see a little bit of a pullback on prestige as well? 
Scott Settersten: No. The promotions itself, it's generally non-prestige-related. Again, from time to time, prestige becomes part of the mix with some of the offers that we give our guests. But by and large, in the third quarter, it was non-prestige-related categories. 
David Wu: Where you saw the pullback? 
Scott Settersten: Yes. 
Operator: The next question is from Mark Altschwager of Robert W. Baird. 
Mark Altschwager: I wanted to touch a bit more on the supply chain side. Mary, I was hoping you could talk about your long-term vision there. You made some changes, so what is your assessment of the supply chain today? And where does it need to go in order to support the type of growth that Ulta is capable of? 
Mary Dillon: Sure. Well, I -- we'll just answer that really at a macro level. But our supply chain today, I think, is performing very well for us, yet we know that we need to do more, especially because number one, we're a growing business. So we need more infrastructure to support our multi-year growth plans. We also know that we need to continually increase our ability to compete in an omni-channel way. So we're thrilled with our e-commerce performance, but we want to make sure that we have the capability at a minimum to be able to have our guests, for example, understand if they can order online and pick up in our stores. Whether or not we ship from stores is a different question, but we're really looking at the range of capabilities. And as I'm sure you imagine, that's not the -- you need to have the right systems in place to allow that kind of capability. And we also know that we have opportunities just in end-to-end efficiency in our supply chain. So we've taken some time to really build a robust view of that. We're -- the first stage of that is really building a new distribution center in 2015, which we're planning. But beyond that, there's also plans to invest in the right systems and in people and capability and capacity to support our long-term growth ambitions. We plan to get to 1,200 stores and continue to be a very high-growth retailer, so we need a supply chain that supports that. 
Mark Altschwager: Okay. And then on the services side, where do you see the biggest opportunities? And how do you think about allocating the space in the store? And then as the environment gets more competitive, how do services fit with the long-term vision of building brand awareness and customer engagement? 
Mary Dillon: Right. I think it's a perfect example of -- we sit back and think about our 10-year view of Ulta and how we want to really differentiate Ulta. That's exactly the kind of question we're asking ourselves. Ultimately, we really have a differentiated proposition today because of the one-stop shop ability, the exciting assortment that we offer, but also the fact that you can get services in our stores, which I don't think anybody can get online yet and hopefully never. But anyway -- so we've got a really differentiated concept that we believe is going to really be the place that allows us to win for the long term. So we're going to examine what we think about trends, consumer trends, anti-aging -- an example might be skin health, right? So there's ways that we can think about. Is there more we can do there? But that's just one example. But we'll put all those under the, I guess, sort of the examination lens here as we think about places that we'll continue to invest to grow. So -- but for sure, services will continue to be part of our long-term proposition. 
Operator: The next question is from Kayla Berg of Piper Jaffray. 
Kayla Berg: First, if you would, could you share your thoughts about approaching holiday from a digital marketing perspective versus last year? And also, how do you guys feel positioned for holiday in fragrances here across the price points and newness? 
Mary Dillon: Okay. Can I ask you guys to take those for us? Janet and Jeff, you want to take the marketing? We have our team here. 
Jeffrey Severts: Sure. Well, Kayla, I would say that our digital marketing efforts will be pretty consistent with what you've seen from us for the balance of the year. So as we've talked through the first couple of quarters of the year, we're a lot more focused on the digital space than we have been traditionally, and you're just going to see that continue. Not going to give you much more detail than that because I'm sure the competition would love to hear it. 
Janet Taake: And in fragrance -- this is Janet. Basically, we have our exclusive gift with purchase that we started in November and continue through holiday, and that is exclusive to Ulta and something we have done for many, many years. And we're very excited. We've improved the quality of both of those. One has already been in the stores, and the second one hit this week actually. But we're also encouraged by some of the newness that we have seen at the end of third quarter. Just to comment on One Direction, out of the box was very strong, along with Honey from Mark Jacobs and a few other things. So gift sets are strong. And also, I think that we feel very good about some of the opening price points in purse sprays or roller balls, if you will. So from a fragrance perspective, we're ready for holiday. 
Kayla Berg: Okay. And one last quick follow-up. Where do you guys expect to end the year in terms of inventory levels? 
Scott Settersten: We expect to end the year in line -- similar to where we ended the third quarter. So it'll be well below what the comp increase is for the year. We feel very, very comfortable with our inventory position. Again, as many of you know, there's very little in the way of fashion risk in our inventory, so very low obsolescence risk. So again, very comfortable we're on plan and expecting to hit our targets at the end of the year. 
Operator: The next question is from Krystyna Metcalf of Oppenheimer. 
Krystyna Metcalf: Most of my questions have already been asked, but I was just wondering if salon comps were still above product comps this quarter? 
Scott Settersten: They were indeed. They were -- they added roughly... 
Mary Dillon: 10 basis points. 
Scott Settersten: 10 basis points to the comp for the quarter. So still performing very strong. 
Krystyna Metcalf: Great. And then I'm not sure if you answered this already, but I believe last quarter, you said that you were expecting e-commerce sales to go down just because of the new website rollout? And obviously, this quarter, they were pretty similar. So what are your expectations for 4Q? 
Mary Dillon: Well, yes. We were very happy with that transition, and we were being cautious about that. So that's better than we expected. The first 3 quarters still, I would say, were benefiting from some pretty high-ticket products that we were selling that were hot products and -- I mean, supplements and some tools. We're excited about our continued growth, but the comps do get tougher going forward. So we're going to continue to grow. I'm not sure if we're citing a specific number, but it's -- we're going to continue to have tough comps, but we also feel more optimistic with the transition going better than it did, I might add. 
Scott Settersten: And I would add, we picked up steam at the end of 2012 with our e-commerce site. They had a really good fourth quarter, so I wouldn't expect the 70% growth for the fourth quarter year-over-year. 
Operator: We have time for one more question from Jill Nelson of Johnson Rice. 
Jill Caruthers: A quick one on fourth quarter gross margin. You did mention that merchandise margins are planned up. Could you talk about maybe the pressures in that line item you're expecting? 
Scott Settersten: On the gross profit line? 
Jill Caruthers: Yes, because you had said, for overall, it'd be flat. 
Scott Settersten: Right. So we are happily expecting to see merchandise margin expansion with product mix and the prestige mix being richer as part of the overall business. We do have headwinds with fixed store cost. That's really the primary offset there, Jill. So it's really the accelerated new store program, especially with 125 new stores now kind of entering into the chain here late in the third quarter. So that's the headwind that's offsetting the merchandise margin gains. 
Jill Caruthers: Okay. And then kind of big-picture question into 2014. Clearly, you need to put in more investments into the business. And could you maybe just talk about some of the big buckets? You've mentioned supply chain, but maybe if you could put them in order? Or just some type of magnitude of where you feel like the company has underinvested and what needs to help grow the business for -- into next year? 
Scott Settersten: Yes. I wouldn't use the term underinvested, Jill. I mean, there is -- I think we've talked to many of you, at least I have, over the last year. Right? I mean, as a growing company, there's always things we'd like invest in, but you need to have the proper team in place and the proper third parties to help coach you along in some of these more complicated kinds of things. So I would just remind everyone, the biggest investment we're making is in the new store program. So big acceleration in 2012 and into 2013. And even next year, at 15%, 100 stores, do the arithmetic. That's no small feat for us. And that's still -- the best investment produces the best shareholder returns that we currently have. So in the current term though, that creates some headwinds for us on fixed store cost. Again, we don't get the leverage with all those stores going in place that we have in recent years, so that hurts us a bit. Some of the investments are more certain things. Mary talked about supply chain. We're going to get a lot of new capabilities there, which are going to be very helpful for us down the road. There's things in IT. Again, they're primarily customer-facing kinds of investments. So in-store POS systems that will allow us to do more mobile and all that kind of flashy iPad stuff, which everyone does now and we need to invest in as well. That's what the guests expects. There's other investments like brand awareness, marketing investments, training for store associates to make sure we give the right guest experience in places like skin category, which is high touch and high impact. So those things -- those are one of the things that we're talking about as part of the strategic planning process and how far do we need to go and to what extent do we need to do those kinds of things. So -- and then there are other things I'd call kind of compliance costs, non-investments, but will be a drag on earnings next year around health care. So some of that stuff is starting to kick in now. And I can tell you, generally speaking, it's more expensive than anybody really thought initially. So that's kind of the short bucket list for what we're looking at for 2014. 
Operator: That is all the time we have for questions. I'd like to turn the floor back over to Ms. Dillon for any closing remarks. 
Mary Dillon: In closing, I'd like to thank all of our Ulta Beauty associates who worked very hard to deliver solid results in a tough environment in the third quarter. I'm very proud of the team for driving strong store sales while delivering on elements of our longer-term initiatives to position the company for success over the long haul. While we're acknowledging some of the challenges we're facing in the near term, I know the long-term opportunities for Ulta still make it one of the most exciting growth stories in all of retail. Thank you for your interest in Ulta Beauty, and I look forward to speaking with you soon. 
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and thank you for your participation.

===== 2013 Q2  (2013-09-12 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Greetings, and welcome to the Ulta Beauty Second Quarter 2013 Earnings Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Laurel Lefebvre, Vice President, Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin. 
Laurel Lefebvre: Thank you. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us for Ulta Beauty's Second Quarter 2013 Conference Call. Hosting our call are Mary Dillon, Chief Executive Officer; and Scott Settersten, Chief Financial Officer. Also joining us today are Janet Taake, Senior Vice President of Merchandising; and Jeff Severts, Senior Vice President of Marketing.

 We may make references during this call to the metric free cash flow, a non-GAAP financial measure defined as cash provided by operating activities minus purchases of property and equipment.
 With that, I'll turn the call over to Mary. 
Mary Dillon: Thank you, Laurel. Good afternoon, everyone. I'm delighted to be hosting my first earnings conference call as the CEO of Ulta Beauty. The team delivered an excellent second quarter with strong sales and margin performance. 
 Our second quarter performance highlights many of the reasons I decided to join Ulta. We operate in an industry that's growing and important to our guests. Ulta has a differentiated format that resonates with customers. We have a solid long-term growth strategy and a strong team that's executing that strategy very well. 
 Leading that team for much of the second quarter was our interim CEO, Dennis Eck, and I would like to thank Dennis for his leadership and dedication to the success of Ulta Beauty over the past few months, and the other board members for their support as well. 
 Now to recap the Q2 headlines. We grew the top line 24.8%. Comparable store sales increased 8.4%, including the impact of our e-commerce business, which continued its rapid growth with a 72% top line increase. Operating income increased 26.8% and operating margin improved 20 basis points to 12.1%. Earnings per share increased 29.6% to $0.70 per share. The team will provide more details on the results and the drivers for the quarter. 
 Before that, I'd like to make a couple of comments on my perspective on the business after my first 2 months on the job. Ulta has enjoyed tremendous success for the past several years, executing a well-defined strategy. And that includes accelerating store growth, introducing new products, services and brands, enhancing our loyalty program, broadening our marketing reach and increasing our digital focus, including ulta.com. 
 I don't plan to make any radical changes to this strategy, but rather I plan to expand and build upon this solid foundation. In my first couple of months, I've been in our stores getting to know the business and our people. I'm incredibly excited about our potential. The beauty category is expected to continue to grow 3% to 4% over the long term, and I believe Ulta can continue to capture market share. 
 I expect that share gains will come through new store growth, healthy same-store sales growth, driven by new customer acquisition and more frequent visits of existing customers who are attracted by newness in our offering and the strength of our marketing and loyalty programs. 
 We'll continue our focus in introducing new products and services that drive traffic on continuously improving our loyalty program with increased simplicity and benefits for the customer; on delivering value to the customer through our gift-with-purchase programs, discounts and special offers; and improving our CRM program to better target and refine our offerings. 
 In addition, I see great opportunity to test and activate new strategies to further drive growth and profitability. These include: driving greater awareness of Ulta as a brand and a retail concept in creating a stronger emotional connection to our brand; deepening our insights about our current and prospective guests, continuing to identify opportunities to best meet her beauty needs; further driving digital discovery and e-commerce; continuing to provide great value while reducing reliance on price promotion and, finally, exploring new ways to continue to create excitement for our guests. 
 Now with that as a backdrop, I'd like to share with you my key priorities for my first 100 days at Ulta Beauty. First and foremost, I plan to work with the team to deliver the 2013 financial performance that we've planned. Another top priority is supporting our store growth plans. At the same time, I'll be focused on addressing business needs in the area of supply chain and our digital omni-channel approach. 
 I'll also be assessing the organization's talent, capabilities and culture needs as we continue to aggressively grow the business. I'll also spend time getting to know key vendor partners, and of course, analysts and investors. 
 I'm highly energized about the opportunity ahead of us and about how much runway the Ulta brand has. So now I'd like to ask our SVP of Merchandising, Janet Taake; and our SVP of Marketing, Jeff Severts, to talk about the progress that they and their teams have made with the key elements of our growth strategy. And then our CFO, Scott Settersten, will wrap up with an update on our real estate strategy and a detailed review of the numbers. 
 So let's start with Janet to update you on brands, products and services. 
Janet Taake: Thanks, Mary. The merchandising team has a lure of steady stream of compelling new products and brands for our guests in the first half of the year and are even more excited about the newness we're launching in the back half. Ulta gained share in all categories during the quarter. Our strength on the top line was again driven by prestige cosmetics and skincare. 
 To recap the highlights of the second quarter, we launched Sarah McNamara skincare, Ulta men's skincare and Mally Beauty cosmetics developed by a celebrity makeup artist, Mally Roncal. Many of our premium brands launched new products, including Stay Flawless 15-hour Primer from Benefit, Limited Edition spring colors from Clarisonic, Diamond Oil from Redken and Moxie Lipstick from bareMinerals.
 Benefit has quite a few new product launches this year and we're also making good progress on the services front. We have about 360 Benefit Brow Bars in Ulta stores as of the end of Q2 and plan to have more than 400 by year end, making Ulta the largest Benefit Brow provider in America. We continue to roll out brow tinting in the Benefit Brow Bars and expect to have 100 stores offering this additional service by the end of 2013. 
 To update you on Clinique and Lancôme, we ended the second quarter with 90 Clinique boutiques and expect to have 100 boutiques by year end. We added another 5 Lancôme boutiques during the quarter, with 20 more planned for this fall, for a total of 105 Lancôme boutiques by year end. Both Ulta and our prestige brand partners are very pleased with the results of these boutiques, and our guests are delighted to find these brands in our store. 
 Looking ahead to the third quarter, we have a tremendous amount of newness in the assortments. A few highlights of the new products we're excited about are Urban Decay's ultra long-wear pencils and lipsticks, Smashbox Liquid Halo Foundation, Tarte's Amazonian Clay Foundation, The New Black Innovations in Color Nail Kits and the Infiniti Pro Curl Secret from Conair.
 We continue to work with our vendor partners to offer our guests items sold exclusively at Ulta, including Stila's Dancing with the Stars collection, Butter London's color cosmetic collection and Living Proof's Perfect Hair Day 5-in-1 Styling Treatment. 
 We are launching several new brands this quarter that have a strong following and unique brand personalities, including IT Cosmetics, Jamie Kern Lima's award-winning line of color cosmetics infused with anti-aging technology and Meaningful Beauty's skincare system, Cindy Crawford's brand developed in partnership with Dr. Sebagh, a renowned anti-aging expert. 
 On the [indiscernible] side, we just introduced Jane Cosmetics, a brand that was very popular and trendy in the 90s, and was recently completely revamped and relaunched. Jane Cosmetics products are available online and in 500 Ulta stores today, with further expansion planned for October. 
 We continue to enhance our merchandise assortment on ulta.com, including launching new brands and products a couple of weeks in advance of their in-store launch. Grooming has seen a strong trend online with products like Tria, a laser hair removal device, and other personal care appliances becoming strong sellers on ulta.com. 
 Turning to salon, our services business continued to see strong momentum in Q2, driven by a good balance of higher customer traffic and higher tickets. Our efforts to improve retention of stylists and grow our team of more experienced stylists are translating into higher sales in the salon business. 
 Coming up in the third quarter, we are launching a new collection of trend right hair color looks for fall and have rolled out chain-wide training in new color techniques. We are also beginning to use our CRM platform for targeted offers to increase salon trial among our rewards customers. We expect our salon business to continue to deliver growth as we improve execution and retention and test and roll out new service offerings like lash extensions. 
 In summary, we're building momentum by adding new products, brands and services to our overall offering to continue to fuel strong growth and market share gains and enhance our positioning as a beauty destination. Now I'll turn it over to Jeff Severts, SVP of Marketing. 
Jeffrey Severts: Thank you, Janet. I'm going to start by highlighting our key promotional activities during the second quarter. I will then update you on our loyalty program and CRM platform, and then finally wrap up with an update of our e-commerce business. 
 The largest marketing promotion of the second quarter was our signature Love Your Hair event. This year, we expanded it to a 3-week duration and executed a fully integrated marketing campaign, with a strong focus on digital tactics. The campaign generated millions of impressions and thousands of sweepstakes entries while driving traffic to the stores. 
 At the end of the quarter, in late July, we launched our first digital brand-building campaign called Beauty LOLs. As we've discussed in prior calls, we have a big opportunity to grow Ulta through increased brand awareness. With Beauty LOLs, we are using digital and social media tactics to invite women across America to submit their own stories about the humorous beauty mishaps they've experienced. To date, we've received thousands of submissions in the form of stories, pictures and videos, and we directly or indirectly reached a significant number of potential new customers. 
 While we're working to bring new customers into the top of our marketing funnel with campaigns like Beauty LOLs, we continue to drive today's performance with our bottom-of-the-funnel initiatives. Our loyalty program member count has now passed 12 million, an increase of about 19% year-over-year. Member sales continue to grow as a percentage of the total, and our retention rate continues to improve. 
 Consistent with last quarter's announcement, we expect to convert the remaining 50% of the country still on our legacy certificate program to ULTAmate Rewards, our newer points-based program in Q1 of 2014. This conversion will allow us to more effectively communicate the benefits of being a loyalty program member at Ulta. We will also be able to better leverage our CRM platform, because we will now have a universal currency for driving customer behavior. 
 With our CRM platform and our more robust customer analytics team, we have significantly improved our abilities to segment our customer file. As a result, our communications now feature content that is much more relevant to the target audience. 
 We have been moving promotional emails from one-size-fits-all to a modular, more personalized approach, helping us drive increased sales and margin. We executed 27 CRM campaigns during the second quarter and continue to experiment with different promotional offers. Overall, sales driven by email are up dramatically, while the total number of emails we're sending is down. 
 Now turning to e-commerce, top line growth in Q2 was 72% with nice improvement in the margin rate. Growth was once again driven by prestige cosmetics and skincare categories. We have brought new brands into our online assortment like Perricone and Mally, and we have enjoyed continued success with our limited-time-offers we've trademarked as Beauty Breaks!. 
 Our website redesign project is on track for delivery in Q3, and we'll carefully convert customers to the new site with a phased approach to implementation. We recently began fulfilling e-commerce orders from a second distribution center and are currently staffing up to scale that capability in time for the holiday season. 
 Looking forward, I would note that this quarter, we are starting to anniversary the work we did to stabilize the site last year. So we expect our top line growth to moderate somewhat as we stop lapping some easier comparisons. We also expect some conversion disruption as customers adapt to the new website. These 2 effects will make it challenging to match the e-commerce growth rate we experienced in the first 2 quarters. 
 We are making strong progress against all our marketing priorities. We are broadening our reach through digital tactics, we are strengthening our loyalty efforts by converting to 1 program, and we are improving our CRM capabilities through experimentation and analytics. In e-commerce, we are driving today's business while building capabilities to support a high-growth future. With that, I'll now hand it over to Scott. 
Scott Settersten: Thanks, Jeff. Good afternoon, everyone. I'll recap our real estate program and review our financials. Our growth and development team continues to execute the plan very well, identifying high-quality sites and opening new stores on time and on budget. 
 In Q2, we opened 33 new stores, ending the quarter with 609 stores in 46 states, representing 25% square footage growth. New store productivity remains strong, driven by the quality of our new locations, increasing brand awareness, a more compelling assortment of products and services and great execution of our grand openings and marketing programs, to get our stores off to a strong start. 
 For the back half of the year, we're on track to execute the balance of our 125-store plan. We expect to open 53 stores in Q3 and 13 stores in the fourth quarter this year. We're also on track to complete the 7 remodels in our plan and expect to end the year with just 38 stores in older formats. 
 Looking ahead to next year, we have already approved 90 sites for our 2014 program. While we have not yet settled on a firm number of openings for next year, we expect to have more remodels in our plan than we did this year when much of our focus was on new stores. 
 This year's 125-store program is at the upper end of the range of what we feel that we can comfortably execute from a store staffing and operational execution perspective. And as a result, on a base of 675 stores by year end, we'd expect the absolute square footage growth next year to be more aligned with our long-term guidance of 15% to 20%. 
 Now turning to a detailed discussion of our financials. Second quarter sales were $601 million, an increase of 24.8% compared to sales of $481.7 million achieved in Q2 of 2012. Our 8.4% comp was stronger than expected and reflects 130 basis points of benefit from our e-commerce business, as well as a benefit from our salon business, which comped better than the product side of the house again this quarter. 
 The retail comp of 7.1% compares to 9.3% in Q2 of 2012. Last year's retail and e-commerce combined comp was 9.7%. Our comp was primarily driven by an increase in average ticket. The composition of our same-store sales increase was roughly 80% ticket and 20% transactions during the quarter. 
 A higher average ticket reflects less discounting as we successfully implemented strategies to be more targeted with our promotions. It also demonstrates strong growth in our salon and e-commerce businesses where the average ticket is higher, as well as the continued mix shift in our stores and online to our higher-ticket items, such as prestige cosmetics and skincare products, which continued drive the fastest growth in our assortment. 
 Gross profit margin increased 50 basis points to 35.3% from 34.8% in Q2 of last year. Gross profit leverage came in better than we expected due to higher-than-expected sales growth, which helped us achieve stronger fixed cost leverage than planned. Gross profit improvement was evenly split between merchandise margin due to mix and discipline promotions and rent and occupancy leverage on higher sales despite the large proportion of young stores in the portfolio. 
 SG&A expense as a percentage of sales increased 40 basis points to 22.4% compared to 22% in the second quarter of last year, driven by the expansion of prestige brand boutiques and investments in store labor to support the growth in our prestige categories. 
 Deleverage was less than we expected due to higher-than-expected sales and the timing of some of the investments planned for this year, with some shifting out of Q2 and into Q3. 
 Preopening expense for the quarter was $4.8 million compared to $4.1 million in Q2 of 2012 due to adding 33 new stores compared to adding 22 new stores last year. Operating margin rate increased 20 basis points to 12.1% compared to 11.9% a year ago, with operating income up 26.8% to $72.9 million. 
 The tax rate was 38.4% compared to 39% in Q2 of 2012. The decrease is primarily due to changes in our state tax liabilities. Net income per diluted share rose 29.6% to $0.70 compared to $0.54 last year. 
 Turning now to the balance sheet, starting with inventory. Inventories at the end of the second quarter were $461.2 million compared to $316.7 million at the end of Q2 of 2012. Total inventories increased 45.6%, and average inventory per store increased 16.9% compared to the prior year. Growth in total inventory was driven primarily by the addition of 120 net new stores opened in the past year. 
 Inventory per door increases versus last year are being driven in part by the addition of roughly 150 prestige brand boutiques since the end of 2Q last year. Each boutique represents an incremental inventory investment of approximately $75,000. It also includes the $20 million permanent investment in basic, high-turning inventory items we made in the fourth quarter of 2012 to improve store and stock levels, as well as the continued introduction of new brands as we enhance our product offering across the store, and to a lesser extent but still impactful, the timing of receipts to support over 50 new store openings, as well as bringing additional e-commerce fulfillment capacity online in our Northeast D.C. in Q3. 
 While difficult to measure, we believe that these inventory investments are translating into a better guest experience and contributing to our strong sales growth. Our inventory is healthy with very low obsolescence risk. As we mentioned in our last call in June, we expect that inventory per door growth will be in line with comp growth by the end of the year. 
 Capital expenditures were $56 million for the quarter, driven by our new store program, the addition of prestige boutiques and systems and supply chain investments. Depreciation and amortization were $26 million for the quarter. 
 Now turning to our outlook for the rest of the year. We are maintaining our previous earnings guidance for 2013. We expect to deliver comparable store sales growth in a range of 5% to 7% for the year, including e-commerce. We expect to grow square footage approximately 22% and we expect to achieve earnings per share growth at the low end of our long-term range of 25% to 30% growth, adjusted for the 53rd week in 2012. We expect to spend about $225 million in CapEx, including approximately $125 million for new stores and $100 million for merchandise fixtures, remodels and other systems and e-commerce capital needs. Depreciation and amortization are expected to be approximately $105 million. We expect to generate strong free cash flow for the year and we'll continue to evaluate with our board the best use of any excess cash. 
 Turning now to third quarter guidance. We expect to achieve sales in the range of $613 million to $623 million versus $505.6 million in Q3 of 2012. We expect comparable store sales to increase in the range of 5% to 7%, including the benefit from e-commerce sales. We plan to open 53 new stores versus 49 last year. We expect to achieve earnings per share in the range of $0.71 to $0.74 versus $0.59 in Q3 of 2012. 
 Gross profit margin is expected to increase 100 basis points at the midpoint of the range. We expect healthy product margin expansion and modest supply chain leverage, offset by some deleverage of fixed store cost, driven by our accelerated store growth. 
 SG&A rate is expected to increase 95 basis points versus last year's 23.3% rate, driven by investments in store labor to improve the guest experience, in supply chain as we develop our blueprint for the future and in e-commerce as we accelerate growth in that business and prepare to deliver a better guest experience. 
 Some of the upside we saw in Q2 was due to timing of investment spend shifting from Q2 into Q3. Operating margin is expected to increase approximately 10 basis points at the midpoint of the range to 12.2%. The tax rate is expected to be approximately 38.2%, and we anticipate a fully diluted share count of approximately 64.5 million shares. 
 This outlook represents robust sales and earnings growth while balancing the need to make prudent investments to ensure the long-term health and sustainability of our business. With that, operator, please open up the call for questions. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Gary Balter with Credit Suisse. 
Gary Balter: First of all, Mary, welcome to the company and it's -- looking forward to meeting you. You talked -- I was going to ask you about what you found in your first few months, but you did a really good job of walking us through that. But one of the comments you talked about opportunities in supply chain and omni-channel. Could you go into a bit more detail about what the opportunities are or what you see as kind of the weaknesses now and what are you going to them [ph]? 
Mary Dillon: Sure, absolutely. I'll start with omni-channel and then, Scott, maybe you can jump in on supply chain. We'll do that second. I would just say, obviously, omni-channel is something that's important to everybody in retail right now and for -- I think the way would look at it, it's about being where the guest wants to learn, wants to explore and of course, where they want to shop. It's about making it easy for the customer, as well as really being in the conversation. In social media, they're discovering brands. So I know the omni-channel through many different lenses. And I would say that, for us, we will always have what I would say is our very unique asset, which is our store base, which has the combination of product and service, and it's a great part of our model. But also being everywhere else our guest wants to shop is important as well. I'd say the investments that we're making this year, and Jeff talked about some of these in his section, are a great step forward as it relates to e-commerce. So being easier to shop in terms of web, tablet and mobile. We're pleased with what that is going to do for our business and our guest experience as well. We also have several other projects in flight from a systems perspective to help to continue to enhance the guest experience. So whether it's selling capabilities in-store, it were [ph] discovery, as well as associate selling tools. So all of those are either in process or I think we've made good progress on already. And lastly, I would just add that certainly as we think about our longer-term supply chain solution, we're thinking through the evolving guest expectations and how we economically meet those. 
Scott Settersten: And I'll pick up on the supply chain. Again, we're in the midst really of a significant project of designing what the future state supply chain looks like for Ulta. I think our honest assessment is we're probably a little bit behind as far as supply chain processes and best-in-class things are concerned. We've slowed down the project here just a little bit in recent months and that's what you'll see some of the flip in expense going from Q2 to Q3, that's really one of the primary drivers. As you know, Gary, these are big decisions with far-ranging financial and operational impacts on a business over a long period of time. And so we're carefully looking at what we can do to expand current capacity and also taking into consideration what we think guest expectations are going to be in the future. So we're still a little away from the finish line, but as we -- those particulars are finalized, we'll be sharing more details with you. 
Gary Balter: That's great. Just one follow-up and I'll get off. But you have Clinique and Lancôme in less than 100 stores, I would say 90, approximately of the 609 that you have. Is there a material difference in the results you get from those stores versus the other ones, driven by having these 2 brands in there? 
Scott Settersten: We'll have -- actually by the end of this year, there'll be roughly 200 between both brands, so roughly 100 of each. And we do see that those brands, there's a halo effect on each of the stores that we place those brands in service and it drives customer traffic to the stores. We've seen that demonstrated. 
Gary Balter: Could you quantify that or you won't? 
Scott Settersten: No, we won't be able to break that out for you, Gary. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Ike Boruchow with Sterne Agee. 
Irwin Boruchow: So I guess I'll focus on the top line right now. There's clearly a lot of volatility in the retail space today month-to-month. Is there any way you guys could provide any color of the cadence of how the quarter played out maybe what you've been seeing quarter-to-date from your customers? And then if there's any changes that you're seeing between traffic and ticket? 
Scott Settersten: You know, Ike, we see the same stories in the financial press and in the general press at large, the same kind of things that you guys see on a day-to-day basis. It seems like there's a divergence in customer reaction and shopping behaviors, and it depends what kind of retail category you're in. We're not going to be able to comment really about what the cadence was within a quarter or what the current kind of business environment is for us. But the guidance that we provided includes our best observations of what current business trends are and all the macroeconomic kind of impacts that we look at as we get ready to discuss that with our board and come up with our final guidance for the quarter. 
Mary Dillon: And Scott, let me just add one piece, which is one of the things that I think is great about our business model, is that we have a pretty diverse customer base. And I think through our merchant marketing and CRM strategies the ability to walk across those different customer bases. So we have some folks that are more value-oriented, some people who are about discovering newness and less concerned about value. So I think that sets us up well, really, in any economic environment. 
Irwin Boruchow: Okay, great. Then Scott, just a quick follow-up on inventory. I think you did a helpful job explaining away some of the growth that you have at the end of the quarter. Can you maybe help us think about how inventories plan to end the year? And then just kind of how you plan -- how you see the business kind of normalizing as we get into next year from a growth rate or inventory per square foot basis? 
Scott Settersten: What I tried to do in the prepared remarks is just try to remind everybody of the significant changes in the business over the course of the last year. So we've added a lot of prestige boutiques, which are -- represent significant inventory investments. The new brands that Janet and her team have been able to bring aboard here again are skewing more towards the prestige side of the store. They are higher-priced points kind of items, they're in high demand. So we're making investments to try to stay ahead of the demand curve and try to service our customers as best we can. We would see that continuing in the future. That's part of our strategy. By year end, we would expect again year-over-year comparisons that the comp -- that the inventory growth will be in line with the comp growth for the full year. And we would expect that to be the trend as we look out to the future. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Daniel Hofkin with William Blair & Company. 
Daniel Hofkin: Just wanted to follow up a little bit on traffic. If I heard correctly, I think you said within the product business, that 7.1 comp was about 80% average ticket. Was that correct? 
Scott Settersten: That's correct. 
Daniel Hofkin: So if the traffic was in that, let's say, 1% to 2% range, I guess can you discuss a little bit what some of the factors maybe that caused that to ebb and flow a little bit. I think in the first quarter, as I recall, it was more of an even split between the 2. That's my first question. 
Scott Settersten: Yes. We've seen the composition of the comp transition over the last 3 or 4 quarters from being one that was basically driven by transaction growth to now more recently being more of an average ticket growth kind of situation. Part of that, we would attribute to kind of the macro environment. So you've seen other retailers talk about traffic being down in centers across the U.S. I mean, you've seen that reflected in a lot of the comp numbers that have been announced during the last 4, 6 weeks. We see that in our business, we're not immune to that. I mean, we're in the centers, right up next door to all those other high-quality, big-box retailers. So we have seen nonmember traffic down year-over-year. The good news for Ulta is we've got a great loyalty program. We've seen that be very effectively implemented. We see our loyalty program members actually shopping more often with us. And we -- to top that off, we've got nonmembers and members actually buying higher-ticket items and driving their basket higher. So that's really worked in our benefit here in Q2. 
Daniel Hofkin: Okay. So it sounds like you would attribute most, if not all of it, to sort of just the overall backdrop as opposed to kind of changes within your specific business? 
Scott Settersten: That's correct. 
Daniel Hofkin: Okay. And then as it relates to, I think just following up on Gary's question on brand penetration, is there -- can you talk about kind of what you're thinking, at this point obviously, not putting hard numbers on it, but do you foresee a situation where the 2 kind of -- Lancôme and Clinique could be in a significantly larger percentage of the store base over time? Is there a subset of the stores where it wouldn't make sense for any number of reasons? I'd just be interested in your thoughts on that. 
Janet Taake: This is Janet, and thanks for the question. We are just opening up more boutiques this year. So with the 100 in Clinique and 105 in Lancôme. We're very pleased with the partnership we have with the brands, and we're hopeful that we'll add more boutiques in the future. But at this point, I don't have a definitive answer for that. 
Daniel Hofkin: Okay. And then I guess if I could sneak in one last one as it relates to store growth. And obviously, I think last quarter, you had said you've had about 50 in place and now, 90 for next year. Is that -- is my memory correct on that? 
Scott Settersten: Yes, that's rough -- that's correct, Dan. You're on target there. We... 
Daniel Hofkin: Okay. Do you think from the standpoint of your longer term, your most recent longer-term target of 1,200 stores, how are you thinking about that itself and your thoughts also on the smaller format opportunity? 
Scott Settersten: Well, the 1,200 stores, I think as we've discussed consistently in the past, is a realistic target that we're all here focused on. So that's 1,200 of the 10,000 square foot boxes that we do so well today. I think we've also talked a bit about the 125-store number kind in absolute terms, that's kind of a mix of new stores and remodels. It's kind of at the upper end of the range where we feel like we can execute that at a very high level. So again, as you look out to next year and beyond, that's kind of the absolute number that would fit into your model as you're looking at percentage growth kind of estimates. The small store opportunity is one that the team here is focused on internally. Again, we've got a couple of small stores sprinkled throughout the chain right now. But the team is focused on really delivering the Ulta experience in a smaller store format, whether that be in an urban kind of setting or more of small town rural kind of setting. So that's something that we're focused on currently and we'll probably have a couple of test stores to roll out next year. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Evren Kopelman with Wells Fargo. 
Evren Kopelman: Mary, I wanted to ask you, what is your impression of Ulta's brand awareness, given the kind of the size of the business and the store chain and your thoughts on potential improvements there? And then secondly, your view about the marketing spend, both kind of the dollars that are being spent, do you think -- is that appropriate and also the content of it, the different areas of spend? 
Mary Dillon: Sure, okay. Well, thank you, Evren, for your questions. I'd say a couple of things. One is that I think that our current brand awareness is a great opportunity actually for Ulta because it's not very high. In some ways [ph], I mean, if we're doing great, it means that we're in a great industry that's growing, we've got a very successful business model that's working really well and I think this team has really built, as you can see, a very successful business, and we're focused on the right strategies. That said, I think we do have the potential to really drive even more growth in the future as we think about the fact that there's millions of prospective customers who really haven't discovered Ulta yet. And so we'll figure out carefully over time how to get there. But I think driving more top-of-mind awareness and more customers to Ulta and driving more emotional connection are all opportunities for us. Women, we know, love to discover new beauty products and services and especially in a really helpful setting with great value and certainly, that's very much what we have to offer. So as I look at our current strategies, I'm really pleased to see that we're experimenting and evolving. I don't think anybody would ever swing a pendulum dramatically on a business without some risks. So instead, I think what we're doing is right, which is we're testing and learning. Jeff and his team are -- the CRM improvements are, in terms of our ability to target and segment and vary our offers, are very interesting to me. Our e-commerce business is growing strongly, as you've seen, which is terrific as well. But certainly, we see that there's opportunities to continue to think about how do we shift the mix over time and drive more awareness driving tactics, which drives you to the business. So we'll continue to evolve that. 
Evren Kopelman: And then secondly, Scott, I wanted to ask you about e-commerce profitability. Where are we today and where can that get to? And if -- what kind of time line, if you could talk about that, relative to maybe the corporate average or the store side? 
Scott Settersten: Evren, I would say e-commerce, I think it's probably generally common knowledge that e-commerce businesses generally do not contribute at the same rate as an installed bricks-and-mortars base of business, the environment that we operate here at Ulta. So it contributes at a lower rate currently, but it is scaling up quite nicely. And as we continue to scale that businesses up, we expect that to significantly improve over time. So that's part of our long-range plan. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Neely Tamminga with Piper Jaffray. 
Neely Tamminga: Just a couple of questions here, if I may. Jeff, for you, what size and scale do you think Clinique needs to be, if you're not already doing it already in terms of targeting either versions on the print circulars or the targeted e-marketing. I'm just wondering how much of the Clinique success that you guys have had just because of some bolt-on sort of traffic versus how much you guys have actually been alerting area shoppers as to whether or not Clinique is actually in your store. Could you talk a little bit about that and then I have a follow-up. 
Jeffrey Severts: Sure, Neely. We actually do both already. So we version the mailers for Clinique and Lancôme already for the geographies where there's enough density of stores in those areas or actually, where customers live within a short enough distance of one of the boutiques. And then email, of course, gives us even more options for being very precise in our targeting to her and letting her know what the benefits of those boutiques are for her. So we do both already. 
Neely Tamminga: Okay, that's awesome. And then, Mary, a question for you. As you think about the digital strategy for Ulta, I think at one point, we were counting up actually the SKUs online versus what is actually carried in the store and there was -- if memory serves, was a pretty big delta between the 2 there. Is that one of the key gating factors kind of expanding some of this digital strategy, getting the customer-facing side, the website re-platforming done, et cetera, but then also just getting the SKUs kind of available online? Is there something precluding the company from being able to kind of scale up on that? 
Mary Dillon: Yes, I'll make a comment and then I'll ask somebody else in the team to add to that. I would say that it's both. I mean, first and foremost, I'm really excited about the redesign that we'll be launching and, I mean, it really will improve the overall guest experience and shopability and discoverability on the site. So that's a good starting point. In terms of having more products online, of course, we're always going to look to expand that. So I'll ask you guys to -- Jeff, you want to take [indiscernible] . 
Jeffrey Severts: Yes, I won't add much to that. I mean, we have a pretty high penetration of what you can find in the stores already online. They're just a couple of categories where we're not where we'd like to be, and pro hair is probably the biggest. And Janet's team is always working very hard to get us up where we are on the stores online. So we're making great progress there. 
Neely Tamminga: Great. And just a follow-up here for Janet then. Janet, it's great to see IT Cosmetics come into the store. I think it's a great brand and completely spot on with your customers. I was just thinking about it, though, is this kind of the first brand you've had maybe in a while or ever where the distribution was initially digital? And is this the first retail introduction? I'm just trying to get a sense of -- sizing up kind of what that opportunity might be for IT Cosmetics for you guys. 
Janet Taake: Sure. Neely, it's not the first time, but it's been many, many years. I think I would go back in history on there because it was on DirecTV prior to really launching with us, but it's been a long time. So to have a brand that's direct and then coming in brick-and-mortar, it's been a new experience since I've been here and I can't really speak to -- too much about it because we are just in the midst of launching IT Cosmetics, but we're very thrilled with the partnership, and we have great expectations of what the brand will do, most importantly for our guests and the experience in the store with our guests. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Oliver Chen with Citigroup. 
Oliver Chen: Regarding the performance of the salons comping better this quarter, what was the rationale there? And is that an opportunity in the back half? Also, related to your merchandise margin guidance in 100 basis points on the gross margin, what's the driver behind your view of better merchandise margins this third quarter? 
Janet Taake: On the salon side of the business, it was average ticket, as I mentioned, drove increase. But a lot of it is going back to the retention of the stylist. And with the retention of the stylist increasing, goes back to the loyal guests coming back to that stylist. The heart and soul of the salon is truly the cut and color, which drives the majority of the business. So all of those things have been working and we foresee that the salon will continue to be a solid business. 
Scott Settersten: Oliver, as far as gross profit improvement in the third quarter being driven in large part by improvements in merchandise margin. It's really kind of a continuation of the discussion we started earlier this year. It's a combination of factors. It's the business continuing to mix up more towards the prestige side of the box, which again is higher price points and less promotion and less discounting going on there. And also on our side, being more disciplined and smarter around the promotional kind of environment. So again, whether it's the CRM tool, we can be more targeted with our promotions to customers or the analytics team that supports all that, which is helping us get smarter on how we do those kinds of things. So that those are really the primary drivers. 
Oliver Chen: And Mary, as you engage in the journey to make the brand potentially more emotional, how should we think about the financial impact there and the timing? And what do you foresee how that will impact the business or the brand portfolio or traffic? 
Mary Dillon: I like that question, how to quantify emotion. I'm going to figure that one out. I think it's a journey. It's really just about continuing to refine how we think about positioning Ulta and making sure that all of our communications add up and the guest experience adds up to an ideal guest experience. I don't think we have a problem there. I think we have an opportunity to continue to have folks just discover us and hence, have a deeper relationship, rely on us as, really, their beauty expert. So that will play out in many different ways I think, but it won't be something that happens overnight. It's something you have to earn over time. And as I mentioned earlier, I would just say it's the totality of everything we do. We're not going to swing a pendulum and all of a sudden, start doing things really differently in terms of stopping all of our promotions and doing only advertising or something. You really have to work your way to that to really find the balance in the mix. And again, I think the team has done a nice job already of -- with the loyalty program that's really working well, with CRM analytics that are helping us refine this. So I would think about it is as a journey over time that I think just is an opportunity for us. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Brian Tunick with JPMorgan Chase. 
Brian Tunick: I guess one question for Scott and then one for Mary maybe. So on Scott, on the $0.13 of incremental investments this year, can you maybe talk about some of the pieces that could continue into next year? Or are there potentially new initiatives as you continue to move towards that 1,200 store opportunity? So just curious of the $0.13, maybe what are some things that we should expect? And maybe Mary, if you look ahead to the planning around holiday this year, just curious as you reflect on and you look at the results of holiday last year and you see the current tough traffic environment out there, what gives you the comfort to guide essentially a 5% to 7% comp for the holiday, and if there are any tweaks to the plans that you're making now? 
Scott Settersten: I guess I'll go first. I'll take the investments. Again, the $0.13 were split roughly evenly between labor investment in the stores to support prestige growth, supply chain, e-commerce investments to drive growth there, and then of course, the new store program. So another one, Brian, on the new store program, I think -- we would think that's going to moderate a little bit again as you look at 2014. So the absolute number of stores is not going to grow beyond the 125. So on a percentage basis, that should help or moderate a little bit as we look forward. E-commerce, I would say again, we're going to continue to make investments there. It probably won't be at the same level, generally speaking, because we wouldn't expect to have a new website redesign next year. So we'll continue to invest in the team there and some of that analytical stuff we have to do. But infrastructure-wise, it shouldn't be as big a bite of the apple next year. Supply chain, I mentioned we slowed that project down just a little bit, so the expense is kind of flowing towards the back half of 2013. We would expect to have a final determination here sometime in the fourth quarter on what the plan is going to be. So that will go -- that will transition from being kind of an expense item to more of a capital item as we transition into 2014. Again, we'll be able to size that up for you a little bit more once we have our final answer there. Store labor, again, we deleveraged that store labor this year significantly, either try to improve the guest experience in the store and to support the prestige side of the business, which continues to grow at a very high rate. With Mary entering the business here and us kind of taking a fresh look at the strategy and how Ulta is going to evolve here over time, I think that one might be a little bit more TBD'd as I look into 2014. Again, I wouldn't expect it to be a significant change from where we are '13 versus '12, but there could be some investments that we look at there. It just depends. 
Mary Dillon: And then on holiday, I'll just make a couple of comments and I'll ask Janet to add to this. But certainly, we're very focused on our holiday readiness. I feel very confident. I know that across the merchant teams, the store operations teams, marketing, supply chain, that everybody is really focused on making sure that we have strong holiday season. And I have confidence that the team has put together a really good plan. So would you like to add some color to that? 
Janet Taake: Sure. And we are very focused on gift-giving categories across all areas of the store. And we feel that we have both value as well as some exclusive items, as well as some of the things that we do traditionally every year that other people may not do to really incent some of the categories for holiday, but we feel very good about our holiday assortment coming in this year. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Fassler with Goldman Sachs. 
Matthew Fassler: I want to focus for a moment on a couple of other angles on the online business. First of all, you spoke about online being a factor in driving traffic. If you could just speak about the composition of the typical online transaction and what about it drives the ticket higher? And then also if you could tell us within online what you've seen essentially in terms of traffic conversion at ticket? 
Jeffrey Severts: So Matt, this is Jeff. I may have to have you repeat the second question or catch it from somebody here. I'm not sure I got that. But on the first question of how is that a factor in driving higher ticket, we have, as long as I've been here anyway, seen a higher ticket in the online channel than in the retail channel. So as that becomes a stronger portion of the total mix, it's just carrying the average for the enterprise up. Does that answer your question or did I miss that? 
Matthew Fassler: No, that's good. And the second one, I guess the question was to the extent that in aggregate, your comp growth shifted from being traffic-driven to ticket-driven, if you think about what -- if you think about the big surge that you've seen in online, is that more a function of online transaction growth or online ticket growth within the online channel? 
Jeffrey Severts: I see. So within the online channel, the mix has been heavily traffic versus ticket so that's been predominantly traffic-driven. 
Matthew Fassler: And a follow-up, if I could. You spoke about tougher compares in online for the -- as you cycle the second half of last year, when it sounds like you started to make real headway. I believe you only started giving us online contribution with this level of specificity in the first quarter of 2013. So any sense you could give us as to how the momentum of your online business changed or evolved as you moved through 2012? 
Scott Settersten: I would be able to tell you, Matt, if you looked, I think we provide some of these details in our Q as well, which got filed today. So year-to-date last year, I think it contributed 40 basis points of comp and this year, it's at 130 to 140 basis points of comp. So that's kind of the relative spread year-over-year. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Joe Altobello with Oppenheimer. 
Unknown Analyst: This is Christina [ph] in for Joe. Most of my questions have been answered at this point, but I just wanted to follow up on, it sounds like you're saying that your customers aren't as focused on value as they were maybe in the last few quarters. And I was wondering if you could talk about that a little bit more and if you're continuing to see that in this quarter? 
Scott Settersten: Yes, we talked a little bit about in the first quarter call. We started seeing this trend continue as we exited the holiday period and kind of got through some of the rough seas we saw early in the first quarter, that we saw this divergence in our customer profile, much like the rest of America has seen it. There's a certain portion of our customers, our core customers, that are pursuing value and that are very focused on whatever coupon or promotional event that we're running at the time. And then there's a good portion of our customers that the sense is that price is really no object. They're pursuing whatever the hottest new gadget is or the hope in the bottle or hope in the technology or whatever it might be. So the good news for us is we serve a wide continuum of customers and a lot of different products available in our stores. So that plays to our strength. 
Unknown Analyst: Great. And then just one last one about gross margin, what your expectations are for the full year? 
Scott Settersten: We would expect -- I think when we talked about quarter-to-quarter, we would expect to see the continuation of improvement in our merchandise margin as we get deeper into the year. That will be the major driver in third quarter. Again, if you look at it historically, that moderates somewhat as you get into the fourth quarter because of the promotional environment and the competitive environment in the fourth quarter. So that would be the driver for the rest of the year by and large. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of David Wu with Telsey Advisory Group. 
David Wu: First, you mentioned that the major comp driver was the higher ticket, and I was wondering, how much of the ticket increase was driven by less promotions on the mass products versus the mix shift toward prestige? And do you expect ticket to remain the main driver of the comp through the back half of the year? 
Scott Settersten: Well, that's what we're seeing as the most recent kind of reality in the marketplace in our stores. So we would expect the trend to continue absent any other significant change in the macro environment. The ticket, when we talk about the ticket, most of it was average selling price. That was the majority of the ticket increase. So units were up slightly. So again, it's subject to assessment and analysis on our side. But we tend to think that our customers are making choices too, just like people are choosing autos and homes and home improvement versus other discretionary kinds of things. When they get into our stores, they're choosing a higher price point prestige kind of product and offsetting that with not buying another category. So that's what we're seeing as kind of the current business trend right now. We really don't foresee any significant changes there in the near term. 
David Wu: Great. And you mentioned already approving the 90 sites for next year, and I was wondering, how much of it will be in new markets versus backfilling existing ones? 
Scott Settersten: Well, we always take a very balanced view towards our real estate strategy, so that's been our profile since day one here at Ulta, and so that we would expect that to continue. So it's always a balanced approach with single-store markets, major metro areas and backfilling markets as we look at our real estate. And we're always cognizant of the sales transfer or cannibalization impact on those stores and making sure that we're making really good decisions. 
David Wu: Great. And as you expand into some of the smaller markets, are you looking into opening smaller-format stores, so below sort of your average 10,000 square foot store sized in order to maximize your productivity? And as you continue to do that, do you think it could potentially change sort of the new store economics? 
Scott Settersten: As far as the economic model is concerned, that's a little far out right now. I guess we're not -- the thought process isn't that far down the path on that one. That would be something, again when you're talking smaller footprint, we're looking at different potential sizes so 5,000 square feet up to 7,500 square feet. And just trying to think about what worked best inside each one of those footprints. And of course, that would be different if we're doing that in an urban setting versus some kind of rural setting. So we do believe that small store is a good side opportunity for us in the long term, and it's something that we hope to see again in some limited test cases in 2014. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Jill Nelson with Johnson Rice. 
Jill Caruthers: Touching on the strength of the salons, you mentioned a trial you're going to run with customers to get them to the salon. I was wondering, is the bulk of your salon customers under the loyalty program now? I'd assume they're pretty loyal and good customer for you to have? 
Scott Settersten: Yes, our salon customers, service customers, are our best customers. They visit our stores more often than an average loyalty person does. So we recognize the value in those folks, and we're looking strategies and tactics to try to drive more engagement and try to get more people to try the salon at Ulta. So I think Janet mentioned that we're going to have a CRM initiative to try to touch our loyalty members and try to get them engaged and get them to experience the salon. And we figure, once we get them to try that, there's a good chance that they're going to continue with us. And that's a great add for us as far as value is concerned in the long term. 
Jill Caruthers: Okay. And then have you ever quantified of your total sales the percentage that is tied to your loyalty program? 
Scott Settersten: No. We've consistently said it's greater than 50% of our sales. And I think that's all we're going to share at this time. I just -- we're all kind of laughing and smiling here. It's something that we think in the future that we might want to provide a little bit more granularity and color on. So maybe stay tuned in 2014 for that. 
Jill Caruthers: All right. And then just one last question. Given you've talked about some shifting of the expenses, is there any way you can quantify of the $0.13 of investments you're making this year, how many -- how much of that $0.13 has already occurred in the first half, just asking, given you mentioned a shift from second to third quarter, some investments. 
Scott Settersten: Yes, Jill. Sorry, I don't really have that kind of detail handy with me. Generally speaking, the e-commerce stuff will be, by and large, behind us by the time we get to the end of September. Supply chain has kind of pushed back into the second half of the year. We thought that would be more evenly balanced quarter-to-quarter. The store labor, as well we did some experimentation with that and testing early in the year, and now that's really picking up steam in the back half of the year. So it's a little tough to give you any more quantitative answer than that. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Mark Altschwager with Robert W. Baird. 
Mark Altschwager: Just a follow-up on the store growth. Can you just talk about what learnings you've had as you've ramped to that 125 pace? And then moving forward as that pace slows, would you expect to see more operating leverage, given the system from a training perspective, is going to be less stressed? 
Scott Settersten: We consider the real estate program and what we do with processes around new store to really be a core strength of Ulta. I mean, the teams that we have, the experience that we have doing this and the way we've been able to accelerate that store growth plan over the last couple of years has really been outstanding. And the new stores again, congratulations to the team. The sites we've identified, those stores are producing excellent results, right on target with where we want to be and that's great for Ulta. As far as the future is concerned, we would expect again the 125 to kind of be the absolute top end so percentage-wise, yes, that's going to help on the leverage when you consider fixed store costs and what that -- impact that has on the P&L. So we would expect to see some benefit there next year. 
Mark Altschwager: Great. And then maybe to push for one more on the loyalty program. As the new loyalty program has built momentum, any metrics you can share with us just on the customer behavior on the coupons versus the new point system, timing of purchases, frequency, basket size? Any metrics you have kind of comparing the new program with the old? 
Jeffrey Severts: Mark, this is Jeff. We generally are pretty tight-lipped on details about the loyalty program. We view it as central to what we do and proprietary in many ways, so we probably can't reveal what you'd hope to hear today. 
Scott Settersten: We would say, though, that it's clear that those customers are more engaged than the folks that are in the certificate program, that they prefer that over the alternative and that we see those folks more often, they're more engaged with the program and it's going to be a big win for all of us when we move everyone onto that program next year. 
Operator: There are no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the floor back over to Mary Dillon for closing comments. 
Mary Dillon: Great. Thank you. Just to wrap up, I'd like to first thank our 19,000 Ulta Beauty associates, whose hard work delivered excellent results this quarter. In my short time as CEO, I've seen that our associates truly love what they do and they're currently passionate about Ulta and our guests. I've really developed great confidence in the team's ability to deliver another strong year of growth in sales and earnings, while making wise investments to set up the business for long-term performance. Thanks to all of you for your interest in Ulta Beauty and I look forward to meeting you in person in the coming months. 
Operator: Thank you. This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and thank you for your participation.

===== 2013 Q1  (2013-06-11 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Greetings and welcome to Ulta Beauty's First Quarter 2013 Earnings Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. 
 It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Laurel Lefebvre, Vice President, Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin. 
Laurel Lefebvre: Thank you for joining us for Ulta's first quarter 2013 conference call. Hosting our call are Dennis Eck, interim Chief Executive Officer; and Scott Settersten, Chief Financial Officer. Also joining us are Janet Taake, Senior Vice President, Merchandising; and Jeff Severts, Senior Vice President, Marketing.

 With that, I'll turn it -- the call over to Dennis. 
Dennis Eck: Thank you, Laurel. Good afternoon, everyone. We are pleased to announce a strong first quarter with better-than-expected sales and margin performance. The team is executing our 5-point strategy very well and our outlook for continued market share gains is excellent. 
 To update you on our CEO search, we are making good progress. We have been very happy with the high quality of candidates. As expected, there's a high level of interest in this opportunity. The Board of Directors is partnering with our search firm, Herbert Mines, where we are working through a comprehensive process to identify the best candidate. We hope to conclude our search in the near future. 
 With that, I would turn over to Scott. 
Scott Settersten: Thanks, Dennis. 2013 is off to a good start with solid first quarter results. To recap the Q1 headlines, we grew the top line 22.9%. Comparable store sales increased 6.7%, including the impact of our E-Commerce business, which had a very strong quarter with 70% top-line growth. This compared to a 10.1% retail only comp in Q1 of 2012. Operating income increased 17.8%, while operating margin declined 50 basis points to 11.6%. Earnings per share increased 20.4% to $0.65 per share. 
 I'll walk you through our financials in more detail in a moment but first, the team and I will update you on our progress with Ulta's 5-point multi-year growth strategy, which includes: one, accelerating store growth; two, introducing new products, brands and services; three, enhancing our loyalty program; four, broadening our marketing reach; and five, increasing our digital focus including e-commerce. I'll start with the real estate discussion. In the first quarter, we opened 26 net new stores and in Q1 with 576 doors in 46 states, representing 24% square footage growth. We added our first store in South Dakota in Sioux Falls in Q1. New store productivity continues to be very good, driven by a high-quality real estate, growing brand awareness, dedicated resources for our brand opening events and marketing programs to help stores get off to a great start. We recently updated our store model to reflect the most current data for sales, capital and inventory. New stores are starting out a bit stronger than they have historically at roughly $2.8 million per store in year 1. They still ramp up to $4 million on average in year 5 and then are expected to continue to comp modestly thereafter. We spend about $1 million per store in capital and receive landlord allowances of $600,000 per store on average. 
 Inventory, net of payables, has gone up slightly to about $500,000 per store. As a result of the increase in our mix of higher value Prestige products. Preopening expenses decreased as we've shortened the time it takes to get stores opened and gain some scale efficiencies. All in, the total new store investment is about $1 million. The payback period hasn't changed. It is still roughly 2 years. We continue to be very pleased with the performance of the portfolio and are already making good progress on next year's new store program with roughly 50 sites already approved. 
 Looking ahead to the rest of the year, we are on track to execute our 125 new store plan. We expect to open 29 stores in Q2, 54 stores in Q3 and 16 stores in fourth quarter of 2013. We're on track with our plan to remodel 7 stores and we'll end the year with less than 40 stores in older formats, well over 9% of the changes in our newest formats, which we refer to as level 6 or 7. 
 Now, I'll turn it over to Janet Taake, SVP of Merchandising to update you on new products, brands and services. 
Janet Taake: Thanks, Scott. Newness continues to be the primary driver of our comp sales growth. In terms of categories, Prestige Cosmetics and Skincare continue to grow at a rapid pace offset by softer performance in the more mature hair care tools category. To recap newness of note in the first quarter, we were pleased with the new brand launches of St. Tropez self bronzers, Lipstick Queen and the addition of Deborah Lippmann prestige nail lacquer in 200 stores. Perricone MD skin care line got off to a very strong start, we introduced HairMax, an FDA clear appliance for in-home treatment of hair loss for men and women, continuing to strengthen our offer in response to the trend and high-tech beauty tools in hair growth and hair-thickening solutions. 
 In terms of brand expansions, we completed our rollout of our exclusive brands CK One color cosmetics to the entire chain. We also launched some exciting new products within existing brands Urban Decay Oz, the great and powerful palettes; Clarisonic, limited-edition colors and Ultra CHI styling tools and new patterns. We introduced Living Proof good hair kits and Color Wow root cover-up, both exclusively available at Ulta. 
 For Mother's Day, to highlight the fragrance category including the new fragrances launched in Q1, we offered new and exclusive pastel totes as our gift with fragrance purchase. We also featured a customizable cosmetic bag with an Ulta brand product purchase. 
 On the services side, we continue to expand benefit brow waxing services now in almost 400 stores and after testing new brow tinting service in Q1 with strong results, we are now rolling it out to our Benefit Brow Bars. 
 To preview some of the newness in the current quarter, we're launching Sarah McNamara skincare this week. Sarah McNamara is a beauty industry veteran who developed her breakthrough product, Miracle Skin Transformer a few years ago and quickly developed a cult following. We are launching several brands of CC creams, or color corrector creams, in Q2 following on the heels of a hot trend BB creams, or beauty balm creams, that we've enjoyed over the past several quarters. We are also introducing a line of men's skin and body care products this quarter under the Ulta brand. 
 High-tech beauty continues to be a strong trend. Tria, a laser hair removal device, is an FDA-cleared device for home use. We had launched this new product in select stores and on ulta.com in the second quarter. NuBrilliance, a tool from microdermabrasion at home. NuFace and LightStim, new products skin rejuvenation and wrinkle treatments, were also launched this quarter. 
 Another trend is tools and products for healthier hair. We introduced Jose Eber and Rowenta professional quality hair care tool during the quarter. Jose is a celebrity hairstylist whose collection of high-quality appliances improves hair health with infrared light technology. On the product side, we introduced Redken's line of diamond oil haircare products designed to improve hair strength and shine. We also launched Ojon's rare-blend deep conditioners and a line of damage reverse conditioning products. 
 To update you on Clinique and Lancôme, we're very pleased with the performance of these boutiques and our partnership with these brands. We continue to expand our partnership with Clinique with 8 new boutiques added during the first quarter ending Q1 with 51 boutiques, and we plan to continue to add boutiques throughout the year. We're also delighted to announce that we will open another 25 Lancôme boutiques this fall, adding to the 80 boutiques we operate today. We ended last year with 79 Lancôme boutiques and we just opened an Urban Store on Walnut Street in Philadelphia, including a Lancôme boutique. By the end of this year, a significant percentage of the chain will have either a Clinique or Lancôme boutique. 
 Turning to salon services, our salons performed very well in the first quarter. Driving strong sales growth through effective promotions like our Cut, Color, Style package offer. Other contributors to our salon business' strong performance includes improved integration between the stores and salon teams, improved career development plans for our associates, leading to reduced turnover, as well as excellent technical training on hair color and new hair trends. 
 In terms of new services, we have now fully rolled out microdermabrasion skin services in all our stores, and we will begin to market this service this month. After testing hair extension services earlier in the year, we launched this new service, chain-wide during Love Your Hair promotion in May. We are now testing eyelash services by our skin therapists in select stores. With encouraging early results as a result of great execution and broadening our service offering, we've seen good growth in our guest count as well as improvements in average ticket and customer retention. In some, whether it's on the product or service side, we're very excited about the pipeline of newness this year and our ability to translate current trends and a curated assortment that is compelling to our guests. 
 Now, I'll turn it over to Jeff Severts, SVP of Marketing, to cover enhancing our loyalty programs, broadening our marketing reach and increasing our digital focus. 
Jeffrey Severts: Thank you, Janet. I'd like to highlight some of our marketing activities during the first quarter. And then preview some key second quarter events. I'll also update you on our loyalty program and CRM platform and, finally, provide some color on the performance of our E-Commerce business. 
 Our most important promotion in Q1 was the signature 21 Days of Beauty, an event that our guest anxiously await twice a year for the daily beauty steals and in-store events focused on Prestige brands. We have significantly increased our resources dedicated to positioning ourselves as a beauty and trend authority and this season's efforts featured an array of new marketing assets with a special emphasis on digital, including a display advertising campaign featuring rich media units and a social media content and Facebook, Twitter and Pinterest. A dedicated online landing page allowed customers to view that day's upcoming and upcoming beauty steals as well as the schedule of all our in-store events. The page also allowed customers to register to receive digital reminders throughout the event, so that they won't miss any of their favorite steals.  We further enhanced our traffic driving efforts by utilizing Ultimate Rewards bonus point promotions to targeted customers via our CRM platform. Overall, it was our most integrated campaign to date and an exciting first step in our efforts to expand our marketing reach. 
 On the public relations front, we were pleased with the brand impressions generated by our sponsorship of the reality show The Face. In late March, the winner of the show's modeling contest was announced. Her name is Devyn. She will become The Face of Ulta beauty in our marketing campaigns for this fall and holiday season. 
 Looking ahead to the second quarter, we got off to a strong start with our Love Your Hair event. We are supporting Love Your Hair with a digital marketing campaign, similar in size and scope to what we did for 21 Days of Beauty. And for the first time ever, we have featured a celebrity on the cover of our direct mail magazine, Jennifer Aniston. Jennifer is the part owner and spokesmodel for the Living Proof brand, an important and fast-growing vendor in our professional hair category. 
 Turning to our loyalty programs. Last quarter we updated you on the status of our points-based program, ULTAmate Rewards. We shared that we wanted to assess a full year of customer data post last year's April conversion before making the final decision on the shape and timing of the next stage. We have recently completed our analysis of those data. While we have always known that ULTAmate Rewards is strongly preferred by our customers, we can now say with confidence, that this program also drives higher customer frequency and sales per customer. Consequently, we are announcing today our plan to convert the remaining 50% of the country to ULTAmate Rewards in Q1 of 2014. While we want to make this conversion as quickly as possible, we also want to be prudent about how much change we expose our employees and customers to during our most important season. With the supply chain project, website redesign and our aggressive store rollout plan already on the docket, we have decided that the smartest course for us is to wait until we're through the holiday period before we execute this final stage. This will support excellent execution of this complex process, which will involve significant planning and synchronization across systems, training, marketing and customer service. 
 One of the reasons we prefer the points program is that it allows for more effective use of our new CRM platform. Since implementing the CRM tool in late Q3 of last year, we've substantially ramped up our CRM activity. During the first quarter, we executed 25 e-mail campaigns targeted at specific customer segments, hoping to drive more traffic through more relevant and timely offers. Using a variety of approaches, including loyalty program bonus points, product discounts and free gifts with purchase, we continue to refine our understanding of what works best. In Q1, these campaigns posted strong incremental results over our mass e-mail efforts, exciting us, our customers and our vendors, who will now have a new means of growing their brands and gaining trial for their products. 
 Going forward, we will build on these successes and continue to expand our utilization of this platform. To that end, we've hired a new leader to further build out our customer analytics function. We have already made substantial progress in approving this capability and intend to be best-in-class at understanding our customers' behaviors, insider channels and applying those insights across our business. 
 Turning to e-commerce, our online sales delivered better-than-expected top line growth in Q1, while improving margin rate. Growth was driven primarily through strong sales of Prestige cosmetics and skin care and continued success with our beauty breaks and other online-only offers. Ulta.com had great success in acquiring new customers to this channel, especially during our 21 Days of Beauty promotion.  To update you on the website redesign project, we are on track for delivery of the full site redesign by this fall. In Q1, we made some foundational improvements including enhancements to our rewards program, Customer Account Center, and it's the landing pages for Ulta's iOS and Android mobile apps. This quarter, we will deploy a streamline checkout process, hoping to enhance our online conversion. To further support our rapid growth in e-commerce, we continue to step up the team with new talent and we are expecting to launch this summer additional fulfillment capabilities in our Chambersburg distribution center. 
 Overall, I'm very pleased with the progress we've made in the past few months in marketing, loyalty, CRM and our digital strategy. I'll now hand it back over to Scott. 
Scott Settersten: Thanks, Jeff. Turning to a more detailed discussion of our financial results, first quarter sales were $582.7 million, an increase of 22.9% compared to sales of $474.1 million achieved in Q1 of 2012. Our 6.7% comp was fairly balanced between traffic and ticket during the quarter, as a result of good discipline around promotional activity, an increase in mix of our higher ticket items as we added more Prestige cosmetics and skincare to the assortment. Our same-store sales increase reflects 140 basis points of benefit from our E-Commerce business, which grew 70% during the quarter. Gross profit margin decreased 100 basis points to 35% from 36% in Q1 of last year. The gross margin leverage, most of which we outlined in our Q4 call, included a number of unusual items compared to the prior-year period, including inventory receipts flow and the conversion of our central region to our points-based loyalty program, both of which we have now anniversaried. 
 We also had the onetime negative impact from our private label Gift-With-Purchase issue and continue to see our customers' increased focus on value. The gross margin decline was less than we had forecast due to a slightly better fixed store cost leverage and stronger product margins as we manage promotional activity in a very disciplined way. SG&A expense as a percentage of sales decreased 60 basis points to 22.8% compared to 23.4% in the first quarter of last year, driven by corporate overhead and advertising expense leverage. These gains were offset by deleverage in store labor as we began to invest in higher service levels and labor to support our increased mix of Prestige products, which require a higher level of guest service. 
 Preopening expense for the quarter was $3.2 million compared to $2.5 million in Q1 of 2012, due to adding 28 new stores compared to adding 18 new stores and relocating 1 store last year. Operating margin rate decreased 50 basis points to 11.6% compared to 12.1% a year ago with operating income up 17.8% to $67.7 million. The tax rate was 38.2% compared to 39.3% in Q1 of 2012, primarily due to changes in our state tax liabilities.  Net income per diluted share rose 20.4% to $0.65, compared to $0.54 last year. 
 Turning to the balance sheet, starting with inventory. Inventories at the end of the first quarter were $442.1 million, compared to $332.1 million at the end of Q1 of 2012. Total inventory increased 33.1%, an average inventory per store increased 7.9% compared to the prior year. Growth in total inventory was driven by the addition of 109 net new stores opened in the past year, and inventory related to the additional Prestige brand boutiques. Our inventory is healthy with very low obsolescence risk. 
 When we gave guidance in March, we said we expected inventory per door growth to be slightly less than comp growth. Inventory per store at the end of the quarter was actually up about 1 point higher than comp growth. The slightly higher per door inventory increase was primarily due to a shift in the opening schedule of 6 stores in 2Q, moving them earlier in 2Q resulting in us bringing in the inventory at the end of Q1. For the second quarter, we expect inventory per door to be somewhat higher due to the investments in the Prestige brands boutiques and new brand launches that Janet mentioned. For the full year, we expect our inventory per store to grow in line with our comp growth. 
 Capital expenditures were $42 million for the quarter driven by our new store program, the addition of Prestige boutiques and systems and supply chain investments. Depreciation and amortization were $25 million for the quarter. After authorizing a share repurchase program in March, for an aggregate amount the $150 million, we repurchased 500,500 shares of our stock at an average cost of $74.58 per share for a total of $37 million. 
 Before we discuss our guidance for Q2 and the year, I'd like to mention a coming change to our disclosure practices. We have decided to discontinue announcing holiday sales and updating Q4 guidance in early January. This was a practice dating from our previous participation in the ICR Conference in mid- January, when we are in our normal, quiet period cycle. 
 Now, turning to our outlook for the full year. We remain committed to delivering results for the full year 2013, consistent with our long-term financial model. This model is based on 4% to 6% comps with 15% to 20% annual square footage growth, yielding 25% to 30% earnings growth and targeting a mid-teens operating margin in the medium-term. We are maintaining our previous guidance for 2013. We expect to deliver comparable store sales growth in the range of 4% to 6% for the year, including e-commerce. We expect to grow square footage approximately 22% and we expect to achieve earnings-per-share growth at the low end of our long-term range of 25% to 30%, adjusted for the 53rd week in 2012. We expect to spend about $225 million in CapEx, including approximately $125 million for new stores and $100 million for everything else, including merchandise fixtures, remodels, initial investments and a new D.C. plant for 2014 and other systems and e-commerce capital needs.  Depreciation and amortization are expected to be approximately $105 million. We expect to generate strong free cash flow for the year and we'll continue to evaluate with our Board the best use of any excess cash. 
 Turning now to second quarter guidance. We expect to achieve sales in the range of $579 million to $589 million versus $481.7 million in Q2 of 2012. We expect comparable store sales to increase in the range of 4% to 6%, including the benefit from e-commerce sales. We plan to open 29 new stores versus 22 last year. We expect to achieve earnings-per-share in the range of $0.64 to $0.67 versus $0.54 in Q2 2012. 
 Gross profit margin is expected to increase 40 basis points at the midpoint of the range. We expect healthy product margin expansion and modest supply-chain leverage offset by the impact of cost associated with preparing for Lancôme and Clinique boutiques and modest deleverage of fixed store cost driven by our accelerated store growth. 
 SG&A rate is expected to increase 70 basis points at the midpoint of the range versus last year's 22% rate. Driven by investments in store labor to improve the guest experience, in supply chain, as we develop our blueprint for the future, and in e-commerce, as we accelerate growth in that business and prepare to deliver a better guest experience. 
 Operating margin is expected to decrease approximately 20 basis points at the midpoint of the range versus 11.9% last year. For the full year, we continue to expect to make meaningful progress towards our mid-teens operating margin target. The tax rate is expected to be approximately 38.3% and we anticipate a fully diluted share count of approximately 64.7 million shares. 
 In summary, we plan to deliver very strong growth in sales and earnings while continuing to invest in the long-term health and sustainability of our business. 
 With that, operator, please open up the call for questions. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Gary Balter with Crédit Suisse. 
Simeon Gutman: It's Simeon Gutman for Gary. Gary's right next to me give, I was just -- he's driving, that was his shut out. Scott, last quarter we talked about gross margin and there was some promotional, I guess, spending but there was some promotion that the business is, over time, going to be weaned off of it to some degree. Can you give us some color on that? Did that begin in the first quarter and then how did that progress as the year goes on? 
Scott Settersten: Just as a reminder. For first quarter, we guided gross profit margin down roughly 140 basis points at the midpoint of the guidance range. So comp store sales were a bit better, so we did get some leverage on fixed store cost, which helped, overall. We also saw product mix towards Prestige skin care and color cosmetics continued its strength, so that helped margin rate overall for the first quarter. E-commerce also helped us quite a bit. It was a tailwind as that business continues to scale up. With respect to the promotional environment, the first quarter, we kind of ran head-to-head. Things kind of shook out the way we expected them to. As we talked about that in the big, big scheme of things, our intention, over the long-term, is to moderate some of the general coupon drop, so to speak, and so offset that with a bit more of the CRM initiative, to do more one-on-one, more sophisticated marketing with our customers. So that's the trend. As Jeff mentioned, we've had some good successes there. We've been ramping up the efforts there. We've seen some good, positive results. But again, we're still in the very early stages of the CRM tool and platform. 
Simeon Gutman: And then one follow-up for Janet. She mentioned a couple of the categories per segment that's strong or that are outperforming some of the other categories. Can we just drill a little bit more deeply into the 2, I think, that you called out on the positive side, and you mentioned a couple brands. And then also a follow-up on the, I think, you said the appliance category was a little soft. There are some introductions that are upcoming. I don't know if that's something you think will turn around the space or et cetera. If you can comment on that? 
Janet Taake: Well first of all, the Prestige side, when I mentioned the Prestige skin and color cosmetics were very strong for first quarter, I didn't mention specific brands and it continues to be strong for us. It has been for several quarters. As far as other categories that are gaining traction, we're seeing a lot of healthcare or therapy and hair care. And its in liquids as well as some tools. High-tech tools, I mentioned before, have been a trending category for us and it's -- a lot of it is high ticket products. The HairMax we launched earlier in Q1 along with other tools that are coming in from Q2 that I mentioned, and a lot of hair removal -- home hair removal techniques are also trending. So there's the hair therapy, there's hair tools and then there's also the home-care with hair removal that's also been trending. 
Simeon Gutman: What about the appliance category? I mean you sold a couple of products in the past couple of weeks that looked pretty promising on the curling side that looked like that could revise some of the category. I don't if expectations built into that? 
Janet Taake: Yes, we have newness coming in. We usually don't speak too far out, but we do have some new technology coming in. I mentioned from Jose Eber, the infrared flatiron that's coming in which is new technology for us and also a new brand. And there's some other product coming in that has to do that's associated with curl that we have not launched yet that will be coming in this quarter. There is some newness. It is also a slower-growing category. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Daniel Hofkin with William Blair & Company. 
Daniel Hofkin: Just I guess following up on the topic of the CEO search for a second, if there's anything you can say at this point in terms of some of the characteristics that you're particularly looking for, that you're trying to zero in on? That would be my first question. 
Dennis Eck: Yes, we've been very focused on -- we have a very strong team at Ulta. We think we're headed in a very good direction and what we're looking for is somebody that can take that and move it on to the next step. So we're being very, very thoughtful and careful about somebody that can do that. And as I said in the last call, we're going to take our time and do it right and that we'll be back to you as quickly as we have something. But we're pleased with the progress. 
Daniel Hofkin: And then my other question relates to e-commerce. The 70% growth, seems like that may be a step up from what you had been seeing, correct me if I'm wrong on that. And if so, what were some of -- was there any like particular 1 or 2 events that drove well above trend growth or was that a fairly steady growth trend during the quarter? 
Scott Settersten: Hey, Dan, the 70% growth rate that we saw in the first quarter, again, while e-commerce is still a relatively small piece of the business, I wouldn't model that in as kind of the go-forward run rate. Historically, it's been in that 30-ish, 40-ish kind of range, which I would say is still probably a good estimate for you to use. As far as category drivers on e-commerce, it's really -- we saw higher ends, skin care kinds of things and some of these tech tools that Janet mentioned which lend themselves very well to the kind of digital e-commerce space. We were able to get it in stock and get it promoted and get it out there in the website in a real timely fashion. So more than anything else, it was the higher-end categories that were driving the growth. 
Jeffrey Severts: Sorry, this is Jeff. I'd just add to Scott's answer about later in the year expectations for e-commerce. Remember that we do have the site relaunch only happening in the fall and quite naturally, with that kind of relaunch, we would expect to see some transitional bumping as the customer gets used to that new site. 
Daniel Hofkin: But fair to say that, that was -- that the type of growth you saw, even -- was kind of above your historical average pretty steadily? It wasn't 1 or 2 key events that drove explosive growth or anything? 
Scott Settersten: No. It was the general trend across the quarter. And again, it was because of the introduction to some of these new products that just worked out extremely well. 
Daniel Hofkin: Okay. And I guess, lastly, as it relates to what you mentioned about some of the styling tools, do you think that there's any competitive pricing things there? Or is that primarily what you mentioned just kind of maturity of the category? 
Janet Taake: We're always aware and pay attention to the competition but we also deliver what we feel is going to drive our guest to the store. So on both sides, we manage the styling tools appropriately. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Evren Kopelman with Wells Fargo. 
Evren Kopelman: Can you give us a sense of Lancôme and Clinique, maybe the impact they're having on the stores that have the boutiques? Is there a significant difference in comp or store traffic that you can speak to in those stores? And what's kind of the maybe the sell-through of those brands relative to expectations? 
Scott Settersten: Evren, we're not really going to be able to get into the details with you on specific brands or categories, but we are very happy with the performance of the boutiques, both Lancôme and Clinique. I think our partners, our vendor partners, are happy with the performance as well, which I think is demonstrated by our continued expansion with them. It does drive additional traffic to the stores. It helps the box overall. It helps our guest experience in the stores and the offering that we have. So again, I think we're happy in all fronts, we've been happy with the expansion and we look forward to more in the future. 
Evren Kopelman: And then a follow-up on the stock buyback program. Should we expect you to be more opportunistic or is this going to be more regular use of the program, possibly to offset the dilution from options? How do you think about the usage of the program? 
Jeffrey Severts: In the near-term, I guess the short answer we'd say, opportunistic, would be the answer, the short answer, again. This is a responsibility that management and the board takes very seriously. We've got $150 million authorization out there. It's kind of a judgment call on where get into the market and what we do. But again, it's a thoughtful process that we're in continuous conversations on with the Board. 
Dennis Eck: And we're measuring that against the need for cash for the other things that we need to do to continue to build and grow Ulta. So we discuss this at nearly every board meeting. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Ike Boruchow with Sterne Agee. 
Irwin Boruchow: I guess my question is going to be based on the merchandise margins. Scott, you talked about the gross margins in the quarter and how they came in. Is there any way you could break apart the gross margin that you saw in terms of merchandise margin and occupancy and buying deleverage in Q1? 
Scott Settersten: I'm not sure if we're going to be able to do that on the call. Should we? I mean, again, overall the mix was better, Prestige skin care and color continued its strength during the quarter, so we continue to mix up a bit on that side of the business, which helped the rate. We did get slightly better fixed store cost leverage because the comp was stronger than we are expecting or what the midpoint of the guidance range called for. We did get supply chain. We were expecting that to deleverage slightly in the first quarter. That ended up being a little stronger than we were expecting because of some of the inventory receipts during the quarter to support some of the initiatives with the new brands and the boutiques coming into the Q. So I don't think we're going to be able to give you any more breakdown than that at this stage. 
Irwin Boruchow: I guess what I was going at is in Q2, your guiding gross margins at the midpoint up 40 basis points. They were just down 100. I'm assuming that, that has a pretty nice inflection in the merchandise margin and I was wondering if you could comment there, give color. I know there was one-time things in Q1 that impacted you, but maybe what are you seeing going forward? What's your visibility into positive merchandise margins for the remainder of the year? 
Dennis Eck: I would preface that by saying, again, in the big picture, we've kind of cycled through a lot of those headwinds in the first quarter that we saw with, primarily, inventory receipts but also a couple of the other items that we talked about here on the call. As we pivot and look ahead to second quarter, again, a big driver of it is the promotional and merchandising strategies that we use. So again, for second quarter, we're looking at some different events that we expect to drive better rates for us overall. We expect to continue to see strength in the high-end Prestige skin and color categories, which will continue to drive rate, as that continues to mix up. We'll also see some leverage in supply chain in the second quarter, which we didn't really see in the first quarter. So those are the primary levers that we look at as we look ahead to Q2 with margin expansion. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Neely Tamminga with Piper Jaffray. 
Neely Tamminga: Scott, I have just one quick clarification point and just a bigger picture question on e-commerce. Clarification on the promos. So we definitely noticed as well in our own analysis that the promo trends were actually down this year versus last year as you guys have more of this direct kind of segmented e-mail marketing. So are you expecting embedded in guidance for Q2 to be kind of a similar sort of year-over-year trend in Q1 or kind of matching that with the promos of Q2 last year? 
Scott Settersten: We expect Q2, year-over-year, to be consistent, so Q2 this year versus last year. When we talk about promotional events, we're talking about the direct mail pieces that we send our customers and the newspaper inserts kinds of things. So those will be even up head-to-head year-over-year for Q2. 
Jeffrey Severts: Sorry, this is Jeff. I was just going to add, yes, we do, I mean, anniversarying, year-over-year, the major events. You'll see no changes to that. What you will notice, I think, what you noticed in first quarter is us taking opportunities to nip away at the corners a bit and be more selective and targeted in our promotions. 
Neely Tamminga: Absolutely. We thought it was very well executed. And then my big picture question on the e-commerce side is if you think about e-commerce growth and expansion, based on our observation, we noticed companies really see kind of that lift in business overall when they're either expand SKUs online or basically offer some amazing new customer service function like free shipping, free returns. Where are you guys on that spectrum and how you're thinking about probably primarily SKU expansion online and availability relative to what you have in your stores? And then also any sort of latest thinking around free shipping, free returns or something to that effect? 
Janet Taake: On the SKU expansion, we will be expanding a brand that we may have in-house and add SKUs online that we don't carry in the brick-and-mortar side of the business. We're also looking at adding brands that we don't carry in brick and mortar. And it's continuing to evolve and we will continue to manage that and look at opportunities to expand beyond, once again, what may be in brick and mortar. 
Dennis Eck: Otherwise, we are not planning any major changes to the customer proposition. We feel like we have strong proposition already. We want our customers to buy from us online because they're buying from Ulta, first, and that the online channel is just their channel of choice at that time. You won't -- we are not planning on trying to grow online sales for online sales' sake. We're trying to grow Ulta sales. 
Scott Settersten: I would just close that one out, Neely, by saying in the big picture, this E-commerce business is a place where we're playing catch-up right now. So when you talk about major new changes that will drive guest engagement and have them shop our site more often, a lot of that is to come. So part of that's going to be with the web redesign that we have coming out in the fall, integrating the points-based loyalty programs across platforms, so it's seamless to our customers, and expanding the assortment here that Janet spoke to across, so that more closely resembles the in-store experience. So that's all ahead of us. All good things to come in the future. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Brian Tunick with JPMorgan. 
Brian Tunick: Two questions really regarding, I guess, stores. First one is given the ongoing CEO search, we were wondering what is the timing of your budget process when you need to lock-in how many new stores you're planning for 2014? And then the second one is really on the store maturity curve, I guess, Scott, you updated and, I guess, when you guys think about the faster ramp that you're now seeing and you try to isolate whether or not it's about the markets now you're in or the real estate locations or the brand awareness, sort of what do you isolate as sort of being the reasons that the store maturity curve is what it is? And when you think about the double-digit comps you put up the last 3 years compared to your guidance, what's really changing? Is it mostly the mature stores? Just trying to figure that out. 
Scott Settersten: Well let me take the easy one first, which is kind of the budget process, all right? I mean can -- I think we mentioned we're well on our way. The pipeline looks good for 2014. We've got 50 sites already approved, internally approved. We're still working on the leases and all the details. So we feel we're in very good position for 2014 and we can lever that up and back. Our real estate guys are very seasoned. We can work to meet the number, whatever it is, again, depending on the quality of the real estate. As long as the quality is there, we can execute. As far as the new store ramp is concerned, again, we updated our model here just recently. So the stores are starting out a little bit stronger than they had, than what we had seen historically. So again, that first year step up in the comp, maybe is a little bit more moderated -- moderate than some of you may have had in your models. So again, instead of high teens in second year, because they start at a higher rate, so the second year might be closer to midteens kind of step up, all right? Again, what we're seeing when we look at the models and stack up the stores every quarter, we're seeing that the store ramp is consistent over that 5-year period with what we've seen historically. Broader picture, we're closing in on 600 stores across the U.S. We're kind of following the natural flow of the beauty industry, overall. As we look back to 2012, I would say it's not double-digits the last 3 years, Brian. But it was very healthy, high single-digit growth last year and when you pivot that against what we saw here in the first quarter, which, you know, again it's a low 5% comp for the bricks and mortar part of the business. That is a change. When we look across the classes, we're not seeing any significant changes by class or geographic area of the country. The stores in general, there's not a lot of variability between the stores outside of the normal ramp up of new stores. So when you look back now at some of the older stores, like the greater than 5-year-old stores, last year when he had really high single-digit comps, they were comping at healthy single-digit kind of levels. This year, those older stores are comping in the low single-digit kind of area. So again, the good news is they're not hurting the comp, all right? And while they might not -- those older stores might not be helping drive a higher comp, they are contributing very healthy store-level earnings and cash flows for the company. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Matt Fassler with Goldman Sachs. 
Matthew Fassler: One question, one follow-up, both sort of around the e-commerce, retail interaction. First, thanks for the very detailed disclosure on the store's comp and the e-commerce comp. If you think about traffic and ticket, should we think about that 140 bps from e-commerce really driving that traffic number? Because I know you gave that for the base, overall, without differentiating between channel. 
Scott Settersten: Look, again, the comp was 6.7% for the quarter, roughly equal transaction drivers and ticket drivers, the ticket side of that was primarily units, all right? Average selling price was basically flat year-over-year. When we break down the business and built up a comp map, we break apart the E-Commerce business, the salon business and the retail business. And when we say it's roughly equal transactions or traffic and ticket, the same goes for the E-Commerce business. So it's not -- we don't just throw it all in the traffic side of the comp driver. So it's [indiscernible] . 
Matthew Fassler: Got it. That's helpful. And then secondly, given your loyalty program, you have, obviously, a better visibility than most who your customers are. As you think about the big e-commerce spike that you saw, what's your sense about whether these are existing Ulta customers, loyalty program members or not, relative to people who are new to the brand and joining you through the e-commerce channel? 
Scott Settersten: Generally speaking, customers that use our e-commerce site, by and large, are aware of Ulta and are already part of the Ulta guest kind of profile in pool, all right? That's the majority of the users. We have seen, with some of these new product introductions here, especially recently Q1, that it has been able to draw in more new customers. So as we look at it overall, we're happy to see that, that it's a way for us to mine and draw in new customers. 
Dennis Eck: Yes. I would just build on that. Generally, most of our online channel growth is coming from existing customers, and we're just getting another visit or more frequency out of them, which is fantastic for us. But this quarter was a bit peculiar. We had a couple of new products, SeroVital being one of the them, where it was a hot product where we -- we're one of the few distributors around the product and it brought a lot of new people into the franchise. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Joe Altobello with Oppenheimer. 
Joseph Altobello: Just wanted to stay on e-commerce for a second. Looks like, obviously, the 140 basis points boost you got in terms of comp growth in the quarter from that was a little bit better than you guys were looking for. It definitely was better than we were looking for. So could you help us out in terms of the full year, I think in the past you've said that it will be less than a point to full-year comps. Is that still your view at this point? 
Scott Settersten: Yes, exactly. For the full year, we're estimating it's roughly 100 basis points to the comp for the full year. As Jeff mentioned, we started out at the gate here very strong in Q1. We expected to moderate a little bit. We've got this new site redesign that's going to roll out in early fall. We expect there to be some transition time period there. So again, for the full year, rough and tough, 100 basis points. 
Joseph Altobello: Okay, got it. And then in terms of gross margin, obviously, the quarter there too was better-than-expected. On your last call, I think you had mentioned that you guys did expect to see "healthy" gross margin expansion for the year. Didn't hear any commentary today, at least, on the full-year gross margin outlook. Is that still your view that, that gross margin will be up healthy this year and SG&A roughly flattish or have those components changed a bit? 
Scott Settersten: Joe, we're reconfirming our full-year guidance. So again, exactly as we described to many of you over the last couple of months, we do expect to see healthy gross margin expansion for the full year. 
Joseph Altobello: Okay and I apologize, but if it's down 100 and up 40 [ph], and the fourth quarter, I think, you've said is going to be pretty promotional, so you probably shouldn't expect to see much in the way of gross margin expansion in the fourth quarter. It sounds like a lot of the gross margin expansion this year you're looking for is going to be in 3Q. 
Scott Settersten: I wouldn't say that's a fair statement. Typically, fourth quarter is a more promotional time period but again, as we shift some of our marketing and merchandise strategy, the CRM initiative continues to gain speed of momentum, and we're able to pull some levers back and forth in other parts of the promotional kind of basket, we feel confident that we'll be able to do what we said. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of David Wu with Telsey Advisory Group. 
David Wu: First, can you talk about the longer-term opportunity of the Prestige business, including any plans to introduce additional large flagship brands into the mix, as well as a longer term potential for a new brand boutique, especially as Prestige segment obviously is expected to continue to outperform over time, yet it still appears to be relatively under-penetrated category for you? 
Janet Taake: We will continue to evaluate new brands and new products in Prestige but, more importantly, across all categories of our business, it's important to look at the total business. Our box is very flexible so we can -- and we're very agile as an organization, so we can move pretty quickly within our stores if we needed to add boutiques or any type of presentation that goes from mass to Prestige. As we look at the total mix, we will introduce, we can constantly have conversations with vendors and we will, once again, across all categories, and we will continually add and look for newness and it will be an important part of our business. But overall, I don't see a significant change from the total mix of the box year-over-year. 
David Wu: Great. And with the new brand boutiques that you've been opening and -- as well as introduction of more sort of higher-end product and tools, have you noticed any changes at all, to your customer demographics, whether age or by income? 
Jeffrey Severts: David, no. This is Jeff. We have not seen any substantial shifts there. Nothing that would show up in any of our tracking tools. So same customer, generally, in terms of what she looks like, how old she is, where she's from. 
David Wu: Great. And then I thought it was interesting, you talked about ongoing [ph] some of the private label men's product this quarter. And I was wondering if you could perhaps talk about sort of the overall men's opportunity? 
Janet Taake: We have a men's shop in our stores and men's, we carry fragrance, skincare and some bath categories that we just launched with Ulta. We're very pleased with our business but, overall, it's a really small percentage of the total business for Ulta. 
David Wu: Got it. And is this a category that you may focus on more over time? 
Janet Taake: Once again, it's a small part of the business, but we will always look for opportunities to grow categories at two other category. So as I mentioned, we just launched Ulta, which is totally new and it doesn't compete with anything else within the category and we will continue to evaluate men's skincare. It's been a nice category for us. 
David Wu: Excellent. And just lastly, in terms of your store expansion strategy, I know obviously that the focus here is still on opening stores in power centers but can you perhaps elaborate more on the mall opportunity and if the sales and profitability dynamics are attractive enough to make it a viable alternative to the power centers? 
Scott Settersten: We do look at mall sites occasionally. Again, when we're looking at 100 or 100-plus new store opportunities a year. There are certain geographic locations where the mall is the only place really to do business in a specific town or geographic area. So we do look at those from time to time. We do have a number of stores that are adjacent to malls, attached to malls. So we do look at every one of those opportunities that comes about. The stores that we do have opened that are connected to malls do just as well as stores that sit on independent pads or are in power center lineups with other tenants. So again, we look at them on an individual basis to make sure we're happy with the physical space, that the co-tenant mix is the right one for us, that we get the right kind of economic model overall and that we feel good about the store. So again, it's an opportunity and it's something that we take a look at as need be. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Jill Caruthers with Johnson Rice & Company. 
Jill Caruthers: Is there any way you could quantify the number of Clinique boutiques you'll be rolling out this year? 
Janet Taake: Thank you for asking that question. Not today. We will be able to update you on the next call. 
Jill Caruthers: Okay. Should we assume that it's a more material number or there's just no real comment there? 
Janet Taake: No comment. 
Jill Caruthers: Okay. And I guess just trying to see how -- I feel like these brands pull in, possibly, a department store customer that isn't fully aware of what Ulta has. How are you going about advertising these -- specifically these brands, Clinique and Lancôme, given they're not storewide across your base? Is there any advertising you're able to do at this point in time throughout this rollout? 
Janet Taake: Yes. Actually, we've been marketing in our mailers to the zip codes in which our stores are located that have a Clinique or a Lancôme or both and we've been doing that for several years and we will continue as we continue to expand. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Mark Altschwager with Robert W. Baird. 
Jacob Zitter: This is Jacob in for Mark. If you're looking at the loyalty data over the past year, will the program be tweaked at all going forward versus the initial points-based model? And then I guess as a follow-up, do you expect the rollout to impact gross margin positively or negatively next year as new customers enter the program? 
Dennis Eck: Thanks, Jacob. So no material changes to the customer proposition on the program, it will be the same program that you see today. Some very minor modifications in the way we launch it, on the basis of what we have learned in the first launch in the first 50% of the country. But nothing significant and certainly nothing visible to the customer. Did you want to handle margin? 
Scott Settersten: Yes. As far as margin or the financial impact of transitioning the rest of the 50% of the country that's not on points-based today, I think I've outlined, again, for a large number of folks over the last couple of months that there was some initial margin rate impact based on the new program, because people are more engaged. They spend more money, so they earn more points. So we have to reserve more and there is an impact on the margin rate. But over the long-term, and we're hoping next year, that's another element that plays into the early 2014 implementation, that over the first year period, all that kind of moderates by and large. So we've learned some good lessons over the years with how this program works and what they expect, and we feel very comfortable now and confident that we can forecast that appropriately. 
Operator: There are no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the floor back over to management for closing comments. 
Scott Settersten: Thank you all for your interest in Ulta and we look forward to speaking with you all soon. Thank you. 
Operator: Thank you. This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time and thank you for your participation.

===== 2012 Q4  (2013-03-14 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Greetings and welcome to the Ulta Beauty Fiscal Fourth Quarter and 2012 Earnings Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Laurel Lefebvre, Vice President, Investor Relations. Thank you. You may now begin. 
Laurel Lefebvre: Thank you. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us for Ulta's Fourth Quarter 2012 Conference Call. Hosting our call are Dennis Eck, interim Chief Executive Officer; and Scott Settersten, Chief Financial Officer. Also joining us are: Alex Lelli, Senior Vice President, Growth and Development; Janet Taake, Senior Vice President, Merchandising; and Jeff Severts, Senior Vice President, Marketing.

With that, I'll turn the call over to Dennis. 
Dennis Eck: Thank you, Laurel. Good afternoon, everyone. I'm very pleased to have several members of our senior management here. Ulta has a strong and tenured leadership team. Scott, Alex, Janet and Jeff are among the key leaders driving Ulta's business forward. 
 We will take you through the fourth quarter numbers. Ulta drove terrific results in the fourth quarter, wrapping up another year of sales and earnings growth. We will share our expectations for continued excellent performance in 2013. 
 For those of you who are not familiar with my background, I have been the Non-Executive Chairman of the Board of Ulta for the past 10 years. I've worked closely with the management team over the last decade. I'm honored to take on the role of interim CEO. Our primary focus is to maintain a high-quality business at Ulta. I will be working with other members of the Board to find the right CEO to lead Ulta in the years ahead. The search is underway. We are working with Herbert Mines and Associates, a top executive search firm, to identify the best possible candidate to lead this company. 
 You saw our announcement about Scott Settersten's appointment to the CFO role today. I'd like to congratulate him on his well-deserved promotion. With that, I'll turn it over to Scott. 
Scott Settersten: Thank you, Dennis. As you've seen in the results we announced this afternoon, the Ulta team delivered another very strong quarter and year. Ulta remains a compelling growth story, which continues to build upon our successful 5-point growth strategy. 
 To recap, the Q4 headlines. We grew the top line 30%, including the benefit of an extra week in the quarter. Comparable-store sales were 8% on top of 11.5% in Q4 of 2011. We were pleased with our sales in January, which benefited from our planned inventory investment. This allowed us to reduce stockouts and to come out of the holiday season in a healthy and stocked position, while ending the year with inventory levels more in line with the rest of the year. We increased operating margin 110 basis points from 12.6% in Q4 of last year to 13.7% this year. Earnings grew at 37% to $1 per share. These excellent results wrapped up a strong year in which we grew sales 25%, drove an 8.8% comp and delivered 41% earnings-per-share growth for the full year. 
 I'll go through the financial statements in more detail and talk to you about our plans for this year in a moment. But first, I'd like to ask the team to provide some updates on our progress with Ulta's 5-point multiyear growth strategy. One, accelerating store growth. Two, introducing new products, services and brands. Three, enhancing our loyalty program. Four, broadening our marketing reach. And five, increasing our digital focus, including ulta.com. First, I'd like to introduce Alex Lelli, our Senior Vice President of Growth and Development, to talk about our store growth. Alex has more than 30 years' experience in real estate development for big-box retail, and has been with Ulta since 2005. His team is responsible for real estate analytics, site selection and all the elements of getting leases signed and fixtures, stores, fixture and open. Over the course of the last 8 years, Alex and his team have quadrupled our store count, and the quality of the real estate and the new store productivity speak for themselves. Alex? 
Alex Lelli: Thanks, Scott. Good afternoon, everyone. Ulta is a compelling store expansion story. And my team has the expertise, creativity and proven track record to deliver 15% to 20% annual square footage growth as we build out our 1,200-store plan. 2012 was an outstanding year for us, and here's why. We increased square footage by 23%, opened 102 new stores, relocated 3 and remodeled 21 stores. That is a significant increase in activity compared to 2011. Focusing just on the fourth quarter, we opened 13 new stores and ended the year with 550 stores in 45 states. We continue to be very pleased with new store productivity, driven by high-quality sites, a growing awareness of the Ulta brand and strong grand opening promotions. 
 Let's look ahead to 2013. We are in very good shape to execute our 125-store plan. The vast majority of the leases are already signed. The mix of stores in 2013 will look pretty similar to last year, with about 75% in existing shopping centers and the balance in new developments. About 1/3 of the new stores will be in new markets, and the rest will fill in existing markets, again, similar to last year. We expect to open approximately 23 stores in the first quarter, 32 in the second quarter, 55 stores in the third quarter and 15 stores in the fourth quarter of 2013. We plan to remodel 7 stores, as our primary focus is on executing our accelerated new store rollout. 
 The portfolio is in great shape. 90% of the chain is in our newest formats. Looking ahead to the next several years, we continue to see a high-quality pipeline of potential real estate sites. The dealmakers on my team all have at least 25 years of experience in retail real estate. Ulta is benefiting from their tenure and creativity to find ways to deliver the best sites in an environment where there's very little new shopping center development. We are also enjoying the benefits of our solid network in the shopping center industry, and strong relationships with landlords, shopping center owners and brokers, since we are one of the few retailers to have such strong growth potential. Our debt free balance sheet and our ability to drive customer traffic to shopping centers makes us a tenant of choice. 
 We're also benefiting from the repositioning now taking place in the retail industry, with many retailers closing or downsizing stores. However, as we have always maintained, we will not compromise our standards for quality sites just to deliver the quantity of stores in our plan. I'd now like to introduce our Chief Merchant, Janet Taake, to discuss the second element of our growth strategy: introducing new products, services and brands. Janet has been with Ulta since 2008, and has more than 30 years of experience in retail merchandising. Janet and her team have added 65 new brands to the Ulta portfolio in the past 4 years and 20 last year alone, fueling the strong comp performance we've seen over the past few years. Janet? 
Janet Taake: Thanks, Alex. Merchandising is the heart of the growth for Ulta. Introducing newness is a powerful tool to continually surprise and delight our guests. Our business continues to grow faster than the beauty market overall, as we strengthen our assortment with new brands, new products and new services. We continue to curate the offering with trend right products to make the guest experience compelling. With over 20,000 SKUs and 500 brands, we have unmatched breadth of assortment which continues to evolve almost daily. 
 In the fourth quarter, we gained share across all categories, with particular strength in prestige cosmetics and skin care. We see strong trends in nail, foundation, both women's and men's skincare, and high-tech tools like Clarisonic. Celebrity tie-ins with hair care brands are boosting the growth of brands like Living Proof with spokesperson Jennifer Aniston, and Alterna, with brand ambassador Katie Holmes. They will be both be very prominent in our marketing. 
 Looking ahead, the merchandising team continues to build a strong pipeline of new brands and new products to add to our assortment. Starting with some great news, just this week, Ulta became the only retailer approved to sell OPI nail polish online, and we launched the full OPI assortment on ulta.com, including the new Euro Centrale collection of spring colors. Nail continues to be an important trend, with personalization at the forefront, supported by nail art tools and seasonal color trends. 
 And now, let me touch on a few new prestige brands we're introducing. St. Tropez luxury bronzing products, Lipstick Queen, a line of lipsticks with a cult following, and Deborah Lippmann prestige nail lacquer, which we will be rolling out to 200 stores in Q1. In the skin care category, we are delighted to launch Perricone MD, a prestige brand known for its antiaging formulations and clinical efficacy. Perricone is a great addition to the assortment as we continue to build a complete skin care offering. Newness in fragrance continues to be strong with Coach Love, Jimmy Choo and Dolce & Gabbana The One Desire, all launching in Q1. 
 Moving on to brand expansions, we're excited to announce we're continuing the expansion of Clinique boutiques in 2013, on top of the 43 boutiques already opened at year end. These additional boutiques will be fairly balanced between our new stores in 2013 and existing stores, while adding more Clinique boutiques to create some short-term pressure on the P&L. This provides excellent long-term benefits to Ulta and our guests. We have also just rolled out our exclusive CK One cosmetics brand from 180 stores to all locations. Benefit brand boutiques continue their strong performance. We now have Benefit Brow Bars in 400 stores, and we will be adding brow tinting to the service menu this year. 
 For a quick update on our services business, salon performance was very strong in the fourth quarter, driven by cut and color. On the skin care side of the business, we're seeing nice growth in micro dermabrasion services, as well as strong response to special promotions on our menu of 20-minute targeted skin treatments. 
 Turning to Q1, we're now launching the new 2013 salon collection with new cutting, color and highlighting techniques, and we expect our salon business to have another solid year of market share gains and growing awareness of our high-quality salon services. 
 As you can see, the pipeline of newness for 2013 strengthens our position as a beauty authority to succeed in merchandising, you need a strong partnership with marketing, and I am delighted to be partnering with Jeff Severts, the newest member of the leadership team. Jeff joined Ulta last fall with 20 years' experience in multichannel retail and consumer products marketing. Jeff most recently led the marketing efforts for Carphone Warehouse in the U.K. and he built the Geek Squad brand at Best Buy from a local phenomenon to a national brand. Jeff? 
Jeffrey Severts: Thank you, Janet. I've really enjoyed my first few months here. This company has a vibrant business model, with so much natural strength. And as a marketer, I see tremendous potential. The good news is that we are already doing the hardest part of marketing really well. We have over 11 million active loyalty program members who are shopping more frequently and spending more money with us. But the untapped opportunity is penetration. Tens of millions of women in our treating areas have yet to discover the Ulta brand. 
 We know what it takes to win customer loyalty, and we'll continue to leverage our proven methods. But now, benefiting from our increasing scale, we can begin to invest in marketing in a way that will allow us to reach those millions of potential customers. We expect those efforts to be mostly digital, and we look forward to providing you updates on our progress in the quarters ahead. 
 Now, let me take a step back to recap our efforts on 3 initiatives during the fourth quarter, and also give you a preview of our activities in Q1. In Q4, we continue to broaden our reach beyond our traditional strength in direct mail marketing. For the holiday season, we opened many of our stores at midnight on Black Friday, and built excitement with great deals and an integrated marketing campaign. Leading up to Christmas, we offered 11 days of daily holiday Hot Buys, driving excitement and strong sales with great offers on prestige brands. We also continue to evolve our social media strategy, with increased communication through Facebook, Pinterest and Twitter. In January, we refreshed our popular skin care event, rebranded Love Your Skin, this 3-week promotion offered daily in-store events and gifts-with-purchase to encourage customers to reassess their skincare regimens. 
 Turning to Q1, we kicked off the quarter with a spring beauty preview in partnership with Allure magazine, promoting the season's newness and highlighting tips and trends. In February, the Oxygen reality show The Face debuted amid great fanfare. The winner of the contest will become the newest face of Ulta, and we've been very pleased with the buzz about the program in social media and with the coverage we've received in national titles like InStyle and Marie Claire. This week, we launched our semiannual 21 Days of Beauty promotion. We are backing this event with our most integrated campaign to date, featuring the largest digital marketing push in our history. 
 Turning to our loyalty program, we continue to build our member base to well over 11 million active members. We are testing and refining how we use our new CRM platform that we implemented in Q3. We've had some early success using customer behavioral data to deliver more compelling, personalized offers. As we use this platform more, we expect to find more efficient and effective ways to drive traffic. As you know, we currently have 2 loyalty programs running in different parts of the country. We are still assessing the results of last April's conversion in the central region. Once we have a full annual cycle of data, we plan to quickly decide on the size and timing of subsequent conversions. Our goal and our expectation is that we have 1 national loyalty program. 
 Moving onto e-commerce, in the fourth quarter, we enjoyed strong growth on ulta.com and delivered significant enhancements to the site's stability and speed. We were very pleased with our dramatic improvements in site performance on Cyber Monday weekend despite record volume. Looking ahead to Q1 and beyond, this is a very important year for ulta.com as we invest in a major site redesign, as well as in people and supply chain capabilities to continue to accelerate our growth. In summary, Ulta has a huge opportunity to reach new customers who've never discovered our brand. And to be even more compelling to our existing guests with personalized marketing communication. I'll now hand it back over to Scott. 
Scott Settersten: Thanks, everyone, for the update on our 5-point growth program and a reminder of the significant runway that remains in each leg of our strategy. Turning back to the detailed P&L, net sales were $758.8 million, an increase of 30.3% compared to sales of $582.5 million achieved in the fourth quarter of 2011. This included an extra week of sales which came in a bit stronger than our previous estimate of $35 million. Our 8% comp was fairly balanced between traffic and ticket during the quarter. On a 2-year basis, the comp was more consistent with our typical trend, with traffic being the primary driver. Gross profit margin increased 10 basis points to 34.2% from 34.1% in Q4 of last year. 
 We continue to see leverage and fixed store costs on our strong comp and increasing leverage in our supply chain on efficiency improvements from our new Chambersburg distribution center. These gains were offset by weaker merchandise margins, which were primarily driven by our guests' stronger focus on value, meaning they are taking greater advantage of our promotions and coupons. SG&A expense as a percentage of sales decreased 100 basis points to 20.3%, compared to 21.3% in the fourth quarter last year, driven primarily by corporate overhead and marketing leverage. Preopening expense for the quarter was $1.9 million compared to $1 million in Q4 of 2011, due to adding 13 new stores compared to 7 stores last year. Operating margin rate increased 110 basis points to 13.7% compared to 12.6% a year ago, with operating income up 41.7% to $103.8 million. The tax rate was 37.8% compared to 36.7% in Q4 of last year. The difference in rate is due to timing with the year-over-year rate relatively flat. Net income per diluted share rose 37% to $1, compared to $0.73 last year. This year's fourth quarter included about $0.05 of earnings per share from the extra week in the period. Excluding the benefit of the extra week, earnings per share growth was approximately 30%. 
 Turning to the balance sheet. Regarding inventories. We are pleased with the improvements in our overall [indiscernible] position and the quality of our inventory. While the average per door at the end of Q4 is a bit higher than we originally planned, we expect the per door average to be below our comp growth by the end of Q1. Inventories at the end of the fourth quarter were $361.1 million, compared to $244.6 million at the end of Q4 last year. Total inventories increased 47.6%, and average inventory per store increased 20.5% compared to the prior year. Inventory balances were driven by the addition of 101 net new stores, $6 million of incremental inventory related to the 79 new prestige brand boutiques completed during the year, $20 million of planned strategic inventory investments in core product categories to reduce stockouts and ensure strong in stock levels coming out of the holiday season, a pull forward of roughly $10 million in inventory to better support timing changes in the early 2013 promotional calendar and $5 million due to the incremental new stores in the pre-open queue versus last year. 
 Capital expenditures were $44 million for the quarter and $189 million for the full year, driven by our new store program, remodels and systems and supply chain investments. Depreciation and amortization was $23 million for the quarter and $88 million for the year. For the year, we generated over $50 million of free cash flow and paid a $63 million special cash dividend. 
 Turning to our outlook for 2013. First, I'd like to cover a change in our communication practices going forward. Consistent with our plans to become a more integrated business that focuses the entire organization on the guest and how she wants to shop, e-commerce sales will be included in the comp beginning in Q1. With e-commerce currently representing a low single-digit percentage of our sales, this is not a material change from a financial perspective. That said, we have high expectations for growth in e-commerce this year. If we achieve our growth plans, e-commerce could add close to a point to the comp number. We will break out the impact of e-commerce sales each quarter for the first year. 
 In terms of our financial expectations for 2013, we plan to deliver another strong year. We expect to deliver comparable-store sales growth in the range of 4% to 6% for the year, including e-commerce. We expect square footage growth of approximately 22%, and to achieve earnings per share growth consistent with our long-term financial model. We have exceeded our growth expectations over the last couple of years, with the acceleration of our store rollout in iconic brand boutiques, expanding faster than we anticipated. All great things for the business.
 To prepare for the next stage of Ulta's growth, we are increasing our investment in a number of areas that will support strong, sustainable growth, while still delivering on our long-term earnings growth expectations. As a result, we expect to achieve EPS growth at the low end of our long-term range of 25% to 30% growth compared to 2012 earnings per share, adjusted for the $0.05 of EPS attributed to the extra week in Q4. Earnings growth will be driven by continued operating margin expansion, offset by approximately $0.13 of earnings per share in incremental investments to maintain the long-term health of our business. We will continue to invest in store growth, in more prestige brand boutiques, in a more robust digital strategy, in our supply chain and systems capabilities and in customer service in our stores to support the rapid growth of our prestige brands in our mix. 
 Let me give you a bit more color on each of these areas of investment. In terms of our new store program, with 25 more stores opening in 2013 compared to 2012, the impact of higher pre-opening expense year-over-year is about $0.02 to $0.03 of earnings per share. The impact of a large number of immature stores, 100 opened in 2012, and 125 opening this year, will also put pressure on the P&L, resulting in $0.02 to $0.03 of deleverage. 
 Turning to our digital strategy, Ulta has a huge growth opportunity in e-commerce, in addition to the need to better integrate our store and online shopping experience. We plan to make a substantial investment in systems to enhance online and mobile capabilities through a complete site redesign, which encompasses improved search capabilities and expanded personalization functions. We'll also make investments in our people and marketing to support hypergrowth in our digital business. The goal is to improve the guest experience, grow sales and improve the integration into the stores. We estimate the impact on the P&L will be approximately $0.03. 
 Moving on to investments in supply chain. To ensure we are positioned to support our continued growth, we need to invest in several areas to maintain an efficient supply chain and continue to provide great guest, store associate and e-commerce experiences. This year, we will be expanding our e-commerce fulfillment capabilities into another of our existing distribution centers. We will also begin to plan for an additional DC to be added to the network in 2014. Included in the additional facility will be an upgrade to our warehouse management system and warehouse control system. New warehouse systems will improve productivity within the supply chain functions and allow Ulta to introduce new multichannel capabilities, such as direct-from-store ordering. These capabilities, combined with future POS software updates, will significantly improve the customer experience across channels. These supply chain changes represent a multiyear investment, and we expect the impact on 2013 earnings per share will be about $0.03. 
 Finally, we will invest in our in-store guest experience. We are planning to invest modestly in store payroll to ensure our guest experience is optimized, as we continue to offer more prestige products requiring more associate knowledge. We expect modesty leverage in store payroll, which will impact the P&L by about $0.02. Turning to capital allocation, we expect capital expenditures for the full year 2013 to be in a range of $225 million, about $36 million higher than our capital program in 2012, driven by 25 additional stores, expansion of our prestige brand boutiques, as well as systems and supply chain investments. Depreciation and amortization are expected to be approximately $105 million. We expect to generate strong free cash flow for the year, and we will continue to evaluate, with our board, the best use of any excess cash. 
 Turning now to the specific guidance for Q1. We are taking a conservative view of the sales environment, which assumes a continuation of the consumer behavior we saw in Q4. With that as a backdrop, let me give you our expectations for the first quarter and then circle back at the end to provide a little more insight into gross profit margin and SG&A. We expect to achieve sales in the range of $568 million to $577 million versus $474.1 million in Q1 of 2012. We expect comparable-store sales to increase in the range of 4% to 6%, including e-commerce. We plan to open 23 new stores versus 18 last year. We expect to achieve earnings per share in the range of $0.60 to $0.63, versus $0.54 in Q1 of 2012. This earnings guidance includes higher store opening expense and investments in systems and supply chain initiatives. It also includes costs associated with the additional Clinique boutiques. As we continue to expand our prestige boutiques, accelerated depreciation and other expenses to prepare to open the Clinique boutiques are expected to cost us about $0.01 of earnings per share in Q1. 
 Gross profit margin is expected to decline 140 basis points at the midpoint of the range. While we will uncharacteristically see gross margins decline in Q1, for the full year, we expect healthy gross margin expansion. SG&A rate is expected to decrease 50 basis points versus last year's 23.4% rate. Operating margin is expected to decrease approximately 90 basis points at the midpoint of the range versus 12.1% last year. The tax rate is expected to be approximately 38.3%. We expect a fully diluted share count of approximately 65 million shares. 
 Going back to profit margin. There are a number of margin challenges specific to Q1. A couple of the larger drivers for Q1 include first, product mix. We planned an Ulta private label gift-with-purchase offer early in Q1, which unfortunately got hung up in U.S. Customs. We quickly substituted a replacement offer, which was successful at driving units, but hurt our margin rate in Q1 by roughly 40 basis points. Second is the large number of immature stores in the base, which will drive 30 basis points of deleverage in fixed store costs versus Q1 of last year. Third, as you know, we transitioned the central region to our ULTAmate Rewards loyalty program at the end of Q1 last year. Our guests love the program and over the long term, ULTAmate Rewards will be a gross margin driver. However, compared to Q1 of last year, the central region change comparison will have a modest negative impact on margin. We are also assuming that customer behavior, focusing on promotion and value, will continue in the near-term. I'll repeat. For the full year, we expect to see healthy gross profit margin expansion. 
 With respect to SG&A, most all of the incremental 2013 investments we described earlier impact the SG&A line. The $0.13 of incremental expense generally flowed evenly throughout the year. While we expect the SG&A as a percentage of net sales to improve in Q1, it will be roughly flat to 2012 for the full year. We have consistently communicated that we are targeting a mid-teens operating margin over the next several years, and that the mix of leverage between gross profit and SG&A would fluctuate over time. We made significant progress toward our operating margin goal in fiscal 2012, and expect to continue to expand operating margin in fiscal 2013. 
 Just to reiterate our long-term view. We remain confident in delivering our long-term financial model based on 4% to 6% comps with 15% to 20% annual square footage growth, yielding 25% to 30% earnings growth and targeting a mid-teens operating margin in the medium term. 
 Now, I'll turn the call back over to Dennis. 
Dennis Eck: Thank you, Scott. I am very comfortable with our outlook for 2013. The Board of Directors and I work closely with the entire Ulta team to review and approve the plans for 2013. There have been no changes to the budget as presented to the board at the end of last year. We expect -- continue to derive market share gains and robust earnings growth. This is balanced with the need to invest in the long-term growth of this company. I am very proud of Ulta's 2012 performance and in each of our 16,000 associates for a compelling experience for our guests. We are managing our business for the long term, and we are making the right investments to support our vibrant growth story over many years to come. 
 With that, operator, please open up the call for questions. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Daniel Hofkin from William Blair & Company. 
Daniel Hofkin: Just a couple questions first on the selling environment. You, obviously, finished up the fourth quarter a bit on an upswing. I'm just curious, I know you're not a monthly reporter, but baked into your guidance, have you seen any choppiness recently, similar to what some other retailers have talked about the last month or so? And how much is that informed your guidance? That's my first question. 
Scott Settersten: Dan, yes. Again, back to our prepared remarks. The choppiness we saw in the fourth quarter and the increasing take on our promotions and coupons, we've seen that continue into the early stages of the first quarter. So again, when we put our guidance estimates together, we consider all the elements of the current environment that we're experiencing. So you can rest assured that all of that is baked into our current thoughts. 
Daniel Hofkin: Okay, is there anything baked in, for -- in terms of your full year view for the potential comp benefit from the accelerated pace of store growth that really kicked in around the middle of 2012? 
Scott Settersten: Yes. Again, we take a very disciplined, detailed look at the way those new stores are stacked up. Again, we discussed that in the past with many of you. So we are very clear and understand what the impact is, and that again, that's baked into our full year view. 
Daniel Hofkin: I mean, to some degree, does that imply some -- you're expecting some further deceleration, excluding that? 
Scott Settersten: Further deceleration in the comp? 
Daniel Hofkin: In the comp. Because to some degree, wouldn't that benefit only show up in the second half of the year, the benefit from the accelerated store growth? 
Scott Settersten: Well, we look at the comp for the -- for any particular quarter for the full year. We're baking in a lot of different elements, not just the new store ramp or the, how the model stacks up in future periods. So we have to take into effect or into account what the customer's feeling, and how we're seeing them react to our ads and our promotions and take the total picture into account. And obviously, that impacts the older stores as well. Everything's that in the comp base, not just the new stores rolling into it. 
Daniel Hofkin: Okay, where have you seen the most in to -- and is it more response to gift-with-purchase on prestige offers? Is it in some of the mass brands, in terms of greater offtake of sharply price promoted product? Where are you -- is that a -- some color on that? 
Scott Settersten: We really -- we haven't seen any trade down in the customer. Again, for the comp during the fourth quarter was evenly split between traffic and average ticket. That's a little bit unusual compared to our normal trend, which is primarily traffic driven to the stores, driving the comp. We see the customer, just -- there's just a greater take. They're really capitalizing on the promotions when they're out there. They're taking great advantage of that. More so than they had in the fourth quarters or holiday seasons over the last couple of years. 
Daniel Hofkin: And competitively, is there anything that you've seen change in that regard, either e-commerce or other brick-and-mortar wise? 
Scott Settersten: We haven't noticed. We keep an eye on our competitors across-the-board. There's a lot of them out there, in a lot of different categories. We haven't noticed any major changes in their competitive environment. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Neely Tamminga from Piper Jaffray. 
Neely Tamminga: I had some clarification questions for Janet, if I may. Janet, I think it's a huge deal what's going on here with you guys getting exclusive for OPI on dot com. I'd love to hear from your perspective, what -- how OPI approached that with you, and what it is about the nature of your relationship that you think allowed you to get that exclusivity. And then, just some clarification on the number of doors. How many doors are you planning for Perricone for this year? And then, I don't think we actually heard the official door count for the new Clinique doors in 2013. That would be helpful. And one final follow-up, just on the merchandising side here, would be pricing on salon. You're rolling out a new menu. Is your pricing on salon actually going to go higher? 
Janet Taake: Neely, thank you for the questions. OPI, we've had a very long relationship and a very solid relationship with OPI. It goes back from the very beginning of Ulta, and we were very pleased that we were able to launch exclusively and approved to the OPI online, and that was done with great partnership with George Saber [ph], the principal of -- the starter and owner of Ulta, or excuse me, OPI prior to Cody [ph] owning it. That's -- we're very, very pleased and excited to have it online. Perricone is rolling to all doors, and that will be in the next several weeks. You will see it in all of our doors. We're very excited about that as well. And Clinique, we did not mention how many doors we're expanding to in 2013. We are still finalizing that with Clinique. And we're very, very pleased to continue the expansion, and we will have more information on that later on this year. But we have opened 6 already this quarter. So we're expanding as we speak. 
Neely Tamminga: And in terms of salon pricing, Janet? 
Janet Taake: The salon pricing. It's really just trends. What we're introducing right now is really more trend and color, but the pricing has not changed. Color and cut are really the heartbeat of the salon business. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Brian Tunick from JP Morgan. 
Brian Tunick: Yes, two questions. I guess maybe for Scott, just as you give your comp view for 2013, and as you just ended the year, anything you can share in regards to maybe comps by class of store for 2012. Just curious what's happening to the more mature stores and if that's having any influence on what people will view as a conservative comp guide? And then maybe Dennis could share his thoughts on the CEO search. Obviously, you have a lot of projects going on in 2013. So what's your thoughts on timing, how long it might take to have a CEO? And maybe what the ideal candidate, in your view, would bring to the table? 
Scott Settersten: Brian, I'll take the comp item first. Again, looking back at Q4 and 2012 as a whole, we reported an 8 comp for the fourth quarter and 8 8 for the full year. So when you go back and look at the individual classes, they're all contributing in a solid, positive manner. I mean the new stores are doing very well, at or above targets, and some of the older stores are still contributing in a very solid level. Looking forward to Q1, again, based on what the consumer environment we fill and the choppiness we've seen, Q4 into Q1, we just feel it's best to take a conservative view of what the future holds for us. 
Dennis Eck: Okay, then I'll take on the CEO question. You saw in the announcement that we announced that we had a selected a search firm. We have a spec that we're working against. There will be a step where they come in and have a conversation with SVPs of the business just to get an understanding of the strength of the team that we have here. And as I've become more involved with the day-to-day, we've indicated earlier that we had a great sense of confidence in the Ulta management and their ability to execute the plans as they've laid them out. And that's increased as I've been here. So we would like to move as quickly as possible, but that said, we're incredibly focused on getting the right person to commit to Ulta because we have so many good things going. We have plans that we're driving forward. We're really looking for someone who could come in and as seamlessly as possible just lead us to the next iteration, the next generation of Ulta, and that's our goal. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Matt Fassler from Goldman Sachs. 
Matthew Fassler: A couple of questions about growth. I guess, first of all, to sum it up, what's the hurry, in terms of accelerating to 22% unit growth? I know this decision was made recently. It seems like it's straining the financial model to some degree. You don't have a direct competitor essentially chasing you. And then, this is really directed, Dennis, to you, and to the board as well as to the management team, because I know it's a group decision. So given that the P&L or at least its -- the trajectory of the P&L is feeling a bit of stress related to this growth at least relative to recent earnings growth rates, why the need to go above 20% from a unit perspective? 
Dennis Eck: I think is the board looks at the ways that we can deploy the cash that we're generating from the business. We look at the ability to open new stores with a really high degree of certainty that they're going to perform, because we've -- our real estate group and our operations group have delivered that. So we see this as really a chance for us to continue to use our strong balance sheet to move quickly, and Alex might want to make a comment about the fact that there are a lot of opportunities that are coming forward. And we want to make sure that we're taking those opportunities so we get the right locations for the future. 
Alex Lelli: That's true, Dennis. So we are finding that with the repositionings that's taking place with other retailers, in terms of their downsizing and closing and some vacancies that have occurred over the course of the last couple of years, that this is an opportunity to get into top-notch real estate locations that are successful on a traditional basis. And it's an opportunity to get in after the fact, so to speak, and get to play into game that has existed on some of these intersections for several years. So it's an opportunity to move quickly right now, when we have no particular competition of great note for the space that we're interested in. 
Matthew Fassler: Do you think you will have more competition? And do you worry about cotenants who risk as you make these moves? 
Janet Taake: We couldn't hear you very well, Matt. Can you repeat that? 
Matthew Fassler: Sure, sorry. Are you concerned about having more competition for this space a year or two out? And are you concerned at all about cotenancy, given some of the retail store closures that we've seen from some of your peers and other sub-sectors? 
Alex Lelli: Well, there is downsizing taking place amongst some other bigger boxes that will provide some competition for the same size box that we're interested in. But our preferential treatment, so to speak, based on the attractiveness of our offering, is giving us primary attention from the landlord. So there could be competition in the future, but I think at this point in time, we're eliminating that by moving quickly into the space as it becomes available. 
Matthew Fassler: Got it. That's very helpful, and just a quick follow-up. On the rhetoric of the investments, as you itemized, the allocation of investment dollars, differ. Items like payroll and some of the prestige buildouts, all of which I think are sort of part of the ongoing plan of our end of the business day-to-day. So if you could just clarify on what way these are really extraordinary investments, as opposed to sort of a cost of doing business on an ongoing basis? 
Scott Settersten: Well, I guess to your point, Matt, your perspective on whether it's a normal cost of business or not, what we want to make sure that's clear to folks, is that it's an incremental spend over what you -- what was reflected in our P&L last year. So in the case of the store payroll and trying to improve the guest experience, the $0.02 that we mentioned there or the 10 basis points deleverage we'll see in the P&L is incremental to last year, and there's a good reason for it. It's trying to improve the in-store experience. E-commerce, we got a functional site today that we're able to transact business on. But we're a long way from best-in-class type of environment out there. So we need to go back in, we feel we -- this is the point in time we need to redesign the site and get some of the other functionality things really resolved. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Erika Maschmeyer from Robert W. Baird. 
Erika Maschmeyer: Could you talk a bit about what you're looking for with the ULTAmate Rewards program before rolling it out further? Is this a margin hit, what you're [indiscernible] came out the most, and is it possible you could tweak the program before expanding it? I guess sort of any color there would be helpful. 
Jeffrey Severts: Erika, this is Jeff. So as you know, we have the luxury of having 2 great programs with the old Beauty Club in half the country and ULTAmate Rewards in the central region. So we have the luxury of taking our time and getting this decision right, and that's why we're talking about getting a full annual cycle of customer behavioral data before we determine the shape and the timing of the conversions. The other practical reason for getting that full annual cycle of data is that it will better allow us to forecast our business when make that conversion. Because the shape of the customer's engagement in the program is a bit different. The old program pushes all the redemption into a couple of weeks within the quarter. The new program tends to spread that redemption out across the total quarter. So having more time to watch how she engages with this program, we think is going to let us make smarter decisions for the launch and help us better forecast our business. 
Erika Maschmeyer: That's helpful. And then for Janet, kind of a follow-up to Neely's question. I mean, one of the fears that's out there, that the management turnover could stall the expansion of adding prestige brands. How would you respond to that? And then, could you walk us through the various relationship points that Ulta has with new brands, existing brands? And can you talk about where the relationship lie? 
Janet Taake: Well, I will just tell you that our relationships with all of our vendors are very, very strong, and we continue to improve every day on looking at brands we want to bring in and reaching out to those vendors. So our relationships are very solid. My merchant team and I continue to work on that. I think that the vendor community is very appreciative of our ethics and our straightforward partnership that we have in the marketplace. And that we're a growth retailer and we continue to introduce newness to our stores and to our guests, most importantly, and they want to be a part of that. But we have very, very strong vendor relationships. 
Erika Maschmeyer: Okay great, and Scott, could you quickly clarify the -- on the past, you guys have provided some additional color on the breakout, basis-point-wise between a past fixed store leverage, fixed store comps leverage on the supply chain and merchandise margins? 
Scott Settersten: For what period are you referring to? 
Erika Maschmeyer: For Q4. And then if you could talk about how you expect that to play out, that would be helpful as well. 
Scott Settersten: Yes, well, at Q4 2012, the margin improvement was merely driven by fixed store cost leverage. Again, I think I mentioned in our prepared remarks that merchandise margin was weaker during fourth quarter. That kind of held us back from where we expected to be for the quarter. As we look to next year, again Q1 kind of prevents a type of perfect storm, as far as merchandise margin is concerned. So again, we are facing some challenges there. We do expect that the drivers in Q1 will have largely abate or will become more moderate as we go into Qs 2 through 4. So we do expect merchandise margin, we do expect leverage there in the back half of the year. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Gary Balter from Crédit Suisse. 
Simeon Gutman: This is Simeon Gutman for Gary. Scott, first following up on gross margins on Q4. It was still a little below trend. I think you mentioned the merchandise came in a little light. If you can share a little more color on that. And then, the second part, Scott, just to paraphrase what you said, if the investment spend, the incremental investment spending is spread evenly across next year, then it's just really a gross margin issue in the first quarter, and that gross margin issue technically goes away and therefore, that's what the acceleration in the EBIT and EPS growth is explained by? 
Scott Settersten: Now let me take the first one on Q4. Again, just to refresh everyone's memory, Q4 historically has been our most challenging quarter to try to expand gross profit margin. Again and, we compete with all other retailers out there for the gift giving space, the promotional environment's a lot more aggressive during Q4 than it is the rest of the year. And what we saw in 2012 during the holiday was just a bit more of a challenge than it has been in recent years. That's what drove some of the weakness in merchandise margin. As far as looking at 2013, yes, again, I'd reiterate the investments deuce, kind of rolled smoothly throughout the course of the year, and we do expect to see merchandise margin expansion after we get past Q1. We've generated positive operating margin expansion in 2012 and then we expect to do that again in 2013. 
Gary Balter: This is Gary. Let me just, as a follow-up. Because we've seen now a few companies, not just you guys, but others that have said we're increasing our investment spend, and that's going to have an impact on earnings. And how do we think about that over the longer term? Because obviously, you're always investing for the future. So why is this investment spend something that wasn't spent last year? And what does it imply for future years? Like how should we build that into the model? 
Scott Settersten: Let say, if I look at the laundry list, Gary, in new stores, the $0.05 -- $0.05 or $0.06 in total there that we're talking about, again, is something yet to be determined. We're not -- we haven't decided on what the 2014 new store plan looks like. As far as e-comm is concerned, I would say that our 2013 investment represents a fairly large portion of what we think we would need to put into that element of the business here over the medium term. When it comes to supply chain, I would characterize that as sort of a down payment. The $0.03 we're talking about this year, really relates to kind of the investigation process and trying to figure out exactly what it is we want to build. So there'll be more pets [ph], primarily expense this year. The capital will follow on top of that, the back half of 2013 into '14. So we'll give you more color on that when we get closer to figuring out what that looks like. 
Simeon Gutman: And just one more back to gross margin, this is Simeon again. Some of the Q1 headwinds, you mentioned the product mix with purchase, I mean the mix -- gift-with-purchase, that we can get and can go away. The large number of an immature stores, I mean, last year you had a big step up versus the prior year and I guess this year, we're only going to see more. So why does that abate? And then, to rewards program impact, I take it that means you're not going to be putting more regions on the rewards program as the year progresses? 
Scott Settersten: Fixed store cost, deleverage, you're correct, that, that's going to be a headwind for the majority of the year. It's a fairly large bucket in first quarter. We want to just remind folks of that. The loyalty program, I will say the customers love the program;, we love the program. The cost is not necessarily going to be an inhibitor on whether we move forward with that or not. To Jeff's point, we just want to make sure we understand how the guest is going to react to this over a full cycle so that we can predict with certainty what the future's going to hold there. 
Simeon Gutman: Okay, and then one final question for Janet, if I can sneak it in. If you look, and you've done -- the company's done a great job adding and winning these brands, and if you look at, collectively, all the brands that you carry, how much of the prestige market do you think those represent? And that's not asking what Ulta's share is, but just more of, of all the brands that you represent, how much of the market are you looking at? And then much more is, obviously, left to go? 
Janet Taake: That's a very broad market and if you're speaking just the prestige color, is that what you're referring to? 
Simeon Gutman: Yes. 
Janet Taake: It's very -- there's more to come. We have grown the portfolio considerably over the last several years, but there are many brands that we would still love to have in our home. So as I said before, we continue to evaluate the productivity and look for new brands and have conversations on an ongoing basis, but there's a large space still. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Evren Kopelman from Wells Fargo. 
Evren Kopelman: Scott, I think I heard you say in the fourth quarter the comp, the ticket traffic was more balanced. If that's right, the ticket maybe contributed four points. I was a little surprised to hear that because of the higher uptake on coupons you mentioned and the promotional environment in Q4. Can you give us a little more color, what drove that ticket? 
Scott Settersten: Yes. You're right, that is what I've said, that the comp was driven equally by traffic and by ticket. In the fourth quarter, we saw average selling place was up a little bit. Units were flat, so really, that's what was driving the ticket side of it. Again, we've seen this vary quarter-to-quarter over the long term, Evren. Over the long term, we expect traffic to be the major driver of the comp, and it does vary quarter-to-quarter, depending exactly on what we're promoting in our circulars and magalogs. 
Evren Kopelman: Okay. That's helpful. And then on the store maturation, I guess model that you had shared, the 5-year, how the stores mature, do you -- would you expect any of that to change in now that you're opening a lot more stores? 
Scott Settersten: I'm thinking back through the store model here. I'm just putting it through my imagination here. I don't foresee any major changes in how those stores stack up. I mean, they're still -- the model that we've posted is still the model that we're following. The stores again, the new stores are still performing very well. First year sales are at or above our targets. There's some minor variance in some of the CapEx numbers that we have in the model, but it doesn't have any material effect on what the overall payback is on a cash on cash basis over the model term. 
Evren Kopelman: So there's the sales growth rates in a year 2 or 3, those will remain within the, I guess numbers that you've shared in the past, you think, then? 
Scott Settersten: We're still -- again, based on what we've seen through fiscal 2012, those numbers still hold up. 
Evren Kopelman: Okay, and then lastly, I wanted to ask on brands, big brands like the Lancome and Clinique, in the stores that you have them, I mean, what kind of impact should we expect on the traffic or the comp from the introduction of such a large brands and kind of the boutiques in these stores? If you can give us any help in picturing what kind of lift that has, that would be great. 
Scott Settersten: Evren, where we're still, really in the early stages of implementing or rolling out the Clinique boutiques. So while we feel comfortable and confident that it's going to help the total box, it's going help the comp over the long term, it's really not a significant impact at this point in time. Again, as we look at 2013, Janet mentioned that the advancement of that is going to be split between new stores and comp stores, fairly evenly. So again, there won't be as large an impact on the comps. Some of that's going to be in the non-comp or new store bucket. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Irwin Boruchow from Sterne Agee. 
Ike Boruchow, Jr.: I actually have 2 quick questions. So we've heard a lot of questions about how the new stores are kind of hitting the maturity curve profile and things like that. I'm actually curious more about the more mature stores, the stores that are 6, 7, 8 years old. Are you seeing any change there, are those stores comp-ing? I think you'd mentioned over the last 12 months they were still comp-ing, low to mid- single digits. Just curious, any change with the more mature store footprint you have? And then, the second question is, I think you stated that you expect similar impact on the SG&A line from investments throughout the year in each quarter? But you're guiding a 4% to 6% comp and 50 bps of leverage in Q1, and also a 4% to 6% comp for the year, but implying deleverage for the remaining 3 quarters. So just -- can you kind of walk us through why the leverage had turned to deleverage on similar top line, Q2 through Q4, versus Q1? 
Scott Settersten: As far as the comp lead is concerned, again, through the end of 2012, we haven't seen any change in the way those old stores are maturing or producing. Again, still low single digits overall for some of the oldest stores. As far as the deleverage points go in 2013, again, I think it's more of a timing thing, on what we see when some of those -- how those investments play against some of the other things we're doing in the business. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Joe Altobello from Oppenheimer & Co. 
Joseph Altobello: Two quick points of clarification. I guess, Scott, first in terms of gross margin, you mentioned obviously down pretty significantly in the first quarter, and then up for the year. Are you guys assuming that the customer focus on value dissipates throughout the year, or the other drivers you're talking about really going to offset that? 
Scott Settersten: Yes, it's -- we're not assuming any change in consumer behavior. It's some of the other things that I mentioned, the mix item in the first quarter, just some other smaller things. Again, when you add up a bunch of small numbers, they kind of turn into something, but we don't want to get into all the details of it. So again, it's merchandise margin, deleverage in the first quarter, but course correcting as we get deeper into the year. 
Joseph Altobello: Okay and then secondly, in terms of the investments you're making this year, is it fair to characterize some of those as catch-up investments, or it's just that, the fact that, that because of the timing of them, that they tend to be somewhat lumpy? 
Scott Settersten: Each one has a slightly different story, Joe. The supply chain, when you look at that one specifically, for example, why we opened up Chambersburg, D.C. earlier this year, we're very happy with the productivity there. That decision was made 2-plus years ago. So since that point in time, a lot of things have changed. We've accelerated the store program, the dot com business, we're kind of breaking out at the seams here in Romeoville. So it seemed like the proper time to a little bit more whiteboarding and kind of figure out what the long-term answer is there. So that's kind of what's driving that one. As far as e-commerce is concerned, we've been making investments there, to earlier points here. What we're looking at this year is a significant step up in that. 
Joseph Altobello: Okay. Just one last one, and I apologize, this is a bit unfair for you guys, but you talked about the potential uses of cash, my screen, you're stocks at a bit of $75.10. Any thoughts to repurchases? 
Scott Settersten: Well, we ended the year with roughly $320 million of cash on the balance sheet. Not all of that is excess cash, right? We need some here to run the businesses by way of working capital. Management and the board continuously assesses the best use of excess cash. Always with an eye on what provides the best return for shareholders. So, rest assured that, that we're watching out to see what the best use is. 
Dennis Eck: We've had that conversation on an ongoing basis between the board and the management. 
Operator: Our next question comes from David Wu from Telsey Advisory Group. 
David Wu: In terms of the retail expansion, obviously, you continue to open up many of your stores and power centers and was wondering if you're starting to shift perhaps more of your openings toward mall-based locations? And what you think the opportunity there is? And if the profitability dynamics are different from the power centers? 
Dennis Eck: We have already several mall stores in our portfolio and we expect to continue to add additional in-mall locations when it makes strategic and financial sense. We'll look at quality malls with high occupancies, solvent anchor tenants and good population density. Our preference however, still remains with big-box power centers, best of the breed co-tenants. The performance of our mall stores to date have been very good, and we continue to be very strategic and scrutinize those locations carefully to continue to maintain that excellent performance. 
David Wu: And would you say the 4-wall profitability are pretty similar as the power centers? 
Dennis Eck: Yes. In fact, in some cases, we're seeing an improved profitability, and I think a lot of that has to do with our heavy scrutiny of the site selection process when we do go into malls. 
David Wu: Great. And in terms of marketing, can you perhaps talk about your ad spending plans for the year? And if you're planning to allocate the marketing mix differently from last year. I mean, it looks like you're doing a little bit more TV with the partnership with The Face, and want to know whether you've seen some good sales traction with some of these new initiatives? 
Jeffrey Severts: This is Jeff. In terms of marketing, we're looking to build on what's been so successful for us, which at the heart, is our direct mail marketing capability and our loyalty programs. And, but as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, the real opportunity is around penetration. So we're looking to add on top of what we do so well, marketing efforts oriented at reaching some of these customers who just aren't terribly familiar with the brand or in some cases, have never heard of us. So that doesn't mean more spending per se. That opportunity is afforded us by the increased scale that we're enjoying here as we grow. So we keep what we've got, we refine it, but now we're able to layer on this group of efforts against trying to get new customers into this tremendous loyalty machine we have. 
David Wu: And then just lastly, just for clarification on the promotions, is -- would you say sort of the gross margin impact, how much of it is tied to sort of the increase in the level or number of promotions and coupons versus last year, versus sort of consumers just choosing to buy a more discounted product. Is there a sort the way to parse that out? 
Janet Taake: We didn't add any promotions in the quarter, but it would be that they're really enjoying the advantage of coupons and taking advantage of the promotions of the store. But we did not add any additional promotions on top of last year's calendar. 
David Wu: And in term -- in coupons as well? 
Janet Taake: Yes. Coupons is part of our mailers and our tabs, yes. 
Operator: Our last question is coming from Jason Gere from RBC Capital Markets. 
Jack Kindregan: This is Jack Kindregan on for Jason. I was just wondering if you could clarify the -- in terms of your expansion, the leases you've already signed, you have focused more on, more urban versus suburban markets there? 
Alex Lelli: Our focus is more oriented towards suburban markets. And 75% of our sites are located in existing markets. 
Operator: I'll now turn the floor back over to Scott Settersten for our closing comments. 
Scott Settersten: I'd like to say thank you all for your interest in Ulta, and we look forward to speaking with you all soon. 
Operator: This does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.

===== 2012 Q3  (2012-11-29 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Greetings, and welcome to the Ulta Beauty Fiscal Third Quarter 2012 Earnings Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Laurel Lefebvre for Ulta Beauty. Thank you. You may now begin. 
Laurel Lefebvre: Thank you. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us for Ulta's third quarter 2012 conference call. Hosting our call are Chuck Rubin, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Scott Settersten, Chief Financial Officer. 
 Before we begin, I'd like to remind you of the company's safe harbor language. The statements contained in this conference call which are not historical facts may be deemed to constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual future results may differ materially from those projected in such statements due to a number of risks and uncertainties, all of which are described in the company's filings with the SEC. 
 We may make references during this call to the metric free cash flow, a non-GAAP financial measure defined as cash provided by operating activities minus purchase of property and equipment.
 With that, I'll turn the call over to Chuck. 
Carl Rubin: Thanks, Laurel. Good afternoon, everyone. I'm pleased to announced very strong third quarter results. Ulta continues to drive significant market share gains across all of our categories as we delivered 22.4% top line growth. Same-store sales increased 8.4%, maintaining solid top line momentum, lapping a 9.6% comp in Q3 2011 and a 12.2% comp in 2010. We expanded gross margin and leveraged SG&A more than expected, driving operating margin up 140 basis points from 10.7% in Q3 of last year to 12.1% this year. Earnings grew 40% to $0.59 per share. 
 These excellent results position us to deliver sales and earnings performance for the full year well above our initial expectations. At the beginning of the year, we expected to see same-store sales at or slightly above 5% and to achieve earnings per share growth of approximately 30%. We now expect to achieve about 8% comp growth and about 40% earnings growth for 2012, assuming we achieve the midpoint of our Q4 guidance. 
 We delivered these numbers through our team's disciplined focus on the 5 components of our multiyear growth strategy: accelerating store growth; introducing new products, services and brands; enhancing our loyalty program; broadening our marketing reach; and increasing our digital focus, including ulta.com. Our consistent execution of these strategies continues to drive meaningful market share gains in the beauty industry across all of our major product categories. I'd like to recap a couple of our accomplishments in each of these 5 areas during the third quarter and touch on what's ahead for the fourth quarter. 
 First, store growth. In Q3, we opened 49 new stores, representing about 10% of our store base, which is a record number of new store openings for us and a tremendous accomplishment in a single quarter. We ended Q3 with 537 stores in 45 states. New store productivity continues to be very strong with the class of 2012 stores consistently outperforming their targets. So we're very pleased with the quality of real estate we've added to the portfolio and proud of the Ulta team's execution in getting new stores opened. 
 We also completed 11 remodels during the third quarter and also are happy with their performance. With about 90% of the chain opened or remodeled to our most recent store formats, we've done a nice job keeping the portfolio updated and the shopping environment and experience very consistent throughout the chain. 
 In the first month of the fourth quarter, we opened 13 additional stores, successfully completing our 2012 new store program. With these, we will end the year with 550 stores for a 23% square footage increase for the year. 
 As we have said many times, our real estate expansion is predicated on finding great financially attractive sites. Simply put, we will not sacrifice quality for quantity. We do, however, have strong financial and operational capabilities that allow us to accelerate store growth if we believe the right opportunities exist. 
 Looking ahead to 2013, that opportunity does exist, and we expect next year to be another year where we can exceed our long-term goal of 15% to 20% square footage growth. More specifically, we are currently planning to open approximately 125 new stores in 2013 or about 22% square footage growth. This program will look a lot like 2012 -- like the 2012 plan in terms of opening stores primarily located in suburban shopping centers, with roughly 80% of the stores in existing centers as opposed to new shopping center development. We are confident that we have the resources and expertise to execute this aggressive new store program successfully without relaxing our high standards for the quality of the real estate, yet maintaining our high standards for store staffing and training. 
 Our second key growth strategy is adding new products, services and brands. Newness has been and will remain a key driver of our growth. We continue to see a strong pipeline of innovation in the beauty market. We're also benefiting from the introduction of new brands as well as new product lines within existing brands into our assortment. 
 In terms of brands, we launched in Q3 new skin care lines from Vichy and La Roche-Posay rolled out to all stores, and we expanded our exclusive CK One cosmetics line to 178 stores during the quarter. We also launched Khroma Cosmetics from the Kardashians and the skincare brand Nip + Fab on the mass side of our offering. 
 To update you on the expansion of Clinique and Lancôme boutiques, which was announced previously, our teams completed all of the 50 additional Lancôme boutiques by the close of the third quarter, ending Q3 with a total of 79 Lancôme doors. We completed 29 additional Clinique boutiques, bringing the total to 42 doors at the end of Q3. We just opened an additional Clinique boutique early in Q4 and have another 5 planned for early in the new fiscal year. 
 Execution by the team on all aspects of the implementation from fixturing to recruiting to training was exceptional, and we are very pleased to have the vast majority of these new boutiques ready to go before the holiday season. We view these iconic brands as a great addition to our prestige skincare and cosmetics offering. As with any new initiative, these boutiques will take time to ramp up, and we expect that they will be long-term positive impacts on our guest experience. 
 During the third quarter, trends in antiaging, mascara, lipstick and foundations continued to be strong. Several brands' foundation launches performed especially well, including bareMinerals' READY Foundation, Urban Decay's Naked Skin and Stila's Stay All Day Foundation. 
 The skincare category overall also saw a good growth, and our guests remained very interested in the high-tech beauty tools category for at-home micro-dermabrasion, acne and wrinkle treatment and hair removal. Clarisonic continued to outperform, with new colors and special editions for men and acne treatment reaching new customer segments. 
 In terms of new brands for Q4, we will launch a new chemical- and cruelty-free line of body care products from the brand Nourish. This certified organic brand expands our assortment of organic products that our guests are increasingly asking for. 
 We will also add some exclusive to Ulta products from existing brands we carry. For example, Amp 2, an instant volume texturizer from the brand Living Proof, will be exclusively available at Ulta for several months. Living Proof is currently in the limelight with the recent news that Jennifer Aniston became the spokesperson and face of the brand. 
 In the hair appliance category, we are introducing an exclusive Ulta version of the ghd luxury flat iron, the #1 selling flat iron in Europe, and a new assortment of Ultra CHI hair tools featuring exclusive holiday patterns. 
 In prestige cosmetics, some of the new products we're excited about include the Vice Eyeshadow Palette from Urban Decay and a special bareMinerals kit exclusive to Ulta, which commemorates Ulta's 10-year partnership with bareMinerals. 
 In the nail category, OPI's latest nail polish collection, Skyfall, recently launched and has been off to a strong start. 
 While these are all great additions to our assortment, key focus in Q4 is obviously the holiday season. Our stores are set for the holidays with a dominant in-store presentation with improved signage and holiday gifts featured throughout the stores and online. This year, we've made it even easier to find the perfect gift at Ulta with a terrific assortment of fragrances, gift sets and stocking stuffers, many of them exclusive to Ulta. 
 To give you a sense of fragrance, last year, we talked -- last quarter rather, we talked about the impressive number of fragrance launches in Q3, including Marc Jacobs Dot and COACH Poppy Blossom, just to name a couple. A strong assortment of new fragrances prepares us well for the upcoming holiday season when this category takes center stage for gift giving, supported, of course, by our compelling gift with purchase offers for fragrance. This year, we will offer 2 GWPs. Running now is a fun 4-piece martini pitcher and glassware set, and starting shortly is our now famous luxury robe GWP. 
 We also have a great assortment of holiday gift sets from all of our prestige cosmetic brands across a wide range of price points. In fact, we have over 120 holiday gift sets, many exclusive to Ulta, offering great fashion at great value. A holiday tradition at Ulta, our private label Blockbuster color cosmetic kits, branded this year Beauty Gems, are attractively packaged gift sets that offer great value and are expected to be some of our hottest selling items during the holidays. 
 We're also a great destination for stocking stuffers with our 5 for $5 and 5 for $10 mix-and-match offering, Body Shop giftables and Ulta holiday bath collection. 
 In summary, we're very pleased with our -- both our holiday merchandise offering and inventory levels this year. As you read in our press release, we made some strategic investments in core inventory to ensure a great guest experience throughout the holiday season and into the new year. Scott will get into more detail on the financial impact of this investment in a moment. 
 Turning to our services business. Salon sales were solid in the third quarter, driven by customer acquisition and retention with compelling offers. Our salon comps were below the overall comp, but very strong competitively. Our fall/winter trend collection, which feature the newest looks in hairstyles and color and showcased our salon associates' expertise, has been very well received. 
 In Q4, the salon business will continue to drive performance with cut and color offers; promotions to drive awareness in trial, like our free updo promotion; and special offers for our OPI gel nail service and mini-facials. We will continue to expand our micro-dermabrasion service and high-quality hair extension service. Both of these are available in about 200 stores today, with plans for further rollout into 2013. 
 Next, let me update you on our third growth strategy, enhancing our loyalty program. We currently boast 10.5 million active loyal customers -- active loyalty customers, up about 20% compared to 1 year ago. Our loyalty programs continue to fuel our very successful direct marketing programs, with a long-term goal of driving higher share of our guests' beauty spend. 
 Late in the third quarter, we implemented the first phase of our new CRM solution. This tool will help us mine the rich customer data in our loyalty member database and over time assist in the greater personalization of our marketing. As I've said, this is a significant long-term opportunity for us, which will deliver multiyear benefits as we build on our skills and personalizing our communications in an increasingly sophisticated way. 
 In the fourth quarter, we will begin to utilize this new CRM solution to better target our guests, including birthday e-mails and grand opening notifications and communications designed to incent our guest to achieve platinum status in our rewards program. 
 Moving on to our fourth growth strategy, broadening our marketing reach. While we continue to grow our business through our highly effective direct marketing approach, at the same time, we are expanding our marketing efforts to drive traffic and strengthen our positioning as a beauty and trend authority. Third quarter highlights included our partnership with Allure magazine to create a special 13th issue exclusively for Ulta. Publication was available only at our stores and was highly regarded in the industry for its high quality editorial content. 
 In September, we promoted our 21 Days of Beauty event, focused on prestige brand in skincare and cosmetics. We offer daily beauty steals to drive traffic and repeat visits, often featuring new or exclusive products and kits. We offer our 21 Days of Beauty promotion twice a year, and this most recent one has been our most successful event yet. 
 In October, our teams went all out to support the Breast Cancer Research Foundation, which is Ulta's focus charity. The campaign included a month-long sale of logo-ed product to raise funds for the BCRF and salon events featuring free haircuts and free skincare treatments with a donation to the BCRF. 
 On the media and public relations side, our team executed several high profile activities in Q3 to put the spotlight on the Ulta brand, including events around Fashion Week and our Donate With a Kiss campaign in support of the Breast Cancer Research Foundation. 
 In September, Ulta Beauty was announced as the cosmetic sponsor of The Face, a new modeling competition reality TV series set to debut this February on the Oxygen Network. The show features supermodel coaches Naomi Campbell and Karolina Kurkova. The winner of the series will become the newest face of Ulta Beauty in ads and promotions during the fall and holiday seasons next year. 
 Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, our marketing focus will shift to position Ulta as a destination for holiday shopping. We'll communicate our assortment of great gifts offered at a wide range of price points, as well as a focus on our fragrance offering in very popular gift with purchase programs I mentioned earlier. 
 On the PR side, we started out Q4 with a fun segment on Shark Tank, the ABC television series watched by more than 6 million viewers. The show featured NailPak, an innovative portable nail product that one of the sharks invested in, which is now sold at Ulta stores and online. 
 The fifth growth strategy is our digital focus, including ulta.com. In Q3, we continued to see rapid growth in online sales as our promotions, including our successful limited time beauty breaks, and improvements to our site's content continued to drive traffic and conversion. A great example of our enhanced content is the -- are the videos hosted on the site in conjunction with our integrated fall beauty preview campaign, which we did in partnership with Condé Nast. How to tutorials from Allure, Glamour, Lucky, SELF and Teen Vogue brought to life each of the featured looks or trends. 
 On the technology side, we deployed our first Apple and Android mobile apps in October. We also deployed new capabilities related to e-gift cards and enhanced our social media presence by enabling Pinterest. We also focused on making sure the website is ready for the high volumes of orders we expect during the holiday season by improving overall page load times. 
 For Q4, we plan to improve our digital abilities to recommend relevant products to our guests and to continue to refine our e-mail targeting capability by leveraging our new CRM tool. For Cyber Monday, we more than doubled the amount of exclusive deals and drove our biggest ever Cyber Monday sales performance. Our commitment to execute our digital strategy positions us to continuously improve the overall guest experience. 
 In summary, we continue to make significant strides in our 5 key growth initiatives, with a lot of opportunity ahead for each one of them. We believe this comprehensive and focused strategy, combined with consistent execution, will drive sustainable share gains and strong sales and profit growth in the quarters and years to come. 
 Before I turn the call over to our CFO Scott Settersten, I'd like to touch on the topic of our CFO search. We are extremely fortunate to have Scott, a seasoned finance executive with more than 7 years of tenure with Ulta, step into the CFO role. I have complete confidence in Scott and his ability to lead the finance team and to be a great partner to me and the rest of the senior leadership team. We have relaunched our CFO search, for which Scott is clearly a very strong candidate. But with the demands of the business during the holiday season and the obvious challenges of recruiting at this time of year, frankly, I don't expect a lot of activity before the new year. Because of Scott's knowledge of the company, expertise and leadership, we are highly confident we won't miss a beat during this time. 
 And with that, I'll ask Scott to get into a more detailed discussion on our financial results. 
Scott Settersten: Thanks, Chuck. Good afternoon, everyone. Ulta's third quarter results were once again driven by strong top line growth, coupled with operating margin improvement. Total sales increased 22% to $506 million, with strength across all categories. Same-store sales increased 8.4%, on top of a 9.6% comp in Q3 of last year. Traffic was the major driver of the comp, representing more than 90%, with average ticket up slightly. 
 Gross profit dollars increased 24% to $185 million, with gross profit margin up 60 basis points to 36.7%. Roughly half of the improvement was driven by better merchandise margins, with the remainder attributed to leverage and fixed cost on our strong comp. 
 As planned, fixed store leverage was lower than what we achieved earlier in the year due to the large number of stores we opened in the last 2 quarters, 22 in Q2 and 49 in Q3 this year compared to 21 in Q2 and 28 in Q3 last year. The Northeast DC continues to perform well. We expect to see a slight benefit from our improved network during the fourth quarter and a more meaningful benefit to margins in 2013. 
 SG&A expenses increased to 16.8% to $118 million, down 120 basis points as a rate of sales to 23.3%. We leveraged operating expenses on a strong comp and consistent cost disciplines. 
 Preopening expense increased in line with our accelerated store opening program at $6.3 million compared to $4 million last year as we opened a record 49 new stores, remodeled 11 stores and relocated 1 store in the third quarter compared to 28 new stores, 1 relocation and no remodels during the third quarter of 2011. 
 All in, operating margin improved by 140 basis points to 12.1% versus 10.7% in Q3 of last year as we continued to deliver strong operating execution and remain focused on cost management. 
 Our tax rate was 37.7% versus 39.2% in last year's third quarter. The improvement in the rate was driven primarily by stock option exercises and was worth about $0.01 of earnings per share for the quarter. We expect our tax rate to be approximately 38.6% for the full year.  
 Net income increased 42.5% to $38.2 million or $0.59 per diluted share versus $26.8 million or $0.42 per diluted share in last year's third quarter. 
 Now taking a look at the balance sheet. Merchandise inventories at the end of the quarter were $462.8 million compared to $354.9 million at the end of the third quarter last year, up roughly 30% in dollars and 7.3% on a per store basis. The increase is primarily due to the 95 net new stores we opened in the past year along with our normal holiday build. The increase also reflects incremental inventory related to the 79 prestige brand boutiques which were added in Q3, as well as strategic inventory investment in core high-turn SKUs to ensure we support strong in-stock levels throughout the holiday season and into the new year. 
 We will make additional investments in inventory through the fourth quarter, which we believe is a good use of cash and helps our business long term. As a result of the additional inventory investment, you should expect to see our average inventory per store to increase year-over-year in the low double digits as of the end of Q4. We would characterize this as a onetime increase that equalizes the average inventory per store levels quarter-to-quarter. I would also note that the basic items we are investing in do not add any obsolescence risk. 
 Looking ahead to 2013, we expect per store inventories to grow at a lower rate than our comp sales, absent any major new brand additions. The additional inventory investments that we are making do not have a significant impact on our new store model. 
 Capital expenditures for the third quarter were $76.7 million compared to $45 million for the same period last year, mainly driven by our accelerated store opening program. Depreciation and amortization for the quarter was $22.2 million. 
 Turning to our outlook for Q4. It's still early in the holiday season and somewhat challenging to forecast the mood of the customer. That said, we feel very good about our plan, the amount of newness we are offering our guests and our team's execution. We were very pleased with our Black Friday weekend and our Cyber Monday sales, with both events achieving record sales performance. 
 So with all that as a backdrop, we estimate Q4 sales will be in the range of $742 million to $754 million versus $582.5 million last year. This includes the impact of the 53rd week this year, worth about $35 million in sales. We anticipate that comp store sales will increase in the range of 5% to 7%, on top of the 11.5% comp we achieved in Q4 last year. Our guidance includes the disruption we experienced from Hurricane Sandy, which impacted almost 20% of the chain, with many stores closed for multiple days. As we do every year, we plan to announce our holiday sales on July -- on January 4 to provide you a view of our 6-week holiday selling season. 
 We expect our fourth quarter earnings per share to be in the range of $0.96 to $0.98 compared to EPS of $0.73 in Q4 of 2011. Our expectations for Q4 include the positive impact of the extra week in the quarter, which we estimate will contribute approximately $0.04 of earnings per share. 
 Gross profit margin is expected to increase approximately 30 basis points at the midpoint of the guidance range, driven by improvement in merchandise margin and leverage of fixed store expenses. 
 SG&A rate is expected to decrease around 90 basis points at the midpoint of the range versus last year's rate of 21.3%. 
 Preopening expenses are expected to be approximately $2 million, up $1 million compared to last year's fourth quarter, driven by the acceleration of our new store program. This increase in preopening expense will negatively impact operating margin by about 10 basis points in the quarter. 
 All in, operating margin is expected to increase approximately 100 basis points at the midpoint of the range. 
 We expect our tax rate to be approximately 38.6%, and we anticipate the fully diluted share count to be about 64.8 million. 
 To recap the full year, we expect to significantly outperform our original sales and earnings expectations. Sales are expected to exceed $2.2 billion, more than 24% growth compared to 2011. 
 We are raising our guidance for earnings per share for the full year to a range of $2.64 to $2.66, representing approximately 40% growth. This is well above our long-term goal and our expectations at the beginning of the year of achieving 30% EPS growth despite the roughly $0.07 negative impact from our accelerated new store program, the new DC and the addition of prestige brand boutiques. 
 Total preopening expense for the year is expected to be $15 million compared to $10 million in fiscal 2011, negatively impacting earnings per share this year by about $0.05 per share. 
 Capital expenditures for the full year 2012 are expected to be approximately $180 million, about $51 million higher than our capital expenditure program in 2011, driven by the acceleration of our new store program, store remodels and the expansion of prestige brand boutiques. 
 Depreciation and amortization are expected to be approximately $90 million. 
 We expect to generate strong free cash flow for the year, and we'll continue to evaluate with our board the best use of any excess cash. 
 To wrap up, Ulta is well positioned to drive robust sales and profit growth well into the future. All the contributors to our success that we've been discussing with you have tremendous multiyear potential. 
 We're highly confident in our store build-all plans, the quality of our real estate and the sustainability of the maturation curve of our new stores. We expect to continue to offer newness to our guests in terms of products, brands and services. We have significant opportunities to drive benefits from our supply chain, from our marketing and CRM investments and from increasing our digital capabilities. 
 We remain very confident in delivering our long-term financial model based on 3% to 5% comps, 15% to 20% annual square footage growth, 25% to 30% earnings growth and targeting a mid-teens operating margin in the next few years. 
 With that, I'll turn the call back over to Chuck. 
Carl Rubin: Thanks, Scott. Before we start the Q&A session, I would like to thank our 15,000 associates for all they do to make Ulta a winning formula that is rapidly gaining market share in the beauty industry. Our team always works hard. But I'd like to recognize in particular all the efforts of our field teams and our corporate associates to prepare for and then to recover from the historic storm impacting the East Coast just 1 month ago. I thank them for all they did to take care of each other, to take care of our guests. I'm always very proud of this team, but never more so than when seeing their commitment and engagement to overcome this challenge. 
 Now, let's turn the call back to the operator to open up for your questions. Operator? 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Brian Tunick from JPMorgan. 
Brian Tunick: I guess, Chuck, I know it's a late holiday this year and people might be a little behind the 8-ball given what they've said about some November comps out there. But just curious of your view of the overall promotional environment, either from what you're seeing on the department store side or on the drugstore side. And then the second question is, you talk about a 1,200 store target long term. You're obviously accelerating that here. But what's the thought between how much of that has to come from existing or reconfigured real estate versus when are we going to need to see new store development begin to ramp up? 
Carl Rubin: Brian, let's take the second one first. I think that clearly for the 1,200 stores, there is going to be a need for new construction. Obviously with our announcement today, we feel really good about 2013, and most of those stores are existing real estate. Now the pipeline into 2014, believe it or not, we've already approved some sites for that year. It's a little early to look at it at that point, but there are some seeds of new development starting to show up. And we do have high hopes that the real estate market does start to show some new development as you move into the out-years. But clearly, to get to the 1,200, we will need some new development. But we do think that, that will start to materialize. In terms of your first question on the promotional environment, there does seem to be a wide range of activity in retail today, and it goes beyond the beauty market. Clearly, our performance this quarter continued to gain market share, so the customer continues to vote that they like what we do. We're well positioned in our strategy for the fourth quarter between the breadth of our offering, everything from mass to prestige, from cosmetics to skincare to hair care, across price points using our loyalty program, we are well positioned to add value to the customer and we are seeing that she is shopping for value. As Scott mentioned in our prepared comments, our Black Friday weekend and Cyber Monday were terrific. They were very big and -- but she was looking for value. But we have a very sound offering to be able to cater to that, using some of the things we talked about in the script. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Matthew Fassler from Goldman Sachs. 
Matthew Fassler: I want to talk for a moment about gross margin. First of all, if you look at the fixed leverage that you've generated, it was on the lower end of what you've typically been doing with the pretty good comps. So how much of that was absorbing issues like Chambersburg and the prestige investment, and perhaps offsetting what would have been better natural leverage on occupancy given the comp that you put up? 
Scott Settersten: Yes, Matt, the leverage that you're referring to, I agree it's a little bit unexpected. But the drivers of that were additional labor that we pushed through the supply chain and other additional costs that were related to these inventory investments that we made during the third quarter. 
Matthew Fassler: And to the extent that, that labor shows up in gross margin, would that happen kind of in the DCs? 
Scott Settersten: Exactly, a little bit of deleverage in the DCs. 
Carl Rubin: And again as Scott mentioned earlier, don't forget the number of stores that we've opened. We had a record number of stores in the third quarter, so that had a little bit of a drag on us as well on not being able to leverage as high in this fixed store expense. 
Matthew Fassler: Understood. And then Scott, just to clarify, the gross margin expansion you talked about for Q4, I want to make sure I didn't mishear, is that 30 basis points? 
Scott Settersten: That's right. 30 basis points at the midpoint of the range. 
Matthew Fassler: So if you think about that relative to the trend in recent quarters, that would be a bit lower as well. So can you talk about -- I'm understanding that your guidance is [indiscernible] conservative, if you look at the components of the budget to take it to that level, how should we think about that? 
Scott Settersten: Well, we're thinking about the hurdles that we're jumping over from last year. You have to remember that the comp last year was significantly higher with 11-plus percent for the quarter and a 12% plus during that very important 6-week holiday selling season. So as we look at it year-over-year, we see that merchandise margin relatively flattish and a little bit -- a pressure on the fixed store leverage because of the large number of new stores that we just put in place over the last 2 quarters. 
Matthew Fassler: And does the extra week help that at all? Or is that kind of a nonevent for... 
Scott Settersten: It's really a nonevent. 
Carl Rubin: Matt, I just -- I would add, keep in mind on the merchandise margin that in the last roughly 2 years, we have added close to a couple of hundred basis points on the merchandise margin. And what we've said is long term, there's opportunity both on SG&A as well as on the margin side of the equation. It won't always be equal. They'll vary between the 2 of them quarter-by-quarter. On the long term, we think that they do somewhat mirror themselves. They'll be about equal in their contribution or our overall operating margin. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Joseph Altobello from Oppenheimer. 
Joseph Altobello: Just first quick housekeeping question. You mentioned Sandy. What was the impact on comps this quarter, and what are you expecting to be the impact on comps in the fourth quarter? 
Carl Rubin: The impact that we envision in the fourth quarter is included in the guidance that we gave, at 5 to 7. It's tough to be very specific about that, Joe, because you clearly have the impact of when stores were closed. And we had close to 20% of the store base that was affected and closed from either 1 day or 2 to a number of days. But then you have the aftereffect. Once the store is back open, it still takes a little bit of a recovery time to get back in the business. And for those stores, we weren't the first thing that people affected by Sandy were going out to purchase. So to our best guess from what we've seen thus far, we think that this is going to impact the quarter up to 100 basis points, 50 to 75 up to 100 basis points. 
Joseph Altobello: This is for the fourth quarter? 
Carl Rubin: Yes. 
Joseph Altobello: Okay, okay. And then just switching gears to the real estate opportunity. Obviously next year, you're looking to do another 20, I guess 3% square footage growth. What's driving that opportunity? I mean, is it just more real estate coming your way, more centers being built? And then secondly, how are you guys handling that internally? Because you added 100 or will add 100 doors or so this year and 125 next year, and the numbers are getting pretty big. So are you guys adding people? Or how are you adding capabilities to keep up with that opportunity? 
Carl Rubin: Yes, we've added people. Obviously, you can't grow a retail chain without adding people to it. We've added obviously the people in the stores, but we have more construction people, we have more store set people, we do have more inventory people [indiscernible]. 
Joseph Altobello: I mean, on the real estate side, Chuck, sorry. 
Carl Rubin: Sorry? 
Joseph Altobello: On the real estate side, sorry about that. 
Carl Rubin: On the real estate side, the team is a little bit larger, but not extensively. The real estate team can flex with some good flexibility because you do use other third parties to help find sites. There's a broker community that we leverage extensively. I've talked before that our real estate group is a very strong part of our company, our real estate and construction teams and store set teams. So we've got very, very strong capabilities on this. And clearly, as we've ramped up the store count, we've added additional people to help get that executed. But the core team, the core leadership team of our store set teams, construction, the real estate teams, the dealmakers, it's just a very strong core group of people. To your question, the first part of your question, I think we said in our comments that about 80% of the chain -- 80% of the stores rather for 2013 are existing real estate. So there are seeds of new development, but it's not a heavy influence into next year. And I've talked about this publicly a number of times, our team's very creative in going out to find opportunities for stores. We still have tremendous white space in the country for stores to go in. And the fact that we have become much larger and more successful, we are a very attractive tenant for landlords. So you put all of that together, and that's what has allowed us to find these opportunities. And clearly, as evidenced even by these results for the third quarter, these new stores are performing very well. And it is part of our DNA that we will not pursue quantity above quality. We just happen to be finding both right now. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Neely Tamminga from Piper Jaffray. 
Neely Tamminga: So I have 1.5 questions, I think, here. So going back to the real estate composition of the markets, may -- I absolutely get kind of the new center development versus existing center? But can you give us a sense of when we look into that 2013 on the 125 stores, how many new markets will that represent or to existing markets to this year? 
Carl Rubin: I don't know if we want to break into that just yet. There's a fair number of new markets, but depends on how you define the market as well, Neely. So I use this example quite often, you take San Francisco where we have, I don't know, 10, 12 stores. It's a market that can support significantly more than that. So as we put more stores in San Francisco and it's -- into the San Francisco general market, a new store is 10 miles away from an existing store, is that considered new, a new market or not? So it -- our point is that there's a lot of greenfield out there. There are some of the stores for next year that are going into single market -- single store or 2-store markets. But a lot of them are infilling into these bigger markets as a whole. So it's kind of a broadbrushed approach that we've got here. 
Neely Tamminga: Okay. And then your loyalty program, unless I missed it, did you actually -- say, do you fully convert to the new program on all markets? Are you still -- where are you in that process? 
Carl Rubin: Yes, we still have half the chain on the new program and half the chain on the legacy program. We had converted -- we converted a number of stores earlier this year, and our goal is to get to the 1 program, the points-based program. We're pleased with how the transition's going. But there are changes to the program where we want to get through a full cycle of customer shopping pattern so we understand all the components to it. So we're still half and half. 
Neely Tamminga: Would that be more of like a spring revisit sort of situation at this point? 
Carl Rubin: We'll see. We still have another, I don't know, close to 6 months I guess to go before we anniversary the conversions. So we're making good progress, and we're pleased with the new program. Honestly, we're pleased with the old program. It continues to fuel a lot of goodness for us. We will get to the 1 program, but we just haven't announced the timing exactly. 
Neely Tamminga: Great. And I just -- I actually have one more on fragrance. I think it's really interesting what you're saying about fragrance and the strength that you saw in Q3. And is that historically been a really pretty good predictor for holiday? And then maybe even carrying it further into Valentine's Day, if you think about kind of the key selling seasons for fragrance? I mean, when did fragrance really -- remind us, when did fragrance really start to get lit up a little bit from a category perspective? 
Carl Rubin: Well fragrance is -- what happened in Q3 was there was a lot of newness. So we have a lot of new fragrances that have been introduced. We'll see how it goes for fourth quarter. It's -- we haven't really hit the main stride for the fragrance category yet. That does tend to peak very quickly as you get close to the holiday. But newness is important. And between that, and there's a lot of newness, there's a lot of core fragrances that we've had, and our GWPs continued to be wreathly [ph] well received in this fragrance area. So too soon to tell how the fourth quarter's going to shake out on that, but we think our plan is really well laid out. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Daniel Hofkin from William Blair. 
Daniel Hofkin: Just a couple of questions. I guess first, maybe you touched on this earlier, but can you say anything about sort of the flow of store openings in 2013? Obviously, I would expect it to be somewhat smoother compared to this year, but correct me if I'm wrong about that. 
Scott Settersten: Obviously, when we get to March, Dan, we'll give you a better predictor of how the store rollout schedule is going to work for next year. I don't think you'd be too far off base if you use 2012 as kind of the proxy as far as store rollout for 2013 at this stage. 
Daniel Hofkin: And just sort of can I gross it up proportionately, you're saying basically? 
Scott Settersten: Yes, right. That would be your best bet at this point in time. 
Daniel Hofkin: Okay. And then my next question is, with the -- I guess in the near term, the -- you're seeing more contribution from the SG&A leverage. You've had huge improvement the last several years in gross margin. If we look forward over the next 2, 3 years and still -- you guys are still thinking in terms of a mid-teens operating margin, how do you see the contribution splitting up between gross and SG&A? 
Scott Settersten: Again, as we've progressed, look to the future, we're still working on achieving our mid-teen operating margin in the next few years, Dan. And again, it's going to be balanced between both gross profit and SG&A leverage. So again, it's going to move in tandem over the quarters. It's not necessarily going to be in perfect balance each quarter. There's going to be a little lumpiness along the way. But again all in, that's where we're headed on target. 
Daniel Hofkin: Okay. So I mean, would it be just, all else equal, fair to say that you'd expect because the DC will be further in the ramp up next year and I guess the rate of store growth is similar in terms of percentage, you'd expect potentially more gross margin improvement year-over-year in 2013 than in 2012? 
Scott Settersten: We're not ready to get into that quite yet today, Dan. We'll be prepared to give you a little bit more detail on that when we talk to you in March. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Erika Maschmeyer from Robert W. Baird. 
Erika Maschmeyer: The ticket increase that you saw this quarter was slightly lower than it has been. Any factors to call out there? 
Carl Rubin: I missed the beginning. The what increase? 
Erika Maschmeyer: Oh, I'm sorry. The increase in your ticket? 
Carl Rubin: Yes. No, most of the increase has been driven off of traffic. Last quarter was a little more balanced between ticket and traffic. But we've said all along that long term, we think the traffic will be more the driver, and this quarter was generally in line I think with that mix. We're very pleased. We do think it's a much healthier and sustainable comp driver when most of that's coming out of traffic, not ticket. 
Erika Maschmeyer: I completely agree. That all makes sense. And then can you talk a little bit about your in-stock levels, maybe grade yourself there? Kind of how are you thinking about that? And what types of initiatives are you investing in to continue to improve in that area? 
Scott Settersten: Well, Erika, our #1 goal is to provide our guests with the best in-store experience that we can. And obviously, part of that is maintaining high in-stock levels. As we came out of a spectacular fourth quarter last year with the high comps that we had, we found that we had some in-stock challenges as we worked our way post-holiday and into the January, February timeframe. We've also noted -- noticed over the years that some of our smaller vendors are having a -- having more of a challenge keeping up with our out of stocks as our store base continues to grow. So the investments that we're making are in core high-velocity SKUs with no obsolescence risk. We will remain highly disciplined and continue to prudently manage our inventory levels as we have in the past. Again, there might be a little upside to comps in the January, February timeframe. But this, in our view, is a long-term investment. It's going to help the business in the long term. 
Carl Rubin: And just to add to that, Erika, if you go back and look at our per store inventories, they generally have been relatively consistent quarter-by-quarter. This -- the end of fourth quarter this past year, we dipped down. So the additional inventory that were -- that Scott talked about were -- this year, we're expecting our per store inventory at the end of fourth quarter to be up low double digit. It is kind of a one-timer just to get the per stores by quarter more comparable. And to Scott's point, this -- the additional inventory that we've bought and anticipate continuing to buy, it's not really specific to holiday. It's core. And hence, we're not overly worried about obsolescence of this stock. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Evren Kopelman from Wells Fargo. 
Evren Kopelman: I wanted to ask as you're opening more and more -- as you have been opening more and more new stores each year, have you seen any changes to the store maturity model that you've shared with us in the past? 
Carl Rubin: We're opening stronger than we have been before, so -- but there's still the maturity curve that we've talked about before, so... 
Scott Settersten: And the new store class -- I would add, the new store class in 2012 is operating, delivering at above our expectations. And again, I think we may have mentioned this previously, yes, the older stores and the new store comps are built into our guidance. The older stores are turning a bit above those post 5-year comps that are part of our standard store model. 
Evren Kopelman: Oh, great. Okay. And then for next year, thinking about the preopening expenses with the higher number of new stores, is it fair if we just looked at about per store investment this year and extrapolate? Or will there be further savings as you're opening more stores, on the store investment? 
Carl Rubin: I think I wouldn't anticipate a lot of additional savings per store. The market continues to evolve, and it's an interesting scenario. Compared to a couple of years ago, there were far fewer suppliers, contractors, et cetera. So the supply of resources has tightened up a bit. Therefore, some of the cost savings that we've gotten before, we're not going to lose. But I'm not sure that we'll see as much additional savings there. But -- so I think I would model it to be relatively consistent to this year. 
Evren Kopelman: Okay. And then lastly if can ask on the balance sheet, with a growing cash balance, any further thoughts on use of cash after all your clearly store opening plans? Given the upcoming tax rate changes, any thoughts on special dividends or stock buyback programs? 
Scott Settersten: Evren, we discuss the cash balance and the best uses of cash with our board on a regular basis. As you know, we paid a special dividend back in May of this year. At this point in time, we've determined collectively that the best use of cash is in -- to continue to invest in our new store program. That's what generates the best returns on that balance. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Jason Gere from RBC Capital Markets. 
Jason Gere: Just I guess kind of a quick question. What do you estimate is the blended beauty growth category rate in the U.S.? I mean, I know your mass, your prestige, your salon, but if you kind of had to aggregate that together, what type of category growth do you think you're seeing right now? That's kind of the first question. 
Carl Rubin: What we're seeing or the industry is seeing? 
Jason Gere: Well, the industry, but I mean -- it'll lead into the second question. But I mean, yes, the -- what do you estimate the industry growth to be right now? 
Carl Rubin: It's -- firstly, I'll give you an answer, but let me give you some disclaimer to it. It's a pretty broad industry from everything from prestige to mass to hair care to appliances, et cetera. With -- so I'll give you that as the backdrop. I think if you put all of that together, you're probably seeing low single-digit kinds of increases. 
Jason Gere: For including everything together? Okay, okay. Seems a little bit modest, but -- okay. But I guess the question is, as you ramp up the square footage and as you get some of these new stores into kind of year 2, year 3, I mean, thinking about the comp -- and I respect the conservatism that you have with your long-term 3 to 5. But when you look at the comp trends right now, what's to say that it is ever going to go back to that 3 to 5? I mean, the CRM program, similar to what it did for Sally Beauty was a strong contributor for their same-store sales. You've got some great new products in the stores. So I guess, can you just talk me out of that thinking? 
Carl Rubin: Well, I think that when we talk about the 3 to 5, we're trying to highlight that this is a profit-generating, cash-generating business with 3 to 5 comps. That's the first point. Secondly, our growth has been and will continue to lead the market. We will continue to gain market share in the beauty industry. The growth that we've seen, as to be expected, I think as in this quarter and last quarter, we were lower than the previous quarters. To expect double-digit kinds of comps endlessly, it would be probably an unwise conclusion. So the 3 to 5 that we have in our long-term financial model is just that. It's a long-term financial model to ensure that we continue to generate the kind of strong shareholder returns that we have been. We work to exceed that, so obviously, we have been doing that quite consistently for the past couple of years, and we're going to continue to strive to do that as we go forward. 
Jason Gere: Okay. That's a good answer. And then I guess the other kind of longer-term question is just on the margin target. And can you just remind us how you benchmark? You say the mid-teens. But which are some of the specialty retailers out there that you guys look at? I know that I think it's been said in the past, maybe not by you, that you don't compare yourself to Sephora. But how do you kind of gauge what the real margin potential is in this business? 
Carl Rubin: Well, that's a tough one to answer. No, first of all, Sephora only carries prestige fragrance, cosmetics and skincare. We're a much broader retailer. There are other large big-box operators out there that have terrific businesses and they're mature and generate terrific returns. Their business is different than ours. I think what we've said before is that getting into the mid-teens is what we're working towards now. If you go back a couple of years ago, we were in the single digits. And back then, I'm not sure that anybody would have believed that we have the potential of getting for the mid-teens. When we get there, our challenge will be to continue to grow that. So I wouldn't suggest that's the ceiling on us. I would suggest that's what we're striving for to get there in the next x period of time. But there -- and I wouldn't compare it to necessarily to other retailers that we directly compete with. 
Jason Gere: Okay, great, Chuck. And then just the last, I guess it's my 1/2 question. When you -- some of the, I guess, gift with purchases that you're doing this year, can you just remind us on who's funding some of that? So that the luxury robe, I actually saw that with the purchase on fragrance. Can you just put a little color on that? Is that funded by you, or is that -- how -- can you -- I guess I'm just a little bit curious like how much you kind of have to step into that promotion? Or is that kind of vendor funded for some degree? 
Carl Rubin: No, Jason, we wouldn't get into that. We run a multidimensional merchandising and marketing program. And we work closely with our vendors to develop exclusive product, to provide input into the product that they're going to offer on a broad range. We work with them on promotions. I don't see any great value of getting into the details of any specific program. I will reinforce to your point that the robe has -- goes into effect this weekend officially. And we would invite everybody on the call to be sure to get to one of our stores or online and enjoy that as a gift with their fragrance purchase. 
Jason Gere: Is that velvet? Terry cloth? 
Carl Rubin: It is not velvet. But for you, maybe we can arrange. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Jill Caruthers from Johnson Rice. 
Jill Caruthers: A quick question, just on the Black Friday approach. You mentioned that Black Friday and Cyber Monday were -- they beat the highest record that you've posted. And any different approach that you did with doorbusters or type promotions that you'd want to call out year-over-year? 
Carl Rubin: A couple of things. One is, the merchants did a great job of putting an offering together that was profitable, had a lot of exclusivity to it and was really well targeted to our guest. And then, the stores did a terrific job of servicing. So we also -- this year, we did open a lot of our stores earlier than we did the year before to go along with what was happening in the center with our other retailers that we co-habitate with. So when you put it all together, the offering, the marketing was quite effective and the experience in the store, it led to a really good Thanksgiving weekend. 
Jill Caruthers: Okay. And then, question on new -- the Lancôme and Clinique boutiques. I know it's very early. Just wondering, how are you informing the customer of those new boutiques that you've got in the store, given it's not storewide so you can't really -- I don't think you can run it in a print circular or what have you. Just kind of wondering how you're informing the customer at this point in time. 
Carl Rubin: A number of ways, just to touch on a couple. Clearly, you can go out to our website and find it on on-store locator. We're using digital communications, and we are putting them into versioned additions of our print marketing, so -- and we've done other direct marketing that has been exclusive to Clinique around the stores that have carried it. So it has been pretty multidimensional in terms of how we're getting the word out. 
Jill Caruthers: Okay. And do you feel at this point that you're gaining some new customers from that? Or is it just too early? 
Carl Rubin: We have -- we believe that we are and we believe that will continue, yes. 
Operator: At this time, we have no further questions. I'd like to turn the call back over to our speakers for any closing comments. 
Carl Rubin: Well, let me just thank everyone for your interest in Ulta and joining us today and wish everybody a happy holiday season, and we will look forward to speaking with you soon and hopefully seeing you in our stores or online even sooner. Thanks so much. 
Operator: Thank you. This does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.

===== 2012 Q2  (2012-09-06 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Greetings and welcome to the Ulta Salon, Cosmetics & Fragrance, Inc. Fiscal Second Quarter 2012 Earnings Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Laurel Lefebvre, Vice President, Investor Relations. Thank you. You may now begin. 
Laurel Lefebvre: Thank you. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us for Ulta's Second Quarter 2012 Conference Call. Hosting our call are Chuck Rubin, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Gregg Bodnar, our Chief Financial Officer. Also joining us today is Bruce Hartman, who becomes our CFO tomorrow. 
 Before we begin, I'd like to remind you of the company's safe harbor language. The statements contained in this conference call which are not historical facts may be deemed to constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

We may make references during this call to the metric free cash flow, a non-GAAP financial measure defined as cash provided by operating activities, minus purchases of property and equipment. 
 With that, I'll turn it over to Chuck. 
Carl Rubin: Thanks, Laurel. Good afternoon, everyone. I'm pleased to announce that we delivered better-than-expected results for the second quarter. To recap the numbers, strong momentum continued on the top line with 22% sales growth. Same-store sales increased 9.3% on top of double-digit comps in Q2 in both 2011 and in 2010. We expanded gross margin and leveraged SG&A, resulting in 180 basis points of operating margin improvement, and earnings grew 42% to $0.54 per share. We delivered these numbers by continuing to focus on the 5 components of our multi-year growth strategy: accelerating store growth; introducing new products, services and brands; enhancing our loyalty program; broadening our marketing reach; and increasing our digital focus with ulta.com. As done in the past number of quarters, successful execution of these strategies in Q2 allowed us to once again gain market share in the beauty industry across all of our categories. 
 I'd like to update you on each of the 5 elements in this strategy in terms of what we accomplished in the second quarter and what's on deck for Q3. First, store growth. Our plans to add approximately 100 new stores and grow square footage 22% this year are on track, with 22 new stores opened in the second quarter. We ended Q2 with 489 stores in 45 states. Our new stores continue to perform very well and we've been very happy with our new store productivity. New stores are contributing sales above plan, partly because we're seeing good efficiencies in our construction process, allowing stores to open slightly earlier than anticipated, but mostly because sales out of the gate are better than planned and better than previous year's new stores. While we've ramped up new store openings this year, we also completed 9 remodels during the second quarter and are very pleased with their performance as well. 
 We also completed work in about 400 stores to update and reflow our planograms in the Prestige, cosmetics and skin care areas of the store to improve the shopping experience and make room for the expansion of high-performing existing Prestige brands, along with the future addition of new Prestige brands. Looking ahead, Q3 is a very active quarter on the real estate front, with 52 new store openings, 11 remodels and all the work that we're doing to set the stores for the Prestige boutique expansions, which I will detail in a moment. This compares to 28 new stores in the third quarter of 2011. As we shared with you last quarter, our updated analysis for the U.S. store buildout potential for our current format increased from 1,000 to 1,200 stores and we're very pleased with our pipeline of high-quality sites for next year's Real Estate program. 
 Our second key growth strategy is adding new products, services and brands. As I've discussed before, newness is a key driver to our sales growth and we have done a terrific job capitalizing on trends in introducing new brands and new product lines within existing brands into our portfolio. Let me give you a quick sense. In the second quarter, we saw strong trends in anti-aging, mascara, lipstick and foundations. BB creams remain very strong, with a steady stream of new introductions from multiple vendors from Mass [ph] to Prestige. We featured multiple brands of BB creams on one of our trend end caps, which bolstered customer interest and trial in this new product. Mascara was a big trend, with strong sales from bestsellers like They're Real from Benefit Cosmetics. We also saw continued growth in the do-it-yourself at home tools category. Clarisonic, Tanda, Remington and Go Smile have all introduced innovative items in the high-tech beauty and grooming arena which address skin care, acne treatment, hair removal and teeth whitening. And skin care and grooming continue to be a big trend in the beauty industry, and our men's shop that we launched a year ago performed very well. 
 In the personal appliance area, we saw growth in specialty tools like deep wavers, which support the current trend of curly hair. In the nail category, trends in nail art, glitter and magnetic polishes helped fill the void in the wake of last year's Shatter nail boom. In the second quarter, we launched the Juice Beauty brand, which consists of organic skin care and makeup. Our guests have reacted very well to this new brand given its organic nature and clinically validated results. 
 Looking ahead to what's coming in the third quarter, the newness pipeline is strong. Building on the many fragrance introductions so far this year, we are planning for even more with a significant wave of new fragrances being introduced in the third quarter. Q3 2012 will be an exciting quarter for the sheer number of new fragrances and the amount of buzz around many of the names such as Lady Gaga Fame. We're pleased with our trends at our fragrance business and the volume of important launches is encouraging for the holiday season. 
 In foundation, Tarte, Pure and Stila are all launching new foundations this fall. Also Urban Decay, which has been so successful with its Naked and Smoked eyeshadow palettes, made its first foray into the foundation category, with the naked skin launch in August. And finally, bareMinerals ready foundation just launched and is expected to be the biggest foundation launch of the year. 
 In terms of new brands for Q3, skin care lines from Vichy and La Roche Posay rolled out to all stores in August and we are expanding our exclusive CK One cosmetic line from 50 stores launched in the first quarter to 178 stores in Q3. We also continue to make progress with our iconic Prestige brands. As we announced last quarter, we are in the process of adding Lancome to 50 additional stores this fall, bringing the total number of stores offering Lancome to 79. The implementation is going well and we're on schedule to have these new boutiques complete before the holiday season. We're also very pleased to announce that we will be adding Clinique boutiques to an additional 35 stores. This, along with our existing 13 Clinique stores, will bring our total Clinique presentation to 48 stores. 30 of these new boutiques will be opened by the holiday season this year and the remaining 5 will open in Q1 next year. 
 We are very pleased with our current Lancome and Clinique business and expect these boutiques to be outstanding additions for the long term. We know our guests will be very excited to experience these terrific brands that complement our already strong Prestige skin care and cosmetic offering. Now as with any new initiative, these boutiques will take some time to ramp and we do not expect them to have a significant impact on our results in the back half of this year. 
 Now I'd like to spend a moment on our service business. Salon had a very strong quarter in the second quarter. We drove solid improvement in guest retention and saw good results from several compelling promotions, which combined our authority in both product and service to deliver a true beauty solution to our guests. Events included our Love Your Hair promotion that had in-store events and great values for our guests and our Frizz-Free Friday events. 
 Turning to Q3, our Salon team has developed and launched a fall winter trend collection featuring the newest looks in hairstyles and color. The collection highlights the expertise of our Salon teams. Ulta is the only national salon to offer this type of program, which is supported with extensive stylist training and in-store events. 
 Next let me update you on our third growth strategy, which is enhancing our loyalty program. We recently launched -- reached the milestone of 10 million active loyalty customers. This program continues to fuel our very successful direct marketing efforts. At the end of the first quarter, we converted our central region to our points-based program, so we currently have about 1/2 of our loyalty customers on our Legacy certificate-based program and about 1/2 on our points-based program. While it's only been a few months since the Central region's conversion to the points-based program, initial customer feedback is good. 
 To enhance our loyalty program for our guests, we introduced an online rewards center to help customers understand and self manage the benefits of our loyalty program. We also improved our POS capabilities to enhance our cashier's ability to interact on a more personalized basis with our guests and provide a better shopping experience. We are confident that our loyalty program will drive a higher share of wallet over the long term. 
 In the third quarter, we intend to continue to leverage the benefits of our loyalty program with member-only promotions and to our members, advanced notice of new trends and new events. We also will begin the implementation of a new CRM platform, which will expand our capabilities in harvesting the rich behavioral data that our 10 million member file contains. As I have stated before, this is a long term, very attractive opportunity for Ulta to personalize our communications and offers to our guests based on their individual shopping tendencies. 
 Moving on to our fourth growth strategy, which is broadening our marketing reach. To drive traffic and to support our positioning as a beauty and trend authority, we are focusing on 2 areas. The first, executing compelling events in our stores and online. And secondly, expanding our use of various forms of media. Q2 highlights on the events side included our Mother’s and Father’s Day gift of purchase offers driven by the abundance of new fragrances. Our 2-week Love Your Hair event in June was very successful as was our Frizz-Free Friday that I mentioned, a promotion that occurred in July in partnership with the brand Living Proof to offer guests a free blowout and the opportunity to learn more about smoothing products and Styling Tools. 
 We continue to believe that Ulta's product, service and Salon offering uniquely positions us as a true authority for our guests, whether they are looking for a beauty solution, want to learn something new or just want to enjoy themselves for the afternoon. Our in-store and online events reinforce this Ulta's strength and we have expanded our team that works with our stores and our vendor partners to ensure that these events continue to be exciting for our guests and effective for Ulta. On the media side, during Q2, we continue to expand our efforts to communicate with guests via Facebook and other social media. We are improving and increasing our e-mail communications and creating more effective direct mail pieces that are driving higher trial and awareness overall. 
 Previewing our marketing highlights for the third quarter, in August we partnered with Allure magazine to create a 13th issue exclusively for Ulta. This insider's guide to beauty and style was available in-store and mailed to Allure subscribers with a mini-version available on Facebook. Tied in with this guide, we launched in-store and digitally, a fall beauty preview in August featuring 5 beauty trends presented by Allure, Glamour, Lucky, Self and Teen Vogue with How-to Videos, a curated product guide on how to get the look at Ulta and tie-ins to sweepstakes, social media and a Red Carpet trend event in L.A. 
 Also in August with a marketing activity leading up to the highly anticipated launch of Lady Gaga Fame on August 22. Fame is the first ever black Eau de Parfum, which turns clear once airborne. Posts on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and Pinterest were part of the strategy to make Fame one of our most successful launches in fragrance becoming our #1 seller when it debuted. 
 Now in September is our 21 Days of Beauty celebration focused on Prestige brands. This event, bigger and better than ever, features daily events and promotions from the hottest brands and our trademark beauty steals. In October, our focus turns to Breast Cancer Awareness with our trademark Donate with a Kiss event. Everyone at Ulta really supports this event, as it benefits the Breast Cancer Research Foundation or the BCRF, our premier charitable partnership. The campaign includes a month-long sale of logo products specifically intended to raise funds for BCRF. We also will repeat our hugely successful Salon Cut-A-Thon on October 14, where our Salon stylists give free haircuts with a donation to the BCRF. Our campaigns these past couple of years have been thoroughly embraced by our guests and our associates and I'm proud to say these efforts have resulted in numerous scientific researches and projects being funded to find a cure for this disease. 
 On the media side in Q3, we'll see an increase in activity and content in social media associated with Fashion Week, our fall beauty preview and our 21 Days of Beauty events. It will also enable the products on ulta.com to be tagged to Pinterest for the first time. Finally, we will continue to improve the effectiveness of our print marketing through better targeting of offers and guests. 
 The fifth growth strategy is our digital focus, particularly ulta.com. In Q2, we maintained strong growth in traffic and sales compared to last year. But again, we know there is far more to be captured. In Q3, we will complete numerous back end enhancements to improve the guest shopping experience, make our site even faster and expand our delivery capability for the holiday season. On the sales and marketing side, our trademark limited time beauty steals will continue. Our product offering and editorial content will expand and we will increase our digital outreach. We are also planning to deploy our first Apple and Android apps in October. 
 So as you can see, we have made great progress on our 5 key growth initiatives, with even more excitement coming for each of them. We believe our comprehensive strategy and strong execution will fuel additional market share gains for the remainder of 2012 and in the years to come, regardless of the economic environment that lies ahead. Obviously, we are aware of the uncertain climate and the pressures on the consumer today. But as you've seen, our performance in Q2 was strong and we remain very confident in our business model, guest offering and guest experience. 
 Now, let me turn it over to Gregg for a detailed discussion on our financials. 
Gregg Bodnar: Thanks, Chuck. Ulta's second quarter results were once again driven by strong sales growth and margin improvement. Total sales grew 22.1%, with strength across all categories. Same-store sales increased 9.3% on top of an 11.3% comp in Q2 of last year. Traffic remained the dominant driver of comp, representing about 6 points of the 9.3% comp, but average ticket grew about 3% compared to last year. We are very pleased to continue to deliver strong traffic growth, particularly as we were comping over an 11% traffic increase in Q2 of last year. 
 Gross profit dollars increased 24.8% to $168 million, with gross profit margin up 80 basis points to 34.8%. This improvement was driven by 70 basis points of leverage and fixed store costs on our strong comp and an increase of 30 basis points in merchandise margin as we continue to benefit from our merchandising and marketing strategies. These gains, as planned, were partially offset by about 30 basis points of supply chain investment with the start up of our new Northeast distribution center. 
 SG&A expenses increased 16.8% to $106 million, down 100 basis points as a rate of sales to 22%. We leveraged operating expenses on a strong comp and consistent execution of our margin expansion strategies. Preopening expense was up slightly at $4.1 million compared to $3.8 million last year, as we opened 22 new stores, remodeled 9 stores and relocated 1 store in the second quarter compared to 21 new stores and 15 remodels during the second quarter of 2011. 
 All in, operating margin improved by 180 basis points to 11.9% versus 10.1% in Q2 of last year, as we continue to execute well and maintain our disciplined investment and cost management strategies. Our tax rate was 39% versus 39.5% last year. The modest improvement in the tax rate was due to a decrease in nondeductible compensation expense. Net income increased 46.4% to $35 million or $0.54 per diluted share versus $23.9 million or $0.38 per diluted share in last year's second quarter. 
 Now taking a look at the balance sheet, merchandise inventories at the end of the quarter were $316.7 million compared to $258.8 million at the end of the second quarter last year, up 3.9% on a per-store basis. As planned, this still includes a small amount of additional inventory investment to start up the Northeast distribution center. The increase in average inventory per store was well below our 9.3% comp store sales increase as we continued our very disciplined approach to inventory management. The Northeast DC is performing very well and remains on track to deliver planned productivity benefits and drive significant reductions in transportation costs. We expect to see -- start to see the benefits from our improved network in Q4 and we expect the new DC to have a more meaningful benefit to margins in 2013 and beyond. Capital expenditures for the second quarter were $46.5 million compared to $33.1 million for the same period last year, mostly driven by our accelerated store opening program. Depreciation and amortization for the quarter was $21.6 million. 
 Now turning to an outlook for the third quarter. We currently estimate sales in the range of $494 million to $503 million versus $413.1 million last year. We anticipate that comp store sales will increase in the range of 6% to 8%, on top of the 9.6% comp in the third quarter of last year. We expect earnings per share will be in the range of $0.54 to $0.56, including a $0.04 negative impact primarily due to the acceleration of our new store program, as well as a modest impact from the Northeast DC and the Lancome and Clinique boutiques. This compares to EPS of $0.42 in Q3 of 2011. 
 Gross profit margin is expected to increase approximately 60 basis points at the midpoint of the range, driven by improvement in merchandise margin and leverage of fixed store expenses. As expected, this increase is slightly less than what we achieved in Q2, as we will open 52 new stores during the quarter versus 28 last year. As previously discussed, this will create some temporary pressure on our ability to achieve meaningful leverage on fixed store expenses. Again, this is consistent with our store model and past performance. SG&A rate is expected to decrease around 70 basis points at the midpoint of the range versus last year's 24.5%. Preopening expenses are expected to be approximately $7 million, up $3 million compared to last year's third quarter, driven by the acceleration of our new store program. The increase in preopening expense will negatively impact operating margin by about 40 basis points in the quarter. Including the impact of these long-term investments, operating margin is expected to increase approximately 90 basis points at the midpoint of the range. We expect our tax rate to remain at approximately 39% and we anticipate the fully diluted share count to be about 64.6 million. 
 Looking ahead to the full year 2012, given our performance in the first half of the year, we expect to deliver strong sales -- strong results, well ahead of our long-term financial goals. We expect to achieve comp store sales growth of approximately 8%, about 300 basis points above the high end of our long-term goal of 3% to 5%. Recall that fiscal 2012 is a 53-week year for us, with the extra week included in the fourth quarter. We expect the 53rd week to represent approximately $35 million in sales. 
 As a reminder, Q4 same-store sales are calculated based on comparable 14-week period in the prior year. We expect to deliver earnings per share for the full year in the range of $2.58 to $2.60, representing growth well above our long-term goals. This includes the negative impact of our accelerated new store program, the new DC and the addition of new Prestige brand boutiques. The full year negative impact of these factors is estimated to be approximately $0.07 to $0.08 per share of additional operating expense. Partially offsetting these impacts is the benefit of the 53rd week operating results, which we expect to be approximately $0.03 per share. 
 We are on track to open 100 new stores and to complete 21 remodels this year. Total preopening expense for this year is expected to be about $15.5 million compared to $10 million in fiscal 2011, negatively impacting earnings per share this year by about $0.05 per share. We are very pleased with the performance of our new stores, both this year and last year, and continue to drive improving returns from our new store model. As stores continue to open above plan, this validates the attractiveness of accelerating our store growth and reinforces the attractive multi-year returns for shareholders that our new store investments provide. 
 Capital expenditures in 2012 are expected to be approximately $180 million, which is about $51 million higher than our capital expenditure program in 2011. This increase is driven by the acceleration of our store expansion program, store remodels and about $10 million of incremental capital investment for the expansion of Prestige brand boutiques. Depreciation and amortization are expected to be approximately $90 million. We expect to generate strong free cash flow again this year and will continue to evaluate the best use of any excess cash position. 
 We are encouraged as we look to the back half of this year and the years ahead as we think about how much growth runway lies ahead, driven by our strategies and financial disciplines. Multiple drivers are in place for continued momentum in our business, from the maturation cycle of our new stores to the growing benefits of our supply chain investments; from the pipeline of new products, brands and services, to the investments in our CRM and digital capabilities. We are very well-positioned to continue to deliver strong sales and earnings growth. 
 With that, I'll turn the call back over to Chuck. 
Carl Rubin: Thanks, Gregg. Before we begin the Q&A, I'll comment about our CFO transition. Today is a very bittersweet one, as it is Gregg's last as CFO. I'd like to express my deep gratitude to Gregg for his tremendous contributions to Ulta over the past 6 years. Gregg's been a great partner to me and has developed a very strong team here at Ulta, from finance, to supply chain, to the IT organization, which have all been instrumental in the execution of our strategy. This team's hallmark is its analytical approach to growing and improving the business. Gregg and his team have made significant contributions to Ulta's expense management discipline, our very healthy balance sheet and the consistent and rapid improvement in our financial results. 
 While we are truly disappointed that Gregg is stepping down, I'm very pleased to welcome Bruce Hartman to the Ulta team. As you saw in our announcement a couple of weeks ago, we are thrilled that Bruce will take the helm as Chief Financial Officer as of tomorrow. Bruce has an excellent track record of driving growth and profit improvement throughout his career and has valuable and relevant experience as a CFO for a specialty retailer with the national and international footprint, as well as real estate and consumer product companies. The entire management team met Bruce during the interview process and while we will miss Gregg greatly, we know Bruce will build upon our success to date and help Ulta achieve even greater things. We're also very pleased that Gregg will remain with the company through the transition and will partner with Bruce to ensure a smooth handoff. Gregg, so many thanks to you, and Bruce, welcome to the team.
 Bruce? 
Bruce Hartman: Thanks, Chuck and Gregg. I'm delighted to be part of this team and part of this vibrant industry. I spent a lot of time with the entire leadership team throughout this process and conducted a lot of research on the company and the industry. I can't think of another retailer that has as much opportunity ahead as Ulta does. I'm looking forward to getting to know all of you in the coming weeks and months and working with you in the years ahead. 
 Gregg? 
Gregg Bodnar: Welcome, Bruce, and thank you, Chuck. I will certainly miss my partnership with Chuck in working with the entire leadership team. I step down as CFO extremely confident in the strength of the business model and proud to know that business is in the capable hands of a great team, even stronger now with the addition of Bruce. Bruce and I will work closely together over the coming weeks to ensure a seamless transition. I would add it has been a pleasure working with all of you and I look forward to watching with great pride and satisfaction as Ulta's incredible growth and success story continues to unfold in the coming years. 
 Chuck? 
Carl Rubin: Thanks, Gregg. Finally, I'd like to finish by thanking our 15,000 passionate associates for making Ulta the place where our guests are increasingly choosing to shop. Or team's hard work and commitment to great service are the foundation for our steady market share gains and our strong financial performance. 
 With that, let me turn the call back to the operator to open up for your questions. Operator? 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Neely Tamminga from Piper Jaffray. 
Neely Tamminga: So my question here is one, at a very high level on Clinique, and I do want to ask a little bit more about ulta.com, if I may. First on Clinique, you guys have had the privilege of testing this for a little while within your organization. And you said, you have 13 stores now. Just wondering, as you look forward to the 30, 35 boutiques, will there be some meaningful changes to the size, scope and SKU on density of where you've been in the tests and where you're headed? Some contextualization around that would be really helpful. And then on ulta.com, I was just wondering, Chuck, if you could talk a little bit about maybe the dynamics of the dot com business in beauty. How big can this be, if you're willing to talk about that? Or just give us some sense of how big it is now and where you think you guys can take that particular growth initiative? That would be helpful. 
Carl Rubin: Sure, Neely, and thanks for your kind comments. Talk about Clinique first. We're pleased with our business that we've seen with them. We're pleased with the addition of these stores. In terms of the size and the scope, I don't want to go into too much detail on that because we're still in the process of getting these things put into our stores. But I would expect that they're going to look and feel similar to what we've done thus far. We highlight boutiques through the store as a whole. We've got other brands that are highlighted as well and we think that our guest really appreciates the ability to find some of those key brands in easy to shop kind of environment. So expect that it will look similar to what we've done thus far. As far as ulta.com, no we're not going to go into a lot more detail in terms of its current size. What we have said is it's small. It's too small. The way we think about this is along the digital front. And I've talked about this in a number of forums before. Digital has 2 parts of its -- 2 responsibilities, if you will. One is clearly to conduct more commerce and that's where ulta.com can deliver through e-commerce. But the second that digital has to do is support the brand as a whole and whether that's through allowing commerce to be conducted or whether that's communicating something about our products, or our services, or our locations, or stores, the test today, as you know, wants to interact with a retailer in a way that she wants to interact, whether it's going to a store or going online. So we need to have our digital assets continue to expand and that will manifest itself in significantly higher ulta.com sales, but it will continue to support the brick-and-mortar as well. The advantage that we have in our business, as you know, is this is an experiential business. We have that unique advantage of product and service in an environment that really is unique in the retail marketplace. So we think brick-and-mortar, we're big believers in brick-and-mortar and unlike some of the pipes of retail. But we know digital is a key component that will only grow in importance for us to reinforce Ulta as a whole. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Daniel Hofkin from William Blair & Company. 
Daniel Hofkin: I will echo Neely's comments across the board, just a great quarter. And Gregg, terrific to work with you all this time and Bruce, looking forward to working with you going forward. Just regarding a little follow-up on Clinique. If you can at this point, share with us a little bit about kind of the genesis of how you kind of got over to the next level with them, if you can describe that at all. And any learnings in the first year from Lancome that you think might be brought to bear? And then I have a follow-up question. 
Carl Rubin: Yes, Dan, it's Chuck. We're going to get to the follow up pretty quickly, because we're not going to get into details about each step of our relationship with Clinique. What I can tell you is that it's the same thing that I've said before. Our relationship with Clinique, as our relationship with all our brands and we carry, I don't know, close to 500 brands throughout the store, is really good. We're a fast-growing retailer. We have a great relationship with our guests. Our brands know that. They think that we are executing well, they support our strategy and that's true of Clinique, as well as Lancome, as well as every other brand that we do business with. So we are very pleased to be adding Clinique in these additional stores. We have gone out and specified the number of stores just so you all don't get carried away as you start to see these things showing up in stores. And as I said in my prepared comments, we think that Clinique and Lancome and Bare Essentials and Benefit Cosmetics and Urban Decay and Tarte, they blend together to really create a very powerful offering in the market. And when you throw in our services and then our service in the store as a whole, that is the core of what our business model is all about. And that's why we feel so bullish about the long-term growth potential for this company. So really happy to be adding stores with Clinique, but it's just one part of the equation. 
Daniel Hofkin: And then I guess my follow-up, on the gross margin in the quarter, were there any aspects that were different than you thought going in? Obviously, the sales coming in higher than you expected would tend to benefit the margin. Were there any things within the components that you described that were different one way or the other? 
Gregg Bodnar: No, nothing significant, Dan. We've been very pleased to be able to add 80 basis points of gross profit improvement, 180 basis points of operating margin expansion, particularly when you think about this time last year, what we were stepping over. We added over 300 basis points of operating margin expansion in the second quarter of last year, about 1/2 of that coming from gross profit, 1/2 of it coming from SG&A. So now overall, very pleased with the performance. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Matthew Fassler from Goldman Sachs. 
Matthew Fassler: My questions relate to Prestige. You're now going to have, it sounds like close to the same number of Clinique and Lancome stores up and running. I guess some more Lancome still. But are you finding that these programs have been launched in identical stores and there's a concentration of Prestige in a number of stores and markets? Are they spread throughout the chain in a way that would suggest kind of broader acceptance by the consumer? 
Carl Rubin: Matt, welcome to the group. The stores for Lancome and Clinique, we haven't released which stores those are because we're still in the process of putting them in and we, just from a competitive standpoint, think that we should hold off on that. There is -- Lancome in the first 29 doors, rolled out into those doors on a market-based approach. And I think for the most part, with the additional stores that we're adding in Clinique and Lancome, you will see that occur as well. It provides some additional efficiencies from an advertising standpoint and a staffing standpoint. So it's not completely congregated into a handful of markets, but for the most part, it is. And again, I would reinforce that as really happy as we are to be having these stores with both Lancome and Clinique, it is one part of our overall Prestige offering and our growth over this past, especially our accelerated growth over these past couple of years, has been fueled by the breadth of our existing Prestige offering, whether that's in cosmetics or in skin care. 
Matthew Fassler: And if I can please follow-up, investments that you're making in the buildout that you've made at this point and the buildout of the Prestige boutiques, the 400 or so stores, do those stores now have the capacity to absorb brands like this of this magnitude with no incremental or little incremental investment? 
Carl Rubin: Well, the 400 stores that we did some work in were not heavy capital intensive projects. We added fixturing of our existing fixturing type. We expanded some space. It provided more flexibility to us. We are committed still to not being bigger than our 10,000 square foot box. We do have great flexibility in that store format for adding brands, clearly depending upon the significance of the boutique that we build in the future, that could cost more money versus other efforts that we've put forth in expanding some secondary brands that cost less. So there's no real one answer that fits all scenarios. But the important thing is I think, from our viewpoint very important, is our store is very flexible. And to be adding these boutiques doesn't require heavy capital investments to reconfigure the store, as you might find in other store formats. So while the boutique may cost money, the store doesn't need a full redo. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Brian Tunick from JPMorgan. 
Brian Tunick: Just to repeat what I said last quarter, we're going to miss you Gregg and also welcome aboard, Bruce. So I guess -- I know guys don't comment on any intra-quarter trends, but there seem to be some worries out there regarding the category in May and especially June. So just wondering, if at all, your quarter was choppy or if it was just market share up for grabs. And if you saw some competitors doing anything from a promotional standpoint. That's the first question. And the second one, I guess, is on your stores. Just trying to understand maybe how your more mature stores or more mature class of stores are comping versus the chain average. And do you see upside to that 20% four-wall margin? I think you've  said before that your more matures peak at. And then finally, also, should we be thinking next year as an absolute number of stores, like 100 again next year, or more of a growth rate, somewhere 18%, 20%? 
Carl Rubin: Brian, you're getting your money's worth with 3 questions now. I'll take maybe the first and the third and I'll let Gregg talk to the second one. On the first part, yes, we're not going to comment on the inter quarter trends. What I'll tell you is, as we've said before, it's one of the beautiful aspects of our business model is we have Mass [ph] products, we have Prestige products, we have hair care. All different price points, all different categories of product, all different brands. So we have a lot of levers that we can pull. And clearly, in this past quarter, we pulled lots of those levers as we do every quarter. So we're very pleased with how we did. We know we gained a real significant market share across the board. As far as competitors, yes, there are a lot of competitors out there. We're not a vertical retailer. We carry things that other people carry, so we compete with a lot of different players and some of them are doing quite interesting things. But whether it's Mass [ph] to Prestige, or specialty, or online, there's a lot of players out there that clearly are trying to gain in this business. But we have defined a very good strategy. We've executed it incredibly well throughout the organization and that's what's allowed us to stay ahead of other players. As far as your third question on new stores, what we've said long term is that our goal is to grow our square footage at 15% to 20%. This year, we will end up growing faster than that because of the opportunities that were available. And as you've seen, we've said repeatedly that we are after quality above quantity and clearly with our new store performance, you can see that we've been able to get both. I would expect next year, that, that long term of 15% to 20% will be along those lines unless we find some opportunities that are very attractive. And I do expect that we'll give you more color on this on our next earnings call, but we are very, very pleased with both the quality and quantity that we're seeing for 2013's new stores. 
Gregg Bodnar: And Brian, just the older stores, I kind of characterize those as 6, 7-year-old stores that are kind of off the new store model that we run after 5 years. We're very pleased with the performance of those. They are trending with the 9% to 10% comp that we've been running. They are certainly trending above that model that we have out there, so very pleased with that performance. There shouldn't be any surprise because you think about a lot of the strategies that we're talking about that are driving the business, they not only benefit the performance of a new store, but they have the greatest benefit in the performance of some of those older stores because we're growing the loyalty club customer base. We're adding assortment, newness. We're using the loyalty program. We're developing a CRM strategy. All of those things benefit those stores, quite frankly, that are some of that older vintage because they have the most mature customer club base. And that's the heart or part of our strategy, certainly from a communications standpoint. As far as long-term, four-wall operating margin, we believe that there is longer-term runway in operating margin expansion as a company. We said in the next couple of years that we'll get to that mid-teen operating margin. We're obviously making good progress moving towards that this year. I think continuing to demonstrate credibility. We're less than halfway built out. As we continue to drive the productivity of those old boxes, the older boxes, 5, 6, 7-year-old stores, I expect there's more runway there. And I think that's also evidenced by the fact that you see, as we're accelerating our square footage or we're bringing all these younger stores into the store base, that our overall company sales productivity is continuing to move up. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Erika Maschmeyer from Robert W. Baird. 
Erika Maschmeyer: On the loyalty program, you're now talking about 10 million club members. Fairly recently, you talked about 9 million. It seems like the growth there accelerated. Is it a new program? Do you think the biggest factor there, or some of what you're doing on the marketing side or improved POS? I guess any sense there and kind of the rate you expect to see that accelerate or extend going forward. And then could you talk a little bit about the benefits you're seeing from the new loyalty program? Are we really -- are we seeing the benefits from that currently? Or I know you mentioned is a longer-term driver, do you expect it to be more of a back half in 2013 and after a type of benefit? And then just a quick follow-up on ticket. The contribution from ticket accelerated a little bit from last quarter and I guess anything to call out there besides mix? 
Carl Rubin: We'll take each one of those. So everyone's getting 3 questions, I guess, today. 
Erika Maschmeyer: Sorry, the first 2 really are sort of together. 
Carl Rubin: I think you were on maternity leave last call, so you get a bonus question this time. So loyalty -- our membership is accelerating because our business is accelerating. We're seeing more people come through. I don't think I'd necessarily connect it to the loyalty conversion in the central part of the country for us. But we're seeing more footsteps as we continue to have better comp business and we continue to grow our new stores that is more footsteps coming through. We are very pleased with that. It will continue to grow. We haven't talked about that goal to next year but clearly, we have high expectations of what this number will get to. I would remind everybody, because every retailer puts a different parameter on it, our 10 million members are 12-month active customers. So they've shopped within the past 12 months, which is a very rich file. The benefits of the loyalty program are very attractive. The conversion, we're encouraged by customer feedback, but that's going to -- the converted part of the country is going to take a little bit of time to materialize in terms of customer shopping behavior. But the longer-term component for the loyalty program throughout the company, which is ultimately to get to one program which will make it more efficient for us to market. But the advantage for the guest is very real. They have advanced notice of our events, they have promotions, advance notice of the promotions. There really is an incentive for her to continue to shop with us. That's the incentive for her. For us, we capture all of her shopping data, what she's buying, when she's buying, where she's buying it. And for us to be able to mine that data, which as I've talked about before is not the easiest thing in the world to do, but it is a very rich opportunity and we're making good progress on it. But it's a long-term opportunity for us, that's the really significant benefit for us. And we've seen benefits on our mining of the data thus far. We'll continue to see it accelerate in 2013 and it will continue on for years to come. That's one of the reasons that we went down this path on the CRM solution that we're starting the implementation on in the third quarter. 
Gregg Bodnar: And on the ticket front, Erika, it was driven by average selling price and units per transaction, a little bit more biased towards average selling price. As I said in the prepared remarks, we were stepping over a virtually nonexistent growth in average ticket last year versus the double-digit growth that we saw in traffic. So it's our strategies continuing to work. A little bit easier comparison on the ticket growth side, a little tougher comparison on the traffic side. Yet, still really, really strong growth on the traffic side this quarter. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Joe Altobello from Oppenheimer & Co. 
Joseph Altobello: Just to stay on that ticket collection, just so I understand, it's not as if consumers are moving from one higher-priced point category to another. It's that they are moving up in terms of price points within categories. Is that fair to say? 
Gregg Bodnar: Our strategy has continued to be, as we talked about this, is driving Prestige Color Skin. Certainly all the categories in the business, those are our primary focus. Average selling price is a little bit higher. There are multiple dynamics in this business as we drive customers into the store and sometimes that will benefit average selling price a little bit. And depending on some of the marketing and merchandising promotions during that quarter, could also benefit units, Joe. So it's a function of all the strategies that were driving the business. It's not a sea shift in the way the customer's shopping. 
Joseph Altobello: On that point again, it sounds like you guys have not seen any major change in the way your consumers are shopping over the last 3 to 6 months or so. 
Gregg Bodnar: No. We're continuing to drive very healthy growth in traffic into the stores, very healthy overall comp performance. The new stores are performing extraordinarily well. I'm very pleased on both fronts. 
Joseph Altobello: Just lastly, in terms of the strategy mix, and Gregg, when you guys first went public, one of the more attractive aspects of the story was the whole master class sort of offering, Mass [ph] to Prestige across the board. It sounds like over the last 6 to 12 months or so and maybe even before that, that the strategy has shifted or started to shift a little bit more towards Prestige and I imagine part of that is due to a response on your part to the Prestige consumer being a little bit stronger than the Mass [ph] consumer. Is that a fair assessment? And is that where the strategy is going a little bit more up market? 
Carl Rubin: I don't think I would put it that way, Joe. The foundation of our strategy is to carry Mass [ph] through Prestige, along with professional products. The mix of that has shifted more towards Prestige over time, but we're very proud of our Mass [ph] business. It's a very healthy part of our business, as we've talked about before. Most of our Mass [ph] business tends to be at the upper end of the Mass [ph] range. So it's not the very low entry point that many other retailers play out. So we tend to spend more time talking about the Prestige part of our business. But that's to the investment community. Internally, we spend a lot of time, we do a lot of work on the Mass [ph] side too. But the long-term part of our business is very much grounded in continuing to offer a Mass [ph], a Prestige, a Salon service and a Salon product component to our business. That is the unique secret sauce of what Ulta is that distinguishes us, along with our service experience, that's what distinguishes us in the market and there's no plan to shift away from that. 
Gregg Bodnar: Just remember, Joe. We know the way she shops, what Chuck describes is exactly the way the consumer shops. She shops across price points. She shops across categories, high to low. 
Carl Rubin: And again, the reason that we're so bullish about this business long term is that we have those levers to pull and we can react in terms of space allocation in a very flexible store model. We can change our advertising. We can change our offering, because we do offer that full breadth of the beauty market. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Jill Caruthers from Johnson Rice & Company. 
Jill Caruthers: A question on the boutiques. As you further expand this initiative, could you provide any details around the incremental list that these boutiques add to stores, whether it's on sales or profitability front? 
Carl Rubin: No, Jill, we won't go into that. What I can tell you is that obviously, for third quarter, our guidance reflects all that we see, not just from these boutiques, but throughout our business. I did call out that like anything else in our business, whether it's a new store, whether it's a new brand of product that we offer, whether it's even a new product within a brand, there's traditionally a ramp time to that and we expect that here as well. Obviously, we are pleased when we add a new brand to a store, whether it's an iconic brand or whether it's any other brand, there's an anticipation that it will be accretive to the store and beneficial to that guest experience within the store. And clearly, with things that we talked about today, whether it was Clinique, whether it was Lancome, whether it was Juice Beauty, whether it's Vichy or La Roche Posay, we expect those things to be accretive to the store and be better performers than anything we may have to reduce from the store. 
Jill Caruthers: And then just last question, you talked about the Salon business. Could you maybe talk about some of the other services that you provide? I know you've kind of been expanding your brow bars and the new -- the gel manicures and what. If you could just touch on those, I'd appreciate it. 
Carl Rubin: Yes. Well, as far as the offering, you just touched on a few of them. Obviously pretty much anything to do with hair; cut, color, perms, straightening, we do all of that. We do offer gel nail service in all of our stores now. It is kind of a modified manicure. We have facials, skin treatments, mini facials in all of our stores. We have been testing microderm abrasion in a handful of stores and I'm pleased with the initial results on that. So the service part of our business is very critical to our overall experience that we're trying to create. And I mentioned in my prepared comments that our guests come in to solve, for a solution, or to find something new, or to just enjoy themselves for the afternoon and our service part of the business is part of that enjoyment and part of that experience that we want to provide. We'll continue to test new things in the Salon as well as we have in the past year. We don't talk about them all on this call because some of them are small and some of them, quite honestly, like any test, we'll try it and may not work. But the things that was called out here, we feel good about and we think they complement the overall experience, both service and product at Ulta. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Evren Kopelman from Wells Fargo. 
Evren Kopelman: I wanted to ask about -- given the acceleration in the store growth this year, are you going to have more stores entering the comp base next year? How significant of a benefit can that be to the overall comp, assuming the younger stores comp better than the chain average? 
Gregg Bodnar: Evren, I wouldn't specifically quantify that. Obviously, it is going to provide some benefit because we do have a younger group of stores. But also keep in mind that as you think about this year headed into next year, some of the stores that we open this year, particularly in the first half of the year, will fall into the comp base. The 52 stores that we're opening in the third quarter this year, obviously will start to fall into the comp base in the third quarter next year. The biggest benefit’s going to come in the back half of the year next year. 
Evren Kopelman: And then 2 more, if I can. One of them is the new product innovation that's been pretty vibrant in the industry. As we begin to lap some of the strong growth numbers, do you think the pace of growth can be maintained? Are you seeing more new products, innovations coming in the pipeline? And then lastly, any update on your plans for the smaller 5,000 square-foot format? 
Gregg Bodnar: And Evren, just before Chuck answers, one other point you have to keep in mind too, which is built into our store model, keep in mind that every program, annual program, we are always opening stores in new markets and existing markets as well. And to a large degree, a lot of the -- any of the cannibalization, which we have a great deal of precision around, occurs in the existing markets. And it tends to also be in some of those older stores. Stores that are 5 or 6 years old. And that's the other reason why we're also very pleased with the performance we're seeing in some of those older stores that I mentioned in Brian's question earlier. 
Carl Rubin: Just to answer your other questions. On smaller stores, no, we have nothing to add on that. Clearly, with the amount of stores that we're opening right now and the boutiques, our focus has been on our 10,000 square-foot format. So as we -- at the appropriate time in the future, we'll talk more about that, but there's nothing to report on that right now. As far as on the new products, it's a big offering that we have. We have 20,000-plus products in a store and close to that online. There are always trends and when you look at an individual classification of products, sometimes comping against that trend may be difficult. So we have -- this past quarter, we went against Shatter nail polish from last year, which was huge. So the increases we saw in some of nail this year were more conservative. Like given the breadth of what we offer in skin care, in hair care, in color cosmetics and services, there's always something new and it's how we blend all of that out. So you can see, even though we went against Shatter nail polish last year, a big trend, we still delivered a 9 3 comp in the second quarter because we have this other newness. As far as newness going forward, I think what we see out there, I mentioned some of it in my prepared comments about what's coming for the third quarter, what we see tangibly in the next quarter or 2 looks exciting and what we've seen or discussed with vendors for 2013 also sounds exciting. So I don't think there's a shortage of new product in the pipeline. 
Operator: Our last question comes from Jason Gere from RBC Capital Markets. 
Jason Gere: Most of the questions have been answered, but I guess the one thing I was going to ask, you were talking about, in the fourth quarter, that there's an extra week. And I think you tried to quantify the sales of $35 million. Can you just walk me through? Like how does that impact the comp versus I guess what would be kind of new store sales? Maybe if you could just provide a little color and what does that come out to an EPS basis, that extra week? Is that like $0.05? I'm not sure if you mentioned that. 
Gregg Bodnar: So in our prepared remarks, we did mention that. I'll hit the last piece of that question first. It's $0.03 per share. It's about $35 million in extra sales volume. And simply what you do, a normal fourth quarter has 13 weeks. This year, our fourth quarter is going to have 14 weeks. When you add that extra week on the end, you will pick up an extra comparable week for the prior year and you will set that on in the denominator. So you're still going to have 14 weeks over 14 weeks and will have no impact on the comp other than the comp in that specific week. 
Operator: I'll now turn the floor back over to Chuck Rubin for closing comments. 
Carl Rubin: Thank you, operator. Thanks, everyone, for participating on the call. We will look forward to speaking with you on our next earnings call, if not before then. So thanks again very much. 
Operator: Thank you. This does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.

===== 2012 Q1  (2012-06-05 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Greetings and welcome to the Ulta Beauty's First Quarter Fiscal 2012 Earnings Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Ms. Laurel Lefebvre, President of Investor Relations for Ulta. Thank you. You may begin. 
Laurel Lefebvre: Thank you. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us for Ulta's first quarter 2012 conference call. Hosting our call are Chuck Rubin, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Gregg Bodnar, Chief Financial Officer. 
 Before we get started, I'd like to remind you of the company's safe harbor language. The statements contained in this conference call, which are not historical facts, may be deemed to constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

We will make references during this call to the metrics free cash flow, a non-GAAP financial measure defined as cash provided by operating activities minus purchases of the property and equipment. 
 With that, I will turn the call over to Chuck. 
Carl Rubin: Thanks, Laura. Good afternoon, everyone. I'm very pleased to announce that 2012 is off to an excellent start. Following our strong performance in 2011, the momentum continued in the first quarter with better-than-expected sales and earnings growth. 
 Just to recap the headlines, we grew with the top line 23% and drove same-store sales of 10.1% on top of double-digit comps in Q1 in the 2 previous years' first quarters. We achieved 200 basis points of operating margin improvement driven by our double-digit comp and our team's consistent and disciplined execution of margin expansion strategies translating it to 46% EPS growth for the quarter. We delivered this profit growth while investing in the business with the addition of 18 new stores, moving our improved loyalty program to 50% of the stores and opening a new distribution center to enhance our supply chain capabilities. All of these investments position us to continue to gain market share over the long term. 
 We are driving our business forward by executing on our 5-point growth strategy of accelerating store growth: introducing to our guests new products, services and brands; enhancing our loyalty program; broadening our marketing reach; and increasing our focus on ulta.com. These strategies delivered results in the first quarter and we believe will continue to fuel our growth into Q2 and beyond. 
 Let me spend a few minutes detailing the progress we've made on each component of our growth strategy. First, we are accelerating our store expansion and are on track to open about 100 new stores this year, representing 22% square footage growth. With the 18 new stores we will open during the quarter, we ended Q1 with 467 stores in 44 states. We've been very pleased with our real estate strategy and the productivity of our new stores and have just complete a robust analysis to update the store network potential. We now view the opportunity for our prototypical 10,000 square foot store in the U.S. market to be approximately 1,200 stores, up from our previous estimate of 1,000 stores. As such, we are currently less than 40% penetrated into the new store plan. 
 Just to give you a sense of the methodology behind the analysis, our real estate team has a terrific record of identifying great sites and getting stores open on time and on budget and they have a tremendous amount of data on trade areas and customer purchasing behavior that have allowed us to refine our view of the opportunity for the U.S. market's potential for a full-sized 10,000 square foot stores. Our updated analysis takes into consideration about a dozen demographic factors. We look at population density, household income and retail presence in the market, as well as valuable information mined from our loyalty program. This analysis is layered on top of deep knowledge of the local retail markets. A third layer of analysis consists of using performance data of the existing stores in our portfolio based on their market and site characteristics as a reliable predictor of performance with similar characteristics. Our new 1,200 store plan does not include smaller store formats or the potential for expanding outside of the U.S., both of which are incremental, longer-term opportunities. 
 Looking ahead to the second quarter, we are on track to open 22 stores and complete about 10 remodels. Our 2012 store plan is locked in and we are already developing a robust pipeline of sites for the 2013 opening program. Our Real Estate Team just came back from the ICSE Real Estate Conference very optimistic about the long-term opportunities on the market. We believe the discipline we have in selecting sites and opening stores enhances the potential for great returns for shareholders. 
 I'd like to emphasize that we will not, however, open stores for the sake of hitting a number. We always value quality over quantity, but we are very optimistic that very attractive real estate opportunities exist for us to achieve our 1,200 store build out for our current format. 
 Let me talk about our second growth strategy, the addition of new products, services and brands. In the first quarter, we continue to add excitement to our guest offering, which allowed us to gain market share across all major categories by providing the newness that our guests value and expect. The 3 components of capturing that newness to refocus on trend, adding new products from existing brands we already carry and introducing new brands to our portfolio. In Q1, we saw particularly strong trends in antiaging, mascara, lipstick and B.B. Creams. This last category of B.B. Creams is a very hot trend. These all-in-one products deliver protection, priming, coverage and flawless finish. We're seeing strong growth in this category with B.B. Creams from Too Faced, Stila, Smashbox, Boucheron and Garnier.
 The second newness factor is adding new products in existing brands. Here, we saw a continued strength in Prestige Cosmetics in particular. The new Naked 2 Palette from Urban Decay was a standout. Also strong in Q1 was the launch from Benefit of liquid foundation. In fact, this was one of Benefit's most successful product launches ever. I'd also like to note that in our Service business, we saw a strong performance from our Benefit brow bars, which are now in about 300 stores. We believe we have more brow bars than anyone else in the U.S., which provides our guest a fun and fast service for about $20. 
 Turning back to product, we introduced our exclusive Ck One cosmetic line to 50 Ulta stores along with ulta.com and are pleased with its performance. The Clarisonic line of skin cleansing tools continued to perform well in addition to everything else I've talked about. This do-it-yourself-at-home category also saw expanded success during Q1, with strong sales in Red Carpet gel manicure sets and the Remington i-Light Hair Removal System. Our online business in this Personal Care Appliance category, where we've tested some of these innovative personal care products, which sell at higher retail price, was particularly strong. 
 During the first quarter, we also added several new product brands to the assortment. Juice Beauty, an organic line that boasts scientific research supporting the efficacy of their products, was launched during the first quarter. Our guests are looking for organic products that deliver results and Juice Beauty is a sought-after brand with limited distribution. We also launched bath products from The Body Shop, Carol's Daughter skin and hair care products and Dr. Brandt in the Prestige skin category. 
 As we look to Q2, the newness in our offering continues. In Prestige Cosmetics, we are introducing Tarte's Maracuja Oil and Maracuja foundation, a new Benefit Snow White and the Huntsman kit, 68 shades of Urban Decay eyeshadow with a build-your-own palette and a new Super National Trend Collection from Bare Escentuals. 
 Light technology continues to drive innovation as well and we will add personal care products from Remington and Tanda to the assortment, targeting hair removal, acne treatment and wrinkle reduction. The B.B. Cream trend will be an area of focus with a new end cap in all stores, featuring B.B. Creams across all categories from mask to Prestige. 
 Finally, in our Prestige product offering, I'm pleased to tell you that we plan on adding Lancome boutiques to 50 additional stores, bringing the total number of stores offering Lancome to 79. We expect to open the vast majority of these new boutiques starting in the third quarter and completing before the important holiday selling season. These new boutiques are geographically targeted to enable us to market most effectively. 
 Additionally, in select stores, we plan to invest incremental capital in operating expenses in the Prestige area, which will allow us to expand our Prestige brand offering and add additional Prestige boutiques to these stores. We expect to provide more details on this during our next earnings call.  We are very excited by these actions as they will continue to strengthen our guest offering in the Prestige part of our business, which has been growing quickly and capturing market share.  In a few moments, Gregg will detail the short-term capital and P&L impacts of these long-term investments. 
 Let me touch on our Service business briefly. Salon continues to perform well, and we're very pleased with the strong positive comps we achieved. Newness was also a key driver of this strength. We launched Chromatics hair color by Redken in the first quarter, which sparked strong sales in cut and color services, as well as new guest acquisition. During Q1, we also finished the rollout of the gel nail service by OPI to all stores, which continues to add incremental sales as guests gain awareness of the offering. 
 Moving on to our third growth strategy, enhancing our loyalty program. With now well over 9 million active loyalty customers, this continues to be an incredibly valuable asset for Ulta as loyalty program customers shop more often and buy more with us overall. Just as important, the program gives us a highly effective means to communicate directly with our guests. At the end of the first quarter, we converted our central region to ULTAmate Rewards, which brings the number of stores on this new program to about half the chain. Our legacy loyalty program is certificate-based and at certain times during the year, guests choose a free gift from a list of predetermined products based on how much they've earned during that time frame. The new ultimate rewards program is a points-based program, which is far more flexible since guests can use their points on anything in the store whenever they want. 
 While we have been offering ULTAmate Rewards for a number of years, we recently made several enhancements to the program to add greater value to our guests. Since the points program is easier to understand and gives our guests more choices, we believe customers will appreciate the value of the program more. While still early, thus far, they are telling us they greatly enjoy the enhanced points-based program. We hope to move the balance of the stores to the new ULTAmate Reward program over the next 12 to 18 months. 
 As I have discussed previously, our loyalty club database provides us with a tremendous amount of information about our customers' shopping behaviors, what she buys, when she buys, where she buys. This is a significant asset for our company. The opportunity to harness that information in our guest targeting and communications is enormous as we seek a higher share of wallet. We are good today but we will significantly improve this capability over the long term. 
 Looking to the second quarter, we will continue to build on the personalization benefits that the loyalty program provides by launching an online rewards center that allows our guests to proactively manage their loyalty account. We also will enhance our POS terminals in-store to allow our cashiers to recognize and engage with our loyalty guests on a more individualized basis. 
 Our fourth growth strategy is to broaden our marketing reach beyond our historical strength in print advertisements. During Q1, we were pleased with the success of our 21 Days of Beauty promotion, which focused on Prestige's color, skin and special events in-store. We saw a solid performance of our gift with purchase offers for Valentine's Day and Mother's Day. We are also branching out into new areas to improve our marketing effectiveness. During the first quarter in the 21 Days of Beauty event, we supported it with radio, deeper public relations and social media. We continue to run national magazine print campaigns to remind customers of Ulta's brand positioning, Welcome to Fabulous, with targeted ads focused on beauty and spring trends. We are benefiting from the valuable relationship we established with Condé Nast about a year ago to communicate authority and credibility and position Ulta as a leader in beauty trends. 
 During Q1, we've conducted a multichannel editorial integration with a spring trend event curated from the beauty editors of Allure, Glamour, Lucky, SELF and Teen Vogue. This featured an integrated marketing program with direct mail, in-store signage and handouts, sweepstakes, e-mails and social media. On a public relations and digital media side, we drove brand awareness with participation in New York's fashion week, celebrity events with Katy Perry, Faith Hill and Tim McGraw; increased activity with Facebook, Twitter and Pinterest; and appearances on national television on shows like The View.
 In the second quarter, we'll continue to focus on expanding our marketing reach. Kicking this quarter off in partnership with Lucky, a Condé Nast title, we beat the Guinness Book of World Records for completing the most makeovers in 24 hours, and we're rewarded with 7 minutes of airtime on the Good Morning America morning program. Also in the second quarter, we have our Love Your Hair event, 14 days of special events and great deals that showed our guests how to get and maintain the latest hairstyle and color. This type of unique event which leverages our product and service offering is what our guests want, and we believe we are the only national retailer that can bring this to life for her. 
 For the balance of the second quarter, we're planning a strong Father's Day season with a compelling gift with purchase fragrance offer, offers for back to school season late in the quarter and the national print advertising campaign for B.B. Creams. Our marketing program will continue to harness print, direct mail, e-mail, digital, social and broadcast.  Also, a new store end cap Program that highlights new brands, new trends and great value will make our experiential shopping environment more exciting. 
 The fifth leg of our growth strategy is our focus in ulta.com. The opportunity is not only to generate higher e-commerce sales but to become a true multichannel retailer to drive the Ulta brand, both in the physical and virtual environments. From a small base, ulta.com continued its strong momentum in Q1, with solid increases in sales and traffic. During the quarter, we continue to see good performance with our Wednesday Limited Time Beauty Break offers, which we've worked with our vendors to strategically place around certain launches, new items and seasonality.  On the technology side, I mentioned that we have built and launched a rewards portal, and we are working on further system enhancements to ensure a highly stable platform, faster page loads and improved site monitoring analytics. 
 Looking ahead, we are investing in people, customer service and technology to build a strong web presence that supports the Ulta brand and delivers a consistent multichannel customer shopping experience. 
 With a great start to the year, we believe that 2012 will again deliver strong growth in sales and earnings for Ulta as we continue to provide a unique offering and in-store experience that is fueling consistent market share gains. The 5 pillars of growth we've been executing on are still in the early stages, with many years of anticipated store growth ahead, an excellent pipeline of new product and service launches and adding new brands to the portfolio, a compelling improved loyalty program to roll out to the rest of the chain with a significant opportunity to improve the effectiveness of customer data mining; plenty of opportunities to drive customer awareness and acquisition in all of our markets; and a dot com business still in its infancy. We believe all of these drivers will fuel our growth in 2012 and in the years to come. We will also continue to be very disciplined in expense management and maintaining a healthy balance sheet, enabling self-funded growth and free cash flow generation. 
 With that, let me turn the call over to Gregg for a more in-depth review of the financials. 
Gregg Bodnar: Thanks, Chuck. Our first quarter results were driven by better-than-expected sales and margin performance. We delivered a 22.8% increase in total sales, with strength across all categories, reflecting continued market share gains. 
 Same-store sales increased 10.1% on top of an 11.1% comp in Q1 of last year. Consistent with previous quarters, the comp came primarily from traffic, up 8%, with a 2% increase in average ticket. 
 Gross profit dollars increased 27% to $171 million, with gross profit margin up 110 basis points to 36%, driven by continued improvement in merchandise margin and leverage in PIK store costs on a strong comp. 
 SG&A expenses increased 17% to $111 million, down 110 basis points as a rate of sales to 23.4%. This improvement was driven by leverage from strong comps and execution of our margin expansion strategies. 
 Preopening expense was up $1.3 million to $2.5 million as a result of our accelerated store opening program, with 18 new stores compared to 5 in Q1 2011, negatively impacting EPS in Q1 this year by about $0.01. 
 Operating margin improved by 200 basis points to 12.1% versus 10.1% last year, driven by our team's relentless focus on disciplined execution and delivery of our margin expansion strategies. Interest expense was immaterial, primarily representing fees associated with our credit facility, which remains unused. 
 Our tax rate was 39.3% versus 40.1% last year. The slightly lower tax rate was driven by a decrease in nondeductible stock option expense. 
 Net income increased 49.7% to $34.9 million or $0.54 per diluted share versus $23.3 million or $0.37 per diluted share in last year's first quarter. 
 Now turning to the balance sheet and cash flow, merchandise inventories at the end of the quarter were $332.1 million compared to $255.5 million at the end of the first quarter last year, up about 9.6% on a per-store basis. We continue to effectively manage our inventory, and we're happy to maintain inventory growth slightly below our comp growth, particularly in light of the fact that we delivered a stronger-than-expected comp and successfully opened our new Northeast distribution center. The majority of the 9.6% per store average inventory increase was to support the opening of our third DC. Excluding the investment to open a new facility, per store average inventory increased approximately 4%, well below our comp growth of 10.1%. The Northeast DC team has executed an excellent launch, and as the facility ramps up their operations, our incremental DC inventory investment will subside as we rebalance between the facilities in the back half of the year. All of this effort is part of our plan to integrate the new DC into our overall supply chain. As a result, we will continue to manage our per store inventory growth at a rate well below our comp growth rate as the new DC becomes fully integrated into our supply chain. 
 Chambersburg is already delivering excellent productivity and is on track to enable our expanded distribution network to achieve meaningful reductions in transportation costs. We expect to see these benefits from our network improvements in Q4, contributing to our overall margin expansion strategies. 
 Capital expenditures for the first quarter were $24.8 million compared to $19.5 million in Q1 of 2011, driven by our accelerated store opening program. Depreciation and amortization was $21 million. 
 Now turning to our outlook for the second quarter. We currently estimate sales in the range of $466 million to $473 million versus $395 million last year. We anticipate the comp store sales will increase in the range of 6% to 8% on top of the 11.3% comp in Q2 of 2011 for a 2-year comp in the range of 17.3% to 19.3%. New store openings are expected to be 22 versus 21 new stores in Q2 of last year. We expect our earnings-per-share will be in the range of $0.49 to $0.51, including $0.02 negative impact from the planned addition of Prestige brand boutiques and the expenses associated with the startup of our Chambersburg DC. This compares to EPS of $0.38 in Q2 of 2011. 
 Gross profit margin is expected to increase approximately 80 basis points at the midpoint of the guidance range, driven by improvement merchandise margin and leverage of big store expenses, partially offset by the costs associated with our new DC and accelerated depreciation for the previously mentioned expansion of Prestige brand boutiques. 
 SG&A is expected to decrease around 50 basis points as a rate of sales at the midpoint of the range versus last year's 23.0% rate. Preopening expenses are expected to be approximately $4.3 million, up $500,000 compared to last year's second quarter. As a result, operating margin is expected to increase approximately 130 basis points at the midpoint of the range. 
 We expect our tax rate to remain at approximately 39.5%, and we anticipate the fully diluted share count to be approximately $64.5 million. Looking ahead to the full year 2012, given the strength we saw in Q1, we expect to deliver strong results ahead of our long-term financial goals. We expect to achieve comp store sales growth in the range of 7% to 8%, about 200 to 300 basis points above the high end of our long-term goal of 3% to 5%. 
 As a reminder, fiscal 2012 is a 53-week year for us. The extra week is included in the fourth quarter and represents approximately $35 million in sales. We expect to deliver net income growth above the high end of our long-term target of 25% to 30%, including the negative impact from our accelerated new store program, the new DC and the addition of new Prestige brand boutiques. The full year impact of these factors is approximately $0.89 per share of additional operating expense. Partially offsetting these impacts the benefit of the 53rd week operating results, which is approximately $0.03 per share. 
 We are on track to open about 100 stores and to complete 21 remodels in our plan for this year. In terms of store openings by quarter, after pulling some stores forward into Q1, we currently expect to open 22 stores in Q2, 48 stores in Q3 and 12 stores in Q4. Preopening expenses will be about $4.3 million in Q2, $7.5 million in Q3 and $2 million in Q4. Our Real Estate Team has been very successful in pulling as many store weeks forward as possible with the goal of getting stores opened earlier in the year and ramped up to benefit as much as possible from the Q4 holiday selling season. 
 Total preopening expense for fiscal 2012 is expected to be approximately $16 million compared to approximately $10 million in fiscal 2011, representing an incremental $0.06 per share impact in 2012. Capital expenditures in 2012 are expected to be approximately $180 million, which is about $51 million higher than our capital expenditure program in 2011. This increase is driven by the acceleration of our store expansion program, store remodels and about $10 million incremental capital investment for the expansion of the Prestige brand boutiques. 
 Depreciation and amortization will be approximately $90 million. As you know, we paid a special dividend of approximately $62 million in May. We have ample liquidity to continue to invest in the business. We expect to generate free cash flow again this year and as always, we will evaluate the best use of any excess cash position. 
 Looking ahead to next year, we expect the investments we're making in the business this year to allow us to build upon our current success, continue to gain market share and be a leader in the beauty retail space. We'll benefit in 2013 from the acceleration of store openings this year, with about 100 new stores, which will contribute to total sales, comps, profitability and cash flows versus the 60 stores benefiting 2012. We'll see our investment in a new DC payoff in 2013 after being a drag on earnings this year, and we'll also see the benefits of additional Prestige brand boutiques. 
 In summary, we are investing appropriately to continue to drive performance in 2013. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Chuck. 
Carl Rubin: Thanks, Gregg. In closing, I'd like to thank all of our associates for making Ulta a compelling shopping environment for our guests. It's a result of their hard work that we gained market share, delivered excellent financial performance and further positioned Ulta as a true beauty destination. 
 With that, I'd like to turn the call over to the operator so we can open up for questions. Operator? 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Ike Boruchow with JPMorgan. 
Ike Boruchow, Jr.: I'm calling in for Brian today. Chuck, I guess this one's for you. When you look at the business, it's been really very consistent with the comps and the double-digit range for a little over 2 years now, I think. I think last year, you benefited a lot because you were on trend with the nail products and nail services which were hot. Is there anything new out there today that you're seeing that's really trendy and are you going after that? Just trying to see what's driving that comp right now. 
Carl Rubin: Well, I mentioned some of the things in the first quarter, antiaging products, B.B. creams, mascara, lips were all big trends. We think that, that continues and we're excited about the back half of the year. There's a lot of new product launches in the third quarter that's still coming in into the fourth quarter. So it's a combination, Ike, of the new products from existing brands that we've talked about, some of the new services that we've put in. In our Salon business, comps have continued to improve. They're running very well. And then it's the new brand introductions. So all of those things are -- continue to be very good. One thing I mentioned in my prepared comments that I should call out, these at-home tools by Clarisonic, the hair removal, the acne treatment that I talked about that's coming, it's a small part of our business, but they're high ticket and we're selling a good number of units and it's having a nice impact to overall sales dollars. So that's also a trend that we start to see emerging stronger in the first quarter. 
Ike Boruchow, Jr.: Okay, great. And then one more follow-up. On the store rollout, you mentioned you're taking it from 1,000 to 1,200 domestically. You said that does not include international markets. I guess on a high level, Chuck, could you talk about what potential down the road, several years from how opportunities there could be in international markets? I mean, does your format really work in other countries? And then I guess, so then there on the store base. When we look out to 2013, should we be thinking about 100 stores as kind of the run rate? Or is 20%, 22% growth kind of the run rate for the business going forward? 
Carl Rubin: Let me answer the second one first. What we've said is that our business model's built on a 3% to 5% comp, 15% to 20% square footage growth. So we're pleased with how 2013 is setting up right now, but it's still early for that. So we'll update you as the year progresses. But our long-term guidance is that 15% to 20% growth this year. This year being 2012, we are growing at 22%, so obviously higher. If we can find the sites that are very attractive, and I stressed in my comments that we're looking for quality not quantity, if we can find those sites, we have the balance sheet to be able to do it. We have the capability to do it. And most importantly, there's the customer demand to do it. So we will pursue it as we see appropriate. And we're encouraged by what we're seeing, but it's still early for 2013. So just remember our 15% to 20% long-term guidance. As far as the international, yes, I think that there is an opportunity for Ulta's model overseas. But I would stress that when you look at the 3 big buckets of opportunity, those being U.S. stores, the second being U.S. digital and the third being international, clearly, that third bucket of international is the lowest of the 3. And it's the longest term. So we have significant growth opportunities for a number of years ahead of us to get to that 1,200 store count. There's the potential of a smaller store format. And clearly, while our digital business is growing quickly, it is on a small base. So that U.S. business, digital and physical, is really what our focus is for the near to midterm time frame. 
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Daniel Hofkin with William Blair & Company. 
Daniel Hofkin: I just -- maybe one thing I wanted to ask. If I look at the new store economics model that you guys have provided periodically, and clearly, the cost side of it in recent years has certainly improved as has the nothing but total sales volume, if you will. I guess one question would be, just based on the math and if you look at the percentage of stores that are in different age groups, it would seem like you would likely be exceeding your plan right now, kind of across various age buckets, that you would be exceeding that model. Is that fair to say? And the reason I say that is if you just sort of use the numbers in the model in terms of year 1 or year 2 comp sales growth, you're left with very high comps in years 4 or year 5 and beyond, and I'm just curious what your thoughts are on that? 
Gregg Bodnar: Dan, the way to think about that is stores that are 5 years and older are performing meaningfully above what you would expect kind of over the long-term or the normal, if you will. Those stores in our model, 6, 7, 8 years out, we expect to produce more like low-single digits. The fact of the matter is all of the strategies that Chuck referred to that have been driving our business have a meaningful impact on mature stores. So and you could argue have one of the largest impacts on mature stores, because a big part of that is reaching out to our loyal customer base, where the largest quantity is, is in a mature store 5 years or older. So back to the macro on the store model. Yes, the cost will become down. We're still building them for $900,000. The productivity of sales per square foot is getting slightly better as we improve company operating margins, not all of it, but a significant part of that contributes to the single-store returns because a big part of that affects the 4-wall contribution of a store. So the store model keeps getting better. 
Daniel Hofkin: Okay, I appreciate it. That's a helpful color. And then I guess one follow-up would be if you can share anything about your expectation at this point for the incremental Lancome boutiques in terms of looking out a year? Or sort of what your expectation -- do you expect that to show up materially in the aggregated comp sales number now that you'd be at a larger number of stores with those boutique? 
Carl Rubin: Dan, we added the 29 doors last fall with Lancome, so we're very pleased to be adding these 50. We've commented before that we're pleased with our performance with the iconic brands. These 50 will get up starting in the third quarter. It will -- we expect to have them all done as the heat of the holiday season is upon us. I think the impact for this year is minor, it's negligible. I think that as you look out into future years, we believe that it's a nice addition to our offering. It will be in 79 doors once these 50 open. We'll see what happens from there but we're very pleased, as is Lancome, with the level of sales and the type of guests that we're introducing to Lancome that's good for both us as well as the brand. 
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Jill Caruthers with Johnson Rice. 
Jill Caruthers: Following on the last question, the incremental $10 million of CapEx you're devoting to expansion of boutiques and whatnot, could you talk about, is that just supporting Lancome or is it supporting existing Prestige or potential upcoming new Prestige brands? 
Carl Rubin: It's a little bit of all. So obviously, opening the 50 boutiques for Lancome is costing us capital and some OpEx to get those open. But as I said in my comments, in a select number of additional doors, we are making some investments into the Prestige arena, which will accommodate our ability to expand future boutiques. So that all is included in the $10 million that Gregg called out. 
Jill Caruthers: Okay. And then just a follow-on the increased long term store potential domestically. The incremental 200 stores that you found through further evaluation, is that focused on particular regions or is it basically broad-based? 
Carl Rubin: It's broad-based in the contiguous U.S., the 48 states. 
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Joseph Altobello with Oppenheimer. 
Joseph Altobello: Just a couple of quick questions. I guess first, in terms of the new counters to Lancome, what brand or brands are they going to be displacing first? And then secondly, what are the price points of these products relative to department stores? 
Carl Rubin: The price points relative to department stores are the same. This isn't so much a price-based business. This is experience- and service-based business. So the retail prices, everyone prices it as they see fit, but typically, our prices are consistent to what you would find at a department store. But our service model, we believe, is for our guests a better one. As far as displacement, I think we've talked before that our store, the average store size is about 10,000 square feet and it's a pretty flexible store format so we can move things around. So we go through an ongoing review of product and brand performance, and there were always things being added and things being removed. So I wouldn't call it specific brands that are going out, but I would say that the addition of Lancome into these 50 doors is a bit of the same process that we go through on an ongoing basis of refining the productivity and continuing to add new brands and new products and eliminating things that aren't performing. It's that process, maybe a little bit on steroids, but it's an ongoing effort that we'll follow to get the space for these 50 boutiques. 
Joseph Altobello: Got it, okay. And in terms of the new DC in Chambersburg, you guys have mentioned that it's supposed to weigh a little bit on gross margin this year and I would imagine be some of it beneficial next year. Could you quantify maybe how much that that's going to reduce gross margin this year and maybe how much it will help on 2013? 
Gregg Bodnar: We said for the full year, it'll have a slight negative impact, so about 10 basis points. And then for next year, I would expect that negative 10 basis points could be 20, 30 basis points positive depending on how fast we can get it ramped up headed into next year. Typically, a DC in its first 12 months is where it gets its biggest productivity gains, but that's kind of where its maturing cycle is. So it takes 12 plus months to get to the productivity of an existing DC. Certainly, we put some equipment in this distribution center just to kind of better the operations versus our current distribution center. So overall, I'd expect its productivity to meet and surpass the other DCs. 
Joseph Altobello: So by next year, you'll be back to reducing inventory on a per door basis,  I would imagine? 
Gregg Bodnar: Not on inventory, Joe. This is operating costs. So this is driving margin improvement. 
Joseph Altobello: Right, but I would imagine this would also help on the inventory side as well? 
Gregg Bodnar: No, not necessarily.  You do wind up with a little bit of a benefit because you have a distribution center that's closer to stores. It reduces a little bit on lead time, but it's not material. 
Carl Rubin: Just add to that, Joe. Right now, if you look at the overall numbers that we put out, our inventory increased on a per-store basis by about 9% versus our 10% comps. So they were relatively close. If that's what you're talking about reducing, I think you'll see the gap between inventory per store growth and comp to be larger. If you take that 9% though and remove the Northeast DC impact, the per-store inventory was up about 4%. So I think that's where Gregg was going, that if you extract that Northeast DC part, that's how you should really consider that inventory per store will move in line with sales comps. 
Gregg Bodnar: So walk that forward, Joe, in my prepared remarks, I said that when you pull out the Northeast DC by the end of first quarter inventory, the effect of that proceeding it to start shipping stores, we were up 4% on a 10% comp. As we work that DC into our network and rebalance inventories across the 3 DCs, adding stores into that Chambersburg facility, taking them out of other DCs, we'll continue to rebalance that inventory across the chain. But it still does take some incremental inventory as we add stores in our supply chain. When you go to next year, our philosophy will remain consistent. We need to make sure that we're providing a superior experience for guests, appropriate in-stocks, presentations, et cetera. So I expect that our inventory on a per-store basis will continue to be below our comp growth. But I don't expect it to decline. You certainly will get a little bit of an abnormal comparison in the first quarter next year because you'll be cycling against the 9.6 for the new DC this year. 
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Jason Gere with RBC Capital Markets. 
Jason Gere: Just I guess the first question, thinking about the trends, the comp sales over the quarter, when you look at February, March, April, I know we've heard some retailers saying that, "Hey, some of the strong trends we saw in February, March kind of reversed a little bit in April." So I guess I was wondering if you could provide the cadence of maybe the quarter and then maybe how March kind of shaped up? And then I have a follow-up question. 
Gregg Bodnar: Jason, for a lot of reasons, we don't report comps on a monthly basis. So we don't get into the cadence during the course of the quarter. And as for a ride, we've never done that. We move to marketing calendar around from time to time. So there can be impacts that are driven by as we optimize the marketing events and the marketing calendar. So we don't get into intra-quarter comp flow. 
Jason Gere: Is there -- I mean, could you just maybe qualitatively say, is there anything in the March -- I mean, sorry, in the May period that would give you any reason to pause the strong trends you're seeing, that there's anything out there macro-wise? I guess I'm saying it doesn't sound it, but I guess that's just something that obviously everybody's kind of fearing right now with just the U.S. economy, too? 
Carl Rubin: You mentioned May. May is in our second quarter. And that would be incorporated into the guidance that we gave. So I would remind everyone that firstly, this is a pretty resilient business model. We have a lot of levers that we can pull. We have a broad range of prices, a broad range of product categories. We feel very good about the things that we can control. Obviously, we live in a broader economic environment and we understand some of the things that are going on in the world in general. To the best of our ability, that's all incorporated into our guidance that we gave in the second quarter. So we wouldn't break it down into what we're seeing thus far that's reflected already in the guidance we gave. 
Jason Gere: Okay. Okay, fair enough. And then I guess just the other thing. Gregg, I'm not sure if you talked about the timing of the remodels, the 21 over this year. So we didn't see any in the first quarter. What's the flow of that through the course of the year? I'm sure you said it, I apologize. 
Gregg Bodnar: No, I didn't. 10 in Q2 and 11 in Q3. 
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Jacob Zitter with Robert W. Baird. 
Jacob Zitter: I'm calling in for Erika Maschmeyer. First, could you just quickly break out the components of gross margin expansion in the quarter? 
Gregg Bodnar: Sure. We were up 110 basis points, and about 80 basis points of that's coming from merchandise margin and the rest coming from fixed door expenses. 
Jacob Zitter: Okay, great. And then just a follow-up on the Prestige initiative. These stores, these are the ones that have already been remodeled but maybe not to the latest level 7 format? 
Carl Rubin: There's a cross-section of stores. I would tell you that out of our store base at the end of first quarter, about 85% of those stores are either a level 6 or a level 7 are two -- we consider those our current format. That roughly 85% of the mix being in level 6 or level 7 compares to about 75% a year ago. So between the combination of new stores and the remodels that we've done, we're making very good progress. Lancome and these other Prestige investments that we're making, they will not go into anything older than a level 6 store. So they'll all be in a 6 or a 7. So essentially, they're going into our current format. 
Jacob Zitter: Okay, great. And then just lastly, it sounds like the Salon business is picking up steam. Did the comps sequentially improve there? And do you think maybe services like the OPI nail gel is lifting other parts of the Salon business? 
Carl Rubin: Yes, I think that -- a few things. The newness in the Salon, the OPI nail gel, the introduction with Redken of this Chromatics hair service, a lot of programs of training and some greater marketing that we've done in the salon, I think all of them have contributed to some of the improved performance. Clearly, in general, this is a tough business in the industry as a whole. As when you look at other public companies as they release their results, we're very pleased with our performance, and it's been an improving part of our business over the past few quarters. 
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Evren Kopelman with Wells Fargo. 
Evren Kopelman: I wanted to ask if you're seeing any changes, demographic changes in your new additions maybe to your loyalty program for age-wise or ethnicity-wise? 
Carl Rubin: No. We run a pretty broad demographic customer base. And we go from teens to 60s. Obviously, the sweet spot is in the 30s, but both quantitatively and qualitatively, you really do see a broad cross-section of people. It's not a typical spiky kind of bell curve. When you stand in our store and you watch, you typically see women shopping in groups. It's either a mother and a daughter or 2 friends shopping. So pretty broad, widely distributed in terms of age. Certainly, the ethnicity represents the market that we do business in. Our average income customer tends to be upper income. Our average income is in the $70,000 range, a little bit above. So that -- and that really continues to be the case with the new customers as we open new stores, as well as expand our loyalty database. 
Evren Kopelman: Great. And then on when we look at the store maturity, what it used to be historically, as your brand awareness continues to increase, are you seeing maybe a faster store maturity pace? And lastly, with the accelerating new store openings, how is the rent environment that you're seeing? 
Gregg Bodnar: Evren, on the store maturity, as the brand grows in awareness, I think there is much more opportunity in front of us even with 467 stores, 1,200 target for the U.S. There's much more opportunity to drive comps all the way through the maturity curve by increasing brand awareness. So I think more of that opportunity is in front of us than we're realizing today. As far as rents go, it's been pretty even. We have a concept that the customer seeks and the developer community seeks. We have a strong balance sheet that ensures that the developer's actually going to see execution in the leases and get payment. So I think it provides a good balance for our dealmakers to negotiate in this environment. 
Operator: Our final question comes from the line of Randy Konik with Jefferies. 
Amanda Sigouin: This is Amanda Sigouin on for Randy. Just a question around the new 1,200 store target, your in-depth analysis around that, just curious, has it opened up kind of new markets for stores or if it's more going to be you see that you can cluster stores more in certain markets? 
Carl Rubin: I think both. As our -- the cost of getting these stores opened has improved as we've continued to add more data to our loyalty file, as we've continued to learn more about refining the market size that we can operate a store in. All of those have demonstrated that there are markets that potentially a couple of years ago, the company thought were too small to support in Ulta but we believe now they can, or we can congregate them into a market a bit tighter that had been thought of at one point. So this analysis, we spend a little bit of time just giving you some sense of the depth of that analysis. A lot of work and thought has gone into it, and we're very encouraged that the 1,200 number is out there. We're also very confident that it can be realized over time. 
Gregg Bodnar: And keep in mind, that's also based on the data that we have and based on the actual performance in those examples that Chuck cited. 
Amanda Sigouin: Great. And then just a follow-up on the E-Commerce business. I'm trying to get a sense of kind of how longer-term that could fit in as well? I know it's fairly small today. I guess, how do you -- are you doing anything different to drive traffic to your website? And kind of in the next 3 to 5 years, how big do you think it could overall as a part of your business? 
Carl Rubin: Well, it can be a lot bigger. I would remind you of the following. One, it is growing very quickly but it is a small base. I also would remind you that it serves 2 purposes. Our digital effort serves 2 purposes. One is clearly, there is more e-commerce revenue to be done. And that number should be significantly higher than what we have today in terms of our revenue. But the second is to reinforce Ulta as a brand to our customer and bring to life our brand to that customer and augment what we do in stores. So the buzz terms out there are multichannel or omni-channel.The reality is, in our business, which is a very emotional experiential category, digital complements what we do in our stores and what we do -- what we can do through our e-commerce effort. What we need to do digitally is bring that experience to life for our customer, whether that's shopping, actually enabling her to spend money or whether it's providing a community for her to talk to and learn from, whether it's providing trend information, provide that physically in our stores but virtually through our digital efforts as well. And that's the second purpose of our e-commerce effort of our, I should call it ulta.com effort. So one is a revenue increase, which should be significant, and the second is to bring the Ulta brand to life to the customer, where and how she wants to engage with us. 
Operator: We have no further questions at this time. 
Carl Rubin: Okay. Well, let me thank everybody for your interest in Ulta and joining us on the call today. And we will look forward to speaking with you at the end of next quarter in September. Thanks so much. 
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.

===== 2011 Q4  (2012-03-08 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Greetings, and welcome to the Ulta Salon, Cosmetics & Fragrance, Inc. Fourth Quarter 2011 Earnings Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Allison Malkin, of ICR. Thank you. Ms. Malkin, you may begin.

We will make references during this call to the metrics free cash flow, a non-GAAP financial measure, defined as cash provided by operating activities minus purchases of property and equipment.
 Now, I would like to turn the call over to Ulta's President and CEO, Carl Rubin. 
Carl Rubin: Thanks, Allison. Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us to discuss our fiscal 2011 fourth quarter and full year results. On the call with me today is our Chief Financial Officer, Gregg Bodnar. Following my opening remarks, Gregg will review in more detail our fourth quarter and full year financial results and provide our outlook. I will then offer some closing comments and turn the call over to the operator so that we can answer the questions you have for us today.
 The fourth quarter concluded another outstanding year of growth at Ulta. We surpassed the sales and earnings guidance we provided in our holiday release in January and delivered our second consecutive year of double-digit comp store growth, while growing our operating margin and net income at a rate far faster than our sales growth. Our consistent strong performance validates the success of our customer offering, the motivation of our marketing and the power of our operating model. I am proud of all that we have accomplished in fiscal 2011, and equally confident in our ability to continue our favorable performance in 2012 and beyond.
 Briefly touching on the highlights of our fourth quarter results, net sales rose 23% to $582.5 million from $473.7 million last year. Comp store sales increased 11.5% following a comp increase of 10.4% last year for a 2-year comp gain of 21.9%. Comp growth was mostly driven by traffic increases with average selling price rising slightly. Gross profit margin rose 100 basis points, inclusive of a 40 basis point expansion in merchandise margin. Strong sales growth, combined with expansion in gross profit margin and leverage in SG&A, led to a 49.5% increase in operating income with operating margin of 230 basis points to 12.6% of net sales. Net income increased by 53.8% and income per diluted share increased to $0.73 from $0.49 in the fourth quarter last year. Our strong sales resulted in additional market share gains during the quarter across all of our major categories as more customers continue to choose Ulta instead of other shopping venues for their beauty needs and wants. Our growth during Q4, as well as all of 2011, was driven by our 5 key growth initiatives.
 Let me provide some color on each. First, we continued our new store expansion by opening 7 stores in the quarter for a total of 61 new stores opened in 2011. This represented a 16% net expansion in square footage for 2011 and resulted in a year end store count of 449. Additionally, we remodeled 17 stores for the year. We are very pleased with the performance of both our new and remodeled stores. Our second growth initiative is the continued enhancement of our guest offering, especially through the addition of new products, new brands and new services.
 During Q4, our sales were strong across categories with Prestige skin, Prestige makeup and fragrance, leading the way. A few noteworthy strengths included our new and exclusive holiday gift sets from Urban Decay, Benefit, Tarte, bareMinerals and Ulta. New fragrances from FENDI, Vera Wang Princess Night and continued strength from Justin Bieber Someday and Taylor Swift Wonderstruck in the successful growth of new brands and products introduced in Q3, including Laura Geller, Art of Shaving and the Mia 2 from Clarisonic.
 Our third growth initiative of expanding our marketing reach also contributed to our strong sales. During Q4, we enhanced our special eventing that combines our product and service offering into a fabulous guest experience that highlights our unique beauty offering. Our January skin care event, our brand-specific days that have in our stores and our lunchtime specials at ulta.com are all examples of our marketing events, which animate the experiential shopping experience that Ulta offers. Our Q4 marketing program also included blockbuster gift with purchases, including our popular holiday robe, along with the new ice bucket and wineglass gift set. Our Q4 sales were also supported by our first national holiday radio campaign that reinforced our Ulta brand awareness in addition to driving urgency for the holiday shopper.
 And finally, we built upon our already strong direct mail efforts by utilizing our loyalty club database. Leveraging this growing loyalty club membership is our fourth growth initiative. During the fourth quarter we surpassed 9 million active members. As I have previously said, harnessing the power of this rich file of customers is a long-term focus for us, which will allow us to better personalize our marketing outreach while driving higher sales. We made solid gains in Q4 through better custom targeting of all of our direct mail marketing pieces, including our first ever Prestige Fragrance Mailer.
 Finally, our fifth growth initiative to build our e-commerce and digital capabilities continue. Our digital sales during the quarter were strong, albeit still off of a modest base. We continue to better integrate our marketing campaigns across all our customer touch points to consistently reinforce the Ulta experience across channels, from brick-and-mortar to e-commerce to social media. We have great opportunity in this area and are only in the early stages of maximizing our potential.
 Turning to Salon, we achieved a solid positive comp in the quarter, in part, driven by more frequent marketing and new service offerings. One example was our service launch of nail gel by OPI to approximately 200 stores. This is a new incremental service that augments the salon experience we offer our guests. We are pleased that we were the exclusive national retailer to launch this service, and based on our strong initial results, we are rolling out to the balance of the chain in Q1.
 Turning to our balance sheet, our year-end position is very strong with $253.7 million in cash and no debt. Inventory was down 3% on a per-store basis, and we generated over $90 million in free cash flow. In recognition of our ability to generate strong cash flow while investing in our accelerated store opening program and the people and infrastructure to support our long-term growth, our Board of Directors approved a $1 per share special cash dividend payable to shareholders of record as of March 20, 2012. 2011 certainly was a fabulous year for Ulta. Total sales increased 22.1% with comp store sales up 10.9%. Operating margin expanded 280 basis points to 11%, moving us closer to our mid-teens goal. And diluted earnings per share rose to $1.90, up 63.8% over 2010.
 Looking ahead to 2012, we are excited about the opportunity ahead as we continue to focus on our core growth initiatives. We know we are less than halfway to our previously communicated 1,000 U.S. store potential. For 2012 we will accelerate our store openings beyond our long-term goal of 15% to 20% annual square footage growth as we plan to open approximately 100 new stores. This represents approximately 22% square footage growth. Our Real Estate Team has done a terrific job of identifying high-quality sites that meet our stringent criteria. We are also pleased with our early-stage 2013 pipeline and feel confident that it will deliver the 15% to 20% square footage growth, consistent with our long-term growth targets.
 Of course, if additional attractive real estate opportunities are identified, we will consider accelerating our store growth just as we have done in 2012. We will continue to offer newness and excitement to our guests through the introduction of new brands, products and services, as well as line extensions for those existing brands our guests love and rely on us for. During the first quarter, we plan to introduce new brands including The Body Shop, Carol's Daughter and Dr. Brandt. We will also highlight new products and services including Eyelashes from Katy Perry, Urban Decay's Naked 2 Pallet, our exclusive Your Starting Lineup Kit from Bare Escentuals, our exclusive launch of Ojon Super Sleek hair treatment and Chromatics, a new hair coloring service from Redken that provides more vibrant color and healthier hair benefits than other color services. We are proud to be the exclusive national retailer to offer this service. Our marketing will continue to focus on promoting and animating our stores and website through fun, guest-friendly events like our Q1 Spring beauty inspirations held in conjunction with the editorial authority of Condé Nast and our 21 Days of Beauty and finally, our upcoming Frederic Fekkai Hair Blow-Out events.
 We also will continue to leverage our successful and growing loyalty program. As mentioned on our last call, in 2011, we completed our necessary technology platform improvements to begin the migration to one loyalty program from the 2 we operate today. In late Q1 we expect to convert approximately 130 additional stores to our enhanced points based loyalty program. When this base is complete, approximately 1/2 of our stores will be on the points based program. The enhancements of this program provide greater choices and greater freedom to our guests, which we believe, overtime, will lead to higher guest engagement and greater loyalty.
 And finally, we will continue to invest in our digital efforts with continued upgrades to our e-commerce site, including more products available for auto replenishment, improved customer service, improved search engine optimization and an enhanced customer experience via our mobile say.
 Before I turn the call over to Gregg to review our financials in more detail and provide our outlook for the first quarter of the year, let me say how proud I am of Ulta's 2011 accomplishments. Let me also thank our 14,000 associates across our stores, distribution centers and home office that worked diligently to provide the most unique and compelling experience to our beauty guests. We are all focused on building upon the success in 2012 and beyond. Gregg? 
Gregg Bodnar: Thanks, Chuck. We are very pleased with our fourth quarter results, which were driven by better-than-expected sales and margin performance. During the quarter we delivered a 23% increase in total sales, an 11.5% increase in comp store sales, 100 basis points expansion in gross profit margin and leveraged SG&A by 130 basis points. This performance delivered a 230-basis point increase in operating margin to 12.6% for the quarter. We also delivered a 49% increase in fourth quarter earnings-per-share.
 Turning to our review of the income statement, fourth quarter net sales increased 23% to $582.5 million, comp store sales rose by 11.5%, representing a 2-year increase of 21.9%, consistent with the trends that we saw through the course of 2011. As Chuck mentioned, our strong sales performance was broad-based and we believe resulted in market share expansion, reflecting the increase...
 [Audio Gap]
 quarter, we opened 7 new stores and at quarter end, we operated 449 stores, expanding square footage by 16% from last year's fourth quarter.
 Gross profit dollars increased 26.7% to $198.5 million from $156.7 million last year. Gross profit margin increased 100 basis points to 34.1%. Our gross profit margin expansion was primarily driven by 70 basis points of increased leverage and fixed store costs due to our comp store sales increase and 40 basis points of improvement in merchandise margin.
 SG&A expenses were $124.2 million or 21.3% of net sales compared to $107.2 million or 22.6% of net sales last year. The leverage in SG&A expenses is primarily attributable to comparable store sales growth and our cost management discipline. Fourth Quarter fiscal 2010 included a nonrecurring compensation charge which impacted SG&A by 20 basis points.
 Preopening expenses totaled $1 million in the quarter, which compares to $500,000 in the fourth quarter last year, reflecting 7 new store openings during the quarter versus 5 new store openings last year. Our strong sales growth and margin expansion
 [Audio Gap]
 resulted in operating margin expansion of 230 basis points, to 12.6% from 10.3% last year. Interest expense was $91,000 and represented fees associated with our credit facility, which we did not utilize this year.
 The income tax rate for the fourth quarter was 36.7%, down from 38.3% last year, primarily driven by year end tax adjustments, including certain federal and state tax deductions and credits. Net income for the quarter increased 54% to $46.3 million or $0.73 per diluted share. This compares to $30.1 million or $0.49 per diluted share last year.
 Now, turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. Merchandise inventories at the end of the quarter were $244.6 million compared to $218.5 million at the end of the fourth quarter last year. The 3% decrease in average per store inventory was consistent with our plans. Capital expenditures for the fourth quarter were $30.9 million and depreciation amortization was $20.3 million.
 For the full year 2011, just a couple of highlights. Net sales rose 2.1%, inclusive of a 10.9% comp increase. We opened 61 new stores, representing a 16% increase in square footage. We continue to be very pleased with the performance of our 2011 new stores. Operating income margin expanded 280 basis points to 11%, achieving a double-digit operating margin. Earnings-per-share increased 63.8% and we delivered free cash flow of $92.3 million, finishing the year with $254 million of cash and no debt.
 Now, regarding our first quarter 2012 outlook. We currently estimate net sales in the range of $452 million to $460 million compared to actual first quarter 2011 net sales of $386 million. This assumes a comp store sales increase of 6% to 8% representing a 2-year increase of 17.1% to 19.1%, following last year's increase of 11.1%. We plan to open approximately 13 new stores in the first quarter 2012 compared to 5 new stores last year. Income per diluted share for the first quarter is estimated in the range of $0.46 to $0.48. This includes a $0.01 per share impact driven by incremental preopening expense from our accelerated new store program. This compares to actual income per diluted share of $0.37 in the first quarter of last year.
 In addition, we expect gross profit margin to expand by approximately 40 basis points at the midpoint of the guidance range from last year's gross profit margin of 34.9%. Gross profit margin expansion in the first quarter will be driven by merchandise margin. As previously mentioned, our third distribution center will have a slight negative impact on gross profit primarily in the first half of the year. We will also incur some additional accelerated depreciation, associated with the increase in our 2012 remodel program, which will impact gross profit in the first quarter by approximately 20 basis points. Again, with all of these initiatives we will continue to...
 [Audio Gap]
 We expect SG&A as a percentage of net sales to decrease approximately 70 basis points, at  the midpoint of our guidance range from last year's rate of 24.5%. As a result of the aforementioned drivers, we expect to continue to expand our operating margin during the first quarter by approximately 90 basis points. We also expect the following for the first quarter: Preopening expenses to be approximately $2.3 million and effective tax rate of approximately 39.5% and fully diluted share count to be approximately 64 million.
 Looking forward to the full year fiscal 2012, we expect to deliver strong results in relation to our long-term financial goals. As a reminder, our business model has been built to generate 25% to 30% annual net income growth through the achievement of 3% to 5% annual comp store sales gains, square footage growth of 15% to 20% annually and operating margin expansion as we progress to our mid-teen operating margin target.
 We are very pleased with the start of our year. For the full year 2012 we expect to deliver annual comp store sales growth at the high-end to slightly above our 3% to 5% long-term growth target. We expect net income growth at the high end of our 25% to 30% growth target even after absorbing approximately $0.07 to $0.08 per share in incremental expenses related to preopening costs associated with our accelerated new store program and expenses related to the opening of our third distribution center. This net income growth expectation also includes a $0.03 per share benefit from the 53rd week.
 [Audio Gap]
 details regarding our 2012 expectations. We have a very robust new store pipeline for 2012 with the expectation of opening approximately 100 new stores, delivering square footage expansion of approximately 22%. As you are aware, our total sales include comp store sales, non-comp sales from the prior year openings and sales from new stores opened in the current year. Given the acceleration of our store openings in 2012, we thought it might be helpful to provide you with our store openings by quarter and the expectations for new 2012 store sales volume in each quarter.
 By quarter, store openings are expected to be approximately 13 new stores in Q1, 23 in Q2, 48 in Q3 and 16 in Q4. Total new 2012 store sales are expected to be approximately $5 million in Q1, $15 million in Q2, $40 million in Q3 and $80 million in Q4. Preopening expense for fiscal 2012 is expected to be approximately $16 million compared to $10 million in fiscal 2011.
 By quarter, this breaks down as follows: Approximately $2.3 million in Q1, $5 million in Q2, $6 million in Q3 and $2.5 million in Q4. As you know, our new 2012 stores will start to roll into our comp base in 2013. In addition, they will positively contribute to total sales, comparable store sales growth, profitability and cash flow in 2013. We will also expand our remodel program in 2012 to 21 locations compared to 17 locations completed in 2011. You may remember, we generated return on investment from our remodel program primarily driven by the additional selling space gained from the remodel. We remain on track with our third distribution center project. We expect the third DC to result in a...

 at the gross profit, primarily in the first half of the year. Specifically, most of this activity will occur in the second quarter as we prepare to ship from the new DC in Q3. This should have a 10- to 20-basis point impact on gross profit margin in the second quarter. Again, we expect to expand gross profit overall each quarter. Starting in the fourth quarter, we expect a modest benefit to gross profit margin as we ship to more stores from the new DC and therefore, realize the expected transportation cost benefit. As you may recall, we opened our second DC very successfully, on time and on budget, and we'll apply this same disciplined execution as we bring this operation online.
 Capital expenditures in 2012 are expected to be $170 million, which is approximately $40 million higher than our capital expenditure program in 2011, driven by the acceleration of our store expansion program. Depreciation and amortization will be approximately $89 million. We will continue to appropriately manage inventory levels as we have demonstrated in the past. At the end of the first quarter, inventory on a per-store basis is expected to increase in the mid-single digit range, largely driven by the inventory to open our third DC. This inventory growth will still be below expectations for our comp growth and will trend lower as we move towards the end of the year. We expect this improved inventory productivity to drive higher turnover. We remain comfortable with the composition of our inventory and will continue our inventory discipline.
 We will continue to expand operating margin and expect to be well into the low-double digit range, building from the 11% we delivered in 2011. We continue to be very confident in our long-term mid-teen operating margin target.
 [Audio Gap] 
 2012 represents a 53rd week for us. The extra week is included in the fourth quarter and represents approximately $35 million in net sales and approximately $0.03 per diluted share in earnings. In 2012, we expect to deliver free cash flow while making additional investments to accelerate our new store program to approximately 100 stores or 22% in adding our third DC.
 Again, to summarize, in fiscal 2012, we expect comp store sales growth at the high end to slightly above our long-term target of 3% to 5% and expect net income growth at the high end of our 25% to 30% long-term growth target while absorbing $0.07 to $0.08 per share of incremental costs related to the acceleration of our new store program and the opening of our third DC.
 As Chuck mentioned earlier, our board recently approved $1 per share special cash dividend payable to shareholders of record as of March 20, 2012. We are confident we have ample liquidity, including $254 million in cash at year-end and our unused $200 million credit facility, to continue to invest in our future growth and drive meaningful shareholder returns. We expect to continue to generate significant free cash flow in future years. We will continue to invest cash generated appropriately in the growth of our business and will continue to evaluate strategies for the use of excess cash beyond our planned needs.
 And now, I'd like to turn the call back over to Chuck. 
Carl Rubin: Thanks, Gregg. 2011 was another remarkable year for Ulta as we posted higher sales and profits along with strong cash flow. By providing our guests with the product and services they seek in an exciting and fun shopping environment, we gained market share and new guests and further solidified our position as a key beauty destination. I want to thank everyone at Ulta for their hard work and dedication and I look forward to another year of sales and profit growth in 2012.
 Finally, you likely saw our press release announcing that we will begin a search for a new CFO as part of a CFO succession plan. This results from Gregg needing to relocate to Michigan to address a family health issue. In the meantime, I am pleased that Gregg will continue in his current role as well as assist in the hiring and transitioning of his responsibilities to his successor later this year. Gregg has been a terrific partner of mine and contributed greatly to Ulta's growth. While I regret his decision, I respect his desire to put his family needs first. I am confident in the team he has built and know they have the proven abilities to continue Ulta's strong performance.
 Before we open the call to questions, I know Gregg would like to make a few comments as well. Gregg? 
Gregg Bodnar: Thanks, Chuck. While I know I'm making the right decision for my family, this is a very difficult choice for me. I have enjoyed my time with Ulta and I am proud of what we have accomplished and even more excited about the company's future opportunities. Chuck, the management team and the Board of Directors have an exciting vision and all the talent required to continue the company's success well into the future. I am pleased to continue on in my current responsibilities and assist with the hiring and transition of a new CFO to provide a seamless and orderly succession. 
Carl Rubin: And with that, I'd like to turn the call back over to the operator to open the call and we'll take your questions. Operator? 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Brian Tunick with JPMorgan Chase. 
Brian Tunick: So I guess 2 questions here. I guess, first one, Chuck, sort of bigger picture, thinking about market share, right, either by door or by vendor, sort of how do you think about it or where is the share coming from? And is that changing as you've changed your marketing from, I guess, what used to be mainly newspaper circulars and sort of how you're thinking about that or customer acquisition? And then maybe some discussion around the comp drivers going forward. Do you think it's more important for new brands or is it the newness within the brands that you think give you the most confidence? 
Carl Rubin: To your questions, though, on the market share, we're gaining share across the board. So we're getting it in our prestige area, in our mass area, in our, what we call, personal care appliances. So it's coming from a variety of places. I can't identify which specific retailer it is, but I know that we are growing across our business base faster than the industry as a whole. In terms of your second question, it's newness that is the real motivator here. And newness can be defined in different ways. It can be a new brand that we're adding in, as I mentioned some of the new brands we're adding into the first quarter and some of the brands that we've added in the past couple of years, they continue to mature. In some ways almost like a new store matures. It's still, you have the new brand in one quarter and you still see growth even a year later as it continues to mature. But new brands is only a part of it. New products within brands, new trends, new services, I think that's what is -- what we've done so good, with putting into our offering and communicating through our marketing to our guests is the newness. And she comes in and discovers the things that she relies upon us for day in and day out, and has for years, but she's also finding the new product or the new services or the new brand when she comes in and even the new marketing events that we've added into it. So I wouldn't isolate it just to brands. I would tell you that the word new is really the motivator that we're seeing accelerate our business. 
Brian Tunick: And just that final question on what kind of customer acquisition thought process, as you've shifted now from marketing, from mostly being a newspaper insert, to obviously moving more towards digital and radio. So are you bringing in a new customer or is it different view? 
Carl Rubin: Well, print is still a good part of our marketing mix and we're getting significantly better at our abilities in direct marketing as a result of our loyalty program. So the content that the merchants are putting out there is improving the targeting of our marketing, that the marketing group is putting out there is improving and experience in store is improving. As far as attracting a new customer, I believe that our sales performance is driven by taking -- grabbing additional share within existing customers. So she's spending more of what she spends in the beauty space with us, although still, only a fraction, which is encouraging, because we know we can still capture more sales from our existing customer base. But we also are adding new customers. Clearly, when we open a new store, we expand our base, but we're adding new customers in comp markets as well. So Brian, this is, as I said, it was a fabulous year in 2011 and we saw good performance from new and existing customers across the board throughout the year. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Neely Tamminga with Piper Jaffray. 
Neely Tamminga: So the question here on stores, you have 100 here in the pipeline for -- on the opening side. Just wondering if you're doing something a little bit differently on the prototype? Obviously, level 7 is the most recent prototype that you guys have out there, but will they still be anchored with the usual, Benefit, Philosophy, Bare, or do you start making room for the Lancome in that? Just wondering how that looks in terms of the roll out. And then Chuck, a little bit of a clarification question on the loyalty program. So as you open up those new stores, will they automatically be adopted into the loyalty program, the new one? Or do you have to wait till that market gets rolled out? 
Carl Rubin: Yes. Let me take the second one first, Neely. The conversion of the stores is a geographic conversion. It is not based on the store age. So existing stores in the market that we are -- in the market that we're converting, as well as new stores that we opened in those markets, will start up on the new program. As far as the first point, we are still working in a level 7. We have made a number of enhancements to it and we continue to, both in the visual appearance of the store as well as the space allocation and the allocation of space to different brands and different categories. I think what you'll see us continue to do in stores is similar to what we've done in the rest of our business. We had a very good base. We just continued to evolve that, listen very closely to what our guest tells us, what products, what brands, what categories are out there that she's interested in and we continue to evolve. So as an example, you will see later in the first quarter the end-caps of our fixtures throughout the store will become much more exciting than they have been before. They'll be much more statement oriented, either around a new product or a new trend or something that we want to do a better job of highlighting than we have historically. So while we still consider it a level 7, sometimes I refer to it as a level 7 on steroids. We have made a number of improvements to that. So that's what we'll continue to -- we're putting all of that into the new stores we're opening this year, but we're also going back to the existing 7s and doing the same thing. 
Neely Tamminga: And then just one quick follow-up on the manicure service that's being rolled out. Do you have to do anything differently with the store payroll or labor-management? Or is that just a plug-and-play with the salon services? 
Carl Rubin: It's kind of a plug-and-play. There is some downtime for our stylists. It's a service provided by our stylists that are in-store now. They have some downtime between guests. They also have downtime even when working with a guest. If they're waiting for treatment to -- while they complete the service, they have a little downtime with that same guest. So that's what exacting about it, Neely, this is an incremental service. It's not taking away from anything we offer today and it can help fill into some time gaps that we have in the salon. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Daniel Hofkin with William Blair & Company. 
Daniel Hofkin: Just a quick question regarding traffic and ticket expectations. Obviously, in 2011, including the fourth quarter, I gather traffic was the vast majority. Do you expect a similar kind of relative dynamic or might that mix change a little bit going forward? That's my first question. 
Carl Rubin: Yes, Dan, we don't break that out in detail. But clearly, we do expect traffic to be the motivating factor in our comps this year, as it has been over the foreseeable past. 
Daniel Hofkin: And in terms of just number of visits or conversion rate as well, is it some features but mostly number of visits that's driving the transaction? 
Carl Rubin: Yes, I don't know how much detail we want to get into that other than what we've provided in the past. What I can tell you is traffic has been the driving force in our sales, and with the growth of our loyalty file, what we know is she is shopping with us more often and she is spending more money in total. On each of her visits, she may spend a little bit less, but because she's coming in more frequently, the aggregate of her spend with us is increasing. So I would expect that we would see that as we go forward. The loyalty program -- both of the loyalty programs are very good, solid, attractive programs. We obviously believe the points program is better and hence, the reason for the conversion. So we have high hopes of this loyalty program continuing to -- continue to drive our business as we go forward. 
Daniel Hofkin: And then as it relates to, let's say, incremental sales and what you're seeing right now or what you expect for drop-through rate to the margin line, the operating margin, kind of what's a good rule of thumb that we could think about at this point? 
Carl Rubin: Probably, the easiest way to translate that, Dan, is if you look at a point of comp based on our guidance range. So a point of comp translates to about $0.01 of earnings. 
Daniel Hofkin: That being at the quarterly -- I'm sorry, that's on a quarterly basis, correct? 
Carl Rubin: Yes. Correct. 
Daniel Hofkin: So fairly similar even kind of outside of the range, I would assume? 
Carl Rubin: Correct. 
Gregg Bodnar: Talking about just like second, third, fourth quarter? 
Carl Rubin: Yes. 
Daniel Hofkin: Yes. I guess last question, if I could. On the 53rd week, so that's obviously included in the guidance. I was a little bit surprised because I thought it might be a higher margin week, but is that -- are there things that affect the margin in that single week? I know it's such a small number overall year? 
Gregg Bodnar: No. It's a normal week for us. We go through the sort of exhaustive exercise of making sure, which I think a lot of retailers do but maybe not all of them, the exhaustive exercise of making sure that, that week has all of the incremental costs associated with it, which is the proper way to do it. So it has all the variable costs, it has all the fixed costs. So it is a more normal operating margin week in the month of February. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Erika Maschmeyer with Robert W. Baird. 
Erika Maschmeyer: I guess have you set a date for how long you'd be willing to stay around? And then on the search, are you looking internally or externally or both? 
Gregg Bodnar: I'll take the first one. I'm going to be around till we find the right successor, period. I have an incredible passion for this company, passion about what we've delivered in the past, the passion for the opportunities that are in front of us, which I think have never been stronger. We're going to take the time that it takes and I have the flexibility to make sure that I'm around until we find that right successor. 
Carl Rubin: As far as the search is concerned, obviously we are just beginning that and we will consider all candidates, internal as well as external. 
Erika Maschmeyer: And then on the loyalty program rollout, any plans outside of the 130 in Q1? Do you expect all stores by year-end? And then could you talk a little bit strategically on the promotional front? I know you've been working to move away from pure discounting and I guess kind of where -- is there any kind of examples of where you've had success in and how the new loyalty program can help you move that goal up forward further? 
Carl Rubin: Well, we haven't laid out publicly the full conversion schedule, so we're going to take the 130 stores, and as I mentioned of the script, that will have half of the chain on the program by the very end of the first quarter, it's actually the last week of the quarter. There are natural points to convert this over because we have to consider the old program and the redemption windows that we have for that. So we'll talk more about the rest of the company as we proceed into the year. As far as the benefit of converting to the one program, it does provide us a lot more flexibility to adjust our promotional format because today, it is difficult with 2 programs to be able to offer a lot of loyalty-based incentives nationally in lieu of price discounts. So what we have done is altered some of our promotional mix. We clearly have offered our coupons. We will continue to do that. But as we move more and more to the points-based program, you'll see us utilize additional points as incentives to our guests. But ultimately, you've also seen, as 2011 went on, and it'll continue in 2012, that newness is highlighted more and more in our advertising as well. Price is not the ultimate driver in our business. It is a factor, but unlike other types of businesses, it's not the leading factor. It goes back to, I think what Brian was asking about earlier, it goes back to the newness. So you've seen some examples of that and when you go through our ad pieces, whether they are print or digital, you'll see as we go through 2012, us highlighting the newness, whether it's fun, fashion, function around that newness, you'll see us highlight that more in our advertising. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Sam Panella with Raymond James. 
Samantha Panella: I apologize if I missed this, did you break what the traffic and ticket increases were in the fourth quarter? 
Gregg Bodnar: We said mostly traffic. Slight increase on ticket. 
Samantha Panella: And in terms of your acceleration of your store growth, can you talk about the opportunities that you're taking advantage of? Obviously this is a further acceleration from what we discussed in the last call. And just wondering, given your store economics are much stronger now than they were, say, 3, 4 years ago, is this something up maybe new real estate opportunities for you? 
Carl Rubin: I'll take the first part and I'll throw the second to Gregg. The real estate team has been really creative, really aggressive in finding opportunities. There's obviously not a lot of new construction that's happening, but there is real estate that has been out there, whether it's been other retailers who have freed up their full real estate foundation or just others who are looking to scale down on some space. So for instance, in the first, it's Borders, we have taken some sites from them. We have taken some excess space from Best Buy. But I want to give the real estate team a call out for the outstanding work that they've done. They also have been very creative in working with existing centers and existing landlords to try to put together small stores and try to merge them together to get our 10,000 square foot box. So it's a very different way, you have to approach real estate today for new stores than it was a few years ago, when a few years ago, you could almost sit and wait for developers to call you. And today, you have to be very proactive, very creative. And I think our real estate team has done a great job as evidenced by the 100 sites. It's also important to note that we're very pleased with the 100 sites that we've been able to get for this year. We have not sacrificed quality whatsoever. I think we've talked about this. Both Gregg and I have talked about this repeatably. We will not pursue quantity in lieu of the quality. But that's what makes 2012 so exciting, we've been able to find both of them and we're very excited about what's ahead. 
Gregg Bodnar: And we do have an incredibly rigorous real estate evaluation process as well as the talent in our team that knows the right sites to pick. I think one additional point there, too, is the larger we get, the more attractive and more visible we get with developers, kind of, across the country. So the dealmakers have been incredibly creative and the receptivity of developers to rearrange boxes, et cetera, to accommodate our needs has been equally as attractive. As it relates to the payback, you're right. Overtime, we have accelerated the cash payback in the model. We have reduced the opening cost as well as improved the operating margin. So what's really exciting about this opportunity to accelerate the new store program, even though a lot of it does come in to the back half of the year, is there will be a pretty significant 2013, 2014 benefit, cause these stores pay back pretty quickly and they get a nice lift when they start to roll into the comp base. They generate additional incremental free cash flow and earnings. So it'll be a nice complement to 2013 and 2014 and certainly beyond that. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Jill Caruthers with Johnson Rice. 
Jill Caruthers: A question on the comment you all made earlier knowing that only a small percentage of the customer's beauty care spend is at Ulta. Maybe, I know it's a generic comment, but maybe could you talk about where you feel the missing parts are that Ulta isn't grabbing? 
Carl Rubin: Well, I'm not sure it's any particular product category that we're not grabbing, but no one in retail gets 100% of anyone's spend in their respective category. So we believe, given the strength of our model, the breadth of our offering, from mass to prestige to salon products to the salon services and how we've improved upon that, we think we're giving our guests that much more reason to be able to spend her purchase with us, spend her money with us. So it's not any particular place that I think we're weak on, I think it's just somewhat a convenience issue because she maybe shopping elsewhere and pick something up. But it speaks to the opportunity that we have because of the breadth of what we offer, unlike other players in our space who are much more limited in the scope -- in the breadth of their offering and the scope of their offering, we can satisfy most things that a woman wants in a beauty store. So that's why we believe we do have that upside potential to grab more share of an individual's beauty spend. 
Gregg Bodnar: Jill, I think the other way. In addition to that, to think about it, too, is this loyalty program, the flexibility that comes with this and the attractiveness that she has in using this program, I think will drive higher share wallet and higher loyalty. In addition to that, it also leads to the capabilities that we're continuing to develop on the digital side so we can be more personal and more top of mind to her. So the more frequently, at an appropriate level, that we can personalize messaging to her in what's a very impersonal world today, that's going to leave us higher share of mind and leave us with higher share of wallet, I believe, because we know that the other things we're doing, she's significantly enthusiastic about, as demonstrated by the kind of traffic and loyalty growth that we're getting today. So I think there's multiple levers as we continue to build out these strategies that are going to continue to help us drive higher share wallet in the customers where we already have higher share wallet and a bigger opportunity for those as you kind of move down the ladder from there. So that's kind of the way I would think about, in addition to what Chuck said, where the opportunity continues to come forward. And then as we become larger, again, that voice as a national retailer becomes much more prevalent as well. 
Jill Caruthers: Just a quick follow-on question on the real estate. Kind of what are you seeing out there on the rental rate forecast out there? 
Carl Rubin: Pretty consistent with what we've seen in the past. No upward pressure, no significant downward pressure. Again, the way we think about it is we know with -- as odd as this may sound, with incredible precision, based on -- we have this large loyalty club customer base and a very sophisticated analytical model to identify what the potential sales volume is and how that will grow over time for a particular trade area and what the size and shape of the trade area is. So we know exactly what we're going to pay and what we won't pay to deliver a very profitable store as we have been delivering. And then obviously, our dealmakers have incredible experience as to what market there is as well. So it leaves us a very strong negotiating position and a lot of precision in terms of what the right rental structure is to deliver the economics. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Joseph Altobello with Oppenheimer. 
Unknown Analyst: This is actually Christina in for Joe.  I was just wondering if you could give an update on the Lancome and Clinique tests, how many doors you're in now? 
Carl Rubin: We're in the same number of doors that we have been in. We're very pleased with the performance of both brands. And before you ask your next question, we have nothing to announce about an expansion, but we are very pleased of how both of them are doing. 
Unknown Analyst: Have you seen a comp lift from either one of the brands or you're not going to comment on that? 
Carl Rubin: We're very pleased with how we're doing with the brand. We think it augments the offering as a whole. We're pleased with how the store, overall, is performing, those stores that have had Lancome and Clinique added to them. So up and down, our guest has responded very well. It has not been cannibalizing other parts of our offering. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Evren Kopelman with Wells Fargo. 
Unknown Analyst: This is actually Connie in for Evren. My question is, I know you touched on kind of your real estate selection process, but given the ramp up in new store openings, do you really -- do you have any color into how maybe some of the newer markets have been performing relative to some of your mature markets? Have you seen any signs of cannibalization between your stores? 
Carl Rubin: As we always have for many, many years  when we build out a new store annual program, we balance our openings intentionally so between new markets and existing markets. And in some cases, in those existing markets, it will create some cannibalization and in other cases it won't. At the same time, you obviously get incremental operating margin leverage by all the natural efficiencies, as you know, that go along with that. All of that's built-in to our historical performance. We've been doing that sort of forever and all of that's built-in to our store model as well. 
Gregg Bodnar: I'd also remind you that when you have less than half of your potential store build-out that's up and running, cannibalization will be a factor in some cases, but we have a lot of runway open, a lot of white space for us to satisfy guest demand by opening a store in those markets. 
Operator: There are no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the floor back over to management for closing comments. 
Carl Rubin: Let me thank everyone for joining us today, and Gregg and I will look forward to speaking to you to discuss our first quarter results in June. Thanks again. 
Operator: This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time and thank you for your participation.

Operator: Greetings and welcome to the Ulta Beauty Third Quarter 2011 Earnings Results Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. (Operator instructions). As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Allison Malkin of ICR. Thank you, Ms. Malkin. You may begin.
Allison Malkin: Thank you. Good afternoon. Before we get started, I would like to remind you of the Company's Safe Harbor language, which I'm sure you're all familiar with. The statements contained in this conference call, which are not historical facts, may be deemed to constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual future results may differ materially from those projected in such statements, due to a number of risks and uncertainties, all of which are described in the Company's filings with the SEC. We will make references during this call to the metrics free cash flow, a non-GAAP financial measure defined as cash provided by operating activities, minus the purchases of property and equipment. Now, I would like to turn the call over to Ulta's President and CEO, Chuck Rubin.
Chuck Rubin: Thanks, Allison. Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us to discuss our fiscal 2011 third quarter results. On the call with me today is our Chief Financial Officer, Gregg Bodnar. Following my opening remarks, Gregg will review our third quarter financial results and provide our outlook. I will then offer some closing comments and turn the call over to the operator so that we can answer the questions you have for us today. We are very pleased to continue our positive performance and deliver better than expected third quarter sales and earnings. Briefly touching on our results for the third quarter, net sales rose 21.8% to $413.1 million from $339.2 million last year. Comparable store sales grew 9.6%. This is on top of last year's 12.2% for a two-year comp gain of 21.8%. Comparable store sales were driven by traffic growth, but also included an increase in average ticket. Gross profit margin rose 100 basis points including 60 basis points of merchandise margin expansion. Strong sales growth, combined with expansion in gross profit margins and leverage in SG&A, led to an 82.1% increase in operating income, with operating margin up 350 basis points to 10.7% of net sales. Net income increased by 88% and income per diluted share increased to $0.42 from $0.23 in the third quarter last year. Our strong performance resulted in us capturing additional market share during the quarter with our comp sales led by strong gains in prestige color and skin. We introduced to all stores new brands including Laura Geller Cosmetics and Art of Shaving for men. In addition, we introduced new products from existing brands, including Urban Decay's anniversary palette, Book of Shadows 4, Tarte's True Blood, MIA 2 from Clarisonic and Sally Hansen Nail. We also saw a strong growth from brands recently introduced such as Philosophy. All of these product elements combined to fuel our sales growth. Our new fragrance introductions also performed well. These included Coach Poppy Flowers, Jennifer Aniston, Estee Lauder Sensuous Nude and Taylor Swift Wonderstruck. We believe our strong third quarter fragrance sales bodes well for fourth quarter sales given the category's importance during the gift-giving season. During the quarter, we successfully completed the introduction of Lancome to 29 stores across four markets and have been very pleased with the initial performance. In store, we continue to focus on our customer service levels and are proud that our service scores are reaching new highs. We remain committed to providing the best environment and experience within the beauty industry for our guests. The successful expansion of our store base continued with the opening of 28 new stores in Q3. We ended the quarter with 442 locations. Early in the fourth quarter, we completed our 2011 store program with the opening of seven additional new stores. This brought our new store openings to a total of 61 for the year, representing a 16% expansion in square footage. We continued to be pleased with the performance of our new stores which are performing above our expectations. We are also pleased with our 2012 of new store pipeline and now expect to accelerate the pace of our new store openings next year to include square footage expansion at the upper end of the 15% to 20% long-term goal we have previously communicated. Our site selection process continues to maintain the same rigor as you have come to expect from us. The expected acceleration in our 2012 square footage growth is the result of a very good flow of high quality existing retail locations. We are confident that these new 2012 store sites are of the same high quality as our sites over these past years.  Our marketing was highly successful driven by the continued integration of products, services, and eventing. This contributed to our strong comp sales increase in stores and our continued high growth of online sales. For example, our 21 days of beauty campaign reflected our unique ability to deliver both the latest trends and the best values to our guests. We improved the campaign over last year, adding new brands and introducing fun, high-value beauties deals each day.  Our campaign in support of Breast Cancer Awareness Month, Donate with a Kiss was equally strong raising a record level of donations for this important cause. This year we significantly improved our efforts by adding more products in support of this campaign, such as shower gel for the Cure from Philosophy and Pink Shatter nail polish from OPI. Also for the first time, we integrated the salon into our campaign with a national Cut-a-Thon day. Our marketing was multifaceted and included our successful print efforts, but also for the first time leveraged our growing Facebook following with a Guess the Celebrity Kiss campaign. Our efforts this year resulted in significant publicity and we believed heightened brand awareness to a broader base of customers. Finally, we were pleased with the introduction of our new exciting Conde Nast relationship which included the launch of a magazine subscription offer on two titles, Glamour and Allure as well as the leveraging of these titles trend expertise in our other advertising. We believe this relationship reinforces our beauty authority position with our guests. Turning to Salon, we achieved a solid positive comp in the quarter. This sales increase was lower than the rate of our retail product growth. However, we are encouraged by the progress being made in our Salon business. During the quarter, we saw increased salon traffic as we successfully utilized e-mail and direct mail marketing and saw a strong response to our new service offerings, including our hair straightening service and feather weaves. We ended the quarter with a strong balance sheet. At quarter end, cash was $131 million and our balance sheet was debt free. We continue to work with our Board of Directors to evaluate the best uses of our cash for the benefit of our shareholders. Turning to the fourth quarter, we believe our exciting line of merchandising and marketing plans, along with our strong service commitment, positions us well to capture additional market share in both our holiday and base businesses. Let me share a few of the expected drivers of our Q4 performance. In product, our holiday offering will reinforce both our trend and value focus as we launch exciting new products across all categories with prominent, end-cap displays and online features to promote gift giving. In prestige color cosmetics, we will introduce exclusive holiday kits from Urban Decay, Benefit, Tarte, bareMinerals and Smashbox. In styling tools, we will offer exclusive holiday patterns by Ultra Chi. In addition, we will offer our exclusive Ultra blockbuster color sets at a great gift giving price. We will continue to offer great value through our 5 for $5 and 5 for $10 gift tables that allow our guests to choose their own fun stocking stuffer gifts. For Fragrance, we are optimistic about our holiday sales based on the momentum from our robust Q3 performance, along with new introductions including Fendi, Ed Hardy Villain, Vera Wang Princess Night and Tresor Midnight Rose. We will also offer two Fragrance GWPs during Q4 which we expect will bring guests to Ulta through Christmas. The excitement in our offerings will continue after holiday with our skincare event in January. In fact, we will be offering more in-store eventing, more sample gift bags, and more new products which we expect to be the perfect solution for our guests' mid-winter skin needs. Turning quickly to Salon, Ulta will be the first national chain to introduce nail gel by OPI, an up trending new service for our guests. We are excited to add nail gel to our salon service menu as it will also allow our guests to get a unique, long-lasting nail service while indulging in our other salon services, or just stopping in for a special affordable treat. All of these products and services will be communicated to our guests through our marketing, which for the fourth quarter introduces our new overarching marketing theme of Welcome to Fabulous. We expect to continue to build upon our successful foundation of newspaper inserts and direct mail, which leverages our strong loyalty database. We plan to also expand the frequency of in-store eventing, add a fun new radio campaign that supports all stores, launch a new Facebook campaign that actively engages our guests and for the first time, introduce a new prestige fragrance direct mail piece targeted to our very best guests. In total, we are very proud of our performance during the first nine months of the year and equally excited about our ability to deliver strong results in the fourth quarter while capturing additional market share. We have a great team whom I'd like to thank for their continued hard work, exciting merchandising and marketing plans and I believe we are well-positioned to finish the year strong and continue our positive momentum in 2012. And now, let me turn the call over to Gregg to review our financials and outlook in more detail.
Gregg Bodnar: Thanks, Chuck. We are very pleased with our third quarter results which were driven by better-than-expected sales and margin performance. During the quarter, we delivered a 21.8% increase in total sales, a 9.6% increase in comp store sales, 100 basis point expansion in gross profit margin and leveraged SG&A by 210 basis points. This performance delivered a 350 basis point increase in operating margin to 10.7% for the quarter. We also delivered an 83% increase in third quarter earnings per share. Turning to a review of the income statement, third quarter net sales increased 21.8% to $413.1 million. Comp store sales rose by 9.6%, representing a two-year increase of 21.8%. This two-year comp sales result is consistent with the trend from Q2 in the first half of the year. As Chuck mentioned, our strong sales performance was broad-based and we believe resulted in market share expansion reflecting the increasing preference of our overall consumer proposition. During the quarter, we opened 28 new stores and closed one. At quarter end, we operated 442 stores, expanding square footage by 16% from last year's third quarter. Gross profit dollars increased 25.5% to $149.2 million from $118.9 million last year. Gross profit margin expanded 100 basis points to 36.1%. Our gross profit margin expansion was primarily driven by 70 basis points of increased leverage and fixed store cost due to our comp store sales increase and 60 basis points from improvement in merchandise margins. SG&A expenses were $101 million or 24.5% of net sales, compared to $90.3 million or 26.6% of net sales last year. The leverage in SG&A was primarily driven by comparable store sales growth and our cost management discipline. Third quarter fiscal 2010 included $1.4 million non-recurring compensation charge which impacted SG&A by 30 basis points. Preopening expenses totaled $4 million in the quarter which compares to $4.3 million in the third quarter last year, reflecting 28 new store openings during the quarter versus 30 last year. Our strong sales growth and margin expansion, combined with our continued prudent expense management, resulted in operating margin expansion of 350 basis points to 10.7% from 7.2% last year. Interest expense was $176,000 and represents fees associated with our credit facility which we've not utilized this year. The income tax rate for the third quarter was 39.2%, down from 40.9% last year, primarily driven by a lower amount of non-deductible compensation. Income for the quarter increased 88.5% to $26.8 million or $0.42 per diluted share. This compares to $14.2 million or $0.23 per diluted share last year. Now turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. Merchandise inventories at the end of the quarter were $354.9 million, compared to $301.6 million at the end of the third quarter last year. Average inventory per store increased 2.2% from the prior year. The increase in average inventory per store is consistent with our plans and reflects our initiative to bring in holiday inventories slightly earlier than last year to better position our start to the fourth quarter and holiday period. We are pleased with the overall inventory position, the result of this initiative and the start of the holiday period. We remain on track to our previously stated year-end goal to reduce average per store inventory by approximately 1% to 3%. Capital expenditures for the third quarter were $45 million and depreciation and amortization was $19.2 million. Now regarding our fourth quarter outlook. We currently estimate net sales in the range of $552 million to $562 million, compared to actual fourth quarter 2010 net sales of $473.7 million. This assumes a comp store sales increase of 6% to 8% following last year's increase of 10.4%. We have opened 7 new stores in the fourth quarter compared to 5 stores last year. We have now completed all of our 2011 new store openings, resulting in 61 new stores, representing a 16% increase in square footage. We continue to be very pleased with the performance of our 2011 new stores. Income per diluted share for the fourth quarter is estimated in the range of $0.62 to $0.64. This compares to actual income per diluted share of $0.49 in the fourth quarter of last year. In addition, based on the midpoint of our guidance range, we expect gross profit margin to expand by approximately 80 basis points from last year's gross profit margin of 33.1%. As I’ve previously mentioned, as we accelerate our new store program this year, it has had an expected impact on gross profit margin. Our gross profit margin will continue to increase in the fourth quarter, but at a more modest rate versus the first half of the year. This is a normal and expected impact of our store model and the acceleration of our new store program. Gross profit margin expansion will continue to be driven by fixed store leverage on a comp store sales growth and merchandised margin improvement. We also expect to leverage SG&A by approximately 80 basis points during the quarter from last year's rate of 22.6%. As a result of the aforementioned drivers, we expect to expand fourth quarter operating margin by approximately 160 basis points. We expect pre-opening expenses to be approximately $1.2 million for the quarter. We currently anticipate a tax rate of approximately 39.6% compared to 38.3% in the fourth quarter last year. We expect our fully diluted share count to be approximately 63.8 million for the fourth quarter. Based on the midpoint of our fourth quarter guidance and our positive performance in the first nine months of the year, we expect to achieve the following for the fiscal year; total sales growth of approximately 20%, comp store sales growth of approximately 9.5% which exceeds our long-term growth goal of 3% to 5%. We also expect full year net income growth of approximately 50%, excluding the impact of the one-time compensation charge last year. This expected result exceeds our long-term goal of 25% to 30% net income growth. And finally, we expect to deliver an operating margin of approximately 10.8%, reflecting an expansion of 260 basis points from the prior year. We also expect capital expenditures of $130 million, representing a 34% increase from fiscal 2010 levels. The increased investment reflects our store expansion program as well as investments we’ll make in technology and infrastructure to support our strategies and future store growth. This increase also includes the addition of a third distribution center, the development of which continues to progress according to our plans. Depreciation and amortization will be approximately $77 million. Average inventory per store will decline approximately 1% to 3% by the end of the year. We believe our continued strong performance in the third quarter reflects the solid execution of our strategies and our disciplined approach to growing our business. We are pleased with the results of our efforts and remain focused on driving sales and earnings growth, generating free cash flow, and expanding operating margin. As mentioned earlier, this year we expect to achieve an operating margin of approximately 10.8%, which we believe further supports our ability to expand operating margin solidly into the low double-digit range by the 2012-2013 time period. We also remain confident in our ability to achieve a mid-teen operating margin as we look forward. As we continue to evaluate the uses of our cash resources, our focus remains on appropriately investing the growth for business, both new store locations and our e-commerce channel in order to maximize value for our shareholders. As Chuck mentioned earlier, for 2012, we believe we can further accelerate store growth towards the high end of our 15% to 20% target from this year's expansion of 16%. We have and will continue to be extraordinarily focused on the same quality of new locations that we have built the existing chain on. And now, I'd like to turn the call back over to Chuck.
Chuck Rubin: Thanks, Gregg. In summary, we are very pleased to share with you another quarter of robust results and we are equally excited about our ability to continue our strong top and bottom line performance in the fourth quarter. Ulta has become an important destination in beauty and we see significant opportunity to continue to grow our authority in this category as we continue to focus on our growth strategies while delivering a great experience for our guests. With that, let me turn the call back over to the operator to begin the question-and-answer part of the call. Operator? 
Operator: Thank you. (Operator instructions). Our first question comes from the line of Brian Tunick from JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question/
Ike Boruchow – JPMorgan: Hey guys, how are you doing? It's actually Ike calling in for Brian. Congratulations on a great quarter. Question about the overall Cosmetics & Fragrance market that you guys operate in. Obviously for the last two years you guys have done a great job taking market share in the industry. It looks like maybe the pie is growing a little bit more now and the department stores seems to be doing better in the category. Obviously for the last 18 months or so, it seems like you've been taking share from the department stores. Could you comment just on what you're seeing over the last couple of months and how you see that playing out into next year?
Chuck Rubin: Yeah, Ike, the industry certainly has seen some good times with expansion. With that, while the ocean has potentially been raised for everyone, we certainly have gained more than our fair share of market share. So we are winning and winning more of that additional business. I think that growth has been for the industry as a whole and we have excelled within that because of the newness in the industry. There is a lot of new products and some new services out there and when you look at our business model, the fact that we are the only ones in the industry that put it all together in one shopping experience, I think that is what has led to our success and our ability to take share from department stores as well as others. As you look out into 2012, lots of predictions about what happens out there, but we are very confident that we will continue to capture more share because of the unique model that we bring to our guests.
Ike Boruchow – JPMorgan: Okay. And then just one quick follow-up. Looking at the monthly cadence of the quarter, obviously another great quarter, 9.6 comp. At this point, how pleased are you looking back? Was there anything you could have done better and basically, how did you see this relative to your internal expectations?
Chuck Rubin: We had guided lower than we actually achieved. So we were very pleased with the quarter and when you look at these results, whether the strong comps that exceeded the guidance or the margins that continued to expand in the quarter, or the additional market share that we captured within the quarter, we're very, very pleased with how we did. We exceeded in many ways what we thought we would do. At the same time, we never talk about weather. The quarter did have a little bit of frustration on the very last day of our fiscal quarter. That northeast snowstorm did have an impact and cost us our double-digit comp. So we were working hard to get there in those last couple of weeks and that weather hurt us. Nonetheless, the future of our company is enormous as we've talked about before and with that, we recognize that sometimes weather will throw us a curve ball, but otherwise all of our parts came together; the product, the services, the service in the store and our marketing. So I think it is a quarter that we're very, very proud of.
Ike Boruchow – JPMorgan: All right, great. Congratulations, guys.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Neely Tamminga from Piper Jaffray. Please proceed with your question.
Neely Tamminga – Piper Jaffray: So congratulations, great quarter guys. Just wanted to get a little sense more on the real estate side of the business. So you're accelerating the growth towards the higher end for next year. Could you give us a sense as to new markets versus existing, what you're thinking there? I think you've been in a wee bit of a backfill mode or at least that's the intention, but I'm just wondering if anything there has changed. And then in terms of the remodel program, do you have to shift because of human capital constraints and physical capital constraints – you have to shift away from a remodel program and towards the new stores or do you keep that going? Thanks.
Gregg Bodnar: Neely, a couple of reasons for the acceleration. One, lots of high-quality locations out there which is the reason why we're being opportunistic to go after it. We do have the infrastructure to continue to grow with this rate and certainly beyond that rate. We do not need to divert resources away from the remodel program next year to handle this expanded new store growth program. We will continue to focus on making sure that we continue to maintain that shopping environment for the guests. So the remodel program will continue next year as the expanded new store program accelerates. We'll continue to do all the things that we've done in the past in terms of making sure that we grab high-quality locations, balancing those between new and existing markets. The real estate pipeline will continue to be focused as it has been on existing locations, but we're seeing a nice flow of existing locations that meet our criteria, which is why we're accelerating our square footage growth.
Neely Tamminga – Piper Jaffray: That's really helpful. Can I just ask one follow-up here on the business broadly? If you were to look across the whole landscape of the business by – say by price point and I know you're seeing great success like across the board. Is there anything about – whether high-end tools or kind of tiny little frequency of pick up items that probably you can say about consumer behavior that you've read into?
Chuck Rubin: Well, prestige – first of all we saw good business across the breadth of our business, whether it was mass or prestige or appliances or in our salons. So that's the first good piece of news. When you look at it, the prestige component did grow faster than any other part of our business. So those are some higher ticket items within that. I don't know if we would – if I'd draw any conclusions on any part of that. If you look at our –Gregg mentioned in his prepared comments that we're pleased with how the holiday season has started off. If you look at Black Friday weekend – I suspect that we would be asked this, we were very pleased with Black Friday. It’s one part of the fourth quarter and the biggest part of the holiday season is still ahead of us, but we're very pleased with how Black Friday worked out. But that is more of a value-based shopping experience, but that is all the time every year when you go back into our history. So a bit of a long-winded answer, but I wouldn't say that there is any indication that the customer is shopping more than usual for price point. Instead, for us, as prestige continues to grow, we're seeing that increase a little bit.
Neely Tamminga – Piper Jaffray: Chuck, that’s very helpful. Greg, thanks a lot. Good luck to you guys for the holiday.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Daniel Hofkin from William Blair. Please proceed with your question.
Daniel Hofkin – William Blair & Company: Hi guys, congrats on another great quarter. Just a quick question if I – also on the theme of sales trend. So Prestige continuing to grow somewhat faster. Would you say in terms of the upside relative to your expectations, was that also primarily concentrated in Prestige, color and skin and fragrance or was the upside broad-based?
Chuck Rubin: Yeah. I think – I don't want to get into too many details on this, Dan. But I would say that we're very pleased with the breath of our strength. So I wouldn't call out any business in particular, but we are pleased with how broad-based it was.
Daniel Hofkin – William Blair & Company: Okay, that’s great. And as far as just a balance sheet question. With the payables percentage or I guess if you could combine payables and accrued expenses together down a little bit year-over-year, is that also a function of timing of receipt flow versus prior quarters?
Gregg Bodnar: It is, Dan. As you probably know you could probably figure out looking at our balance sheet and the product flow is all concentrated in payables. It's not sitting in accrued liabilities. We pay generally in 30-day terms. I think that's pretty commonly understood and it certainly can be implied based on looking at our balance sheet. So in that shorter time period a little bit difference of flow with the inventory as we brought a little bit earlier you’d see show up in the AP ratio.
Daniel Hofkin – William Blair & Company: Okay. I guess lastly, I know the website in general e-commerce is still very small but growing fast. How would you characterize the overall functionality performance of the site during the higher traffic periods?
Chuck Rubin: It was okay. As you said, we saw very high growth. We continue to see high growth off of our e-commerce site. As many sites over the long holiday weekend had some trouble, we had a couple of pockets of that. They were short. We were back up very quickly and we've addressed some customers that were disappointed in their service. But we strive for 100% uptime and that's what we work towards. So I think as many of our competitors and many other retailers in general experience, there are some things that you can continue to learn through the expansion of the online business, but we're very committed to that and we see tremendous growth in this long-term for us.
Daniel Hofkin – William Blair & Company: Great guys. Congrats again and good luck.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Erika Maschmeyer from Robert W. Baird. Please proceed with your question.
Erika Maschmeyer – Robert W. Baird: Hello. Thanks and congratulations. With your gross margin expansion in Q3, you noted it was up 100 basis points, 70 basis points from leverage and 60 basis points from merch margin. What was the offset there, fewer supply chain efficiencies or?
Gregg Bodnar: A combination of two things as I think I mentioned last quarter. We will have small amount of costs in the back half of this year as we're bringing up the Northeast D.C. We're doing some of that preparation to bring it online next year and it relates to the inventory too. We spend a little bit more on supply chain costs again to bring some of the inventory in sooner than we had last year, better prepare for the start for the holiday season which turned out to be a very successful initiative.
Erika Maschmeyer – Robert W. Baird: Great. And then on the real estate side, are there any particular retailers whose old boxes you’re scooping, any particular focus from geographic or regional perspective? I think you had been filling in on the western part of the U.S. there for a while and do you have any kind of non-10,000 square foot boxes in that mix?
Gregg Bodnar: Geographically, the same opportunities exist as they have in the past and we've been capitalizing on those opportunities primarily as we're seeing high-quality existing locations come back on to the market, either chains that are downsizing or chains that are going out that had high-quality real estate that wasn't the business issue, but it's on both coasts. So the opportunities on both coasts, those are some of the areas we're focused on, but not exclusively focused on. And then as it relates to – you can think through some of the failures you've seen lately, like Borders as an example. A lot of high-quality real estate, that wasn't their issue, a lot of those boxes have gone back to developers now and where there is opportunities for them to split them up and us to work with them to take some great real estate locations, we're doing so.
Chuck Rubin: Erika, just to add – the other part of your answer. Most of these sites that we’re getting are about the 10,000 square foot footprint that we've been building, so it's not a different size. Also, keep in mind that we are less than halfway through our 1,000 store build-out. So there really is not a geography in the U.S. that we don't have opportunity to expand in. So this has been an opportunistic play as opposed to a targeted real estate play. We have opportunity everywhere and where the opportunity has arisen to get a good site, we've taken it.
Erika Maschmeyer – Robert W. Baird: And just a clarification or a curiosity question. With the OPI nail gel service, are you going to be also adding manicure and pedicure services?
Chuck Rubin: Well, it actually is a – it is a dry manicure, not a wet manicure. So essentially it is a manicure service, kind of a modified manicure. We will not be doing pedicures, it will only be manicures. They'll be done by the stylists. We are up and running right now. We have been testing it for some period of time with some good success and we've now put it into about 200 stores or so that are up and running now and the initial results are very encouraging.
Erika Maschmeyer – Robert W. Baird: Okay. Thanks so much.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Joe Altobello from Oppenheimer & Company. Please proceed with your question.
Christina – Oppenheimer & Company: Hi, this is actually Christina in for Joe. I was just wondering if you could give a little bit more color on the Lancome test, how many doors that you expect to be in?
Chuck Rubin: No, Christina, what I said in my comments was we successfully launched it in the 29 stores we had previously announced and we're very pleased with the results so far. And as we had talked about before, we'll keep you up-to-date as developments continue to unfold there, but right now we're in the 29 doors.
Christina – Oppenheimer & Company: Okay. And then do you expect to see or are you seeing same-store sales growth growing faster at stores that have the Lancome than other stores?
Chuck Rubin: We wouldn't get into those details, but you can – where I'd leave it is, we are very pleased with how this has launched and we're excited to have it in the portfolio. We think our guest has been looking for it and we think it's been a very nice addition to the offering.
Christina – Oppenheimer & Company: Okay, great. And then just one follow-up question. You have a target of 1,000 doors. With the improved economics do you see an upside to that number?
Chuck Rubin: We're actually going through that analysis now and we'll come back and talk to you more as we finish that.
Christina – Oppenheimer & Company: Okay. Thank you so much.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Jason Gere from RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.
Jason Gere - RBC Capital Markets: Okay, thanks. Good afternoon. I guess just two questions. One, I guess thinking about the new pipeline of stores for next year. What percentage of that would run to the new DC? I'm just trying to think about – I mean, the new DC and when that would get the leverage. I assume it'd probably be like 200 or so that would probably get you full average on the DC. But just wondering how you think about that and in terms of the transition from some of the stores that are at the Chicago DC going over to Pennsylvania DC?
Gregg Bodnar: Jason, we'll bring that DC online starting in the beginning of next year and then we will slowly ramp it up. We have a lot of stores up in the Northeast today that are being serviced out of our Chicago facility and those will be the first candidates that we will move over to that new distribution center. Next year the impact of that the new distribution center will be as I mentioned on the last call, a little bit of a negative impact on gross margin, although gross margin will still expand significantly next year. But we expect it's probably going to have about 10 basis points of negative impact on gross margin for the year. Start-up costs in the first part of the year as we ramp that DC up, then as we start to put stores into it in the back half of the year bringing those stores in from the Northeast that they will then be closer to their distribution point, we'll get some leverage in transportation costs.
Jason Gere - RBC Capital Markets: Okay, great. And just broadly speaking, if you think about your merchandising activity for this holiday season versus maybe last year, can you just compare and contrast where you think maybe you're being more aggressive or where you think the programs are a little bit better. I just wonder if you could talk maybe a couple and give a little bit of color, some anecdotes about, obviously without giving away some competitive secrets, but just talking about the pace of growth versus last year? Thanks.
Chuck Rubin: Jason, I'd tell you in a couple of areas. Within our offering, newness continues to be very exciting. There is newness in our color offering, there is newness in our skincare offering and newness in particular in fragrance has been very, very strong and given the importance of fragrance in this fourth quarter, we're especially excited about that. We think it sets up very well for our gift-giving business. But even the newness in skincare when you then move to January, we have a significant skincare event. Here again, I think that it positions us well. Our eventing, where we actually bring the product to life for our guests, is up significantly this holiday season compared to last year and we think that makes the shopping experience that much more special compared to our competition and certainly what we've done in the past.  And then just to touch on the marketing for a moment, our marketing outreach this year is broader than it has been before. It certainly leverages our successful print campaign and the loyalty database that we have, which continues to grow and be a very core part of what we used to market affectively. But this year we're going to leverage radio and there will be a component of radio in all stores. It will be a national program and then it will be heavied up in a number of key markets. We're also leveraging digital media more. Our Facebook presence is more significant. Our digital outreach also is more significant. So there is a lot of excitement and that has led to our guidance that we've given that we think we're going to have another really good quarter.
Jason Gere - RBC Capital Markets: Here is kind of an abstract question, but when you think about the events that you're going to be doing then, the radio, digital, where do you get the best ROI? I mean how do you kind of measure that? Just figure out where do you put an incremental dollar to work in terms of getting a better lift on your sales?
Gregg Bodnar: Yeah. We're a pretty analytical company and that's part of a discipline that has allowed us to seize a lot of this growth. So we measure ROIs on our marketing spend pretty aggressively, but there are certain components that are difficult to measure. The radio that we're doing this holiday, we've talked about our testing of radio over the past couple of quarters so you can – we've obviously been encouraged by those tests and that's why we're pushing into this more aggressively. So I wouldn't get into a lot more detail about ROIs by vehicle. I think that's a bit of the secret sauce for us, but I would stress that we are very focused on returns of every investment that we make, whether it's a new store or a new DC or the marketing spend that we have.
Jason Gere - RBC Capital Markets: Great. Thanks a lot guys.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Evren Kopelman from Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.
Evren Kopelman - Wells Fargo Securities: Thanks. Good afternoon guys. I have a couple of questions. One of them is, if you can comment on the environment for this holiday. For most categories – and that I wanted to ask if you think beauty is this way, did the mall and the department stores are very promotional, incrementally promotional year-over-year. Are you seeing that in beauty as well, looking at gift with purchases or any other promotions like that?
Chuck Rubin: I don't know if beauty is more proportional than it was last year, but the environment is widely promotional. I'm not sure if I would conclude that even the apparel or the electronic guys are a lot more promotional than a year ago, but that's just personal observation. Clearly, when you get into the gift-giving season, the competitive field for beauty becomes broader because the shopper has lots of choices for that gift, whether it's apparel or electronics or beauty. We feel very, very confident in our strategy in how we're set for the holiday selling season. As we've mentioned, we're pleased with how we've gotten off into the quarter so far and I think that what makes us unique is the broad range of offering that we have. We have fashion and trend and we have value as well. So we do provide a very appealing offering and a very appealing shopping experience for the holiday season. So we're very comfortable with how we stack up against other beauty retailers as well as other types of product retailers.
Evren Kopelman - Wells Fargo Securities: And then the second question is on inventory. This year you're going to end down per store. Do you think you have an opportunity for that next year as well, or that would be a part of your inventory strategy, or is that just an event for this year? Thank you.
Gregg Bodnar: We are constantly – a little bit like Chuck's comment on return on investment, we are constantly focused on continue and improve the productivity of our inventory. We are talking about our plans for next year. Don’t have anything specific yet, but we will continue to drive the inventory productivity that has helped deliver the earnings results that we've been delivering today.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Jill Caruthers from Johnson Rice. Please proceed with your question.
Jill Caruthers - Johnson Rice & Company LLC: Good afternoon. Two quick questions. I guess just following up on the comments you made on the promotional events and marketing events, you're holding more of them. Have you seen if this attracts a new customer or just that existing customer to add another trip to your store?
Chuck Rubin: Yeah, Jill, just to clarify, I wouldn't describe these marketing events as more promotional. In my terminology, promotional is discounting. In fact, that's not what this entails. They are more marketing, there is more demonstrations, there is more interaction between our team and the store and the customers. So just to clarify that, it is not focused on price discounting. As far as new customers versus existing, I think it's both. We continue to expand, we believe share well with our existing customer base as well as attracting new.
Jill Caruthers – Johnson Rice & Company LLC: Okay. And is it safe to assume that November simply tracked in line with your fourth quarter comp guidance?
Chuck Rubin: I don't know if we'd get into the details on that. Just that – although the bulk of the holiday selling season is still ahead of us, we're accountable with how November went. I'm pleased with how it went and that's incorporated into the guidance that we provided today.
Jill Caruthers – Johnson Rice & Company LLC: All right, appreciate it. Thank you.
Operator: (Operator instructions). Our next question comes from the line of Elizabeth Howell from Raymond James. Please proceed with your question.
Elizabeth Howell - Raymond James: Thanks and let me add my congratulations on a great quarter as well. I just wanted to check for an update on the loyalty program, IT platform. Was that completed in the third quarter as planned? And any clarity on when we might see the two loyalty programs transition onto one?
Gregg Bodnar: We did finish it. As we mentioned on the last quarter call that we were bringing that platform up. We did do that successfully. We were extremely pleased with the performance of the new platform. All stores are up and operating on it now and again very smooth transition, very pleased with the transition to the new platform.
Chuck Rubin: As far as the transition to the new program, Elizabeth, we'll talk more about that on our next earnings call when we speak more explicitly about 2012, but I do anticipate that you'll start to see us move stores over to the new points program during next year.
Elizabeth Howell – Raymond James: Okay, great. And then I know we need to think about some gross margin drag in the first half of 2012 with the new DC. Are there any other investment projects we need think about for next year, perhaps something in terms of the timing of your accelerated store plan openings?
Gregg Bodnar: As we look to next year to expand the store program from the 60 that we did this year, our intention would be to balance more of those openings going from the 60 up into the first half of this year. Having said that, that will not create a drag on gross margin. We will continue to expand gross margin all year long, including the first half of the year.
Elizabeth Howell – Raymond James: Okay, great. Thanks.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Randy Konik from Jefferies & Company. Please proceed with your question.
Shreya Jawalkar – Jefferies & Company: Hey guys. This is Shreya Jawalkar filling in for Randy. Just wanted to ask about your regional performance. I know you mentioned some weakness due to the storm in the Northeast, but aside from that did you see any differences within the country?
Chuck Rubin: No, we have good performance countrywide. We had good solid growth in every part of the country.
Shreya Jawalkar – Jefferies & Company: Okay. And then just a follow-up on comp trends. Obviously, you guys have been doing a great job despite the difficult compare. Do you see any change in the comp metrics as we go forward?
Chuck Rubin: In terms of the comps that we deliver, is that what you mean?
Shreya Jawalkar -- Jefferies & Company: Yeah, in terms of the – like with traffic and conversion, what's driving the comps now? Are they – do you see similar metrics driving the number up as we look towards next year?
Chuck Rubin: I think that I'd focus on the guidance that we gave to you for fourth quarter and tell you that our strategies – we're pleased with our strategies. We think that they are the right ones for our business. We're pleased with how we're executing and we think that 2012 and beyond we have continued growth ahead of us.
Shreya Jawalkar – Jefferies & Company: Okay, great. Thank you.
Operator: There are no further questions in the queue. I'd like to hand the call back over to management for closing comments.
Chuck Rubin: Thank you, operator. Well, let me thank everyone for joining us today and on behalf of Gregg, let me wish you all a very happy and healthy holiday season and look forward to speaking to you the beginning of next year.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect your lines at this time and have a wonderful day.

Operator: Greetings, and welcome to the Ulta Beauty Second Quarter 2011 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. (Operator instructions) It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Allison Malkin of ICR. Thank you, Ms. Malkin, you may now begin.
Allison Malkin: Thank you. Good afternoon. Before we get started, I would like to remind you of the company's Safe Harbor language, which I'm sure you're all familiar with. The statements contained in this conference call, which are not historical facts may be deemed to constitute forward-looking statements, within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual future results may differ materially from those projected in such statements, due to a number of risks and uncertainties, all of which are described in the company's filings with the SEC. We will make references during this call to the metric free cash flow, a non-GAAP financial measure defined as cash provided by operating activities, less purchases of property and equipment. Now, I would like to turn the call over to Ulta’s President and CEO, Chuck Rubin.
Chuck Rubin: Thanks, Allison. Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us to discuss our fiscal 2011 second quarter results. On the call with me today is our Chief Financial Officer, Gregg Bodnar. Following my opening remarks, Gregg will review our second quarter financial results and provide our outlook. I will then offer some closing comments and turn the call over to the operator so that we can answer the questions you have for us today. We are very pleased to deliver better-than-expected second quarter sales and earnings, which continued our favorable momentum from the first quarter. Our results included strength across our key financial metrics. Specifically, we increased net sales by 22.6% to $394.6 million. We grew comparable store sales by 11.3% following a 10.8% comp gain in the second quarter last year. Our comp increase was balanced across categories and continues to be led by increased customer traffic with modest increases in average ticket. We increased our gross margin by 170 basis points, which included a 90 basis point improvement in merchandise margin. We grew operating income 78% with operating margin increasing by 320 basis points to 10.1% of sales, and we increased net income by 83% resulting in EPS of $0.38 surpassing our guidance of $0.31 to $0.33 per diluted share, and up 73% from the second quarter last year. We believe our consistent performance results from our compelling store experience; expansive and sought after selection of brands, products and services; our knowledgeable and friendly associates; and our disciplined approach to managing our business. During the second quarter, we successfully advanced our five key growth initiatives. Let me share just a couple of highlights with you. First, our store expansion continued favorably and included the opening of 21 new stores and 15 remodels. We continue to be pleased with our new store performance and remain on track to open approximately 61 new stores, representing a 16% increase in square footage growth. We're also very pleased with our remodel program, which completely updates our store to our latest prototype, and has generated an attractive payback. For 2011, we have now completed our 17 planned remodels. Second, we continue to improve our guest offering as we launched new products within existing brands and added new brands. A few examples include the launch of They're Real Mascara by Benefit, which produced our highest weekly unit sales ever in mascara. In addition, Philosophy continued its strong comp trend, which we were particularly pleased with given the anniversary of its introduction in Q2 last year. This performance was fueled by product innovation across the assortment, and the successful introduction of Philosophy's Mommy & Baby. We were also pleased with the ongoing strength of Urban Decay and Tarte. Our growth in the nail category continued strongly as we capitalized on new trends in color and novelty, such as Shatter from OPI, which continued to be our top brand. In men’s, we saw a positive response to our new men's shop, which we introduced in the quarter and encompasses our complete assortment of men’s products in one convenient and inviting setting. Fragrance sales also saw robust growth driven by the introduction of several new scents including (inaudible), Gucci Guilty Pour Homme, and Justin Bieber Someday. During the quarter, we set our new fragrance shop, which we believe elevates our offering giving fragrance stronger placement in showcasing our full assortment in an easiest to shop format. Here too we were pleased on our new shop's initial performance. Professional hair care was another standout in the quarter. We saw positive performance from new brand launches, including Living Proof and AG, and also several long-standing brands such as Pureology. In regards to our third strategy, we continued to utilize our loyalty database to better target our direct mail and e-mail outreach. In addition, we saw growth in our loyalty database and now have over 8.5 million active guests. We remain focused on advancing our loyalty efforts and expect to see continued long-term benefits resulting from this program. Fourth, we continue to build upon our successful print marketing efforts by adding greater use of social media, in-store eventing, and testing of new media including radio to highlight customer focused marketing events. For example, in May, we introduced our Love Your Hair event. We successfully showed women the newest ways to pamper their straight, curly, or wavy hair with innovative tools and products best suited for their hair type. This event was supported with new hair products, tools, and salon services, all animated in-store with ongoing demonstrations focused each week on a different hair segment. This combination was successful in driving a double-digit sales increase over our promotion last year that primarily emphasized products only. We also significantly improved our marketing around fashion trends by using in-store displays, print advertising, and ulta.com to highlight color trend themes like Crazy for Coral and Gold Rush. By cross merchandising key products across our broad category offering, we successfully showed our guests how to make the latest trend right for her. We will continue this effort as we believe our guest relies on us, not only for the broadest assortment of any beauty retailer, but also the beauty authority in what is new and fun. On our fifth growth initiative, ulta.com continued its growth in both generating online sales and re-enforcing our brick and mortar business. An expanded product offering, greater editorial content in our beauty destination section and events like our lunch hour specials continue to perform well for us. Our e-commerce sales are still very underdeveloped but we continue to believe there is this great long-term runway ahead for ulta.com to both grow revenue and support a multi-channel strategy. And finally in stores, during the second quarter we continued to improve our guest service levels. This long-term initiative includes simplifying the operations of our store to allow more store labor to be directed to serving the guest, along with providing more time for additional training to our store teams. Our objective is quite simple, to provide the most knowledgeable, most enthusiastic beauty associates in the retail arena. We believe this effort will build upon our already strong existing foundation. Turning to our salon, we achieved a positive comp in the quarter, yet continued to perform below the rate of retail. During the quarter, we saw increased traffic in our salons as we increased our e-mail and direct mail communications. We expect to enhance our salon performance as we introduce new products and trends. For example, late in the second quarter, we launched a new hair straightening product that our stylists are excited about and we are adding a new feather weave [ph] service in the third quarter to capitalize on this hot trend. We expect these and other newness efforts to provide for improving trends in our salon for the balance of this year. As we look to the third quarter, we are conscious that the general economy in the surrounding headlines have weighed on consumer confidence, and while we are not impervious to this, we do believe that our strong and flexible business model will allow us to continue to gain profitable market share. In a nutshell, we remain confident in our strategies and our ability to execute well and as such we are expecting a strong year. With that as a backdrop, let me share with you some of the expected drivers of our third quarter performance. Our store expansion remains on track and includes 26 new store openings during the quarter. We are well on our way to the 61 anticipated new stores this year. As we look to 2012, our store pipeline is in excellent shape with expected square footage growth in the 15% to 20% range we have previously communicated. In Q3, we will continue to fully integrate our product newness with marketing and store events to create more powerful promotions. To this end, our 21 Days of Beauty event which kicked off this past Labor Day weekend, includes more new products, more exciting events, more beauty steals, and more great products at great values to reward our guests. We will continue to communicate this across all of our marketing media. Also, during our 21 Days of Beauty, we launched a truly exciting new partnership with Conde Nast. This relationship brings together the power of Ulta’s offering, stores and website with the most iconic fashion and beauty editorial brands. Some of the specifics of the program include one, offering our customers a $21 annual subscription to receive both Allure and Glamour magazines. This price will be the absolute lowest that a customer can find. Secondly, utilizing the fashion and beauty editorial content of Allure and Glamour, we're also highlighting their brands in our stores and marketing programs. And finally, third, employing a multi-platform marketing approach that will include the various magazine titles of Conde Nast as well as leveraging both organizations’ digital assets. Continuing with our marketing programs in October, we will support Breast Cancer Awareness Month with our (inaudible) campaign. This effort follows our Windows of Love campaign that we held during the previous two years. This year, our plan has a number of new exciting components including new exclusive products that will benefit the Breast Cancer Research Foundation, a new more expansive marketing outreach in our stores and in all of our marketing pieces, and finally, on October 16, a Salon Cut-a-Thon that we believe will introduce our salons across the country to new guests while also contributing to a very worthwhile fund raising effort. Supporting these and all of our marketing efforts throughout the quarter will be the further use of our loyalty database allowing us to better target both direct mail and e-mail communications, which thus far this year has proven successful. Finally in the third quarter, we also expect to complete the basic technology upgrades necessary to allow our transition from the current two loyalty programs to one nationwide loyalty program. Completing this transition will take additional time, but with the basic technology in place we hope to begin that transition in 2012. Turning to our guest offering, we will introduce a number of new brands across categories. In professional hair products, we will introduce (inaudible), in styling tools Orbit by Chi, and in Prestige skin and color, we will launch nationally both Jabot and Laura Geller. We will also introduce several brand extensions including Tarte's True Blood, Urban Decay's Anniversary Palette, Book of Shadows IV and a restage of Smashbox that includes new products in foundation, powder, and eye color. In addition, we will see brand extensions from Benefit with Lash Lovelies, and in Bare Escentuals with Ready Eyeshadows. Also exclusively to Ulta is a four piece kit with purchase from Bare Escentuals. Finally in our product offering, we are especially pleased to announce the introduction of Lancome in prestige color and skin in 29 stores across four markets, including New Jersey, Illinois, Nevada, and North Carolina. As you know, Lancome is one of the most prestigious brands globally and its addition represents a very strong complement to our existing prestige offerings. We are supporting this test with print and digital marketing to drive sales from existing guests and also hope to broaden our customer reach with these efforts. We believe the addition of Lancome in prestige cosmetics and skin care continues to reinforce Ulta as the authority in beauty. In ulta.com, we expect to implement several enhancements to improve the guest experience. We recently introduced new consistent branding across our website, new IT enhancements that are expected to increase checkout speed and further improve our search capability and coming is a new product recommendation feature. Additionally, we will introduce a refill reminder to help our guests recall when it is time to replenish frequently purchased products. Taking a broad look at Q3, we believe we have exciting initiatives in place that will result in third quarter comparable store sales surpassing our previously stated long-term 3% to 5% comp sales goals, and based on strong performance for the first half of the year and our positive Q3 outlook, we also expect our annual net income growth to surpass the high end of our long-term goal of 25% to 30%. In addition, we continue to expect to generate free cash flow. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Gregg to review our financials in more detail.
Gregg Bodnar: Thanks, Chuck. We are very pleased with our second quarter results, which exceeded our guidance and were driven by better than expected sales and margin performance and expense management. During the quarter, we delivered a 22.6% increase in total sales, to $395 million, ahead of our guidance of $378 million to $384 million. Comp store sales increased 11.3%, which was also ahead of our guidance range of 6% to 8%. We remain very pleased with the performance of our new stores, which continue to exceed our expectations. During the quarter, we opened 21 new stores and completed 15 remodels. We have now completed our remodel program for the year, which included a total of 17 locations. At quarter end, we operated 415 stores, expanding square footage by 18% from last year's second quarter. Gross profit dollars increased 29.2% to $134.3 million from $104 million last year. Gross profit margin increased 170 basis points to 34%. The increase in gross profit margin was primarily driven by 90 basis points of improvement in merchandise margin, 60 basis points of increased leverage in fixed store cost due to our comp store sales increase, and 20 basis points of improvement from supply-chain efficiencies. SG&A expenses were $90.8 million, or 23% of net sales, compared to $79.9 million or 24.8% of net sales last year. The 180 basis points of SG&A reduction was driven by leverage on sales growth and continued prudent management of our cost structure. SG&A leverage was approximately 100 basis points excluding the non-recurring compensation charge in last year’s second quarter. Pre-opening expenses totaled $3.8 million in the quarter, which compares to $1.8 million in the second quarter last year. We opened 21 new stores and remodeled 15 existing locations during the quarter. This compares to 10 new store openings, 1 relocation and 3 remodels last year. Our better than expected sales growth and margin expansion, combined with our continued prudent expense management, resulted in operating margin expansion of 320 basis points to 10.1% from 6.9% last year. Interest expense was $147,000 and represents fees associated with our credit facility, which we have not used this year. The income tax rate for the second quarter was 39.5%, which compares to a tax rate of 40.7% in last year’s second quarter, and was in line with our expectations. The lower tax rate was driven by a decrease in non-deductible compensation expense compared to second quarter last year. Net income for the quarter increased 83% to $23.9 million or $0.38 per diluted share. This includes the additional pre-opening expense from our expanded new store program, which negatively impacted EPS by $0.02 per share. Net income was $13.1 million or $0.22 per diluted share last year, and included a $0.03 per share non-recurring compensation charge. Now turning to the balance sheet and cash flow, merchandise inventories at the end of the second quarter increased 15% to $258.8 million compared to $224.3 million at the end of the second quarter last year. The increase primarily reflects the addition of 59 net new stores held over the past 12 months. Average inventory per store declined 1% from the prior year, reflecting the combined efforts of inventory management initiatives, coupled with inventory increases to support the 11.3% comp store sales increase. We continue to effectively manage both the composition and level of inventory to deliver variety and newness to our customer in support of our growth initiatives. Capital expenditures for the second quarter were $33.2 million, depreciation and amortization was $18.9 million. Our balance sheet remained strong with no debt and $140 million of cash and cash equivalents. Now, I’d like to turn to our third quarter outlook. We currently estimate net sales in the range of $400 million to $407 million, compared to actual third quarter 2010 net sales of $339.2 million. This assumes a comp store sales increase of 6% to 8%. We plan to open approximately 26 new stores in the third quarter compared to 30 new stores last year in the third quarter. Income per diluted share for the third quarter is estimated in the range of $0.36 to $0.38. This compares to actual income per diluted share of $0.23 in the third quarter of last year, representing a growth rate of 60% at the midpoint of this range. Income per diluted share in the third quarter of 2010 included a $0.02 per share non-recurring compensation charge. In addition, gross profit margin – we expect gross profit margin to expand by approximately 50 basis points at the midpoint of the guidance range from last year’s gross profit margin of 35.1%. As we have stated in the past, as we accelerate our new store program throughout the remainder of the year, it will have an expected impact to gross profit margin. Our gross profit margin will continue to increase, but not at the same rate as the second quarter, as an example. This is a normal and expected impact of our store model and the acceleration of our new store program. Gross profit margin expansion will continue to be driven by fixed store leverage on a comp store sales growth, merchandised margin improvement and supply chain efficiencies. We expect SG&A as a percentage of net sales to decrease approximately 170 basis points at the midpoint of the guidance range compared to last year’s rate of 26.6%. You may remember last year our SG&A rate was negatively impacted by approximately 40 basis points as a result of the one-time non-recurring compensation charge. As a result, we expect to deliver up to 250 basis points of operating margin expansion during the third quarter, while accelerating our new store growth program. We also expect the following for the third quarter, pre-opening expenses to be approximately $4 million, an effective tax rate of approximately 40% compared to 40.9% in the third quarter last year, and fully diluted share count to be approximately $64 million. Given our strong performance in the first and second quarter and our expectations for the third quarter, we continue to expect our 2011 annual performance to exceed our long-term financial goals. As we have often discussed, our business model has been built to generate 25% to 30% annual net income growth through the achievement of 3% to 5% annual comp store sales gains, square footage growth of 15% to 20% annually, and operating margin expansion as we progress to our near-term low double-digit operating margin target. In addition, we expect to exceed the high end of our 3% to 5% long-term target for comp store sales growth by approximately 300 basis points for the full year 2011. As a result, we also expect to exceed the high end of our long-term net income target for the full year, which assumes the add-back of the 2010 impact of the $0.06 per share related to the non-recurring compensation charge. In addition, our store expansion initiatives include the opening of approximately 61 new stores, delivering square footage expansion of 16% in 2011. In addition, we continue to expect the following for fiscal 2011. Our store opening plans by quarter for the remainder of the year is expected to approximate 26 new stores in Q3, and nine new stores in Q4. The corresponding preopening expenses will be approximately $4 million in Q3 and approximately $1 million in Q4. We expect a full year tax rate of approximately 40% and full year diluted share count of approximately $63.5 million. Capital expenditures in 2011 are expected to be approximately $130 million, which is roughly $30 million higher than our capital expenditure program in 2010. The increased investment reflects our store expansion program, as well as investments we will make in technology and infrastructure to support our strategies and future store growth. This increase also includes the addition of a third distribution center. We have recently executed a lease for the building. The new facility will be located in Chambersburg, Pennsylvania, and is scheduled to open in 2012. We take a very disciplined approach to infrastructure investments, and expect to open our third DC on time and within budget, as we did our second DC. Depreciation and amortization will be approximately $77 million. Average inventory per store is expected to decrease by approximately 1% to 3%. We believe our continued strong performance in the second quarter reflects the solid execution of our strategies and our disciplined approach to growing our business. We are pleased with the results of our efforts and remain focused on driving sales and earnings growth, generating free cash flow, and expanding operating margin. This year, we expect to achieve a 10% operating margin, which we believe further supports our ability to expand operating margin solidly into the low double-digit range by 2012, 2013 time period. We also remain confident in our ability to achieve the mid-teen operating margin as we look further up. As we continue to evaluate the use of our cash resources, our focus remains on appropriately investing in the growth of our business, both physical locations and our e-commerce channel in order to maximize value for our shareholders. Now, I'd like to turn the call back over to Chuck.
Chuck Rubin: Thanks, Gregg. In summary, we are pleased to deliver another outstanding quarter and remain optimistic as we begin the second half of the year. Our strategies are driving strong results. We have a focused and passionate team, and we believe we are well-positioned to continue our favorable sales and earnings momentum in 2011 and longer term. With that, let me turn the call over to the operator to begin the Q&A portion of the call. Operator?
Operator: Thank you. (Operator instructions) Our first question comes from Jill Caruthers from Johnson Rice & Company.
Jill Caruthers - Johnson Rice & Company: The tests you are doing on the Lancome cosmetics, it looks it started to kind of reaching some of those stores in the past week or two. If you could talk about, I know, you have been in ongoing conversations with these companies, kind of what initiated this test, what do you feel like they were open to being on the shelves at Ulta?
Chuck Rubin: Jill, you were going in and out a bit. I think the question is what was behind Lancome getting started with us. We've talked before that our business model is built on having a broad offering, and that the iconic brands are great additions to that, but that our long-term financial expectations could be achieved without them. With that said, we have maintained ongoing dialog with Lancome, and I think that the time was right in our business, and they were impressed with the other brands that we had in our offering, as well as what our stores are like and the customer base that we have. So, we're excited to have that as part of our offering in those 29 stores, it’s actually 28 right now with a new store opening next month, that will be the 29th store, but we are very pleased to have them as part of that offering.
Jill Caruthers - Johnson Rice & Company: And any insight into kind of the timing of the test or when a potential fuller rollout might be or…
Chuck Rubin: No, we're pleased with where we are right now and as things develop, we’ll keep you apprised.
Jill Caruthers - Johnson Rice & Company: Okay. I appreciate it, and then, just last question, more of a longer term picture type question on your store prototype. As you are adding new brands, you build out brand boutiques in the men’s and store type shop. Do you feel like the box currently is big enough or do you feel like you might see some significant change in the mix as in, per se let's say, decreased mass product or what not?
Chuck Rubin: No, I think the box is big enough. I think the gentlemen who heads up our store design has done a wonderful job of building a very flexible box, and we're able to add boutiques, we're able to size them in different ways, and we've made a number of enhancements to what many of you may have heard us refer to as our level 7 prototype. So, I don’t see the box, which is about 10,000 feet, getting bigger. I do see us being able to make the box more productive as new brands come in or new statements or new services come in over the long term.
Jill Caruthers - Johnson Rice & Company: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Brian Tunick from JP Morgan Chase.
Brian Tunick - JP Morgan Chase: Thanks. Good afternoon everyone, and congrats.
Chuck Rubin: Hi, Brian.
Brian Tunick - JP Morgan Chase: I have a couple of questions, really going to stay on that real estate side. First, if you maybe guys could talk about how many leases you’ve already signed for next year? Give us some idea of new sort of versus existing centers. I know there's been a lot of talk about lack of, I guess, strip center development. So maybe, what’s been happening in your comps and maybe even different classes or co-tenancies? And then, finally, maybe Gregg, it sounds like you’ve taken a year out of the payback of the new stores. Are you still seeing that sort of 17%, 18% four wall [ph] margin for each store at maturity, or has something changed there?
Chuck Rubin: Brian, I’ll take the first few, and then let Gregg pick up on it. We wouldn’t get into details on exact status of the leases, but as we said in the prepared comments, we feel very good about where we are for next year on our pipeline, and we’ve said before that it would be in that 15% to 20% range. So, you can do the math. We feel very good about that. As far as new and existing, as we’ve talked before and as you would expect, a higher chunk of those new stores are coming out of existing real estate that has been repurposed somehow, and that’s just a state of the general marketplace. There are some seeds out there. It’s too early to call it a real resurgence, but there are a couple of seeds of new development that could be out there in the next few years, but for the near-term, defining near-term as at least 2012, there'll be a higher chunk of existing stores that get redone into an Ulta. As far as comps across the classes, here again, we wouldn’t break that out, but we’re pleased with our portfolio across the board, both in age of store, as well as the geography of the store. We saw strength across the country in our market. So, it wasn’t one market or one class of store that carried that strong comp in Q2.
Gregg Bodnar: And Brian, on the store model itself, you’re correct. We have taken the payback down to two years. It was up over 3.5 years several years ago, as you may remember. In terms of four wall contribution, it’s certainly – as we've continued to drive operating margin, it has continued to improve as well, because that operating margin not only benefits the new store model but it benefits the existing store. So, they’re performing a little bit better than that 17%, 18% of maturity.
Brian Tunick - JP Morgan Chase: All right. Terrific, great. Thanks very much and good luck.
Chuck Rubin: Thanks Brian.
Gregg Bodnar: Thanks Brian.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Daniel Hofkin from William Blair & Company.
Daniel Hofkin - William Blair & Company: Good afternoon. Great job once again.
Chuck Rubin: Thank you, Dan.
Daniel Hofkin - William Blair & Company: Question, I guess, follow up on the Lancome, which seems very encouraging. I guess I’d be interested in your thoughts regarding either – and I know you probably don’t want to give much detail on further rollout at this time, but does this affect, maybe positively, implications for other brands of similar stature over time? And then, I guess regarding this test, I guess what – maybe if you could share some insight on what kind of drove the specific markets for these tests?
Chuck Rubin: Look Dan, we’re very pleased to have Lancome in, and the reason that we’ve announced it here is that as it was done now, it was found by an analyst and we didn’t want all of you to get ahead of yourselves on this. It is in 29 stores, in 28 today and 29th coming in a couple of weeks. We're very happy because we think it’s good for our guest, and I think it opens up some new guests for Lancome. We know that we continue to take market share and that we continue to perform better in our growth trajectory than a department store does. So, I think Lancome and Ulta are both very pleased with where we are and we will see where it goes from there. Getting into any more detail on that, it just wouldn’t be appropriate at this point. As far as the markets, we wanted to have some density of those markets, so that we could advertise and we could put the power of Ulta behind this brand introduction. We have a very effective marketing machine and that will go to work, as it broke this past Sunday, which was our first ad on our mailer that just began this past Sunday. We will put that marketing machine behind Lancome.
Daniel Hofkin - William Blair & Company: That is great, and then I guess thinking about – one thing I would ask, would you mind, I think you provided this earlier and the audio was going in and out on my end of it. Therefore, would you mind just giving the gross margin and SG&A guidance for the third quarter, just sort of the overall range you expect?
Gregg Bodnar: On gross margin for the third quarter, the midpoint plus 50 basis points, and SG&A, at the midpoint plus 170.
Daniel Hofkin - William Blair & Company: In that plus 170, that is relative to last year's GAAP number?
Gregg Bodnar: Correct, correct. Off of the 26.6 last year.
Daniel Hofkin - William Blair & Company: Okay. That is great. Again, best of luck in the second half.
Chuck Rubin: Thanks Dan.
Gregg Bodnar: Thanks Dan.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Erika Maschmeyer from Robert W. Baird.
Erika Maschmeyer - Robert W. Baird: Thanks and congratulations.
Chuck Rubin: Thank you, Erika.
Erika Maschmeyer - Robert W. Baird: Could you give a little bit more detail on the Conde Nast partnership? What led to that? What you're most excited about on the timing?
Chuck Rubin: Yes. The power of Conde Nast in the portfolio of titles that they have and their iconic nature in fashion and beauty was really attractive to us. In return, where we stand in the beauty industry and the breadth of what we offer and the strength of our relationship with our guests was very attractive to them. So, we've been talking with them obviously for a little bit, and the relationship has just been kicked off, if you will, this past weekend with our mailer. I think it has a lot of places that it can go, but what you've seen thus far this week, is we will use their titles, we will use their editorial content on our websites and in store. And as I mentioned in my prepared comments, we’re going to be able to leverage our digital assets. Conde Nast has a subscriber base, I believe somewhere over $50 million, which is very attractive for us to work with them on, and ultimately the magazine offer that we are introducing now with the $21 for an annual subscription to both Allure and Glamour is just a terrific deal for our guests. So, we are excited about this partnership. We hope that it lasts a long time and we think that we have a clear path of what we hope to achieve in the near-term, and we think over the long-term, it could lead to some very interesting places.
Erika Maschmeyer - Robert W. Baird: Great, and then, your royalty rollout is obviously really exciting. When do you expect to be able to complete that, what are the risks that you are looking at, and are you going to take a break for the holidays to avoid potential disruption or is that not a concern?
Chuck Rubin: Yes. No, let me clarify that, because I don’t want there to be any confusion about this. We are not moving any more stores today from one program to the other. What we have had to do which we are completing in the third quarter is to get the technology platform in place to allow that transition to occur. So, the technology platform we will be in place with this year, we will not convert any new stores for the balance of this year as we do throughout the company. As you get ready for holiday, we essentially stop any new IT enhancements, which you can well respect. The transition of stores will start to happen at some point in 2012. There is still work to be done on this. So I do not want anybody to think that we will be converting quickly in the early part of 2012 to one program that is not the case. But this technology component, which was necessary to accommodate that transition is nearing its completion, that’s why I wanted to call it out in the comments, because we have been running on two programs for a while, and I know you’ve asked – this group has asked many times, at some point, aren’t we go to move to one. We’re finally getting closer to the point of starting that transition to one.
Erika Maschmeyer - Robert W. Baird: Got it. That is helpful. And then just quickly, timing and potential margin impact from new DC, I know that you expect to get it on time and within budget, but are there certain quarters where you might see a bit more of an SG&A or margin impact than others?
Gregg Bodnar: You know, we’re doing some work to develop now that we’ve got the lease signed, to develop and fit out the inside of the building, start training folks, bringing staff onboard et cetera. So that’s the activity for 2011. Back half of the year impact is, for Q3 and Q4 it’s about a penny in total between the two quarters. For next year, certainly as we ramp that DC up in the first half of the year, start bringing product in and then start shipping to stores as you can appreciate, it will have a drag on gross margin. As we get to the back half of the year, and we get the productivity up in that distribution center and then start to leverage the transportation network capabilities, it will be close to our vendors, it will be closer to our larger group of our stores, we’ll start to get some of the transportation network impact. If you look at it over the course of a 12-month time period, I would expect it to be plus or minus 10 basis points neutral to gross margin over the course of the year.
Erika Maschmeyer - Robert W. Baird: Fantastic. Thanks. Best of luck.
Chuck Rubin: Thank you.
Gregg Bodnar: Thanks Erika.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Sam Panella from Raymond James.
Samantha Panella - Raymond James: Hi, thanks. And let me add my congratulations as well.
Chuck Rubin: Thanks Sam.
Samantha Panella - Raymond James: Obviously, the comp trends came in better than expected and a lot of that having to do with the traffic. Do you think as you were rolling out some of the new items that's driving the traffic, or just going back to how the business was doing when we talked last time in early June to how it came in at the end, sort of what trends you are seeing? And then also with ticket being flattish, are you seeing any sort of trade down or mix shift in your business?
Chuck Rubin: Sam, you know the trends of what we saw in the quarter was that newness continues to be really important and newness is new brands, it’s new products within brands, it’s new trends, it’s new ways of merchandizing in the stores. So in my comments, I talked about the new men’s shop, which we’re very pleased with and the new fragrance shop, which we’re very pleased with, and all the new products, and the new ways we have tried to harness the different pieces of our marketing approach. So it’s difficult to pick one piece out and say that was the magic sauce, but instead I think, it’s how we collectively put these things together to present newness to our guest. So that’s what is really been the driving force behind our business and we think that will continue as we go forward. In the second part of your question was what again?
Samantha Panella - Raymond James: With respect to ticket being flattish in the quarter, are you seeing any sort of trade down or mix shift in your business relative to last year?
Chuck Rubin: No, really not. So, you know, it was up slightly, but we’re very pleased that the bulk of our comp was driven off of increased traffic. But, no, we’re not really seeing a slow down or a step down, I should say, in what she’s buying today.
Samantha Panella - Raymond James: And then sort a one-off question. I guess, any significance to the name change in your press release referring to yourselves as Ulta Beauty versus the full Ulta Cologne and Cosmetics?
Chuck Rubin: It's a subtle thing that my General Counsel finally allowed me to do. Our customer doesn’t think of us as Ulta Salon, Cosmetics & Fragrance, it’s rather a mouthful, and as we – we need to continue to increase our branding and make Ulta Beauty a stronger brand in itself, and you will see us do that in a variety of touch points and Ulta Fragrance, Cosmetics, & Salon just is not a brand friendly kind of name. So Ulta Beauty is what the customer sees in the front of our store, and it should be what they see in all of our touch points including our financial releases.
Samantha Panella - Raymond James: Great. Thanks guys and good luck.
Chuck Rubin: Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Alex Fuhrman from Piper Jaffray.
Alex Fuhrman - Piper Jaffray: Great. Thanks guys. I was just wondering if you could give us an update on what percentage of the current store base now is in your level seven prototype and then maybe how can we think about remodels next year? I know you talked about 15% to 20% square footage growth, but how many remodels for that newest prototype could we see next year? And then given that I mean you have come out with a lot of new innovative prototypes over the years. Should we be thinking about a type eight prototype anytime soon?
Chuck Rubin: You know, Alex, we’ve got just under 80 stores that are below the level six, level seven prototype. So think of that as the current sort of modern store design. Certainly differences between six and sevens, but they are much more subtle in the boutique presentation. As far as remodels go, we finished 17 this year as we stated in our prepared remarks. We are focused on continuing to move as fast as possible towards one store prototype and getting it – the rest of the stores to that current sort of level seven design. So, we do plan to slightly accelerate, the plan is yet to be finalized, our remodel program going into next year as we accelerated it from 2010 to 2011.
Alex Fuhrman - Piper Jaffray: Great. That is helpful, thanks. And then just real quick, I think, you alluded to it in response to Aaron's [ph] question about the loyalty program earlier, but how many of your stores are currently as of this moment in time on the new points-based program as opposed to the older rewards certificate program?
Chuck Rubin: The points-based program is in about 20% of the chain.
Alex Fuhrman - Piper Jaffray: Great. Thanks guys. Good luck.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Evren Kopelman from Wells Fargo.
Evren Kopelman - Wells Fargo Securities: Thanks. Good afternoon guys.
Chuck Rubin: Hi, Evren.
Gregg Bodnar: Hi, Evren.
Evren Kopelman - Wells Fargo Securities: Can you tell us about the merchandise margin improvements a little bit more, what drove it in terms of maybe how much (inaudible) any part of it or lower promotions year-over-year? And also when you think about (inaudible) and retained by your 15% operating margin goals, you said, we're going to get there half through gross margin, half through SG&A, but the recent strong performance in gross margin, does that change that at all?
Gregg Bodnar: The merchandise margin improvement continues to be driven by the factors we've talked about in the past. Certainly, there's a slight mix benefit. As we continue to manage the inventory, it continues to be cleaner, albeit there's not a lot of clearance in our inventory. It still continues to be a slight opportunity for our merchants to turn that inventory faster and get better sell through, and that also is a driver in terms of selling through better on promotional inventory too. So, better realized margins in all those cases drive our overall merchandise margin, and as we just continue to leverage our overall growth. So, those are the sort of three or four drivers in merchandise margin. As it relates to our long-term operating goal, I did mention that we expect we'll achieve a 10% operating margin this year. We've stated in the past. You may remember, last quarter, we moved that goal up that we would get to a solid double-digit operating margin in the 2012, 2013 time period. So, we're well on our way towards that. As you look forward beyond that, towards that mid-teen operating margin, that sort of 15% mid-teen operating margin goal, we do continue to expect that there'll be a relatively equal contribution between gross profit and SG&A, slightly more coming from SG&A just from the natural leverage that’s going to come from our business as we accelerate our store program. And certainly, we've talked about in the past, each one of those area is going from 10% to 15%. There are specific strategies that we have accomplished multiple phases of and have delivered the improvement we have seen over the last couple of years and we have multiple phases to go, and that’s why it gives us confidence that we can get to that mid-teen operating margin.
Operator: Thank you. (Operator instructions) Our next question comes from Jason Gere from RBC Capital Markets.
Jason Gere - RBC Capital Markets: Good afternoon.
Chuck Rubin: Hi, Jason.
Gregg Bodnar: Hi, Jason.
Jason Gere - RBC Capital Markets: Just I guess following up on the SG&A question, obviously, I understand the natural leverage. You talked about some of the prudent cost savings that you were seeing, and just with the magnitude of the SG&A leverage that we saw in this quarter, can you talk about some of the – I don’t know if these are corporate-wide programs that you have in place or initiatives, but how much of this, some of the overhead reductions can you take out over the next few years as you aim towards that 15% operating margin? How much will come from the overhead as opposed to kind of the SG&A leverage that comes through?
Chuck Rubin: You know, we've talked about that there is multiple programs that are going to drive gross profit expansion and SG&A. Certainly we have a very flexible store model. We continue as those stores drive their productivity to leverage the four wall operating costs within those stores. So, it’s not cost reductions. It’s a very disciplined approach to how we ramp stores up as they grow through their maturity curve. So that’s sort of point number one. We’ve always demonstrated that point in the past that we’ve always made the point real clear that those long-term goals are built off of 3% to 5% comp, and we start to leverage SG&A at a low single-digit comp, okay. That’s in the four walls of the store, that's in our corporate. It’s just part of that very disciplined approach that we take to managing our business. We get leverage off of advertising, because as we fill in markets, that drives advertising leverage and it also drives G&A leverage, and it also drives four wall store leverage as well. So, they are very specific programs, like we've talked about in the past, Jason. It’s a disciplined approach to managing the business. Those further technology tools that we have put in, in the past that we’re leveraging, and further technology tools that we'll put in the future, like more detailed labor scheduling, more detailed time and attendance tracking, more detailed task management. That answer your question, Jason?
Jason Gere - RBC Capital Markets: No, it does. And then, just a follow-up on an earlier question, and I think there was a part of the question that I’m not sure if I heard the answer, and that might have been done on purpose, but when you talked about Lancome test and maybe how you think about with some of the other prestige players out there, I know you’ve done some tests with Estee Lauder, I’m just wondering if you can kind of maybe refresh our memory, how some of those efforts are going. Can you really – how that the dialog is going with them, and now that they see Lancome testing through, are you more optimistic that you can convince Estee Lauder that Ulta is the shop, the place for high-end prestige in kind of ensuing that relationship?
Chuck Rubin: Jason, I did omit the comment purposely earlier. Our focus is convincing our guest that Ulta is the place for her to shop and putting a portfolio of brands together that we think are appropriate for her. At some point, I hope that we can add additional brands that we don’t carry today. It could be some that you just mentioned, it could be others as well. There’s other brands out there that certainly we would like to add to our portfolio. Right now, we are focused on the offering that we put forth. Clearly, our results suggest that we’re doing a good job of putting that offering together. In the addition, in those 29 stores of Lancome, we’re really thrilled about, but again, I would remind everybody that we have a very healthy business without these other iconic brands, and it will be a healthy business over the long-term as well. So, we continue to pursue lots of newness, both brands as well as products as well as services. So, that’s the foundation of our success since I’ve been here, and that will be, I believe, the foundation as we go forward.
Jason Gere - RBC Capital Markets: Great, and congratulations on great numbers.
Chuck Rubin: Thanks Jason.
Operator: Thank you. At this time, we have no further questions. I’d like to turn the call back over to Chuck Rubin for closing comments.
Chuck Rubin: Okay, let me thank everybody for joining us on this call and we look forward to speaking with you again when we report third quarter results in early December.
Operator: Thank you. This does conclude today’s teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.

Operator: Welcome to the Ulta Salon Cosmetics & Fragrance third quarter fiscal 2009 results conference call. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host Allison Malkin of ICR. Thank you. Ms. Malkin you may begin. 
Allison Malkin:  Thank you. Good afternoon. Before we get started I would like to remind you of the company’s Safe Harbor language which I am sure you are all familiar with.  The statements that are contained in this conference call which are not historical facts may be deemed to constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual future results may differ materially from those projected in such statements due to a number of risks and uncertainties all of which are described in the company’s filings with the SEC.  We will make references during this call to the metric free cash flow, a non-GAAP financial measure. Free cash flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property and equipment. A reconciliation of free cash flow to its US GAAP equivalent has been provided in exhibit five of our earnings release which is available on our website and has also been filed with the SEC on Form 8K.   Now, I would like to turn the call over to Ulta’s President and CEO, Lyn Kirby. 
Lyn Kirby :  Thanks Allison. Thank you for joining us to discuss our third quarter fiscal 2009 results. On the call with me today is our Chief Financial Officer Gregg Bodnar. Following my opening remarks, Gregg will review our third quarter financial results and fourth quarter outlook. Then, I will provide some closing comments and turn the turn over to the operator so that we can answer the questions that you have for us today. We are pleased to deliver better than expected third quarter sales, earnings and free cash flow, building upon our positive momentum from the first half of the year. We attribute our strong third quarter performance to the continued successful execution of our core marketing and merchandising strategies and better than expected performance of our expense management and working capital reduction initiatives.  For the third quarter net sales increased 11.5% to $284 million. Comp store sales increased 1.5% exceeding our guidance and following a 2% increase last year, so on a two-year basis comp store sales are up 3.5%. Gross profit margin increased 70 basis points to 31.9% which included a 40 basis point increase in merchandise and marketing margins. We also exceeded our guidance with earnings per diluted share increasing to $0.14 as compared to $0.09 last year.  As we have previously communicated, we take a fresh look at each quarter and create a marketing strategy that is right for the environment. The rapid deterioration of the economic and consumer environment in third and fourth quarter last year caused us to react with additional marketing strategies with very little lead time. As this year has progressed we have become more experienced operating in and have been able to increasingly plan for this challenging economic environment which is demonstrated in our comp performance.  The marketing and merchandising calendar created for third quarter 2009 delivered a 1.3% increase in comp store traffic which follows a 6% increase in comp traffic in the third quarter 2008 and a 0.2% increase in average ticket which is the first positive growth in average ticket we have reported since third quarter last year. Importantly, this performance was delivered while increasing merchandising margins by 40 basis points and decreasing our marketing expense by 50 basis points versus last year. The improved third quarter marketing rate was achieved through efficiencies, not through a reduction in marketing events.  The merchandising and marketing programs in the third quarter included a very successful fragrance event early in the quarter that continued to drive momentum in the category. The strength of the fragrance event helped deliver positive fragrance category comp for the quarter which is a great result when compared to the rest of the industry. Our positive performance in the fragrance category is encouraging as fragrance is a key driver of holiday gift purchases.  We also experienced a significant improvement in our styling tools category. As you know, styling tools are a somewhat discretionary purchase and have been more affected by the tough economy. While comp trends continue to trail the prior year, the improvement we experienced during the quarter is encouraging for Holiday as styling tools are another example of a key gift giving category.  We optimized major new brand and new product introductions. We continue to be pleased with the early performance of Benefit Cosmetics and Philosophy Bath and Fragrance brand. The quarter also included our launch of Bare Escentuals new matte foundation and our first ever Bare gift-with-purchase offer developed exclusively with Ulta. Both of these new Bare Escentuals offers performed very well for us. The improved performance in fragrance and styling tools and the continued growth of Prestige [cart] and skin were key drivers of our average ticket growth during the quarter.  We continue to utilize private label to drive customer count at affordable margins by offering compelling value propositions to our customers such as our private label blockbuster, a $200 value for $19.99 and our Ulta Cosmetics 15-piece free gift with purchase, a $72 value. In addition, during the quarter we expanded our private label offering across bath, skin and cosmetics, more than doubling the new line extension versus third quarter last year.  The quarter included the successful launch of our first ever social marketing campaign. Our Windows of Love event supported a great cause, raising $600,000 to support the Breast Cancer Research Foundation founded by Evelyn Lauder while assisting us to create a powerful and long lasting emotional connection with our customer. This was demonstrated through dialogue with our customers both online through social websites as well as in our own stores. Looking ahead we plan to hold this event next year as an effective way to connect emotionally with our customers and to support an important cause.  As we saw in the second quarter the improvement in our comp store performance was driven entirely by our retail business. In Salon, the new keratin treatment service and Runway Your Way strategy that we introduced in the third quarter are bringing new customers into our salons which is good news. However, it has not been enough to offset the impact of the decrease we are continuing to experience in overall Salon customer visits due to the challenging economy.  As a result, the Salon business remained a negative comp for the quarter. As a reminder, the Salon is a service business and we have the ability to flex the expense structure with the business trends.  On the web we continue to post significant double digit increases in the third quarter and we expect this trend to continue for holiday. We continue to expand our assortment at Ulta.com and improve the site shopping experience with increased functionality including customer reviews and ratings online and an improved checkout process which were introduced in the third quarter.  Finally, in the third quarter we were pleased with the performance of new stores which continued to perform to our new store model. During the quarter we opened 12 new stores ending the period with 345 locations. In November we completed our store program. For the fiscal 2009 year we opened 37 new stores and expanded square footage by 11% over fiscal 2008.  With our experience this year navigating this economy and having more time to plan for challenging economic environments we have developed an exciting merchandising and marketing program to drive our performance for the fourth quarter. We have planned for a very competitive and highly promotional environment but believe we have impactful events and several new and exciting set of strategies for Ulta in the key weeks leading up to holiday.  For marketing, we plan to utilize TV for the first time. Our television advertising will cover 150 stores representing more than 40% of our overall store base during the key days leading up to Christmas. With ads that focus on product and value to drive store traffic and transactions from both new and existing customers. We also plan to air commercials on Hispanic radio in our top Hispanic trade areas and we have planned a new online marketing event for the Countdown to Christmas theme that we are excited about and believe will create some nice buzz in the marketplace.  Most importantly we will continue to execute the successful marketing and merchandising strategies that have been delivering results for us through the third quarter. We have planned high impact events and compelling value propositions throughout the season on some of our best brands including Bare Escentuals, OPI, Chi and Sebastian. For example, through strategic buying we are able to offer an exclusive for Ultra Chi Flat Iron at our lowest price ever at $79.95. This was offered on the front cover of this week’s marketing and our early consumer response has been great.  In addition we will be offering exciting exclusives to Ulta such as the launch of a new line of Ed Hardy styling tools and accessories, Bare Escentuals Jewel collection, a Smashbox blockbuster and OPI holiday colors. We will also be advertising the new brands we introduced in 2009 including Benefit Cosmetics, Philosophy Bath and Fragrance, Cosmedicine, CARGO, Phyto and Korres skin care. Of course we have new fragrances such as Couture Couture by Juicy and Hearts and Daggers by Ed Hardy.  We expect to continue the positive momentum in fragrance that we saw in third quarter which is important as fragrance is a key gift giving category during holiday. As we have done historically we have planned two major fragrance gift with purchase events in the fourth quarter including our very successful Annual Bathrobe program. As we did in the third quarter we expect to maintain comparable marketing impressions with cost efficiencies allowing us to reduce marketing spend as a percent of sales as compared to prior year.  Finally, as in the third quarter we also expect to improve our merchandising margin. Last year as you may recall compared to the marketplace we made a modest 90 basis point margin investment in response to the economic environment. With more time to plan this year we expect to recover a meaningful portion of that margin investment.  In summary, we expect to be able to compete effectively in what we believe will be an aggressive promotional environment and we expect our efforts to lead to a solid fourth quarter performance at Ulta which is reflected in our guidance. While we have some flexibility with our marketing programs, if the environment becomes as deeply promotional in the key weeks leading up to Christmas as it did last year we will judiciously balance the growth on the top and bottom line of the business. As importantly, if there is more positive consumer spending than expected we have developed strategies with our suppliers to allow us to adjust our inventory on key gift giving items as well as on basic stock.  Since our last call we have continued to build our 2010 new store pipeline and expect to increase our square footage growth next year. We remain confident in our 1000 store opportunity long-term.  Now I would like to turn the call over to Gregg to review our financials in more detail. 
Gregg Bodnar :  Thanks Lyn. Our third quarter results were driven by better than expected sales and margin performance due to the continued innovation and successful execution of our marketing and merchandising strategies combined with our focus on expense management and cash flow initiatives.  Despite the ongoing challenging economic environment we delivered another quarter of sequential improvement in retail sales performance. This combined with our prudent expense management has enabled us to exceed our third quarter targets resulting in sales and earnings above our guidance range.  Now beginning with the review of the income statement. Net sales increased 11.5% to $284 million from $254.8 million in the third quarter last year. Sales growth was driven by the addition of 41 new stores since the third quarter last year and a 1.5% increase in comp store sales. This follows an increase of 2% last year resulting in a two-year comp store sales gain of 3.5%. Comp store sales growth was driven by a 1.3% increase in traffic and a 0.2% increase in average ticket.  During the quarter we opened 12 new stores ending the third quarter with 345 stores and expanding square footage by 14% from last year’s third quarter. We continue to be pleased with the performance of our 2009 class of new stores.  Gross profit dollars in the third quarter increased 13.9% to $90.5 million from $79.5 million last year. Gross profit margin was 31.9%, an increase of 70 basis points over last year. Gross margin expansion was driven by a 40 basis point improvement in merchandise margins primarily driven by our ability to plan the third quarter marketing and merchandising strategy to this challenging economic environment rather than being in more of a reactive mode as the economy significantly deteriorated in the third quarter of last year.  Supply chain operational efficiencies provided a 60 basis point improvement for the quarter. These increases in gross margin were offset by a 20 basis point de-leverage in fixed store costs. The de-leverage from fixed store costs is decreased versus previous quarters due to stronger sales and comparatively lower square footage growth.  SG&A expenses were $73.7 million or 25.9% of net sales compared to $65.2 million last year. The 30 basis point de-leverage in SG&A compared to the prior year was due to 170 basis point increase in incentive compensation expense which was largely, but not completely, offset by 50 basis points leverage in marketing, 40 basis points in store operating expenses and 50 basis points in G&A before the impact of incentive compensation expense. We remain on track to achieve annual permanent cost savings of approximately $18 million this year.  Pre-opening expenses totaled $2.2 million in the third quarter which compares to $4.7 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2008. The decrease in pre-opening expense was due to the planned reduction in our 2009 new store program. The reduced pre-opening expense was also slightly better than our expectations driven by better leverage in our new store advertising costs and lower labor costs. Better than expected sales growth and margin expansion along with our planned lower store opening program led to a 52.9% increase in operating income to $14.7 million or 5.2% of net sales from $9.6 million last year.  Interest expense decreased to $0.4 million from $1.1 million last year driven by the lower borrowings. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 40.6% compared to 40.9% in the prior-year period. Net income for the quarter increased 68.6% to $8.5 million or $0.14 per diluted share from $5 million or $0.09 per diluted share last year.  Now turning to the balance sheet and cash flow results. Merchandise inventories at the end of the quarter were $274 million compared to $268.9 million at the end of the third quarter last year reflecting an increase of $5.1 million due to the addition of 41 new stores versus a year ago and the benefit from our inventory management initiatives. As a result of these initiatives, we have achieved an average inventory per store reduction of 10.2% from the prior-year quarter. Just as a reminder, these initiatives are primarily leveraging our supply chain inventory and have no impact on our store in-stock position or consumer experience.  We remain comfortable with both the level and composition of our inventories headed into the fourth quarter and believe we are well positioned for the holiday shopping season.  Regarding debt, during the quarter we were able to pay down $26.3 million on our credit facility balance. This was driven by our focus on aggressively managing working capital levels, specifically on inventory receivables and lower capital expenditures on planned fewer new stores. Outstanding borrowings as of October 31, 2009 were $39.2 million and our debt to equity ratio was a very modest 14%. As of quarter end we had $160.8 million of availability on our credit facility which provides a credit capacity of up to $200 million.  We achieved free cash flow of $25.4 million for the quarter and $65.5 million for the first nine months of fiscal 2009. Typically we would expect to increase our borrowings under the credit facility during the third quarter as we fund our seasonal inventory build in advance of the holiday period. This year, however, we intentionally float inventory slightly later in the quarter and as a result the payment of some of these goods flowed into the fourth quarter which improved our free cash flow position for the third quarter and optimized our supply chain network.  Based on the progress of our cash flow initiatives we now expect to generate approximately $75 million of free cash flow in 2009 which exceeds our previous target of $50 million.  Capital expenditures for the quarter were $19.6 million and depreciation and amortization for the quarter was $15.4 million. Regarding our outlook we are pleased to see continuing improvement in our comp store sales trends compared with the second quarter which were driven entirely by our retail business. However, we expect the macro environment to remain challenging and consumers to spend cautiously for the remainder of the year.  Before I discuss our fourth quarter guidance, as a reminder I will quickly highlight our performance during last year’s fourth quarter. During the 2008 holiday period we were competing for gift giving share in one of the most extraordinarily promotional environments anyone has seen. We chose to maintain a balance between driving sales and earnings and delivered earnings per share of $0.21 which represented a 9% decrease from the prior-year period on a 5.5% comp decrease. While we were not happy with these results we did not see the deep negative comps and dramatic declines in merchandise margin and operating profits that most of the rest of the industry experienced.  For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 we currently estimate net sales in a range of $362-376 million. This assumes comparable store sales at a range of a decrease of 3% to an increase of 1% compared to a decrease of 5.5% in the fourth quarter of last year. As we have previously noted, we have seen an improvement in our sales and traffic trends in the third quarter driven by the impact of our strategic marketing and merchandising initiatives which is reflected in our guidance range. Consistent with our approach in prior quarters, the wider comp sales range continues to reflect the uncertainty regarding any potential, unexpected impact to current consumer trends as well as the uncertainty regarding the ultimate level of gift giving expenditures this holiday season.  Income per diluted share for the fourth quarter fiscal 2009 is estimated to be in a range of $0.22 to $0.26. This compares to income per diluted share of $0.21 for the fourth quarter of last year. The midpoint of our EPS guidance range reflects gross profit margin expansion of approximately 50 basis points and de-leverage in SG&A of approximately 50 basis points. This de-leverage is driven by 80 basis points increase in incentive compensation versus the fourth quarter last year.  With regard to new stores, as Lyn mentioned we have now completed our 2009 new store program with the opening of our final three stores in the early fourth quarter. The final count was 37 new stores which included two additional stores compared to our previous guidance. The two additional stores will have a minimal impact on 2009 sales. We will also be closing two stores after the holiday as part of our normal real estate upgrade process.  Since our last call we have continued to build our 2010 new store pipeline and expect to increase our rate of square footage growth next year. We remain confident in our ability to attain our 1,000 store long-term potential.  With respect to CapEx we expect capital expenditures to be approximately $71 million for the year.  In closing, we continue to believe that the consumer spending environment will remain difficult. We have and will continue to take the necessary actions to control what we can control. We will continue to manage the business driving our earnings and generating free cash flow and reinforcing our already strong balance sheet and liquidity position.  Now I would like to turn the call back over to Lyn. 
Lyn Kirby :  Thanks Gregg. We do not know the ultimate level of promotional activity that will occur in the marketplace or the ultimate level of consumer spending this holiday season. Accordingly, we have provided a wider guidance range for the fourth quarter. We believe we have created a compelling marketing and merchandising program that consumers will find exciting this holiday season. We are confident we have identified the right strategies to continue our positive performance during a challenging fourth quarter environment.  With that I would like to turn the call back over to the operator and we can begin our question and answer portion of the call. 
 :
Operator:  (Operator Instructions) The first question comes from the line of Brian Tunick – JP Morgan. 
Brian Tunick – JP Morgan: The TV obviously seems pretty impactful here. We are curious is it now that you are comfortable with where the size of the chain is, or the advertising rate came down? Maybe just talk about why you have decided now to do TV and what kind of message we will be seeing in a couple of weeks. Will it be brand specific or price driven? Then maybe if you want to talk a little bit more about the private label penetration that helped the gross margin and where we think private label can grow next year. 
Lyn Kirby :  On the TV, it is actually both of the reasons you spoke to. We are a big enough chain that in key regions around the United States it actually is financially viable for us to spend money. It is why it is not 100% of the chain at this point in time but in those areas where it makes the most sense for us. It is not so much the ad rates are great at all at the moment, we are finding it actually a very competitive environment to purchase TV in and hence the reason we are keeping it very surgical so that we can get the optimal return on it.  On the message itself, the message is definitely brand specific and product specific. It is exciting value but offered in a very brand enhancing manner and environment. We hope that we will be able to attract certainly an additional visit from existing customers but also reach a customer base that we can’t necessarily reach with our existing marketing alone. 
Gregg Bodnar :  On private label penetration it was up slightly in the quarter. It was not the single biggest driver of the improvement in gross margin compared to last year. It still represents about 5% of our business on an annual basis. We do believe there continues to be longer term potential there and we will describe those initiatives more carefully as we head into giving guidance for 2010 in March. 
Lyn Kirby :  A little more broadly on the merchandising margin expansion we did experience, certainly a little bit was the private label as Gregg spoke to but it was also a mix shift. It was part of the strategy for the quarter that we went after in terms of mix shift. We also have flat coupon redemption versus prior year. We are finally anniversarying some of that coupon redemption that was impacting some of the margin opportunity. So there is a couple of other factors in the margin improvement. 
Brian Tunick – JP Morgan: If we are assuming 13% square footage growth next year. Is that what you mean by an acceleration? 
Lyn Kirby :  We are not ready to comment on our 2010 program at this point in time. What we can tell you to give you some comfort is that we do have 40 stores that have been approved, 40 sites for next year at this point in time. Stay tuned on the final guidance when we come back at the beginning of next year. 
Operator:  The next question comes from the line of Lizabeth Dunn – Thomas Weisel Partners. 
Lizabeth Dunn – Thomas Weisel Partners: So were Salon and styling tools the only segments that comped negatively? And do you have, I am sorry if I missed it, specific marketing events targeted towards fragrance to drive that business during the holiday? 
Lyn Kirby :  As you know, we really don’t comment on any individual category performance other than if we think there is a shift in the trend that is important for you to understand. Hence the commentary on the Salon styling tools and the fragrance category particularly as that is a shift in the trend we have been seeing in the earlier quarters this year. Beyond that we can’t for competitive reasons we speak to give you any more color than that. In terms of the fragrance category we do historically do two major fragrance events in the fourth quarter. We intend to anniversary both of those. We have already anniversaried the first one from the quarter and we break the second one in the not too distant future which is the robe that we do in the holiday season. Of course we do have exciting newness. It is not just our marketing events but we have some exciting newness in the fragrance category as well for the holiday season. 
Lizabeth Dunn – Thomas Weisel Partners: Can you talk about the sensitivity next year to an improvement in sales trends in the SG&A line like if we get into an environment where you are consistently comping positively and growth is accelerating a little bit? What sort of SG&A growth should we be thinking about? If you can’t provide that specifically what sort of categories will you be leveraging and where might you need a little bit more investment? 
Gregg Bodnar :  Let me describe the way I normally do and I think this will help you. As we look into next year and we are developing and finalizing our plans, I would expect very, very low single digit comp that we would be able to start to leverage SG&A. We have made a lot of progress this year in permanently altering the structure of the business so none of that is going to come back into next year. We do as we have the last couple of years have some specific strategic projects in the technology area as we continue to improve our technology platform and more importantly looking forward continue to add business value in that particular area.  So low single digit, very, very low single digit to start to leverage. There is nothing extraordinary if you will in terms of one-time meaningful investment next year. It truly is just a continuation of continuing to develop our technology platform like we have been for the last couple of years. 
Operator:  The next question comes from the line of Daniel Hofkin – William Blair & Co.
Daniel Hofkin – William Blair & Co.: Looking at obviously your practice this year has been to sort of look at the current comp trend and allow for the possibility of unforeseen events going forward. Thinking about comparing to last year I seem to recall it was principally kind of leading up to Christmas where the environment had gotten especially challenging. Just wondering if you might be able to provide some general commentary given some of the other retail results we saw out this morning what November might have looked like or just some sense for what things at least quarter to date how that is progressing, if there is anything you can share regarding that. 
Gregg Bodnar :  As we kind of have done in our practice of giving interim monthly results last quarter what I would tell you is we were down 5.5% last year and we have continued to say and believe to be the case this was more relevant in this consumer environment as we cycle those results from last year is our current trends. So coming out of the third quarter with a plus 1.5% comp and understanding the trends we were running at the time leading up to this call we have set a comp guidance range of about the results we achieved in the third quarter. Then the wider guidance range is exactly as we have stated. Achieved in the third quarter and then the wider guidance range is exactly as you have stated and is exactly as we have stated in the past. At the end of the day we don’t know if there is another consumer event that might be a distraction for them or ultimately what their level of gift giving purchases are going to be for the quarter. Thus the wider comp guidance range. 
Daniel Hofkin – William Blair & Co.: So just to paraphrase that, it is not anything you have experienced or seen thus far. It is just kind of allowing for either a continuation or the possibility of something unforeseen going forward as you have been doing? 
Gregg Bodnar :  Yes, the wider comp guidance range is consistent with our prior practice. 
Daniel Hofkin – William Blair & Co.: Secondly, within the gross margin any other color you may be able to provide being what you and Lyn discussed within the merchandise margin and the shift in the sales mix? 
Gregg Bodnar :  If you take the components of the third quarter margin performance we were up about 70 basis points. About 40 basis points driven by pure merchandise margin. We talked about the mix and some of the strategic buys that were opportunities we were able to plan in advance unlike last year’s third quarter. Fixed store expenses represented about 20 basis points of de-leverage which has been coming down quarter-to-quarter because we are getting into the slower square footage growth for the 12 months behind us. Then the rest of the improvement to get to the 70 basis points was really out of the supply chain and the continuation of the initiatives that have been executed thus far this year. 
Daniel Hofkin – William Blair & Co.: Just regarding mix, so I am clear on that, that is separate from the strategic buys? 
Gregg Bodnar :  There were two elements that drove the 40 basis point improvement in merchandising gross margins. One was the planned strategy that drove sales into higher mix categories. Private label was one that we mentioned. The other was the opportunity to plan for some of the strategic buys to improve our margin compared to last year. 
Operator:  The next question comes from the line of Erika Maschmeyer – Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. 
Erika Maschmeyer – Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Could you talk a bit about your declines in inventory per store? I know those have come through your supply chain. How long do you expect these declines to last and what inning are we in these improvements and how do you think about them throughout the year in 2010? 
Gregg Bodnar :  We are planning for some further opportunities primarily still focused in the supply chain as we head into next year. It won’t be of the same order of magnitude so as we indicated we will plan in this year down on a per store basis at about 9%. Then we will have similar opportunity we will plan for next year, just not for the same order of magnitude. 
Erika Maschmeyer – Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Could you talk a little bit longer term about your potential timing for the 1,000 store target? Do you anticipate getting back to 20-25% unit growth after 2010 when the environment normalizes a little bit or I guess can you talk about your decision making process here? 
Lyn Kirby :  The decision making process is basically the same as what we have always used which is quality first, not number of stores. It will really unfold as the environment unfolds and the opportunities. We are in the position where we can be opportunistic. If there are multiple sites that become available as some retailers might perhaps fail that is always opportunistic for us. But we will continue with the strategy of driving our growth in existing centers. If new center development is still slow in a slow economic environment we still have considerable opportunity in existing centers as demonstrated with the program this year and with the pipeline we have begun to build for 2010.  So it really is not as if there is a rate that we are targeting year-to-year at this point. It is more that it will unfold. Having said that, we do expect some increase in rate for next year’s program versus the levels we delivered this year. 
Erika Maschmeyer – Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Can you give any color on your comp trend during the third quarter? 
Gregg Bodnar :  We don’t report comps on a monthly basis and have not disclosed our inter-quarter trends in the past. 
Operator:  The next question comes from the line of Randy Konik – Jefferies & Co. 
Randy Konik – Jefferies & Co. : Can you give us some color on what you think the promotional environment looks like out there thus far in the holiday season? Are you seeing a rational pricing environment thus far? Then I guess a question for Gregg. You have done a very good job of generating free cash flow. If we think longer term here is there some sort of sustainable minimum level of free cash flow that you think the business can now generate over the long-term now? 
Lyn Kirby :  Let me answer your first question. Relative to the promotional environment so far it is exactly what we have been expecting. We have seen great literally today and earlier this week some discounting in the beauty category from some other retailers. So that is very much what we had expected and planned for. No surprise there. As it relates to the broader retail environment and the broader department store environment again so far very much what we have expected. We are certainly planning for more promotional activity than what we have seen up to this point in time in the season and we are well prepared for what we think we will see. 
Gregg Bodnar :  As it relates to long-term free cash flow keep in mind the biggest driver of that is going to be the rate of increase in our store program, as we look forward with some slight increase next year we do expect with the continuation of some of the initiatives, some of which I referred to earlier on the working capital side, we will be in a good positive to generate free cash flow again next year. Then with an assumed sort of gradual increase back to our normal rate of square footage expansion that we have historically performed at I would expect that free cash flow generation will be more of a reality in the years following 2010.  But the biggest driver of that is going to be the change in the rate of square footage growth and the offsetting benefit to that which is the fact that our store investment where it has historically been $1.6 million to build a new store with all of the progress we have made so far in the last 18 months we are probably closer to $1.1 million. 
Randy Konik – Jefferies & Co. : On the working capital line items you have gotten some benefit from payables and inventory, etc. Do you see that becoming a use of cash next year? Any comment there? 
Gregg Bodnar :  I think with the rate of expansion of square footage growth along with some of the other initiatives we will be executing next year I don’t expect the increase in store count to be a big drag on free cash flow. 
Operator:  The next question comes from the line of Samantha Panella – Raymond James. 
Samantha Panella – Raymond James: With respect to the 0.2% increase in average ticket, can you give us some color on that and sort of what you are seeing spending habits with your customer relative to what you see in [ave trans]?
Lyn Kirby :  Again, not too much color on anything too specific but in terms of what we are seeing it is certainly average selling price more than units in the third quarter and it is predominately across the categories we spoke to; the fragrance category and Prestige cosmetics and color continue to be strong performers for us. So that is versus prior year and versus the trend that we have seen in the last couple of quarters the styling tools category is helping lift the average ticket versus the prior couple of quarters as well. 
Samantha Panella – Raymond James: Gregg, with respect to the TV ads how is that impacting SG&A in the quarter? 
Gregg Bodnar :  What we have effectively done is taken some of the efficiencies we would have otherwise realized in the fourth quarter specifically in the advertising line and reinvested in the TV campaign. We are not going to disclose the dollar amount of it because it would give some indication in terms of the size of the program but it is a very modest impact in the fourth quarter. 
Operator:  The next question comes from the line of [Evron Habbelman – Wells Fargo Securities]. 
[Evron Habbelman – Wells Fargo Securities]:  First, as you are signing new leases for next year can you update us on what you are seeing in terms of rent out there? Especially given you will be opening more in existing centers versus new centers and how that is going to look for you year-over-year? The second question, with the acceleration in the rate of square footage growth obviously we are going to think about the de-leverage of the fixed store expenses again. I know you have talked about you have lowered the cost to build a new store but are there any other initiatives to potentially lower that de-leverage such as maybe accelerating the time to get the store open and things like that? 
Gregg Bodnar :  A couple of things. Consistent with what we have said in the past, as we are building the 2010 program we are seeing a reduction in rents versus historically what we would be spending on a cost per square foot basis which typically range about 15%. It depends on the real estate. The extraordinarily high quality real estate is still closer to historical cost per square foot just because of the scarcity value. So if you go up the East Coast as an example. Mainstream real estate we are seeing about a 15% decline in cost per square foot.  As it relates to the mix between existing versus new centers we had a balance this year of about 45-50% in existing centers and the rest in new centers. As we head into next year with the slowdown in development of new centers I would expect most of the expansion, about 90% to be in existing centers. As it relates to de-leverage going forward certainly the lower cost structure from a rent standpoint is going to help that.  The lower build out cost that we were talking about, going from the $1.6 million to $1.1 million to build a new store is also going to help put some downward pressure on the overall new store costs, a big portion of which is sitting in fixed store expenses. Then as it relates to a leverage point going forward, I think the combination of all of that will take us to a point where we can start to leverage fixed store costs with a slight increase in square footage expansion next year in a low single digit comp. 
Operator:  The next question comes from the line of Jillian Caruthers – Johnson Rice & Company.  
Jillian Caruthers – Johnson Rice & Company: Another question on your fourth quarter comp guidance. If you look at your guidance on a two-year stack even at the high end, it is showing quite an acceleration from year-to-date trends. If you could talk about anything different you are seeing because I know you addressed the promotional environment that is expected and things of that nature. 
Gregg Bodnar :  It is more about, and I mentioned this to one of the other questions, it is really more about what our current trends are. The fact that consumer gift giving is down in the fourth quarter of last year, in our mind that has set a new low point or starting point for gift giving. So if we were down 5.5% last year and part of that was gift giving, I don’t expect the consumers based on all the reports that I am reading and I am sure you are reading as well, part of it increased their level of gift giving spend. That is why as it relates to the fourth quarter we believe the current trends are more relevant than the 2-year stack comp you are referring to. 
Lyn Kirby : I will remind you if we do see more optimism from consumers out there than what we are planning for. We do have some flexibility in our inventory strategy to be able to satisfy that increase in consumer spend if it does in fact occur. 
Jillian Caruthers – Johnson Rice & Company: If you could talk about Benefit, I know you have had some good response there. You mentioned about 25% of your store base has a full assortment of that product. Where do you stand now and are you still fine tuning it for the holidays? 
Lyn Kirby :  No more fine tuning. We are locked and loaded for holiday at this point. We do have about 133 stores at this point that have Benefit Boutiques. The boutiques are either the traditional boutique that you have seen as part of the store. It could be a boutique off the wall of the store so the same 200 square feet or it could be what we are calling a linear boutique which is a specially designed gondola run for Benefit. So we have that in about 133 stores and basically in the rest of the store base we have more of an [étagère] and cap presentation of a more limited selection of the line and we will be gradually transitioning into the boutique strategy over the next 18 months. 
Operator:  The next question comes from the line of Analyst for Neely Tamminga – Piper Jaffray. 
Analyst for Neely Tamminga – Piper Jaffray: I am wondering if you could talk a little bit more about your promotional cadence heading into holiday. Should we expect more couponing or are you working with your vendors in advance for more product promotion? 
Lyn Kirby :  Because we are anniversarying that heavily deteriorated economy from last fourth quarter it is not about the couponing as we saw in the third quarter. We actually did not see an increase in coupons over prior year, coupon redemption rates did not impact the margin and we are not expecting that behavior in the fourth quarter and nor are we planning to put any significant increase in coupons out in the market. What the focus for value is more focused on is where you were just a second ago which is strategic buys that we have made with our key vendors and then offering that value through to our customer base. A really good example I had mentioned is on the front cover of our newspaper insert literally this week we had a Chi flat iron out there for just a little below $80, at $79.95 and we are seeing very good consumer response. When the value is there. There is not resistance to the average ticket. 
Analyst for Neely Tamminga – Piper Jaffray: Curious if there has been any change in the Prestige and the overall category has been trending? 
Lyn Kirby :  Again, we don’t comment too specifically on it but we have in the past commented on the trade downs from Prestige to mass as there were more brands available. Not a reflection on the brand strategy but on the availability of mass brands. We are seeing some stabilization of that trend at this point in time. It is not that it is going back the other way so much as we are not seeing it continue to trade down. 
Operator:  The next question comes from the line of Henry Kerpellen – Oppenheimer & Co. 
Henry Kerpellen – Oppenheimer & Co. : In the press release you mentioned you expect the holiday season to be challenging and I was wondering if you could comment on whether you think that is going to be more or less than what you saw last year? 
Lyn Kirby :  Overall we are planning for not I will say the deeply discounted, the deeply extraordinary deep discounts of last year. We think that the marketplace has bought inventory in a different fashion by and large to what they did last year. But nonetheless, it is one of the things we cannot control and hence one of the factors for us putting a wider guidance range in there than what we have in the last couple of quarters. So it is possible. We are planning for a very aggressive promotional environment but are not necessarily believing we are going to see quite that level of extraordinary discount we saw last year. 
Henry Kerpellen – Oppenheimer & Co. : So an improvement essentially from what you saw last year but not anything dramatic essentially? 
Lyn Kirby :  An improvement from last year. If I wanted to put two bookends on it, not as aggressive as last year but deeper than 2007 is what we are planning for. 
Henry Kerpellen – Oppenheimer & Co. : Piggy backing on your comment about the guidance, I am still trying to figure out for same store sales guidance in the fourth quarter you are saying down 3 to positive 1%. You did 1.5% in the third quarter and yet you also have an easier comparison in the fourth quarter. I am just trying to figure out how you came to that same store sales guidance for the fourth quarter. 
Gregg Bodnar :  As we had mentioned we believe the current trends in this environment are more representative if you will. We finished the third quarter at a plus 1.5%. That is taking into consideration we said the top end of our guidance range was 1%. The fact that we have expectations out there for a consumer environment in a gift giving space to be flat to down slightly would suggest the comparison for the fourth quarter is less relevant and to us what is more meaningful is the current trends we are running. As it relates to the bottom end of the guidance range it is as simple as what we have described in the past. We are not sure if there is another consumer event that will be a distraction around the corner that will cause the consumer to pull back on spending. We can’t be entirely sure in this economic environment what her ultimate level of gift giving spend will be in this fourth quarter. So the easier comparisons last year I think the consumer has set a new precedent in terms of what their ultimate level of gift giving is. So it doesn’t make for necessarily an easier comparison and that’s why the current trends are more relevant. 
Henry Kerpellen – Oppenheimer & Co. : The traffic trends while they were positive in the third quarter there was a slight deceleration from what you saw in the second quarter. I was just wondering if there was any commentary you could provide around that? 
Lyn Kirby :  The commentary is actually strategy for the quarter. As we begin to develop our marketing and merchandising strategy for the quarter we take a look at the prior year. In the third quarter of the prior year we had a 6% increase in count and we had a decrease in average ticket. So as we strategize the third quarter this year the biggest opportunity we believe in average ticket and not to expand aggressively on the customer count. We have been very aggressive in going after the customer count third quarter of last year not just in reaction to the economic environment and the deterioration but we had planned for investment in count anticipating a lot of hesitancy during that pre-election time period. So with that resource investment in the baseline to count we put a modest amount to drive count in the third quarter of this year and we aggressively drove against the opportunity to drive average ticket and hence some of the focus on the categories that I have been speaking to on the call that are clearly higher ticket categories; fragrance, the styling tools category and the continued focus we have on Prestige color and skin.   
Operator:  The next question comes from the line of Anthony Lebiedzinski – Sidoti & Company. 
Anthony Lebiedzinski – Sidoti & Company: I just wanted to follow-up on the previous question with the free cash flow. It sounds like you expect the positive free cash flow next year but perhaps not to the same level you are seeing this year? 
Gregg Bodnar :  It definitely will not be at the same level we experienced this year. It will ultimately depend mostly on the rate of expansion of our new store program. 
Anthony Lebiedzinski – Sidoti & Company: You mentioned the CapEx on average is about $1.1 million versus $1.6 million before? Is that correct? 
Gregg Bodnar :  No, the total new store investment. Historically about 18 months we would spend about $1.6 million between CapEx, inventory and pre-opening costs to open a new store. At this point in time based upon all the initiatives we are now pushing the $1.1 million which helps obviously as we start to expand square footage again helps to buffer some of the cash flow impact. 
Anthony Lebiedzinski – Sidoti & Company: So what has driven the half million decrease? 
Gregg Bodnar :  There has been numerous things. One, we have reduced the cost per square foot to build new stores and we have strategically done that over the last 18 months with no impact to the consumer experience. We also, have you have heard us talk about, taken about 10% of the inventory cost to build a new store or fill a new store and our pre-opening costs have progressively come down over time. 
Operator:  There appear to be no more questions in the queue at this time. I would like to turn the floor back over to management for closing comments. 
Lyn Kirby :  Thanks again for joining us today. On behalf of all of us at Ulta I would like to wish you all a very happy holiday and New Year and we look forward to speaking to you on our next call which will be in March of next year. Thanks everybody. Goodnight. 
Operator:  This concludes today’s teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.

Free cash flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property and equipment. A reconciliation of free cash flow to US GAAP equivalent has been provided in exhibit five of our earnings release which is also available on our website and has been filed with the SEC on Form 8K.  Now, I’d like to turn the call over to Ulta’s President and CEO Lyn Kirby.
Lyn P. Kirby : Thank you for joining us to discuss our second quarter fiscal 2009 results. On the call with me today is our Chief Financial Officer Gregg Bodnar. Following my opening remarks, Gregg will review our second quarter financial highlight and outlook. Then, I will provide some closing comments and turn the turn over to the operator so that we can answer the questions that you have for us today. We are pleased to deliver second quarter sales and earnings that exceeded our expectations reflecting a sequential improvement in comp store sales and earnings performance as compared to the first quarter. For the second quarter net sales increased 9.8% to $273.5 million. Comp store sales declined 1.7% slightly exceeding our guidance and following a 3.7% increase last year. So, on a two year basis comp store sales are up 2%. Comp customer traffic increased 2.2% and earnings per diluted share increased to $0.10 as compared to $0.06 last year.  The economic environment stabilized somewhat in the second quarter and while our performance given the environment was good we are certainly not satisfied and we would expect to deliver strong results in a more robust economy. That said, we attribute our strength in this difficult consumer spending environment to the successful execution of the key strategies we outlined at the beginning of the year which included the development of exciting new customer propositions to entice consumers to make a trip to Ulta, the introduction of new brands and products, a reduction in expenses that will permanently impact our cost structure and cash flow management strategies including our planned reduction in stores. During the quarter we successfully reached existing and new customers and drove a 2.2% increase in comp store traffic through exciting events such as our back to school hair care leader sale, the introduction of new brands including Benefit Cosmetics, CARGO Cosmetics, [CEDO] Hair Care and Dr. Perricone skin care. Products exclusive to Ulta such as the $15 Bare Minerals discovery kit. We also increased traffic by continuing to drive our fragrance business through gift with purchases such as our spa wrap at mother’s day and our cooler at father’s day and new introductions such as Ed Hardy’s Love & Luck, DKNY’s Fresh Blossom and for men fragrances such as Only The Brave which we introduced and performed very well at father’s day. Finally, we continued to utilize our private label to offer compelling value propositions and to introduce new products such as Ulta’s Professional Nail Color and our Ulta 52 piece blockbuster with a $150 value for $17.99. As a result of these initiatives we drove a 2.2% increase in comp store traffic during the second quarter without making any incremental investments in marketing. However, as we saw in the first quarter, we experienced a great response to our marketing coupons which had a 30 basis point impact on gross profit margin versus last year. We have appropriately planned our merchandise and strategies to offset the modest margin impact from increased coupon redemption during the third quarter and we believe we will deliver an increase in merchandising margin for the third quarter. Despite passive traffic, we experienced a 3.9% decline in average ticket as compared to the second quarter last year resulting in a 1.7% decline in comp store sales. As I have said many times in the past, we have categories such as hair care and skin care that are consumable and therefore prompt repeat purchase and others such as higher priced styling tools, fragrance and salon services that are more discretionary and continue to be impacted by this economic down turn which in turn impacts average ticket. Although still negative we did experience a strengthening in our comp store sales performance versus the first quarter and this was driven entirely by our retail business. Importantly, on a comp store basis we grew market share during the quarter across each major category. We grew share in skin, fragrance, professional hair care and [inaudible]. Our market share gains of course are further enhanced with the continued expansion of our store base. In addition to our solid top line performance we made progress on our core financial strategies during the quarter.  We continued to make great progress on our cost savings initiatives. We have raised our full year target by $3 million to approximately $18 million in savings this year. We achieved a 9.8% reduction in inventory per store positioning us to decrease inventory per store by 9% at year end which is ahead of our initial targets of down 5% to 7%. And, we delivered $40 million of free cash flow for the first six months of the year driven by improved working capital management, reducing store programs and lowering store investment.  As we look ahead, we expect the economic environment remained challenging and consumers to continued spending cautiously for the remainder of this year. However, we believe that we remain well positioned as begin the second half of the year. We will continue to focus on profitable market share gains while carefully managing expenses. We will accomplish this by continuing to invest judiciously, develop top line growth with bottom line profitability, by executing our core strategies, by expanding our square footage by 11% this year and continuing to carefully manage our costs. In third quarter we will continue to drive traffic and market share in our retail business through new brand introductions including philosophy fragrance and bath which has just been opened in 246 stores, through the introduction of new products an existing brands such as Matte Mineral Foundation from Bare Essentials, through the continued launch of new fragrances such as DKNY’s Delicious Art and the new Dolce & Gabana collection of fragrances and Lola from Mac Jacobs.  We will offer 16 in store events with Urban Decay international makeup artists who will tour stores during the third quarter. We will continue through the excitement in our private label with a 15 piece gift with purchase across our comestics line and new private label bath products such as body whip for back to school. Of course, we will continue to drive exciting value propositions throughout our marketing campaign. This motivation in new and existing brands will anniversary a strong third quarter launch calendar last year. Because of the exciting merchandise and brand opportunities we will not invest in additional marketing in third quarter.  In fact, based on our ability to achieve greater efficiencies as we leverage our growth. We expect our third quarter advertising rate to be below last year’s rate even as we delivered more impressions versus last year. In addition to our traditional traffic driving events, we have a new event in the third quarter that I would like to share with you. Also, you’ve heard me to peak to four Esthetics, escape, education and entertainment. This year we added a fifth E for empowerment.  In keeping with our commitment to empower woman, we have planned and in store vent in October for breast cancer awareness month. During a third week period we will invite woman to share their stores about their battle with breast cancers and their unsung heroes who supported them. These stories will be displayed on six miles of our store front windows across our 330 plus stores. In so doing we hope to encourage those who are fighting breast cancer and all of those who support them. This campaign will be accompanied by an online campaign that we expect to great quite a buzz. During this tier period we will also be asking customers for donations to the breast cancer research foundation with appropriate gifts of thanks for their donations. We believe this event is a way to empower woman, to strengthen the emotional command and in our brand while giving to an important cause.  Within salon we have aggressively pursued new initiatives to gain market share as we expect consumers to continue to defer services in this economy. As we mentioned during our first quarter call we tested a new salon service with encouraging results which will launch in the third quarter. The new salon service is a carotene treatment which eliminates up to 95% of frizz and curl from hair. We will offer this service at a special introductory value compared to the suggested retail price of $250 a service. While consumers are cutting back on their spending, our test of this service indicates that the consumers are willing to spend for something new if it offers compelling features and value.  In addition, we are also very excited about our new marketing strategy for salons. It gives us the potential to solidify Ulta’s position as the leading authority in the salon business. The strategy is called runway your way. We have created a partnership with stylist Rodney Cutler who styles for runway shows for fashion houses such as Marc Jacobs, Mumu and Cynthia Rowley. Rodney has developed three unique haircuts for Ulta for the fall season adapted from the runway so that the styles are wearable for every woman. All Ulta stylists have been trained on these cuts which will be launched at the end of September to our customers. Our intention will be to update the collection with Rodney for each spring and fall season. Regarding our web business, we expect to continue the positive momentum at www.Ulta.com. While still a relatively small part of our business overall, second quarter sales grew at double digit rates and we expect this trend to continue through 2009. In second quarter we expanded our assortment and continued to improve the shopping experience with our increased functionality including automatic cross selling and product recommendation.  In third quarter in addition to the ongoing development about online shopping experience, we expect to improve delivery time for our customers while also reducing shipping expenses through more efficient shipping processes. Regarding our store expansion, we continue to plan to open 35 new stores in fiscal 2009 increasing square footage by 11%. In the second quarter, we are pleased with the performance of new stores. We opened 13 stores and added two new states Connecticut and Mississippi ending the quarter with 333 locations. For the third quarter, we expect to open 12 stores. As we look forward, we are seeing real estate opportunities in existing centers as new center development has slowed and continue to be opportunistic with regard to new site selection. As we said in our last call, we believe there is an opportunity to accelerate our square footage growth in 2010 depending on the availability of quality sites that meet our investment model. We remain confident in our 1,000 store opportunity long term. Now, I’d like to turn the call over to Gregg to review our financials in more detail.
Gregg R. Bodnar : Our second quarter results were driven by better than expected sales performance due to the successful execution of our marketing and new brand introduction strategies combined with our continued focus on expense management and cash flow initiatives. Improved retail sales performance as compared to the first quarter and prudent expense management together have enabled us to exceed our second quarter targets in a challenging consumer environment resulting in earnings above our guidance range.  Now, beginning with a review of the income statement, net sales increased 9.8% to $273.5 million from $249.1 million in the second quarter last year. Sales growth was driven by the addition of 50 new stores since the second quarter last year. Comp store sales decreased 1.7% which follows an increase of 3.7% last year resulting in a two year comp store sales gain of 2%. Comparable store sales included a 2.2% increase in comp store traffic offset by a 3.9% decline in average ticket.  Our customer shopping trends remain consistent with what we saw in the first quarter. She is visiting our store more frequently but spending less per visit as she cut back on more discretionary items. During the second quarter we opened 13 new stores ending the second quarter with 333 stores and expanding square footage by 18% from last year’s second quarter. We continue to be pleased with the early performance of our 2009 class of new stores. Gross profit dollars in the second quarter increased 7.3% to $78.5 million from $73.1 million last year. Gross profit margin was 28.7% a decline of 70 basis points to last year. This decline was primarily driven by 130 basis points of fixed store deleverage resulting primarily from our new store program. The fixed store deleverage is net of 30 basis points of temporary rent relief we received in a dozen stores where co-tenant vacancies triggered temporary rent reductions.  We also experienced a 30 basis point decrease in profit margin due to higher customer redemption rates for our marketing coupons which was expected and consistent with the first quarter. The decreases in gross profit margin were offset by an 80 basis point improvement in our supply chain due to cost reductions and operating efficiencies. The 70 basis point decrease in gross profit for the quarter was better than expected and better than what was reflected in our guidance. The improved performance is primarily attributed to less deleverage of fixed store cost due to stronger sales, higher efficiency and lower operating costs in our supply chain, slightly higher merchandise margins and the temporary rent relief I just mentioned. SG7A expenses were $66.3 million or 24.2% of net sales compared to $61.9 million or 24.8% of net sales last year. The 60 basis point improvement in SG&A primarily represents improved leverage in store and corporate overhead expenses as a result of our focused expense management.  We currently expect to achieve annual cost savings of approximately $18 million which as Lyn mentioned earlier represents an improvement of $3 million from our initial plan. Pre-opening expenses totaled $2 million in the quarter which compares to $4.1 million in the second quarter of 2008. The reduced new pre-opening expense was slightly ahead of our expectations and was driven by lower labor costs. Strong sales growth combined with solid SG&A leverage and our planned lower store opening program led to a 42% increase in operating income to $10.2 million or 3.7% of net sales from $7.2 million or 2.9% of net sales last year. Interest expense decreased to $.6 million from $1 million last year reflecting lower borrowings and interest rates. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 40% compared to 40.4% in the prior year. Net income for the quarter increased 55.9% to $5.8 million or $0.10 per diluted share from $3.7 million or $0.06 per diluted share last year.  Now, turning to the balance sheet and cash flow results, merchandise inventories at the end of the quarter were $209.2 million compared to $197 million at the end of the second quarter last year. Average inventory per store decreased 9.8% from the prior year quarter. The per store inventory decrease is the result of specific inventory management initiatives put in place in fiscal 2009. The $12.2 million increase in inventory was due to 50 new stores opened in the last 12 months. We remain comfortable with both the level and composition of our inventories as we enter the third quarter.  Regarding debt, during the quarter we were able to pay down roughly $35 million on our credit facility balance. This was driven by our focus on aggressively managing working capital levels, specifically in inventory and receivables and lower capital expenditures on fewer planned new stores. Outstanding borrowings as of August 1, 2009 were $65.5 million and our debt to equity ratio was a very modest two times. As of quarter end we had $120.8 million of availability on our credit facility. As a reminder, our credit facility provides borrowing capacity of up to $200 million. We achieved free cash flow of $34.5 million for the quarter and $40.1 million for the six month period. Based on our progress on the aforementioned initiatives, we now expect to generate approximately $50 million of free cash flow this year. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $17.5 million and depreciation and amortization for the quarter was $16 million.  Regarding our outlook, we are pleased to see a continuation of the signs of stabilization in our comp store sales. We have also experienced a slight improvement in our comp store sales trends quarter-to-quarter driven entirely by our retail business. Having said that, consumers remain cautious and there continues to be limited visibility in to future consumer spending trends.  For the third quarter fiscal 2009 we currently estimate net sales in the range of $270 to $278 million compared to actual third quarter net sales of $254.8 million in fiscal 2008. This assumes comparable store sales decrease 1% to 4% compared to an increase of 2% in the third quarter of last year. As previously noted we have seen a stabilization and slight improvement in our sales trends driven by the impact of our marketing strategies new brand introductions. Consistent with our approach in prior quarters the wider comp sales range continues to reflect the uncertainty regarding whatever potential unexpected impacts to current consumer trends. Income per diluted share for the third quarter of fiscal 2009 is estimated to be in the range of $0.08 to $0.11. This compares to income per diluted share of $0.09 for the third quarter of last year. Our third quarter EPS guidance at the midpoint of our range reflects a gross margin decline of approximately 20 to 30 basis points and deleverage in SG&A of approximately 70 to 80 basis points. This SG&A deleverage is driven by 100 basis point increase in bonus compensation expense versus the third quarter of 2008. With regard to our new stores, we continue to plan to open approximately 35 new stores in 2009. As we look forward we are seeing real estate opportunities in existing centers as new center development has slowed and continued to be opportunistic with regard to new site selection. As we said on our last call, we believe there’s an opportunity to accelerate our square footage growth in 2010 depending on the availability of quality sites that meet our investment model. With the strength of our balance sheet we remain well positioned to capitalize on these opportunities in our fiscal 2010 program. We also remain confident in our ability to obtain our 1,000 store long term potential. With respect to capital expenditures we continue to expect capital expenditures to be in the range of $72 to $74 million. Now in closing, we continue to believe the consumer spending environment will remain difficult and uncertain. We have and will continue to take the necessary actions to control what we can control. We will continue to manage the business to drive earnings and generate free cash flow and reinforce our already strong balance sheet and liquidity position.  Now, I’d like to turn the call back over to Lyn.
Lyn P. Kirby : In summary, we are pleased with our second quarter results although we still believe that in a better economy our results would be stronger, we are optimistic regarding our optimistic regarding our opportunities to drive market share gain, solid profitability and free cash flow during the second half of 2009. Longer term we expect the strategies and programs we are implementing this year as well as the significant opportunities we see for expansion in our store base and brands to enable us to increase our long term profitability. We continue to believe we are doing well navigating this difficult economy while simultaneously positioning our company for stronger performance when the economy improves. Now, I’d like to turn the call back over to the operator to begin the question and answer portion of the call.
Operator:  (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Brian Tunick – JP Morgan.
Brian Tunick – JP Morgan: I guess a question for each of you, Lyn maybe talk about I know fragrance was a weak category last holiday, can you talk about are there any big fragrance launches that you see happening in Q4 of this year and have you changed your marketing or gift with purchase plans given what you think or see the department stores starting to do? Then maybe Gregg, can you talk about the number of leases you’ve already signed for next year and what are the lead times to be able to sign and be able to open a store so we can just get some idea if 45 or 55 or 60 could be the number of new stores next year. 
Lyn P. Kirby : Let me take the first part first, as it leads to the fragrance business we do have some exciting new fragrances for fourth quarter. We expect to be anniversarying the newness from last year as well as the continued flow through of some really exciting fragrances from third quarter this year going in to fourth quarter. So, we feel great about the newness availability. On the gift with purchase strategy we continue to see traction with that strategy for our customers. We continue to develop fresh new exciting gifts with purchases to continue to stay motivational to our customer base and have appropriately planned that in our fourth quarter.
Gregg R. Bodnar : Brian, on real estate we continue to see lots of opportunities that keep coming to us as we continue to diligently review those through the process and as you would expect we’re being certainly much more careful as we go through and evaluate each one of these. As we typically think of it in terms of the number of deals that we have approved at this point in time, we have about 26 deals approved at this point in time, we have a significant number that we’re going through as we speak and we also have a meaningful number that the deal makers are continuing to work on to get those ready to present to us. As far as the lead time goes, we usually have until early part of next year to get something finished and documented to still get it open in 2010. 
Brian Tunick – JP Morgan: If I could just ask Lyn, do you see the department stores being at all any more rational as we’ve come in to the back half?
Lyn P. Kirby : When you say rational are we talking about the beauty business, the apparel business, just what aspect are we talking about?
Brian Tunick – JP Morgan: More about the beauty and fragrance business.
Lyn P. Kirby : As you may recall we did see some discounting in fourth quarter around the holiday season last year from department stores, the first time we had ever seen that as well as some specialty competitors. We continue to see that run through first quarter but it has absolutely diminished in second quarter. I’m not sure if that’s your definition of rationality but we have certainly seen less of that straight across the board discounting Brian.
Operator:  Your next question comes from Neely Tamminga – Piper Jaffray.
Neely Tamminga – Piper Jaffray: Just two questions, actually one real question and then a housekeeping one. The in store boutique strategy I think is a big picture longer term strategy for Ulta. If you go way back to the road show from the IPO to where you are today and where you will be for the next couple of years it’s not just about the stores you are growing it’s the productivity improvement within those stores.  So, I was just wondering can we take just a moment to kind of review where you guys are maybe this year versus last year in terms of how you look at the store base ranging from the one brand in store boutique to in some cases up to four in store brand boutiques, how you’re sizing up the store that way. Then, maybe next year, if you’re willing, what that might look like in to the cap ex plan, etc. next year. Then, if I can get it upfront, just the housekeeping questions, Gregg so that I understand your bonus accrual practices that you were indicating for Q3 was that for just Q3’s performance or is that actually the full back half?
Gregg R. Bodnar : I’ll take the second one first Neely, as you remember last year this is the point in time where the economy really feel apart, the consumer went in to paralyze. At that particular point in time we would have adjusted our bonus expense last year reflecting where we thought we would have finished the year. 
Neely Tamminga – Piper Jaffray: So it covers the full back half.
Lyn P. Kirby : Neely, on the boutiques middle of the year last year we had rough and tough about 130 doors with boutiques. At the same time this year we’ve got about 190 or so doors with one boutique and we’ve got roughly bout 80 stores with two boutiques and that of course is primarily the combination of Benefit and Bare by in large. We’ve got a very small handful of stores, some of our larger stores maybe roughly around 10 or so with multiple boutiques, so with three or four boutiques. As we look forward to next year we certainly will continue to roll benefits across the majority of our chain with that boutique strategy. Depending on the availability of other prestige brands, we certainly have a gain plan developed on how we would do multiple boutiques and more stores if that opportunity was available to us.
Operator:  Your next question comes from Lizabeth Dunn – Thomas Weisel Partners.
Lizabeth Dunn – Thomas Weisel Partners: I was wondering if you could update us on competition? We’ve seen from the drug store competitors some real interest in prestige as a category. How are you thinking about those? Also, competition from the Sephora inside JC Pennys?
Lyn P. Kirby : In terms of the drug stores let me just to go the heart of the drug store competition right now which is on the [mass] business. We continue to see ourselves remaining extremely competitive on [mass] business and we are watching with interest some tests that Walgreens has been particularly public on as they reduce selection in their drug stores. So, at the very heart of our competition there we continue to watch that very closely. As it relates to a couple of tests that are going on in terms of expansion in to prestige from the drug stores, we are going to watch it very closely as I am sure you are. It’s at a very modest number at this point, extremely modest and I am not seeing too much indication that there’s going to be a rapid expansion. As I take a look at the brand selection that the drug stores have in those test stores, it is more the what I would call specialty brand selection and not at all department store brands at this point. Again, we will of course watch that very closely but we’re not seeing it as a significant threat at this point in time given the magnitude of what that test is.  Sephore inside of JC Pennys we of course watch very carefully and continue to keep our eye on that. As you would know if you’ve done, as I’m sure you have checked, the selection of brand availability of the Sephore inside of JC Pennys is not consistent with what they have in their free standing stores. So, we certainly watch it, we’re obviously very familiar with JC Pennys real estate expansion strategy so that one we watch extremely closely but right now it is a different brand selection in those stores.
Operator:  Your next question comes from Erika Maschmeyer – Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.
Erika Maschmeyer – Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: I’m wondering if you can comment on comp trends quarter to date and also maybe comment on whether you’re still seeing prestige brands above the company average?
Lyn P. Kirby : In terms of the prestige brands, prestige as I think we’ve mentioned before, still remains one of our highest growth categories and continues to remain that both as we expand brand selection as well as penetration with the customer base so that does remain an above average trend for us. In terms of the quarter to date trend, we are not going to speak quarter to date but we are certainly very happy with our business quarter to date but we really feel that it is appropriate for us to pull back from offering quarter to date trends on these calls. What I would suggest is what’s very indicative of how we feel our business is, is to take a look at the guidance range that Gregg gave and they certainly indicate a positive shift in the comp numbers versus the prior quarters guidance and that is the best indication of how we feel about the business quarter to date. Gregg would you have anything to add?
Gregg R. Bodnar : Erika if you look back over the last couple of quarters we tried to provide that information to give folks some further insights to the trends. We’ve seen two quarters of consistent trends. We’ve seen stabilization in our business and we’ve seen some slight quarter-to-quarter improvement and that’s reflected in the comp guidance we’ve provided for the third quarter.
Erika Maschmeyer – Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: If you could just comment on your private brands, you sounded optimistic on them and it sounds like you’re adding additional categories. Are you increasing penetration there or is that still around 5% of your revenue?
Lyn P. Kirby : Right now the 5% is a good number to be using but it continues to be a strategy for us longer term to continue to add to that and you can hear some of the additions that we have been making. But, given the growth factor of some of the other big categories in the business, the penetration is harder to shift than the actual growth rate so you know that math. Private label in the short term for us continues to be a great lever for us to pull to be driving profitable traffic to our store. It is part of our ongoing strategy to use that category to drive both traffic and unit penetration on the business.
Operator:  The next question comes from Samantha Panella – Raymond James.
Samantha Panella – Raymond James: Just to follow up on the comp guidance, looking at even the high end of your guidance it does appear that the two year trend would worsen from the second quarter, any reason to think that other than being conservative?
Gregg R. Bodnar : What I would say Sam is that we continue to evaluate the trends on our business. I think in this particular environment particularly given what we’re recycling the start of the volatility from last year, we believe it’s more relevant to look at the current year trends and to the stabilization that we’ve experienced there. We recognize that we’re jogging over slightly lower comps than last year but the comp guidance is reflective of what the current trends are which I think what is more relevant to look at as we go throughout the course of this year up until the fourth quarter.
Samantha Panella – Raymond James: Then with respect to the temporary rent relief how many stores did you receive that and how long should that last?
Gregg R. Bodnar : It’s about a dozen and about half of those have been cured or are about to be cured so it will have a small impact on the third quarter. 
Operator:  Your next question comes from Daniel Hofkin – William Blair & Co.
Daniel Hofkin – William Blair & Co.: A question about the launch of Benefit, obviously that must have been very successful so far. I’m just curious if you could maybe help quantify a little bit what type of a lift you think that you saw that came out around mid quarter as I recall or at least it started to. I’m just curious what sort of a lift you might have seen and I know you guys did not do incremental marketing year-to-year. Then I guess the second question would be looking at the free cash flow performance in the second quarter and your new full year expectation, what’s the main one or two sources of upset there?
Lyn P. Kirby : I’ll take the first part, we’re not going to comment on an individual brand in terms of numbers or specific growth rates but we are certainly pleased with the Benefit launch so let me say that first of all. But secondly, I would remind you that we also continue to see really good strength in the core and existing business so in the quarter we did for example have a back to school leader event around our professional hair care lines. We had a very exciting private label event which was a buy two get two free which led in to some other brands and we have some of our existing brands like Bare Essentials where we offered a $15 discovery kit. We are pleased with Benefit but there is much more to our business than just an individual brand and new products. One of the great strengths we have of the business is multiple levers to pull depending on the trends of the business, the environment we see and it is one of our core competitive advantages.
Gregg R. Bodnar : Dan, on the improvement in free cash flow, I think as we’ve mentioned the last couple of calls we have a number of initiatives that we’ve been working on that have materialized. Kind of in priority order versus our last guidance on free cash flow, the drivers are rally improvement in net inventory, you’ve seen we moved down in this particular case our improvement versus last year on a per store basis from five to seven to nine. We’ve also seen some benefits in net inventory over and above the gross reduction. Tax planning is another key driver that’s going to benefit us both it did in the second quarter and the rest of the year.  Earnings improvement versus our prior expectations as we’ve experienced in the second quarter and are now guiding to in the third quarter and then the last is really just fundamental working capital management and account receivables. Those are the four drivers.
Operator:  Your next question comes from Jillian Caruthers – Johnson Rice & Company.
Jillian Caruthers – Johnson Rice & Company: Could you talk about for the third quarter you’re looking for gross margin pressure of 20 to 30 basis points, can you talk about what’s driving that given you’re not expecting as much rent relief and what not?
Gregg R. Bodnar : If you look at it versus the second quarter, and we’ve talked about this before, part of the pressure we get on gross margin is deleverage from our new store program and the fixed store expenses. As we have slowed down our square footage growth this year we’re starting to diminish that amount. So, in the third quarter I’m expecting about 100 basis points of deleverage. We expect to see about 50 basis points of benefit from our supply chain initiatives and then the rest of it is improvement in merchandise margin.
Jillian Caruthers – Johnson Rice & Company: If you could talk a little bit about inventory per store was down more than expected. You lowered your yearend targets. You quoted specific initiatives and places, could you add a little more detail around that?
Gregg R. Bodnar : A couple of things that we’ve been focused on, and this isn’t necessarily in priority order, we expanded our distribution network over a year ago now. We knew there was a greater opportunity to take the safety stock levels down and move inventory through our DCs faster. Along with our supply chain efficiency progress, we’ve made a lot more progress on managing distribution center inventory levels, so not in front of the customer. We’re very comfortable with the safety stock and lead times and the team continues to fine tune those to get some working capital benefit out of the company. The other benefit is really as we continue to fine tune the inventory levels that we put in to our newer stores from a safety stock level, the assortment is the same but we’ve fine tuned the amount of inventory or depth per SKU that we’ve put in versus a mature store and we’re continuing to make better progress on that initiative versus what we expect. So, no impact on consumer experience and in fact, a slight benefit to in stock levels because we can move inventory through our DCs faster.
Operator:  Your next question comes from [Henry Compellin] – Oppenheimer & Co.
[Henry Compellin] – Oppenheimer & Co.: Just had a question about the sequential improvement in same store sales, I wanted to know if that was also occurring in the salon business or was that disproportionately weaker than the sequential improvement in same store sales?
Lyn P. Kirby : The answer is that the improvement was entirely from the retail business from first quarter to second quarter and by in large the salon business has basically remained stable in its negative trend. 
[Henry Compellin] – Oppenheimer & Co.: In terms of the average ticket decline, you said that that was 3.9% in the quarter. I wanted to know if you could just talk about some consumer trade down? I think previously you’d highlighted mineral based cosmetics as a particular category, I wanted to see if that was still the case?
Lyn P. Kirby : Yes, that continues to be one of the factors that we see in terms of the average ticket decline. The other factors are also the fragrance category still remains the most discretionary category and therefore our sales are still lower than prior year although we are significantly out pacing the industry and taking market share in that category. The other category that has certainly been hurt by this economy is our high priced styling tools products, products that are north of $100 in terms of their price. So, that continues to run through the average ticket.
Operator:  Your next question comes from [Anthony Lebosinski] – Sidoti & Company.
[Anthony Lebosinski] – Sidoti & Company: I was wondering if you could talk about the expense savings that you’re now guiding to of $18 million versus $15 million, where is the additional $3 million coming from?
Gregg R. Bodnar : Two thirds of the improvement is coming out of our supply chain Anthony and the rest is coming out of our core store expense management strategies.
[Anthony Lebosinski] – Sidoti & Company:   As far as your real estate is concerned over here, could you talk about just sort of next year the openings that you’re looking to do are they mostly back fills or new markets? And also, has there been any change to the length of your lease terms?
Lyn P. Kirby : In terms of the first part of your question, there’s very little change in the composition of the real estate program that we are expecting. The new to existing market ratio is about the same although you may have heard us stay before we’ve had a very slight uptick in the number of stores that we are opening in single store markets so there’s a very modest uptick. We have had a modest uptick certainly in the last six months between new and existing centers and we have seen a little bit of an uptick in existing centers since the impact to the economy but not a significant uptick from first quarter to second quarter.
Gregg R. Bodnar : Anthony, as we head in to next year, as we talked about, the opportunity really is in existing centers because by the time we get to next year, any of the pipeline that was built for new centers will have been opened so we don’t expect a big mix of our portfolio, unlike the balance in past years, to be in new centers. As it relates to the lease term, we still continue to have a similar structure than what we’ve done in the past. We typically do a 10 year initial lease term and multiples of two or three five year options that are our options for extensions.
Operator:  There are no further questions in the queue. I would like to turn the call back over to Lyn Kirby for closing remarks.
Lyn P. Kirby : Thanks again for joining us today, we look forward to speaking to you on our third quarter call in December.
Operator:  This concludes the teleconference you may disconnect your lines. Thank you for your participation.

Operator: Greetings and welcome to the Ulta Salon, Cosmetics & Fragrance, Inc. Fourth Quarter and Fiscal 2008 Results Conference Call. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. (Operator instructions). As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Allison Malkin of ICR. Thank you. You may begin.
Allison Malkin: Thank you. Good afternoon. Before we get started, I'd like to remind you of the company's Safe Harbor language, which I'm sure you're all familiar with. The statements contained in this conference call, which are not historical facts may be deemed to constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual future results may differ materially from those projected in such statements due to a number of risks and uncertainties, all of which are described in the company's filings with the SEC. With respect to each reference we make on this call to adjusted net income per diluted share as a result of the October 2007 IPO, a reconciliation of net income per share on a GAAP basis to adjusted net income per share has been provided in Exhibit 4 of our earnings release, which is available on our Web site and has been filed with the SEC on Form 8-K. In addition, during the call we may make reference to non-GAAP financial metrics, such as free cash flow. Free cash flow is defined as cash flow from operations less capital expenditures. And now, I would like to turn the call over to Ulta's President and CEO, Lyn Kirby.
Lyn Kirby: Thank you, Allison. Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us to discuss our fourth quarter and fiscal year 2008 results. On the call with me today is our Chief Financial Officer, Gregg Bodnar. And following my opening remarks, Gregg will review our financial highlights and outlook and then I will provide closing comments and turn the call over to the operator so that we can answer the questions you have for us today. In the fourth quarter, we delivered solid earnings of $0.21 per diluted share, and for the full year reported diluted earnings per share of $0.43, which was flat with prior year. Our comp store sales for fiscal 2008 were flat for the year with increases in the first three quarters of fiscal 2008, offset by negative 5.5% comp in the fourth quarter as we navigated the tough economy and intense volatility in the final days leading up to the holidays. Arguably, the fourth quarter included one of the most turbulent holiday periods in many decades, which caused an extraordinary level of promotional activity, especially in apparel. As a result, we did give up some gift sales during the days just prior to Christmas. Quite simply, women chose the $250 cashmere sweater at 70% off (inaudible) fragrance, which was not discounted at $65. Although we anticipated a difficult environment and appropriately invested margin, we chose not to participate in the promotional frenzy in the final days leading up to Christmas, choosing instead to achieve a balance of sales and earnings. This is the right strategy. We maintain the integrity of our brand and value proposition and delivered solid earnings in the fourth quarter, and our inventory levels are quite healthy with no risk of seasonal obsolescence. Most importantly, in January, our business demonstrated its resiliency returning to a 0.5% positive comp, despite store closings due to weather in the last two weeks of the month. While the quarter was difficult, we advanced the priorities we set when we began the year and are pleased with our accomplishments. The year included a significant milestone with fiscal 2008 net sales surpassing $1 billion. Our EPS of $0.43 was even with adjusted 2007 EPS despite the difficult retail environment. We achieved our new store expansion goal opening 63 new stores, ending the year with 311 stores in 36 days with our 2008 class performing two models. And we successfully opened our second distribution centre on time and on budget. As demonstrated in the fourth quarter, we have the flexibility to control many aspects of our business to deliver balance in our sales and earnings performance. We managed cost across our organization and remained nimble, quickly adjusting our plan to changes in trends. Similar to late 2008, there is limited visibility into economic and consumer trends in the year ahead. As we begin fiscal 2009, you can be assured that we are managing all aspects of our business within our control. We are reading trends everyday and have developed specific set of alternative to adjust our business to a wider range of outcome to achieve free cash flow, maximize profitability and continue to gain market share in 2009. Speaking to free cash flow, we have two broad strategies. First, our store expansion. We have appropriately scaled back our store expansion plan and currently plan to open approximately 35 stores in fiscal 2009, an 11% increase in annual square footage. We believe this is prudent in a tough economy as we turn our focus to attaining positive free cash flow. We expect this environment to open up some great real estate opportunities for us and we fully expect to capitalize on premier sites as the economy stabilizes and we will carefully incorporate these opportunities into our 2010 real estate program. Second is our expense management. We have analyzed expenses across the organization and have initiated cost reduction plans that are expected to generate $15 million in savings this year. And Gregg will provide more specifics regarding our 2009 strategies in just a few moments. In addition to the 35 stores we will open in 2009, we continue to focus on three additional strategies to gain market share. First, continued expansion of new brands. We are excited by the rollout of benefit cosmetics to all doors, which we expect to achieve by the end of third quarter, up from just 9 doors in 2008. This is an important brand for us, adding to the diversity and strength of our prestige offerings. We also plan to introduce a number of new skin care brands in the first quarter, including Cosmedicine and Kouros and we will continue to test existing and new brands during the year. In fourth quarter, we also had two very strong additions to our mask categories; we introduced Oil Olay's ProX skin care and L'Oreal's EverPure hair care. Second is Ulta.com. While small, our 2008 sales grew to double-digits rate and we expect this trend to continue in 2009. Last, but equally important, marketing. We will continue to entice existing and potential new customers with exciting and fresh marketing in store, in print, by e-mail and through Ulta.com. For example, we delivered a successful Valentine's Day promotion with Sterling silver jewelry as a gift with purchase. And in partnership with our brands we also held our first ever in-store customer tutorial and promotion with Chi, our leading hair appliance. And looking ahead, we will continue to offer great value to our customers including five products for $10, Easter basket offer and in next three weeks, our plans include our Annual Spring Beauty makeover events for all of our Prestige brands. We fully expect to continue to gain market share in 2009 as we benefit from the increasing preference for our retail experience in this category. As we continue our expansion with the opening of 35 new stores, as we add new brands, and deliver high impact marketing. As you know, we are not a monthly reporter and our marketing calendar changes each year, which makes it difficult to draw conclusions from month to month trends. In addition, our business model is different to mall based and apparel retailers. Our inventory is not seasonal, we operate it off mall and our weekly marketing events drive customer traffic, and so our monthly trends are different from other retailers. However, given the uncertainty in the environment we thought it would be helpful to provide you with additional insights into our comp store sales. In January, our comp store sales increased 0.5%. In the first six weeks of fiscal 2009, our comp store sales declined 2%. Our January increase included a more robust rebound from holiday sales versus other retailers. We believe our first six weeks of fiscal 2009 comp store sales decline of 2% is more representative of the declining economic environment since holiday. Although the economy in the first six weeks of fiscal 2009 has negatively impacted our average ticket by 5.4%, our customers continue to buy across our categories from prestige to mass, but with a bit more caution than in years past. While this economy is causing our consumers to spend less, our comp customer traffic and the first six weeks remains positive at plus 3.4% and continues to demonstrate the strength in our marketing strategies, value proposition and store experience. Our quarter-to-date performance also includes a softening in our salon trends. As you know, we have been able to achieve salon trends ahead of the industry in 2008. However, in this further depressed economy, our salon business has been increasingly affected by consumers deferring salon services, which in turn, has negatively impacted our total comp store sales performance year-to-date. To counter the environment, we are developing a new innovative strategy to drive salon sales, which we will reveal later in the year. We believe the strategy has the potential to improve the current trends in our salon business later in the year. The fundamentals of our retail business model remains strong. We continue to attract new brands and our customer traffic remains positive. We are confident in our core strategies and our long-term growth potential. Given the limited visibility, we have widened the ranges of our possible outcomes for first quarter sales and earnings and have chosen not to provide a specific full year sales and earnings range. That said, we will provide insight into several financial metrics for the year, which Gregg will cover. So now, I'd like to turn the call over to Gregg to review the financials in more detail.
Gregg Bodnar: Thanks, Lyn. In this difficult environment, we continue to focus on executing our core business strategies by controlling and reducing as appropriate, new store expansion, inventory levels, operating expenses and capital expenditures. These actions delivered diluted earnings per share of $0.21 in the quarter. Beginning with the review of the income statement, net sales increased 10.4% to $341.4 million from $309.3 million in the fourth quarter last year. Sales growth was driven by the addition of 62 net new stores in operation versus a year ago. Comp store sales decreased 5.5%, which follows an increase of 4.5% last year, resulting in a two year comp store sales decline of 1%. The comp store sales decrease was driven by a 3.5% decline in traffic primarily related to the last 10 days leading up to Christmas. During the quarter, we opened seven new stores ending the fourth quarter with 311 stores and expanding square footage by 25% from last year's fourth quarter. Our 2008 new store class continues to perform at our model despite the difficult economic environment. Gross profit dollars in the fourth quarter increased 4.5% to $101.4 million from $97 million last year. Gross profit margin decreased a 170 basis points to 29.7%, primarily driven by 130 basis points of deleverage in fixed store costs, resulting from our expanded new store program and lower comp store sales. In addition, 90 basis points of gross margin investment was used to drive traffic in response to the anticipated difficult economic environment and competitive landscape during the quarter. These decreases were partially offset by improved leverage and transportation cost due to efficiencies achieved and the addition of our new distribution center. SG&A expenses were $78.2 million or 22.9% of sales, compared to $70.4 million or 22.8% of net sales in the prior year. This reflects improved leverage of our store expenses and corporate overhead during the quarter. We believe these actions continue to demonstrate our ability to quickly adjust our expense structure in response to changes in the current business environment. Net income for the quarter was $12.3 million or $0.21 per diluted share as compared to $13.6 million or $0.23 per diluted share last year. For the full year net sales rose 18.9%, to $1.08 billion with comparable store sales increasing 0.2%. This follows a 6.2% increase in comparable store sales last year. The two year comparable store sales increase was 6.4%. Operating income for the full year was $46.3 million as compared to $46.7 million last year. Income per diluted share was $0.43 including $0.01 of severance cost which occurred in the first quarter and compares to adjusted income per diluted share of $0.43 in fiscal 2007. Now turning to the balance sheet and cash flow results. Merchandise inventories at the end of the quarter increased 21.3% to $213.6 million from $176.1 million at the end of fourth quarter last year. Average inventory per store decreased 2.9% from the prior year quarter. The 37.5 million increase in inventory was due to the addition of 62 net new stores opened over the last 12 months. We are pleased with both the level and composition of inventories as we entered the first quarter. Regarding debt, outstanding borrowings as of January 31st, 2009 were $106 million and our debt to equity ratio was a very modest 0.3 times. As of year-end, we had $75 million of availability on our credit facility. Our credit facility provides for borrowing up to $200 million and is committed through May of 2011, by three of the largest U.S. banks including JPMorgan, Wells Fargo and Bank of America. We believe this credit facility together with cash flow from our existing store base provides us with the capital and liquidity to achieve our growth plans well into the future while maintaining a very strong balance sheet that is not highly leveraged. Cash flow from operations for the year was $75.4 million, an increase of $28.5 million from fiscal 2007. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $14.3 million. Full year 2008 CapEx was $110.9 million, an increase of $9 million versus 2007. Lastly, depreciation and amortization for 2008 was $51.4 million versus $39.5 million in fiscal 2007. With that recap of 2008, I'd like to look forward to 2009. As we operate in this volatile environment, we note that our forward visibility and consumer trends will be very limited. The economic data that's being reported does not give us any reason to be optimistic about consumer environment in the U.S. in 2009. As a result we have focused on managing the elements of our business we can control, namely, generating free cash flow, reducing our new store growth plans, expense management, and lastly, managing working capital, namely inventory levels. We believe the combination of these strategies will enable us to generate free cash flow in 2009, which is largely driven by our decision to reduce our new store opening program. At this point I'd like to share some more specifics on these strategies and their potential impact on fiscal 2009. New stores, currently, we are planning to open approximately 35 new stores in 2009. We believe this program achieves the right balance between delivering free cash flow and opening new stores in high quality locations. Further, we are managing our future 2010 new store pipeline to maintain maximum flexibility in this environment. Capital expenditures; we expect capital expenditures to be in the range of $72 million to $74 million, representing more than 30% decrease from fiscal 2008 levels. We have several initiatives underway that will continue to reduce our new store investment beyond our 2008 achievements. We expect these initiatives to reduce our new store average investment to $1.3 million compared to $1.5 million historically. Inventory management; we have identified specific initiatives to further reduce our average store and DC inventory levels. We expect inventory per store to decline in the range of 5% to 7% by the end of fiscal 2009. Expense management; as Lyn mentioned earlier, we expect to generate approximately $15 million in cost savings in 2009, including supply chain, store operating costs, and corporate expenses. Free cash flow; we believe that our focus on these key initiatives will result in our ability to deliver free cash flow in 2009 of at least $10 million compared to a $35.7 million net cash outflow in fiscal 2008. Now shifting to our first quarter outlook; given the volatile economic environment and the limited visibility over the full year, we are focusing our communication and guidance on the first quarter. For the first quarter of fiscal 2009, we currently estimate net sales in the range of $262 million to $271 million, compared to actual sales of $239.3 million in fiscal 2008. This assumes a comparable store decrease of 2% to 5% compared to an increase of 3.9% in the first quarter of 2008. At this point, we are three weeks into the quarter and our current comp trend reflects a minus 2% and we have opened six stores of our planned eight stores for the quarter. Income per diluted share for the first quarter of fiscal 2009 is estimated to be in the range of $0.04 to $0.06. This compares to income per diluted share for the first quarter of 2008 of $0.07, including $0.01 per share of severance costs for the management change in March 2008. So looking broadly at 2009, we believe that with the CapEx inventory and cost structure reductions we have planned, we would reasonably expect with a 2% comp store sales decline, we would expect to deliver earnings that would be flat to 2008 on a full year basis and free cash flow of at least $10 million. Let me be very clear, this is not our full year guidance, but a relative data point that we hope helps you model 2009. Let me say in closing that we expect to continue to operate in a difficult economy for a prolonged period of time. We have and will continue to take the necessary actions to control what we can control and continue to manage the business with a focus on driving earnings and generating free cash flow to reinforce our already strong balance sheet and liquidity position. And now, I'd like to turn the call back over to Lyn.
Lyn Kirby: We believe we've identified the right strategies to maximize profitability and cash flow in the expected challenging year. We continue to open stores. We continue to add new brands. We have a loyal customer base that is growing each day, highly dedicated team and initiatives in place across all of our businesses to drive sales and so continue to expand our market share. We will remain nimble and adjust to the environment real time to ensure that we continue to balance our sales and earnings to advance our goals in 2009 and expect the strategies we are implementing this year to enable us to become even stronger, more efficient and better positioned to growth as the economy stabilizes and improves. And now, I'd like to turn the call over to the operator to conduct the Q&A portion of the call.
Operator: Thank you. (Operator instructions). First question is from the line of Neely Tamminga. Please go ahead with your question.
Neely Tamminga – Piper Jaffray: Good afternoon and thanks for the help. I know it’s tough to figure out how to guide this year. Just a couple of questions. In terms of the gross margin trends for the year, and if not for the year, maybe for the quarter, considering you got the shift of prestige to mass, just wondering, in general, how you're looking for your gross margins to kind of play out at least for the Q1, if not, under that down two comp scenario? And then, I just have a follow-up question on some marketing strategy.
Gregg Bodnar: Hi, Neely. I'll take both of those first two questions. As it relates to the first quarter, I would expect gross margin rate mostly driven by the continued deleverage, our fixed store expenses to be down about 150 basis points. And again, the most significant driver there is the fixed store expenses. When you look out to the full year, that comes down slightly and we expect in the full year under that theoretical minus 2 comp that I gave you with flat earnings, gross margins to be down about 90 basis points, more than that is related to the fixed store expenses, as for the full year we'll get some of the benefit from the cost savings that are related to the supply chain in gross margin.
Neely Tamminga – Piper Jaffray: Okay. That's very helpful, Gregg. And this is for, Lyn, if you could talk a little bit about the marketing strategy. I guess there's kind of two ways to go about it and maybe the third option is to do both. You can either increase your circulation in mailers or kind of amp up the compelling offer in tandem maybe with your vendors or on your own on the couponing side. Just wondering, how you guys are viewing that for '09 given this environment? Are you kind of more fixated on driving that traffic or is it about kind of improving that conversion?
Lyn Kirby: We are, Neely, definitely focused on traffic in this environment. We do believe that we want to maintain that loyalty and the connection with our customer base even during this tough time so that they will be there for us when we return to a more normalized economy. The way we're doing it is not through expanded advertising expense and expanded circulation. We actually are planning our advertising expense slightly lower to sales for the full year versus last year, not because we're reducing circ but we're expecting some cost reduction in our negotiation. We are currently planning basically same marketing as last year. Now, you know we'll stay flexible on that as we respond real time to trends that we see, up and down, as the case may be. So advertising is whole. We are certainly continuing to offer value to our customers and that is primarily in concert with our brand partners. We are not investing more margins than fourth quarter, but we certainly will be investing in key offers to provide value to the customers. The most significant impact on our margin is – this is what we have been doing in terms of a change from fourth quarter is actually that we're seeing our customers redeem more coupons than what they have in the past. So our coupon redemption rate is up. I think when you reflect on that, it's not really a big surprise in this economy, but it's not actually a planned strategy to offer more value than we have in the past. But we certainly will offer value.
Neely Tamminga – Piper Jaffray: Great. Thanks. Just one real quick housekeeping question. Gregg, did I miss it? Did you say what you expect D&A would be in '09?
Gregg Bodnar: I hadn't said that yet, but it will be approximately $60 million to $61 million.
Neely Tamminga – Piper Jaffray: Great. Thank you.
Operator: The next question is from Joe Altobello with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead with your question.
Joe Altobello – Oppenheimer: Thanks. Good afternoon guys. First question is just a point of clarification on the guidance for the first quarter. The comp range is down 2% to 5%, I think you said that through the first half of the quarter roughly you're down 2%. So isn't the low end of that range unrealistic?
Gregg Bodnar: Joe, here's what I would say to you. As you've kind of heard through the theme is – as Lyn and I have been talking about. The volatility and the changes that we're seeing in the economic environment have been very difficult to predict. So we have set a comp range that includes the first six weeks of the quarter that we believe is realistic, given the fact that we cannot anticipate what the potential impact from any other shifts in the economy could be for the remainder of the quarter.
Joe Altobello – Oppenheimer: Okay. But are you seeing anything that would lead you to believe that we should expect a significant deceleration in comps in the back half of the quarter or that's just you being somewhat conservative at this point?
Gregg Bodnar: No, the point that we're making is, as you can see in changes that we've seen in the economy recently, that they're very difficult to predict. So we're not anticipating any change. But we're not ruling it out given the fact that we don't have great forward optics into the rest of the quarter. So there isn't something that we see today that necessarily tells us that the current trends will decline significantly, but we cannot anticipate with this lack of visibility, what may come in the coming weeks.
Joe Altobello – Oppenheimer: Okay. And then in terms of trade down, in which categories, and I apologize if you mentioned this already. But which categories are you seeing the most trade down pressure?
Lyn Kirby: Actually we're not seeing it across the board, Joe. There's just one particular category where we are seeing it and it tends to be in the mineral cosmetic category. But other than that, we are not seeing any significant shift.
Joe Altobello – Oppenheimer: Got it. Okay. And then lastly, in terms of the $15 million of cost savings, just to be clear, that is going to be all realized in '09, it's not a run rate or anything like that. Its $15 million realized this year.
Gregg Bodnar: That's $15 million realized versus what the current cost structure in the business is. And obviously, there's some costs that will come into the business as we add those new stores. But it's just specifically – that cost is specifically related to the new stores. So its $15 million cost reduction from what our current structure is, all realized in 2009.
Joe Altobello – Oppenheimer: Got it. Okay. Great. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question is from Brian Tunick with JPMorgan Chase. Please go ahead with your questions.
Evren Kopelman – JPMorgan Chase: Thanks. Hi. Evren Kopelman for Brian. The first question is, we were somewhat surprised by the degree of the square footage growth pull back, especially in light of the better rents and construction that you've talked about that you're seeing. Can you talk a little bit more about the thought process behind that I guess versus the free cash flow consideration? And also would you consider accelerating footage growth if the environment changes throughout the year? Do you have the flexibility to pull in some of the 2010 openings possibly into '09?
Gregg Bodnar: Let me take those one at a time, Evren. Specifically, it relates to the approximately 35 new stores in 2009, our thought process was to balance the quality of real estate, with our objective of being free cash flow positive this year. We have been seeing some reductions in deal structure, specifically, rents and improved landlord allowances. We do not believe that they fully reflect the reality and the potential of what we could see in the short-term in this environment. So said slightly differently, I think the deals that we're not doing this year could potentially get cheaper in the short-term. So I think that's a forward opportunity for us. And then, as it relates to where 2009 could end up, at this particular stage, the store count could move up or down a couple of stores. But for the most part, given the timeline that it takes to build store and get it open, in 2009, we don't anticipate that number to change significantly, because we're too far into the year to pull any significant stores forward from first quarter of 2010.
Evren Kopelman – JPMorgan Chase: Okay. And can you also update us on your remodel program, how many store remodels you plan to do in '09?
Lyn Kirby: We'll do eight remodels this year. That gives us the opportunity to work into our store plans the new brands that I spoke to earlier benefit particularly as well as Kouros and Cosmedicine.
Evren Kopelman – JPMorgan Chase: Great. And then finally, can you touch on the competitive landscape? Do you see increased competition maybe ticket pressure, any new entrance?
Lyn Kirby: I just missed the very last piece, any ticket pressure or –
Evren Kopelman – JPMorgan Chase: Or in general updates on any changes in the competitive landscape?
Lyn Kirby: Actually no, there really is nothing significant that has taken place. It is from a pure beauty landscape. It is as competitive as it was in the back half of last year. So, we're not seeing anything significant there. A little bit more activity online, but nothing that is significant in the retail environment. In terms of the broader retail environment, as you know, during the fourth quarter where we were competing up against extremely heavily discounted apparel, we have certainly seen that competitive environment lessen somewhat, which of course is why you see the comp trend on such a strong rebound from the minus 5.5 during the fourth quarter into the positive numbers in January and slightly lesser in February.
Evren Kopelman – JPMorgan Chase: Alright. Thank you very much.
Operator: The next question is from Liz Dunn with Thomas Weisel. Please go ahead with your question.
Liz Dunn – Thomas Weisel: Hi. Let me say congratulations on managing through this tough environment while I know somebody is going to give me a hard time for this. But you guys sound like you've been doing this for years, you really don't sound like a newer public company. So, congrats on that. I guess my first question relates to cash flow. What would the cash flow be if your comp trend was down 5 – what would the free cash flow be for 2009 if the comp was negative 5 for the full year?
Gregg Bodnar: The impact – here's the way I would say this, Liz. We have specific contingency plans that we have built for this business at different stages of comp performance for the year. We've got lots of levers to pull from a free cash flow perspective. A change from the theoretical minus to down to minus 5, I still believe that we can generate free cash flow.
Liz Dunn – Thomas Weisel: Okay. What is the outlook for debt for the year? Will you need to draw on your facility as you move through the year to fund seasonal working capital needs?
Gregg Bodnar: We will, we historically always have. We will above the debt levels that we ended the fourth quarter at, okay? As we go into the year, our peak, as you know, starts to increase at the end of the third quarter, then comes back down precipitously in the fourth quarter as we get post-holiday cash receipts in. Last year, we still had even at our peak debt level about $50 million of availability in our credit facility. The majority of that free cash flow will come up until the end of that third quarter, so, therefore, this year what I expect our peak debt to be below that 150 million by at least 10 million.
Liz Dunn – Thomas Weisel: Okay. And then on the 15 million in savings, is there any – I'm assuming this is 15 million in savings. I know you said on your 2008 expense structure, but it is sort of 50 million in savings versus plan. Is there any guidance you can give us as to how much SG&A will be up year-over-year?
Gregg Bodnar: On the – again on that theoretical reference point that I gave you on the minus 2 to flat earnings, I would expect the SG&A will be up just slightly, maybe 10 basis points.
Liz Dunn – Thomas Weisel: Okay. And then finally just want a point of clarification. When you talk about your average ticket, that's the average basket, right? So I guess, just a little bit of confusion about the average ticket being down, but you're saying there is no trade down. Is it that people are buying the same things but just less units in the basket? Is that what's going on?
Lyn Kirby: Yes, that's it exactly, Liz. But we're not seeing prestige customers trade down to mass with the exception as I say, there was only one shift worth noting which was in the mineral category. So we're not seeing it trading down, but we are seeing customers buy less across the board. So that's exactly what is happening.
Liz Dunn – Thomas Weisel: That's interesting. In the mineral you're seeing people trade down from prestige to mass within the category.
Lyn Kirby: Yes. To the extent to which we’re seeing any trade down and that’s the most significant change that we’ve seen from prior year trends.
Liz Dunn – Thomas Weisel: Okay, thanks. And once again congratulations on just handling. This is really an unprecedented environment.
Lyn Kirby: Thank you for the positive feedback, Liz.
Operator: The next question is from Erika Maschmeyer with Robert W. Baird. Please state your question.
Erika Maschmeyer – Robert W. Baird: Hi, good evening and great job in a really tough environment. Question on your deviation from guidance of $0.18 and $0.19, where were you surprised on the positive side?
Gregg Bodnar: One of the things we did, Erika, is we came out of that holiday period. We were very aggressive in looking at all of the variable cost structure in our business, and the $0.02 of incremental earnings above the top end of that $0.18 to $0.19 range, came primarily from us quickly responding in pulling back on some store and corporate operating expenses. It was purely more aggressive expense management as we were wrapping up the year.
Erika Maschmeyer – Robert W. Baird: Good job and quick movement there. And then could you give some guidance on pre-opening expense for '09?
Gregg Bodnar: Yes, for the full year I would expect it to be between 7.5 million and 8 million, and then for the first quarter I would expect it to be about 1.2 million to 1.3 million.
Erika Maschmeyer – Robert W. Baird: Great. Thanks so much. Good luck.
Lyn Kirby: Thanks, Erica.
Operator: (Operator instructions). The next question is from Anthony Lebiedzinski with Sidoti. Please go ahead with your question.
Anthony Lebiedzinski – Sidoti: Good afternoon. I was hoping that you guys give us a little bit of a, I guess guidance about the timing of new store openings by quarter. Is that something you can provide us with?
Gregg Bodnar: Sure. Sure. Absolutely. For – as I mentioned for the first quarter, we're going to open eight, for the second quarter approximately 10, and then the remainder will come through the second half of the year predominantly in the third quarter.
Anthony Lebiedzinski – Sidoti: Okay. Do you plan to do any store closings?
Gregg Bodnar: We have potentially one store that we're evaluating, that could be a potential relocation or the relocation may not open until 2010.
Anthony Lebiedzinski – Sidoti: Got you. And as far as your cash flow comments over here, are you expecting that the higher cash from operations to be mostly because of the inventory reductions, or is there anything else that you're expecting?
Gregg Bodnar: The first – Anthony, the first biggest driver there is the reduction in capital expenditures from year-to-year on the lower store base. And then incrementally to that you'll have some benefit from the reduced working capital from the inventory reduction in our existing store base. But, remember, as we add new stores into 2009, we're obviously going to be required to put inventory in those stores. So the single biggest driver is the CapEx reduction on the lower store base.
Anthony Lebiedzinski – Sidoti: Okay. Also wondering, if you guys comment on what you're seeing in your salon businesses, can you give us a sense there, whether your same store sales in your salons were they worse than company average or better, and also anything quarter to date, what are you seeing there?
Lyn Kirby: As I mentioned, Anthony, we have certainly seen a drop off since the holiday period, with the frequency of visits from our customers so that is the most significant change. We're not going to provide too much detail on the specific category. As you know, we don't provide very much information, but we had made a commitment that if there is a significant shift in any category, that would give you some idea. So it has – it has dropped off and it is definitely impacting the comp numbers and it is more negative than the retail business.
Anthony Lebiedzinski – Sidoti: Okay. Alright. Thank you.
Lyn Kirby: Thanks.
Operator: Next question is follow-up from Joe Altobello with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead with your question.
Joe Altobello – Oppenheimer: Thanks, Gregg. I just want to go back to the pre-opening costs that you mentioned that 1.2 million to 1.3 million for the quarter. It looks like you opened 7 doors last quarter and spent a $1.8 million. So why you are opening more doors yet spending $0.5 million less?
Gregg Bodnar: As you may remember that pre-opening costs flows over about a 13 week period. And as I mentioned, this early in the quarter, we have opened 6 stores of the 8 stores. So one of the reasons why, the first quarter is below our normal first store average is because some of those costs flowed into the fourth quarter of last year, and those stores opened early into the first half of the quarter this year.
Joe Altobello – Oppenheimer: Got it. Okay. Perfect. Okay. Thank you.
Operator: There are no further questions in queue. I'd like to turn the call back over to management for closing remarks.
Lyn Kirby: Let me just close by thanking all of the Ulta employees throughout the United States this year for their outstanding commitment and hard work. It has been a difficult year and the dedication has been fantastic. To everybody else on call, thank you for joining us today and we certainly look forward to speaking to you when we report first quarter results in June. Thank you.
Operator: This concludes the teleconference. You may disconnect your lines. Thank you for your participation.

Operator:  Greetings, ladies and gentlemen, and thank you for holding. Welcome to the Ulta Salon, Cosmetics & Fragrance, Inc. third quarter 2008 results conference call. (Operator Instructions)  It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Allison Malkin of ICR. Thank you. You may begin.
Allison C. Malkin:  Thank you. Good afternoon. Before we get started I'd like to remind you of the company's safe harbor language, which I'm sure you're all familiar with.  The statements contained in this conference call which are not historical facts may be deemed to constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual future results may differ materially from those projected in such statements due to a number of risks and uncertainties, all of which are described in the company's filings with the SEC.  With respect to each reference we make on this call to adjusted net income per diluted share as a result of the October 2007 IPO, a reconciliation of net income per share on a GAAP basis to adjusted net income per share has been provided in Exhibit 4 of our earnings release, which is available on our website and has been filed with the SEC on Form 8-K. And now I'd like to turn the call over to Ulta's President and CEO, Lyn Kirby.
Lyn P. Kirby:  Thank you, Allison. Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us to discuss our third quarter fiscal 2008 results.  On the call with me today is our Chief Financial Officer, Gregg Bodnar. Following my opening remarks, Gregg will review our financial highlights and outlook and then I will provide closing comments my comments and turn the call over to the operator so that we can answer the questions you have for us today. Let me start by saying in these unprecedented times we remain confident in our strategies and financial position, and we are pleased with our strong third quarter performance, although our performance was impacted by the sudden decline in the macro environment that occurred in October. We are also pleased with the recent start to the holiday season and the strategies that are driving these results. And if consumers continue spend on their current trend, we would anticipate delivering fourth quarter comp sales in line with third quarter performance. However, we recognize that the majority of the season remains in front of us, and the most volatile economy we have seen in decades. So, as a result of the change in the macro environment, we have reduced our full year outlook. And further, we believe it is prudent to provide fourth quarter guidance that represents a wider range of potential outcomes due to this volatility. That said, our EPS guidance represents a solid increase over last year's fourth quarter, and our expectations for sales and earnings remain well ahead of many other retailers. Quite simply, given the uncertainty of consumer gift spending, we do not want to over promise. As I mentioned, we are pleased with our third quarter results, which included double-digit growth in net sales and earnings and our 35th consecutive quarter of positive comp growth. Our comp store sales gain of 2% included double-digit growth from many of our prestige brands and was driven by positive customer count as we continue to drive for market share in this difficult economy. While we are pleased with our overall comp sales gain in this environment, we do want to point that our total sales comp was negatively impacted by roughly 40 basis points due to store closures in the Houston market as a result of the hurricane. In addition, like most other retailers, we saw our business drop dramatically in the early October time frame during the height of the financial crisis. The good news is that our business bounced back solidly after this period in response to modest incremental spend in advertising and margin. In addition, as we have discussed previously, we are an established retailer with a 310-store chain, so our comp store comparisons include the impact of transfer sales from new stores opened in existing markets. As you know, we build our real estate strategy with a balance of comp sales growth in new markets and operating margin improvement in existing markets. So once again, our third quarter results demonstrate the strength of our business model even in a weak and turbulent economy.  Specific highlights of the quarter included net sales of $254.8 million, reflecting an increase of 22.4% from last year. Our third quarter sales volume was slightly below our total sales guidance range, which reflects the impact of a weak economy on our comp stores and also our new stores. As has been typical in fourth quarter, we expect stronger performance in our new stores when marketing is allocated heavily towards newspaper inserts that reach a broad audience and drive traffic into new stores. This strategy is already gaining traction in the early weeks of the fourth quarter, and overall, our 2008 new store program remains on track with our model. Our operating income growth was 20.4% from last year's levels and our adjusted income per diluted share of $0.09, meeting the midpoint of our guidance, which, of course, was introduced prior to the economic shift that impacted our business in October. As you are well aware, our third quarter performance compared quite favorably to other retail operators and competitors such as our big box co-tenants and stores in alternative channels such as department stores and fashion retailers, the majority of which reported negative comps and negative traffic during third quarter. This demonstrates that Ulta has become a key shopping destination and that our business model includes strategies that can be leveraged in a weak and turbulent economy. Although Ulta and the category are not impervious to the general negative economic conditions, we are more resilient because, firstly, we are convenient to shop. Ulta is located off mall, closer to neighborhoods, and fits into our consumers' busy lifestyles. In addition, although we appreciate the traffic from our co-tenants, we are more self-reliant, with the ability to drive traffic through our own stores. We are a category killer, with a choice of 21,000 products which meets all of our customers' beauty needs in one store and with price points that satisfy all wallets. Our business model is flexible. During the quarter, when news of the financial crisis began, we proactively altered our marketing strategies to emphasize even more our value message and great products in the latter part of the quarter. As we anticipated, we obtained more of our loyal customers' shopping dollars as well as attracted new customers, thereby expanding our market share. And finally, our stores look fresh and exciting each time our customer shops. We provide her a choice of 21,000 products, with the right mix of newness and value which creates an exciting and fun shopping experience each time she comes to our store. We are able to achieve this without the significant seasonal markdown risk that certain retailers, such as apparel stores, may be facing in this environment due to seasonal obsolescence.  Our store expansion continued to deliver good results. We opened 21 new stores and completed two remodels during the quarter and our 2008 class remains on model. Our openings were also well balanced. Six were in major metro markets, nine in medium-sized markets, and six opened in smaller markets. We opened 12 stores in our existing markets, strengthening our market share and leveraging our operating costs, and entered nine new markets, including our first store in St. Louis, Missouri. We ended the quarter with 304 stores in 35 states. During the quarter we successfully opened Ulta on State Street in Chicago, our first open location. The customer and vendor feedback has been terrific, and there has been a lot of buzz. We're very excited by its potential. We have opened 62 of our 63 planned new stores for the fiscal year and we'll open our final store, located in Miami Beach, Florida, this quarter, which will complete our 2008 expansion plan. Looking forward, as we continue to experience the strength in our business model, we are maintaining our long-term square footage growth of 20 to 25%. However, in the short term we have made a decision to reduce our 2009 growth plan to 15% to 20%. We believe this is prudent in a tough economy. The most recent credit and general economic contraction has delayed some planned retail developments and caused numerous retailers to pull back planned openings in others, diminishing their attractiveness to Ulta. On the other hand, the large numbers of announced and anticipated store closings have and will open up opportunities in many outstanding centers that have previously been fully leased. We want to be in a position to take full advantage of this changing landscape. We ended the third quarter in a very strong inventory position, which will allow us to introduce newness and excitement in the fourth quarter in new products and giftables and across our key categories such as fragrance, prestige and personal care appliances. Specifically, this holiday we have 12 new fragrances, including Ed Hardy, Viva la Juicy, Ralph Lauren Notorious, and Estee Lauder Sensuous. We also have exciting holiday giftables from all our major prestige color brands, including Smashbox, Bare Essentials, and Urban Decay. And of course our professional category has exciting newness from [Chi], T3, and OPI. As we mentioned during our last quarterly call, we did see some early positive signs in the fragrance category in third quarter in response to our marketing strategy. We are carrying those marketing strategies into the fourth quarter, when fragrance is a key destination category, and we are very pleased with the early consumer response. We expect to continue to take market share in this category during what is expected to be a difficult holiday season. To summarize, we are pleased with our third quarter performance given the unexpected volatility in the environment, and because we are nimble, we have been able to better plan for this in fourth quarter. Our marketing and value propositions are enticing consumers to shop. Our stores look great and our teams are excited. We have reduced our new store expansion pace in 2009 as we assess the changing real estate landscape. We also have adjusted our real estate strategy for 2009 to allow us to take advantage of attractive opportunities that we believe will present themselves after the holidays. Quite simply, we are controlling those elements of the business where we have direct influence and are outperforming most other retail operators.  However, we are faced with great uncertainty as we enter into the holiday gift giving season, both from a general economic and consumer spending perspective and do not want to over promise and therefore have adjusted guidance accordingly. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Gregg to review the financials in more detail.
Gregg R. Bodnar:  Thank you, Lyn.  As Lyn mentioned, our third quarter results reflect solid double-digit sales growth, positive comp store sales and traffic increases, as well as continued expense leverage which enabled us to achieve a 20.4% increase in operating income and a 28.6% increase in adjusted earnings per share.  Beginning with a review of the income statement, net sales increased 22.4% to $254.8 million from $208.2 million in the third quarter last year. Sales growth was driven by the addition of 67 new stores in operation versus a year ago and a 2% increase in comp store sales. This gain was on top of a 6.7% increase in comp store sales last year, resulting in a twoyear comp store sales growth of 8.7%.  During the quarter we opened 21 new stores and remodeled two locations, ending the third quarter with 304 stores and expanding square footage by 28% from last year's third quarter. Our new store program continues to perform on model.  Gross profit dollars in the third quarter increased 16.7% to $79.5 million from the $68.1 million last year. Gross profit margin decreased 150 basis points to 31.2%, primarily driven by 100 basis points of deleverage in fixed store costs resulting from our expanded new store program, 30 basis points of expected impact related to the addition of our second distribution center, and 20 basis points of gross margin investment used to successfully drive positive customer traffic and comp store sales increases in this difficult economy. SG&A expenses were $65.2 million or 25.6% of net sales compared to $55.6 million or 26.7% of net sales in the prior year period. The 110 basis point improvement in SG&A was primarily driven by our ability to leverage our corporate infrastructure on a growing store base and appropriately manage expenses in this environment. We expect to continue to drive improvement in SG&A as a percentage of sales during the fourth quarter. Pre-opening expenses were $4.7 million or 1.8% of net sales compared to $4.5 million or 2.2% of net sales last year, reflecting the opening of 21 new stores and two remodels during the quarter as compared to 26 new stores and 7 remodels in the third quarter last year. This double-digit sales growth, combined with solid SG&A leverage, led to a 20.4% increase in operating income to $9.6 million or 3.8% of net sales from $8 million or 3.8% of net sale in the prior year period. Interest expense decreased to $1.1 million from $1.3 million last year, reflecting lower interest rates from the same period last year. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 40.9% compared to 36.9% in the prior year. The prior year period benefited from a cumulative true up of our blended state effective tax rate.  Net income for the quarter increased 19.3% to $5 million from $4.2 million last year.  On a GAAP basis, income per diluted share was $0.09 compared to $0.05 in the third quarter last year. On an adjusted basis, income per diluted share for the third quarter was $0.09 compared to $0.07 last year. Now turning to the balance sheet, merchandise inventories at the end of the quarter increased 22.5% to $268.9 million from $219.5 million at the end of the third quarter last year. Average inventory per store decreased 4.5% from the prior year quarter. This reduction was primarily due to the later flow of receipts this year, better using our supply chain with our second distribution center, and our continued focus on overall inventory management.  Excluding the effect of the supply chain leverage, average per store inventory would have been flat to the prior year while delivering a 2% increase in comp store sales.  The $49.5 million increase in inventory was due to the addition of 67 new stores opened in the last 12 months.  We are pleased with both the level and composition of inventories as we entered the fourth quarter.  As we continue to focus on managing working capital and driving strong financial performance, we delivered $29.5 million of operating cash flow during the first nine months of fiscal 2008.  Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $28.5 million. Regarding debt levels and the strength of our balance sheet, as of November 1, 2008 we had $62 million available on our credit facility and $138 million of borrowings outstanding. Our credit facility provides borrowing capacity up to $200 million and is committed through May of 2011 by three of the largest banks in the United States, including J.P. Morgan, Wachovia, and Bank of America. This credit facility, together with cash flow from our growing store base, provides us with the capital and liquidity to achieve our growth plans well into the future while maintaining a very strong balance sheet that is not highly leveraged. Now, regarding our outlook, given the sudden and unprecedented change in the economic environment in October and its impact on our third quarter results, we believe it is prudent to lower our fourth quarter expectations and provide guidance that represents a wider range of potential outcomes, especially given the uncertainty regarding consumer gift spending in this economy.  Although we are pleased with the recent start to the holiday season and the strategies that are driving those results, we recognize that the majority of the season remains in front of us in an incredibly volatile macroeconomic and, as a result, is very difficult to predict consumers ultimate level of gift giving.  Even with this wider range, our guidance represents a solid increase over last year's fourth quarter performance and our expectations for sales and earnings remain well ahead of many other retailers.  Naturally, during this time period we will be focused on prudent expense control and inventory management, as we have been all year.  Specifically for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, we expect net sales in the range of $354 million to $368 million compared to the fourth quarter fiscal 2007 of $309.3 million. Comp store sales are expected to be in the range of minus 2% to plus 2% compared to a 4.5% increase last year. Income per diluted share on an adjusted basis is estimated in the range of $0.24 to $0.28 compared to fourth quarter adjusted income per diluted share last year of $0.23. We have opened six of the seven new stores planned for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007, we opened 12 new stores and remodeled three existing locations. For the full year fiscal 2008 we now estimate net sales in the range of $1.1 billion to $1.11 billion as compared to our previous guidance range for net sales of $1.12 billion to $1.13 billion and versus net sales last year of $912.1 million.  Comp store sales are expected to increase by approximately 1.4% to 2.7%.  Income per diluted share is currently expected in the range of $0.47 to $0.51, which compares to our previous guidance range for income per diluted share in the range of $0.52 to $0.57 and fiscal 2007 income per diluted share of $0.43 after adjusting for the IPO. Our full year guidance excludes $0.01 per share severance costs for the previously announced management change in March of this year. As Lyn mentioned, we have opened 62 of our 63 planned new stores for this year, with our final store scheduled to open later this quarter. We have also completed the eight remodels in our 2008 remodel program.  Regarding capital expenditures, we now expect capital expenditures to approximate $110 million, which is below our previous expectations of $115 million to $120 million. Specifically, we have reduced the construction costs for our 2008 new store program by $7.5 million, which represents a 14% decrease in the capital component of a new store investment. We have continued to aggressively focus on reducing our total new store investment by leveraging the size of our program, particularly in this economy. We will continue to emphasize controlling costs, managing inventory, and ensuring we leverage our capital investments, particularly in new stores, to deliver strong financial returns. This focus on cash flow while we continue to increase our market share will leave us in a superior competitive and financial position when the economy stabilizes. As I've discussed in the past, we have a strong balance sheet position and operating cash flow from our existing store base. This, combined with our $200 million credit facility, leaves us well positioned to fund our future store growth. Our balance sheet is not highly leveraged, with debttoequity at 0.6 times our current seasonal peak debt levels, leaving us presently with $50 million of available borrowing capacity. As we end 2008, I expect our debt levels to approximate $120 million.  As we head into 2009, our real estate program will continue to be focused on high-quality sites, while we have the financial capability and are achieving targeted return levels, we believe it is prudent given the economy to plan to expand our square footage by 15% to 20% in 2009. With this planned square footage growth in 2009, our emphasis will be on managing an appropriate balance between operating cash flow and capital expenditures such that we will maintain a significant level of availability in our credit facility, therefore providing us with the ability to take advantage of attractive real estate opportunities that are expected to develop post holiday. As we look further into the future, the fundamentals of our business remain very strong and we continue to remain confident in our ability to achieve our long-term expansion goals as the economy stabilizes. And now I would like to turn the call back to Lyn to close.
Lyn P. Kirby: Thanks, Gregg. The strength in fundamentals of our business continue favorably in these unprecedented times and are evident in our solid results this quarter. Our value proposition, marketing strategies, compelling brands and inviting in-store experience are clear advantages in a tough economy, and we fully expect to maximize these strengths this holiday. We believe that this economic environment is the time to win market share, and we will continue to pursue this goal through maintaining our investments in our stores, brands, marketing and talent, always with a balanced eye towards return on investment.  We have a strong balance sheet and the financial flexibility to invest in market share strategies and now is the time to utilize these strengths to position us for greater growth when the economy stabilizes. While we have cautiously and prudently adjusted our full year expectations to allow for the uncertainty and impacts on consumer gift spending in this unprecedented and volatile economy, we remain confident in our business strategy and ability to deliver to our long-term growth targets as the economy stabilizes. Operator, we're now ready for some questions.
Operator:  Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Daniel Hofkin - William Blair.
Daniel Hofkin - William Blair:  I guess the first question on the gross margin. Was a little bit of the deleverage from the store program a function of the pace of comp sales relative to, let's say, prior quarters?  And secondly just, I guess, with regard to the pre-opening expense, I just wanted to understand a little bit better why that was up in absolute terms year-to-year given the lower store openings and remodels. And then secondly, I guess, just recognizing it's quite early at this point, any sense for what 2010 could look like from a store opening perspective?
Gregg R. Bodnar: Dan, we'll take those one at a time. In terms of the difference between our 3% to 5% range and the expected impact on store occupancy costs, it's probably about 10 to 15 basis points coming down to the [two comp].  And then with respect to 2010, are you referring to next year?
Daniel Hofkin - William Blair: I'm referring to, I guess, the fiscal year ended January '11, so one year out, yeah, recognizing it's very early. I'm just trying to - I think you guys have said in the past that it's you know, even previously that the 2010 openings could be impacted by retail center development.
Lyn P. Kirby: That's correct, Dan. So on the negative side is that the impact of the economy on real estate development; on the positive side is what we believe will happen even at the beginning of 2009 as there are retailers who go out of business and there are store closures and some have, as you know, already been announced. I think there is a chance that that will continue through 2009, which will continue to give us opportunities in 2010 to balance against the slower real estate development. So from where we sit right now, it is hard for us to predict exactly the size of the 2010 program, but I certainly would not expect it to be any smaller growth than what we are currently planning for 2009. And if the economy improves and stabilizes, then we have a chance to go back to the 20% to 25% targets.
Gregg R. Bodnar: And then, Dan, on your pre-opening question, pre-opening is up a little bit in absolute dollars given the number of stores that we opened. And when we talk about Q4 of 2008 as we did the last quarter, you'll find that it's a little bit of a shift between the two quarters just based on the timing of when the stores opened. So pre-opening in the fourth quarter will be down from preopening in the prior year.
Operator: Your next question comes from Neely Tamminga - Piper Jaffray.
Neely Tamminga - Piper Jaffray:  I have some philosophical questions for Lyn, but I want to just cover some housekeeping here. Gregg, just D&A at quarter end - I don't know if we caught that; I might have missed it in a rundown - and where you expect D&A to be at the end of the year as well as D&A as well as CapEx guidance as early as you can for - extra considering you're taking on store growth. 
Gregg R. Bodnar: Yes, Neely, for the full year I would still expect D&A to be about $52 million, which is consistent with what we've talked about in the past. And then for the quarter it was about $14 million.
Neely Tamminga - Piper Jaffray: Okay, and then CapEx for next year now that you're taking down store growth so much?
Gregg R. Bodnar: Let me describe it this way, since we haven't given any specifics on guidance for next year. If you go from the 25% square footage growth down to the 15% square footage growth, that's a reduction of about 31 stores, which would be about $34 million in CapEx.
Neely Tamminga - Piper Jaffray: And then just two philosophical questions here, Lyn. First, on the stores and the leases and the locations, I mean, I think when you guys were out there on the road and originally thinking you would be potentially kind of a 1,000 location-type concept and chain, how many of those 1,000, just sizing it up for us, a third, a half, etc., were you kind of expecting theoretical new center growth? Said another way, if what's happened in our economy has been so unprecedented, and it has been, how much of this might potentially affect the longer term growth opportunity for Ulta?
Lyn P. Kirby: You know, this is sort of just a reflection on what we have been doing the last couple of years. I would say in the 1,000 or the 700 or so to go, about 30% would be new centers.  And the key comment, does it slow us down, it really goes back a little bit to the response to Dan. You know, on the one hand we'll have slowdown in new centers, but for us on the positive, we really do believe that there will be some very attractive sites that we would not otherwise have been able to get into in existing centers that are going to come our way. So we see a tremendous silver lining in what is going to go on here in the economy.  And so you take those two factors together and I go back to my response to Dan - it's really very early for us to predict the size of the 2010 and out program, but at some point, when this economy does stabilize, we do anticipate that we will move back to our original growth targets and certainly don't see any need to diminish our original program of 1,000 doors. That still remains very relevant and, in some ways, as I say, a great opportunity for us to get back into centers that we have not been able to get into.
Neely Tamminga - Piper Jaffray: And I think, you know, given that I'm an analyst for 12 years and I'm asking a leading question I'll just be open and honest about that - I think you're making exactly the point, right? That the brand - because we're unprecedented and because you have this opportunity, would you expect that you have some unprecedented conversations with future brand growth, particularly on the prestige side to continue to further open up those opportunities for market share gain?
Lyn P. Kirby: We continue to have the conversations. I do have a smile on my face. Thank you for being transparent. We continue to have conversations with the brands that we would love to attract and, as we have always said, the more we continue with our store openings, the more important we are as an alternative channel of distribution for the brands. And, like you, we remain hopeful that that could be a silver lining in this economy. But there is no change from what we have always disclosed on that, which is that we are still just in conversations.
Operator: Your next question comes from Liz Dunn - Thomas Weisel Partners.
Liz Dunn - Thomas Weisel Partners:  I guess my first question relates to your comments about the comp expectations for fourth quarter. When you say if spending trends remain as they are currently, does that suggest your November results were sort of in line with what you saw in the third quarter?
Lyn P. Kirby: My answer to you is that the first few weeks of this quarter are exactly where we had anticipated; Thanksgiving a little better than we had anticipated. But the trends that we're running are in line with the guidance - let me not say the guidance - were in line with the performance that we delivered in third quarter. So with the current trends that we have, we would expect to deliver the same performance as third quarter, so a 2 to 2.5.  What's unknown - and I do what to make sure I stress this - we really cannot predict the impact of the macro environment on the consumer headset going into fourth quarter, and particularly around gift giving, we think it's very volatile and we just, like everybody else, we don't have clear enough eyes in here to say that our comps would stay zero to 2, for example. We really felt the need to broaden the range because we just do not have eyes into it.
Liz Dunn - Thomas Weisel Partners: Are you doing some specific things to be more giftable and more compelling from a value proposition?
Lyn P. Kirby: As we have in third quarter, we continue with those strategies. We do continue to invest some of our own margin into our private label business. We continue to partner with our vendors to invest surgically in pricing that can drive traffic into the stores, so we certainly do that. You heard me touch on an exciting new product program that we have in fourth quarter, so we do have some really good newness coming in. And we continue, although we have not spent more advertising rates in this quarter than last year, we have certainly started from scratch, as we always do with every quarter to learn from last year, and we believe that we have a more exciting marketing program that fourth quarter last year and believe that we are very solidly positioned for this holiday season as long as the consumer is spending at a normal and expected rate.
Liz Dunn - Thomas Weisel Partners: Now did I understand, Gregg, you correctly when you said you'd have $120 million in availability under your bank line at the end 2008? And is there any help you can provide on what you might need to draw on that line in 2009?
Gregg R. Bodnar: The debt levels at the end of this year we're expecting to be $120 million, okay, debt levels at the end of this year. And then, as we look into next year, part of our approach in planning in this environment and being cash flow focused and also leaving some dry powder available for real estate opportunities is to try and balance the capital investment with our cash flow needs so that we maintain a significant level of availability in our credit line. I wouldn't say exactly the levels that they were this year; probably slightly below that. 
Liz Dunn - Thomas Weisel Partners: And then just my final question relates to I think since the IPO you've been able to ratchet down your pre-opening costs and it sounds like your construction costs now, with today's reduction in CapEx. Can you just update us on what you see as the four wall cash contribution and the cash payback term or, if not, just update us on construction costs per store and pre-opening costs per store?
Gregg R. Bodnar: Let me take all three of those each individually, Liz. I'll take the last one first - or the second to the last one first.  If you look at our store model, right now there's a three and a half year cash-on-cash return. Based on some of the improvements that we've made in lowering construction costs that are meaningful coming out of this particular year, it's about $120,000 a store, which is about 7% of our total store investment of $1.6 million, and it has the impact of reducing that payback period from about three and a half years to just over three years, so about three and a quarter years. So a first nice step, as we've been focused on lowering that payback and improving the financial returns.  And then as it relates to pre-opening costs, the impact of what we've done this year is pretty modest relative to the impact of the construction costs. So pre-opening costs in our store model was about $205,000, and that's come down about $5,000 on average.
Operator: Your next question comes from Joe Altobello - Oppenheimer & Co.
Joe Altobello - Oppenheimer & Co.:  In terms of the comp in the quarter, could you give us a sense of how sales progressed throughout the quarter? Did they get materially worse in October?
Lyn P. Kirby: Joe, we have not commented on individual monthly performance at all and so we're not going to respond to that question specifically.  However, you did hear me say that we were able to be very nimble as we watched, even from the beginning of third quarter, before the major crisis that hit in October. We could see some softening coming out of second quarter, so we were nimble enough to be able to put in some advertising and some very modest margin investment at the very back end, and we were very pleased with the response to that strategy. And that is a strategy that we have continued into the first weeks of this quarter, and again, very pleased with what we're seeing at the beginning of the quarter.  So not a specific answer, but hopefully it gives you a flavor.
Joe Altobello - Oppenheimer & Co.: Were comps positive in all three months? Can I ask that?
Lyn P. Kirby: You can ask, but we're not going to answer.
Gregg R. Bodnar: We don't want to slide into the territory of being a monthly reporter, so we're just not going to do it. And also keep in mind the other strategic reason why is, you know, as Lyn has said in the past, we take a fresh look at the marketing strategy and its comparability to the prior year every quarter as they approach the quarter and then adjust during the quarter as necessary, so therefore the comparability may not make as much sense on a monthly basis.
Joe Altobello - Oppenheimer & Co.: And then in terms of slowing down the door growth or the square footage growth, you guys did talk about this a lot, but I was just curious, in terms of the mind-set or the thought process behind that, I mean, you've obviously got two competing goals here - one is to be prudent in their environment, the other is to gain market share and go after market share when there is share to be gained. And so how much internal debate was there in terms of slowing down the square footage growth for '09?
Lyn P. Kirby: Let me take a first pass, and then Gregg can add. There was actually no internal debate. As we started to see some co-tenants - and really, it did become fairly precipitous in October; we began to see more co-tenants drop out of our centers and, as a consequence, more slowdown of new centers - so we certainly do not want to be in centers where the quality of the co-tenant had changed, so they were very, very easy decisions for us. We obviously were also very cognizant of some of the slower states around the United States in terms of their economies, so we took a very close look at those as well. So the desire to pare the program back is consistent with what we have always said, which is we are never chasing a magical number of 20% to 25%. We were always focused on delivering quality real estate and if that started to change, we would appropriately change. So the first half was, as we began to see the change, it was quite easy decisions. And it's not that we couldn't have made money in many of these centers over time, but we would not have optimized the short-term return on the cash. In conjunction with that, we certainly began to see news breaking on closures that we can expect after the holiday season, and we think that that may actually accelerate as well. And we wanted to, as Gregg just mentioned, we just wanted to keep our powder dry so that we can be very opportunistic with those sites as they become available to us. So the two things were actually separate decisions. One was only quality and the changes caused us to want to pull back, but it gives us a simultaneous advantage of being able to be very flexible as these opportunities break. And we think they will certainly break post-holiday, but we'll probably continue through the year as well.
Gregg R. Bodnar: And Joe, we believe this is the right balance. I mean, we're continuing to gain market share in our comp doors as well as our square footage growth, and that opportunity, particularly in this environment, is going to continue to exist whether we're growing at 15% to 20% or 20% to 25%.  We have a very rigorous evaluation process on our real estate; it takes all the emotion out of the decision-making progress. And when that criteria tells us that the centers that we're focused on the quality and the returns are not there, then we change the targets.
Joe Altobello - Oppenheimer & Co.: And then lastly, if I could - and I apologize if I missed this - it sounded like you said earlier that store traffic was up. Was average ticket up in the quarter as well?
Lyn P. Kirby: No, the average ticket was - our customer count growth outpaced the average comp, so we saw a slight downtick in average ticket. But the traffic was very solid and so those two things balanced out.  And that was very much in response to the question you asked at the very beginning, where we didn't give you a specific monthly response, but I said we invested some margin in advertising in the back part of the quarter. It was done deliberately to drive traffic. We had anticipated that to be a very difficult time period, not just because of the economic trends but it was preelection and we anticipated quite a bit of concern and caution on the consumer's part. So we specifically drove traffic during that period of time and were delighted with the response that we got.  We drove traffic both in terms of our existing loyalty members, who we got additional shopping from, as well as really good response to our investments in our newspaper inserts, which attracted new customers to the brand.
Operator: Your next question comes from Brian Tunick - J.P. Morgan.
Brian Tunick - J.P. Morgan:  So I guess I've got one for you, Lyn, and then two for Gregg. So, Lyn, you talked about market share and a lot of your co-tenants potentially closing their doors, but what do you see happening in your own drugstore/salon area? Are you seeing salons closing? Have you seen this part of the cycle before? Are you seeing drugstores closing? Maybe just talk a little about maybe capacity coming out of your own sector for a second, and then I'll ask Gregg the other two.
Lyn P. Kirby: Okay. Well, first let me just make the statement that, although they are partial in our segment, we certainly see ourselves as much more than just a drugstore or a salon, so I do want to just make that comment to you. But relative to salon, we are not seeing any significant closing in chain salon. Certainly, small independents, I think that we're not specifically tracking them, Brian, but I am sure post holiday season that we may see some businesses close down there, and that may give us some positive traction. We are, just on the salon business in general, we are seeing some slowdown in our salon business. We remain positive comps in third quarter, but certainly some slowing down there. Not a complete surprise given some of the shifts in this economy that happened particularly in the middle of October. As it relates to the drugstore business - and our drugstore, our mass businesses - our mass businesses continue to do very well. We're not seeing a shift - it's not just there has been a slight downtick in average ticket, as you heard me say to Joe - we are seeing any significant mix shift in the business. The customers who buy prestige continue to buy prestige; the customers who buy mass continue to buy mass from us. And we're not seeing any significant shift there, just an overall slight downward tick on purchasing. And as it relates to the competition in the mass sector, what we primarily see is not significant price changes from our competition there, but there is certainly increased frequency of promotion and we have our eye very closely on that and continue to compete in the manner that we always do, with our own advertising, ad pages, if we feel that's appropriate, so that we can compete with great frequency with what we're seeing in the drugstores. So Brian, did that give you enough flavor? 
Brian Tunick - J.P. Morgan: Yes, I was just curious if you were seeing any store closing anywhere else. And obviously there will be some department store closings, which obviously could help you as well.
Lyn P. Kirby: We remain ever hopeful on that Brian, not so much to wish our department store competitors ill so much as, you know, we continue to hope that this economy will provide us some opportunities with some of those department store brands.
Brian Tunick - J.P. Morgan: And so, Gregg, I guess for you, two questions. Number one, so now that you've brought down new store growth, can we also expect your SG&A leverage point to come down? So in other words, if comps are flat somehow next year, can SG&A actually grow slower than sales? And then my second question, Gregg, is that I guess 50 some odd stores are going to enter the comp base, I think, here in the fourth quarter, and how are you thinking about those stores relative to your comp guidance? Do you now expect those stores to come into the comp base maybe closer to the chain average versus several points above?
Gregg R. Bodnar: Two things, Brian. As we look into next year - and you can kind of look and see what kind of SG&A leverage we get coming out of this year - but as we look into next year, I would expect somewhere around a 2% comp before we give specific guidance for next year, that we're going to require probably somewhere around a 2% comp to start to leverage SG&A going into next year.
Brian Tunick - J.P. Morgan: And how about the new stores entering the comp base this quarter?
Gregg R. Bodnar: Yes, if you look at the change from third quarter this year to last year and then fourth quarter this year to last year, you actually have an increase of about 13 stores growing into the comp base from third quarter to fourth quarter, and that will provide a modest benefit to comps in the fourth quarter.
Brian Tunick - J.P. Morgan: And just if I can, are you guys going to announce the holiday comps like you did last year?
Gregg R. Bodnar: We plan to, yes.
Lyn P. Kirby: That's our intention.
Operator: Your next question comes from Jason Gere - Wachovia Capital Markets, LLC.
Jason Gere - Wachovia Capital Markets, LLC:  Just one housekeeping-type question - with the 15% to 20% square footage growth for next year, can you kind of talk about how many will affect the new Phoenix facility versus the Chicago facility? And then on that same note, maybe new markets versus existing markets?
Gregg R. Bodnar: Let me take those one at a time, Jason.  In terms of what's going to affect Phoenix, I think it's going to be fairly balanced between Phoenix and Romeoville based on what we see in the program so far this year headed into next year. And then, as it relates to - I'm sorry, Jason, what was your second question?
Jason Gere - Wachovia Capital Markets, LLC: New markets versus existing markets.
Lyn P. Kirby: Jason, the current approved sites are about a 50-50, pretty much in line with what we had done last year, but obviously we are going to wait and see what happens with store closings. And they could go both new or existing although, if you ask me to give you a best guess perspective, my guess is they'll probably lean a little more towards existing markets because much of our new markets - as you know, we have opened up some great opportunities in smaller metro - smaller markets, not necessarily metro - and we think that the closures will happen more in the larger metro markets, which would be our existing markets.
Jason Gere - Wachovia Capital Markets, LLC: Next question, I guess, just going back on the SG&A, and I guess you're saying that you need a 2% comp to leverage SG&A. One of the things you've been talking about is just cost control, and I was just wondering, you know, with the slowdown in the economy, is it fair to assume that, you know, has there been any change inside the store with a lot of your full-time personnel? I mean, there's a good mix of part-time and full-time, but you do have a lot of layers of management in the store, so I was just wondering if there's any type of thought there and if, you know, you're able to kind of manage those schedules a little bit better because of the slower traffic you're seeing.
Lyn P. Kirby: Jason, what we have done - well, first of all, again, our traffic isn't slower. We had positive customer count in third quarter and continue with third quarter trends at this point in time in fourth quarter.  In terms of the store base, we've actually taken a deliberate position over the last nine months to move our store base from full-time to more part-time, and the reason we did it was so that we could leverage our work force deployment IT program. What we found is that, with the extent of full-time personnel that we had, we could not get as much flexibility as we needed, and so we shifted more to part-time. We do not anticipate at this point in time any significant change in our full-time personnel or the structure of our stores. We believe we are well resourced in our stores, at that point in time, with this one change that I described to you that we put into play earlier in the year.
Jason Gere - Wachovia Capital Markets, LLC: And I guess the last question, you talked about the 20 basis points of investment of your own margin to sharpen your value during this quarter, can you talk maybe a little bit about the conversations you're having with some of your vendors right now? I mean, I think in the past you guys have received some dollars from them in order to kind of support some of the marketing initiatives you've done, and I was just wondering if you could talk maybe a little bit more about some of those initiatives and how receptive they've been to supporting their own brands in your store at this point.
Lyn P. Kirby: They continue to be very responsive, Jason, simply because they get a good return on the investment. We are very disciplined in tracking the responsiveness to the investments we make, so they do continue to want to partner with us for the short term. But at least as important as that is the long-term partnership that they know they have with us. They have very few partners who will still grow with the square footage growth that we will continue to do in this sort of climate. We do talk to them not just about the individual tactical program with them, but we do talk to them about the margin investment on our own part that we make in our programs, particularly in some of our marketing strategies and our gift repurchase strategies that drive traffic into the total brand that they, of course, benefit from as well. So we talk tactically, we talk strategically with them, and, although I certainly am not going to say they have an open checkbook - we would neither expect that, nor would they have that but we continue to have very good partnerships and support where we can prove that this makes sense to the brand.
Operator: Your next question comes from David Cumberland - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.
David Cumberland - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.:  Can you give some examples of what you're doing to manage the expense structure in response to the environment?
Gregg R. Bodnar: Yes, sure. And just with regard to, you know, as we head into next year, even in advance of, you know, we certainly haven't given specific guidance for next year. If you look at the guidance that we've given for the fourth quarter, we're going to continue to show SG&A leverage even below that 2% level. And as we head into the 2009 time period and continue to evaluate the strength of the economy, the weakness of the economy, we will continue, David, to manage expenses so that we get the maximum amount of leverage and also focus on continuing the long-term growth of the business as well. We've continued to do a couple of things, one, making sure that we are leveraging the technology investments internally in the business. We have continued to focus on making sure that we have - and Lyn was referring to this on the last question - we continue to make sure that we leverage all of our four wall store operating costs to make sure that we utilize the tools that we have today to makes sure that we are lining up hours with guest count and moving very quickly when we see any fluctuations in that and planning for those ebbs and flows in guest count as well.  And then just various other means that we're taking to leverage our growth, which is similar to what we did on reducing construction costs for our new store program. You know, we are working with all of our vendor partners - not just our merchandising vendor partners, but all of our supply partners as well - to make sure that we're getting maximum leverage on the growth that we're experiencing here, as we should as a high growth retailer.
David Cumberland - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: And my other question is on the 15% to 20% store growth planned for next year. Would real estate opportunities that you've talked about related to closings by others potentially add to that range or would those opportunities mainly translate to some of your 2010 openings?
Lyn P. Kirby: There's two parts to that. The reason for a 15% to 20% range - and that range allows for some of what you've just asked, potentially happening in 2009 - but the reality is as the sites do become available post-Christmas, very few will probably be able to fit into the 2009 timeline. There's a possibility some could get into a late third quarter, perhaps into January, but by and large we expect the majority of those opportunities flowing probably more into 2010.
Operator: Your last question comes from Neely Tamminga - Piper Jaffray.
Neely Tamminga - Piper Jaffray: I just had one follow up question. Gregg, how should we be thinking about the store openings next year? Logically, analysts usually approach that as going more in the first half versus the second half, but I just wanted to double check - is that how you guys are thinking about it?
Gregg R. Bodnar: You know, we've actually done - and it's been sort of part and parcel, Neely, the theme that we've talked about this year, too, as well - you know, as part of trying to leverage the infrastructure, we will shift more store openings into the back half of the year next year, unlike what we did this year. So this year about 55% of our openings were in the first half of the year and about 45% in the second half of the year. Next year I would expect the relationship to be closer to 40% in the first half of the year and 60% in the second half of the year. 
Operator: Thank you. ladies and gentlemen, at this time there are no further questions. I would like to turn the floor back to management for closing remarks.
Lyn P. Kirby: Yes, a couple of things. Again, as we sign off here, let me again just say that we remain very confident about our long-term prospects. We, of course, as we have described to you, for the reasons we gave you, we remain cautious about the gift giving period that we are confronted with in the very immediate short term, but remain confident in the long-term growth opportunities. So let me thank everyone for joining us today. We hope you have a happy and healthy holiday and New Year, and we certainly look forward to speaking to you in 2009. Thank you very much, everyone.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.

===== 2008 Q2  (2008-09-04 17:00:00) =====
Executives: Allison C. Malkin - Senior Managing Director, Integrated Corporate Relations Lyn P. Kirby - President and Chief Executive Officer Gregg R. Bodnar - Chief Financial Officer

Operator: Greetings and welcome to the Ulta Salon, Cosmetics & Fragrance Incorporated Second Quarter 2008 Results Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. (Operator Instructions). As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Allison Malkin of Integrated Corporate Relations. Thank you, Ms. Malkin. You may begin.
Allison C. Malkin - Senior Managing Director, Integrated Corporate Relations: Thank you. Good afternoon. Before we get started, I’d like to remind you of the company’s Safe Harbor language, which I’m sure you’re all familiar with. The statements contained in this conference call which are not historical facts may be deemed to constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual future results may differ materially from those projected in such statements due to a number of risks and uncertainties, all of which are described in the company’s filings with the SEC. With respect to each reference we make on this call to adjusted net income per diluted share as a result of the October 2007 IPO, a reconciliation of net income per share on a GAAP basis to adjusted net income per share has been provided in Exhibit 4 of our earnings release, which is available on our website and has been filed with the SEC on Form 8-K. And now, I’d like to turn the call over to Ulta’s President and CEO, Lyn Kirby.
Lyn P. Kirby - President and Chief Executive Officer: Thank you, Allison. Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us to discuss our second quarter fiscal 2008 results. On the call with me today is our Chief Financial Officer, Gregg Bodnar and following my opening remarks, Gregg will review our financial highlights and then I will provide closing comments and turn the call over to the operator, so that we can answer the questions you have for us today. We are pleased with the second quarter performance that we are announcing today. We delivered a 3.7% comp increase and earnings 1 penny above guidance. We believe these results in a difficult economy reflect the ongoing strength of our business model to provide women with an approachable beauty store experience that combines great value while satisfying all her beauty needs. Equally important, we continue to execute on our core strategies, flexing our unique marketing strategy to drive traffic, expanding our diversified portfolio of 500 plus brands across the Prestige and mass categories, executing balanced new store growth and effectively operating our store base and support infrastructure. The highlights for the quarter included, net sales of $249.1 million, reflecting increase of 24.3% from last year. Our comparable store sales increase of 3.7%, operating income growth of 46.2% from last year’s levels and adjusted income per diluted share of $0.06, which included incremental cost of $0.01 per share related to pre-opening expense. This represents a 50% increase from last year’s second quarter adjusted income per diluted share of $0.04. While we are proud of our accomplishments this quarter, we would have expected stronger performance in a more robust economy. However, the solid sales growth in spite of the economy continues to demonstrate that Ulta is increasingly becoming preferred destination for beauty. We are not dependent on any one brand for our growth and have been successful by proactively monitoring trends and responding with the programs that maximize brands to strong performance, to offset any brands with soft performance. Our consistent results, which includes 34 consecutive quarters of positive comp sales growth further validates the power of having a diversified offering with over 500 brands across color, skin, fragrance, hair and styling tool and price points that fit any size wallet from Prestige to mass. The 3.7% comp increase was driven equally by traffic and average transaction growth. We achieved balanced sales with contributions from both new and existing brands, with Prestige Color and Skincare again leading the way in driving average ticket increases. We have continued to leverage the appeal of our consumer experience, our new products, our value proposition and use of our unique marketing strategy to deliver increases in customer traffic. Our comp sales performance was achieved without additional investment in margin, advertising or inventory. Inventory was well managed during the quarter, resulting in a flat average store inventory level compared to last year, while delivering a 3.7% comp stores sales increase. We remain pleased with the performance of many of our longstanding brands as well as new brands including Pureology and Lorac, which were introduced during the first quarter this year and also performance from new fragrances launched in the second quarter, such as Burberry The Beat, Vera Wang, Flower Princess and Ed Hardy. Regarding our store expansion, we opened a record number of second quarter stores with 18 new stores and 5 remodels completed in the quarter. We continue to be pleased with the performance of our new stores, which remain on track with our new store model. Our openings were also well balanced, 8 were in major metro markets, 2 in medium sized markets and 8 opened in smaller markets. We entered 10 new markets and ended the quarter with 283 stores in 34 states, including our first stores in Utah and Rhode Island. Our store expansion is integral to our strategy and importantly our new stores are delivering to our expectations despite the difficult economy. We remain on track to attain our goal of 63 new stores and 8 remodels for the year. Despite a difficult economy, we remain committed to our square footage growth given the strength of our new stores, our strong pipeline for new sites and because this will continue to position us as an attractive alternative channel to new brands. So far in the third quarter, we have opened an additional 10 new stores and executed 2 remodels, including the opening of our first store in the state of Missouri. We are pleased with the early trends on this group of stores. Our new distribution center in Phoenix, Arizona continues to operate as expected. We are currently distributing to 113 stores from this location. Regarding e-commerce, we continue to enhance the consumer experience of our site. During the quarter, we added 4,000 products and 3 new micro-sites to the Ulta.com site, Murad, H2O Plus and Lorac. We believe we are well positioned to optimize this site during the holiday season. As we begin the second half of the year, we believe the economy will continue to be challenging. However, we expect the continued execution of our strategy will leave us well positioned to deliver to our growth targets. We believe the key drivers that drove our first half results will continue to deliver results in the second half of 2008. Specifically, the introduction of new brands launched in the first half of the year combined with our prospect to introduce additional new brands in the second half of the year has us well positioned to deliver newness and excitement to our customers. In that regard, we plan to launch the Napoleon Perdis Signature cosmetics brand chain wide before the end of third quarter. For those of you not familiar with Napoleon, Napoleon is a Hollywood based makeup artist generating a lot of buzz in the beauty industry. He will be the star of a new reality show called ‘get your face on’ debuting on the TLC Network this fall and we expect this brand to be an exciting addition to our Prestige portfolio. While we do not normally comment on tests, we are delighted by the performance of [Benefit], which we have been testing with the boutique strategy in a small number of doors. We plan to rollout Benefit to our website in the third quarter and select additional doors in 2009. In addition, we have exciting new fragrance launches such as Estee Lauder Sensuous, Ralph Lauren Notorious, Jessica Simpson Fancy and Viva La Juicy. We will continue the execution of our proven marketing strategy. This has delivered solid increases in customer traffic in the first half of the year. As we have discussed in the past, we have several proven elements of our marketing strategy to motivate both new customers and our existing six million loyalty club customers to come in, browse and purchase. We expect our solid execution in new and existing stores and in the support structure will help us manage costs and will provide continued SG&A leverage. And finally, we continue to explore new opportunities in our efforts to expand our reach. To this end, in October we will open an 18,000 square foot store on State Street and Chicago. It is our first urban location and a vertical format on four levels. We do not have plans for additional urban sites this year. However, we are excited about the increased awareness that the State Street store will bring us both with consumers and existing and potential brands. With that, I would like to turn the call over to Gregg to review the financials in more detail.
Gregg R. Bodnar - Chief Financial Officer: Thanks, Lyn. As Lyn mentioned, our second quarter results reflected solid double-digit sales growth and better than expected expense leverage, which enabled us to achieve earnings a penny above our guidance range. Beginning with the review of the income statement, net sales increased 24.3% to 249.1 million from 200.4 million in the second quarter last year. Sales growth was driven by the addition of 72 new stores in operation versus a year ago and a 3.7% increase in comp store sales. This gain in comp store sales was on top of a 6.5% increase last year, resulting in a two-year increasing comp store sales of 10.2%. During the quarter we opened 18 new stores and remodeled 5 locations, ending the quarter with 283 stores and expanding square footage by 34.6% from last year’s second quarter. Gross profit dollars in second quarter increased 23.9% to 73.1 million from 59 million last year. Gross profit margin remains unchanged at 29.4% driven by expected deleverage and occupancy costs resulting from new store growth, offset by a one-time benefit from merchandise purchases at favorable terms to fill the new DC. Excluding this one-time benefit, our merchandising margin was flat to last year for the quarter. We continue to be pleased with the operation of our second distribution center in Phoenix, Arizona, which opened in the first quarter of this year. As many of you are aware, we have staged the increase in stores served by this facility to ensure a smooth transition. We are currently servicing 113 stores from this facility and expect to peak at approximately 120 stores before the fourth quarter this year. SG&A expenses were 61.9 million or 24.8% of net sales compared to the 51.2 million or 25.5% of net sales in the prior year period. This 70 basis point improvement in SG&A rate was primarily driven by our ability to leverage our corporate infrastructure on a growing store base. We would expect to show similar improvement in SG&A as a percentage of sales during the second half of the year. Preopening expenses were 4.1 million or 1.6% of net sales, compared to 2.9 million or 1.5% of net sales last year, reflecting the opening of 18 new stores and five remodels during the quarter as compared to eight new stores and four remodels in the second quarter last year. We continue to focus on improving the efficiency of preopening costs as we leverage the size of our store opening program this year. Double digits top-line growth coupled with solid SG&A leverage led to a 46.2% increase in operating income to 7.2 million or 2.9% of net sales from 4.9 million or 2.5% of net sales in the prior year. These results included incremental preopening expenses of 1.2 million driven by the larger new store program this year. Interest expense decreased to 1 million from 1.2 million last year, reflecting lower interest rates from the same period last year. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 40.4% compared to 41.5% in the prior year period. Net income for the quarter increased 67.2% to 3.7 million from 2.2 million last year. On a GAAP basis, income per diluted share was $0.06 versus a loss per share of $0.23 in the second quarter last year. On an adjusted basis, income per diluted share for the quarter was $0.06 compared to adjusted income per diluted share of $0.04 in the second quarter last year. For the six-month period, net sales rose 23.8% to 488.4 million, with comp store sales increasing 3.8% on top of the 7.8% comp store sales gain last year. Operating income was 15.3 million or 3.1% of net sales, as compared to 14.8 million or 3.8% of net sales last year. These operating results included the impact of 3.2 million of incremental preopening expenses on this expanded store opening program. Adjusted income per diluted share for the six months was $0.13, inclusive of $0.01 of severance costs, and compares to adjusted income per diluted share of $0.13 in the six months of last year. Merchandise inventories at the end of the quarter increased 33% to 197 million, compared to 148.6 million at the end of the second quarter last year. Average inventory per store was flat to last year while delivering a 3.7% comp store sales increase during the second quarter. The 48.4 million increasing in inventory was due to the addition of 72 new stores opened in the last 12 months. We are pleased with both the level and composition of inventories as we enter the third quarter. Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled 37.5 million. On August 15th, we increased the availability under our asset-based credit facility by executing the $50 million accordion feature, resulting in total borrowing capacity of 200 million. As we’ve previously communicated, accessing the $50 million accordion feature was planned and is consistent with our long-term growth strategy. We received this commitment from our existing bank group under the same terms and conditions as the existing facility. This $200 million capacity, together with the cash flow from our growing store base, provides us with the capital liquidity to achieve our growth plans well into the future, while maintaining a very strong balance sheet that is not highly leveraged. Now, regarding our outlook, we are introducing guidance for the third quarter and reiterating our full year fiscal 2008 earnings guidance based on current business trends and the retail and economic environment. For the third quarter fiscal 2008, we expect net sales in the range of 258 million to 262 million, compared to actual third quarter fiscal 2000 sales of 208.2 million. Comp store sales are expected to increase in the range of 3 to 5% compared to a 6.7% increase last year. Income per diluted share on an adjusted basis is estimated in the range of 8 to $0.10 compared to actual third quarter fiscal 2007 adjusted income per diluted share of $0.08. We plan to open 21 new stores and remodel two stores during the third quarter of fiscal 2008. In the third quarter of fiscal 2007, we opened 26 new stores and remodeled seven. This reduction in third quarter openings is a result of our planned increase in openings in both the first and second quarter as we continue to focus on a balanced quarterly new store opening program. For the full year fiscal 2008, we estimate net sales in the range of 1.12 billion to 1.13 billion, as compared to 912.1 million in fiscal 2007. Comp store sales are expected to increase by 3 to 5%. Income per diluted share is forecasted in the range of 52 to $0.57. Our full year guidance does not include $0.01 per share of severance cost for the previously announced management change in March this year. We remain on track to open 63 new stores and remodel eight stores in fiscal 2008. Capital expenditures continue to be projected in the range of 115 to 120 million. As a reminder, our long-term annual growth targets, which are unchanged, include comp store sales increases in the range of 3 to 5%, square footage expansion in the range of 20 to 25%, and net income growth in the range of 25 to 30%. And now I’d like to turn the call back over to Lyn.
Lyn P. Kirby - President and Chief Executive Officer: Thanks, Gregg. In summary, we are pleased with our second quarter and first half fiscal 2008 performance despite a difficult economy. We remain confident in our ability to continue our positive performance during the balance of the year. We have a proven business model. And this, combined with our passion to deliver a great customer experience, has us poised to deliver our annual goal. We are equally confident in attaining our long-term goal of reaching 1,000 stores. With that, I would like to turn the call back over to the operator to begin the question-and-answer portion of the call.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Mr. Brian Tunick with JP Morgan. Please proceed with your question.
Brian Tunick: Congrats. Two for Gregg and then I guess one for Lyn here. Maybe Gregg if you can give us a little more color here on what line items maybe gave you better than expected expense leverage and then may be you could talk about comp performance at the mature stores to remodel the refreshes either in the quarter or for the first half of the year and then maybe Lyn talk a little about the Bare essential sampling program and sort of what’s happening with them versus what they told us last month about slowdown in their business and if you can comment?
Gregg Bodnar: Sure Brian. We’ll take those about in that same order. In terms of the (inaudible) expect expense leverage as you can see our SG&A rate went down 70 basis points that was primarily better management of corporate expenses and the sales volume we delivered for the quarter. And then we also continued to achieve better than expected leverage in pre-opening expenses. And a lot of this is coming from just our management, the training programs in the transition of new managers from existing stores and coming in from the new marketplace, so getting a little bit better conversion of (inaudible) the new stores. And then, we also continue to better manage our balance sheet. Inventory levels were flat with the prior year. We also were successful in negotiating interest rate for expanding credit facilities, that were unchanged from last year and that continues to give us better operating leverage in totality. As far as comp performance in remodel stores, we continue to see mid single-digit comp performance which is in line with our expectations and that’s in the first 12 months of growth and we’ve been seeing that over the last 6 to 12 months. And then, with respect to the very older stores, as we typically characterize stores that are 8 years older, those stores continue to perform in the -- approximately flat comp performance range. I think that got all of your questions, Brian?
Brian Tunick: Yeah, yeah just around and then just for Lyn on the Bare.
Lynelle Kirby: On Bare, as you know we won’t comment specifically on the performance of the individual brand, but relative to the strategies that you spoke to, Brian, we are right in the midst of a first phase of the sample strategy that Bare has launched nation wide. We are distributing samples of their products as we speak right now. And we hope to see the response in terms of full size purchase in the weeks and next couple of months ahead in the back part of third quarter. We do have two unique opportunities. Unique to also that we are also developing and will be proposing to our consumers later in the quarter. One is a unique trial kit, also which is a $15 trial kit on their products and other is a (inaudible) kit for a $30 price point which has a $60 value. So, all these efforts, I guess was continuing to increase brand awareness and trial of the brand amongst the many customers that we still have or yet to try Bare essentials.
Brian Tunick: Okay. Thanks. I will get back in the queue.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Liz Dunn with Thomas Weisel Partners. Please proceed with your question.
Liz Dunn: Hi, good afternoon. Congratulations on a good quarter in a difficult environment. Can you discuss any regional differences that you are seeing in trend and any differences in sort of types of stores, new markets versus sort of emerging markets. I also wanted to know if you could give us any sense of how much traffic is up and then I know you don’t provide specifics, but some color on category performance Prestige versus mass et cetera, what really was driving the comp?
Lynelle Kirby: Yeah, let’s take them one at a time, Liz. First of all, in terms of the traffic, it’s very balanced between average ticket and traffic. So the comp growth came from both of those areas. And Gregg, do you want to take the second question in terms of the real estate?
Gregg Bodnar: Yes, Liz in terms of new versus emerging markets, we haven’t seen a significant difference between new versus emerging markets, as we expect them to perform for some model, certainly as we go into a new market, it has a little bit different ramp and that still control our store model versus emerging market. But, no the new emerging markets continue to perform to our expectation. And then, in terms of regional differences, as we’ve said in the past, we’ve seen a little bit of softness, it’s not material in Southern California and Florida. And we haven’t seen any significant accretion or deterioration of that.
Liz Dunn: So, it would be safe to say that all regions are comping positively?
Gregg Bodnar: Yeah.
Lynelle Kirby: And relative to new stores in those regions, we opened two stores in Florida in second quarter we have one in third quarter and the performance – and the second quarter stores was very good and we get to see (inaudible) the third quarter one?
Liz Dunn: Okay, and then just the category performance?
Lynelle Kirby: Category performance, there was really no change, Liz from what we have said. We continue to see good growth from Prestige color and skin, so that continues. The only very small change and it’s a very only trend yet, so nothing to take to the bank at this stage. But we are seeing a slight uptick in our fragrance business that we are pleased with. It reflects both the newness in the category, as well as, some exciting merchandizing that we have – bring to our program for customers here also around to purchase activity. So, that’s the only slight uptick that we’ve seen at this point.
Liz Dunn: Okay. And then, just a follow-up to Brian’s question on Bare, I am sorry if I missed it, my phone was ringing just as you were answering, but when you will be getting the new Bare kits that I think support with that advertising yesterday as being the only one in the country to have?
Lynelle Kirby: Our Bare kit comes in later in this quarter. I don’t have the exact day in front of me, but it is towards late October, Liz.
Liz Dunn: Okay, thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Mr. David Cumberland with Robert W. Baird. Please proceed with your question.
David Cumberland: Thanks, good afternoon. Lyn you noted several fragrance additions in Q2 and then second half. Is this is a faster phase as new product launches for you in that category and how important is newness in fragrance?
Lynelle Kirby: Newness in fragrance is always important. It is not highly brand loyal business and it is a high impulse business. So, it’s always an important piece. The rate of introduction is not faster than what we would normally do at this time of the year. The third quarter is a time of the year where there are a significant number of new fragrance is launched in preparation for moving into the holiday season, so at about the same rate. But we are delighted with the performance. We’ve had some very strong performance on some of those new brands in the early stages in this quarter that we are delighted with.
David Cumberland: And then a couple of questions for Gregg on gross margin. Did (inaudible) of the DC hurt your gross margin? I think you had been expecting that and then, the one-time benefits that you called out, had that been factored into your guidance?
Gregg Bodnar: The one-time benefit was planned and expected. It was included in our second quarter guidance. As far as, the DC performs, just one reminder, remember in the first half of last year, we did a software conversion in our first DC to allow us the capability to open our second DC. And there was some incremental startup costs, most prevalent in the first quarter, but also flowing into the second quarter. So as we are opening up the second DC and incur any startup costs for that second DC is counting against the same time period where we had software conversion costs. So, the short answer of that David is very, very minor impact on gross margin, not material related to second DC. And we do get some benefit for some deals that we got to fill that second DC.
David Cumberland: What can you say about the impact of the DC in the second half?
Gregg Bodnar: It was about 5 basis points, David in gross margin. Right. It is not material.
David Cumberland: The outlook though for the impact of the DC in second half will be similar to that or very small?
Gregg Bodnar: As we go into the second half of the year, we’ve already cycled that startup cost from the software conversion in the first half of the year. So, we won’t have those comparisons in second half of the year. So, in second half of the year, expect probably about 20 basis points -- 30 basis points a quarter because we’re truly in an increase in fixed cost during that time period and then we’re not operating that DC obviously at full capacity relative to the single DC we had last year.
David Cumberland: Understood. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Ms. Neely Tamminga with Piper Jaffray. Please proceed with your question.
Erinn Murphy: Great. Thanks. It’s Erinn Murphy calling in for Neely, and congratulations on a solid job in the quarter. Lyn, I just had a couple questions for you one really with respect to their promotional calendar, if you could just remind what some of the big or major events you had in the fall and holiday period last year for just promotions and events and then I have a couple follow-up questions?
Lynelle Kirby: There are numerous events and I don’t think I can get into any individual one. I mean, during the second half of the year, we would have approximately eight newspaper inserts and we would have about six to seven individual marketing events to our customer club members. So, unless you want me to get into each and every one of those strategies, but as we speak to a broad picture strategic perspective for the back half of this year we are not anticipating at this stage that we will do more coverage of any weeks than we had in the back half of last year or incremental events at this point in time.
Erinn Murphy: Okay. So, very consistent year-over-year?
Lynelle Kirby: Year-over-year, we -- yes. The cadence of course will vary dramatically as we respond to the economic trends in the marketplace, the propositions will vary dramatically as they did in both second quarter and first quarter to the prior year here. It is not a road calendar that we rollout and work to the consumer propositions to each of those events. We really do create them as fresh and as exciting as we can versus prior year.
Erinn Murphy: Okay. That’s helpful. And, then, I had a question with respect to your loyal customer versus the non-loyalty card customer. I believe it’s kind of the IPO you spoke to the loyalty customer spending about $37 average ticket versus a $25 non-loyalty customer. Have you seen anything different in terms of just the basket size or the frequency at which each of those customers shops in your store?
Lynelle Kirby: No. Nothing of note. But, of course, they change relative to each other although in totality there is no question that our traffic is down versus where we would be in a more robust economy, that we’d certainly see more traffic in the store. Having said that, our traffic even in this economy we are able to with the promotional calendars and the marketing and the newness that we just spoke to we’re able to still keep a positive traffic count. But, relative to each other, no significant difference in the pattern.
Erinn Murphy: Okay. Thank you. And, then, the last question is just with respect to your private label business. Is anything you noticed different in recent months in terms of just that flexing up as little bit of tetter pinch on the consumers’ wallet or any opportunities that you are looking at for that side of your business as you go forward into back half and then to beginning of next year?
Lynelle Kirby: We have in the first half of the year and we continue in the back half of the year to use that more aggressively than last year to provide a value proposition for our customers. So, we have been doing that with great success and we’ll continue to do that in the back half of the year. We have also flexed our muscle a little to try to get some extra new productivity under the private label brand in the back half of the year versus what we had in the back half of last year. So, it’s something -- it’s an area where obviously we can control our own destiny as opposed to being dependent on strategies from our brand partners. So, we are certainly flexing that up in both of those, newness and value.
Erinn Murphy: Okay. Thank you very much, and good luck.
Lynelle Kirby: Thank you.
Operator: (Operator Instructions). Our next question is from Mr. Daniel Hofkin with William Blair. Please proceed with your question.
Daniel Hofkin: Good afternoon. I apologize, this question may have been asked earlier. I had a little trouble getting into the queue. In terms of new store performance, could you characterize the timing of new stores year-on-year in the second quarter versus last year. And, then, in the third quarter, is the new -- given that your overall annual plan of this is clearly more front-end weighted is that also the case in the third quarter and does that impact the kind of the implied new store productivity in the third quarter? And, then, I just have a question on sales trend by sort of broad category.
Gregg Bodnar: Dan, as we look at the second quarter, the timing of new stores opens were fairly balanced throughout the course of the quarter, maybe just slightly to the back half of the quarter as it relates to the second quarter. And, as we head into the third quarter, we mentioned that we’ve opened 10 stores so far on a program of 21. So, I would tell you that they are fairly well balanced in the third quarter this year as well.
Lynelle Kirby: Dan, to reiterate just the broader perspective of course we did move more stores or openings into second and first quarter versus third quarter. So, that’s why the third quarter store count will be down versus prior year in that effort to get balance across the program -- across our quarterly programs.
Daniel Hofkin: Sure. Okay. And, then, with regard to I guess broader category trend, you’ve commented generally that you haven’t seen a material change let’s say within sales mix in terms of people trading down. Has there -- I guess one the converse is, historically, if there was a faster pace potentially of trading up when the economy was stronger, has that pace moderated at all? Sort of the trade upto prestige brands clearly prestige is still driving above average comp, just little color on the dynamic there would be helpful.
Lynelle Kirby: Dan, no. We have not seen an acceleration or deceleration of that trade up and I think that that’s fairly evident in just the broad numbers that we gave you on our comp growth that it’s a fairly even split between average ticket and traffic. So, we continue to see the same balance that’s basically what we saw in first quarter as well. So, we’re really not seeing a shift at a micro level and it’s pretty self evident from that bottom-line performance and that balance between ticket and traffic.
Daniel Hofkin: Okay. Thank you.
Lynelle Kirby: Thank you very much, Dan.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Mr. Brian Tunick with JP Morgan. Please proceed with your questions.
Brian Tunick: Yes. So, Gregg, I guess two follow-ups maybe? I guess number one, how many leases have you signed now for 2009 and maybe just some color on what you’re seeing from an occupancy cost there and do we still assume you guys need 3% to 5% comps to breakeven on occupancy leverage? And, then, maybe just share a little color on what’s happening on the salon side, what typically do you see in this environment coming from the salon? Thanks very much.
Gregg Bodnar: Sure. I’ll take the first two and then I’ll let Lyn take the third one on the salon. In terms of the program heading into next year, we have currently about 70% of the deals approved and roughly about half of those would have signed leases at this point. Any other ones would have letters of intent. So, well into our pipeline for 2008. In terms of or 2009. In terms of the deals, some of those deals have been done certainly first half of this year and back half of last year because we’re filling our pipeline as you know well out in advance and we are not seeing Brian significant improvement in terms with the developers. We continue to negotiate very aggressively with them and in some cases we’re seeing slightly better terms, but not dramatically across the board. And, then, in terms of the occupancy cost leverage, just as an example, if you look at this year with the square footage growth we’re going to have 25% this year, I would expect for the full year that you’re going to see about 50 basis points of occupancy cost de-leverage given the fact we’ve added in so many new stores this year and that’s within that sort of 3% to 5% range. So, as we head into 2009, as those stores start to come into the comp base, I’d expect that occupancy leverage to flatten out a little bit where next year it’ll maybe about 20 or 30 basis points on the same 3% to 5% comp range.
Lynelle Kirby: On the salon business Brian, we continue to deliver solid comp performance there and it very much reflects our focus on training, staffing, exciting marketing and the quality of our guest experience. So, we are happy with the performance of the salon business particularly given this difficult economy.
Brian Tunick: All right. Thanks, and congrats.
Gregg Bodnar: Thanks, Brian.
Lyn P. Kirby: Brian, thanks. With that, I think that's just the end of our question and answer period. We don't have anymore questions in the queue. It was a pleasure to speak to you all today. Gregg and I are available for follow-up questions and we look forward to seeing some of you at some upcoming conferences that we have. We do hope you can come visit our future store when it opens in mid-October and we plan to post a video of that grand opening on our investor relation site for those of you who can’t make it there in person. Thank you again for your time today.
Operator: This concludes today’s teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.

===== 2008 Q1  (2008-06-04 17:00:00) =====
Executives:  Allison Malkin – Integrated Corporate Relations Lyn P. Kirby – President, Chief Executive Officer & Director Gregg R. Bodnar – Chief Financial Officer & Assistant Corporate Secretary
Analysts: Lyn Walther – Wachovia Capital Markets, LLC Lizabeth Dunn – Thomas Weisel Partners Evren Kopelman - JP Morgan [Erin Murphy] – Piper Jaffray J. David Cumberland – Robert W. Baird & Co. 
Operator:  Greetings ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the Ulta Salon, Cosmetics & Fragrance, Inc. first quarter fiscal 2008 results conference call. At this time all participants are in a listen only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Allison Malkin of Integrated Corporate Relations.
Allison Malkin: Good afternoon. Before we get started I’d like to remind you of the company’s Safe Harbor language which I’m sure you’re all familiar with. The statements contained in this conference call which are not historical facts may be deemed to constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual future results might differ materially from those projected in such statements due to a number of risks and uncertainties all of which are described in the company’s filings with the SEC. With respect to each reference we make on this call to adjusted net income per diluted share as a result of the IPO a reconciliation of net income per share on a GAAP basis to adjusted net income per share has been provided in Exhibit Three of our earnings release which is available on our website and has been filed with the SEC on Form 8-K. And now I’d like to turn the call over to Ulta’s President and CEO, Lyn Kirby.
Lyn P. Kirby : Good afternoon everyone. Thank you for joining us to discuss our first quarter fiscal 2008 results. On the call with me today is our Chief Financial Officer, Gregg Bodnar. Following my opening remarks Gregg will review our financial highlights and then I will provide closing comments and turn the call over to the Operator so that we can answer the questions you have for us today. We began the year solidly continuing our positive momentum from fourth quarter with first quarter earnings results excluding severance at the high end of our guidance range. We attribute our ongoing strength in a tough economy to our consistency in providing consumers with an approachable and enjoyable store experience as well as motivational marketing and a strong value proposition. Consumers are responding favorably resulting in increased customer traffic and positive comp sales growth. In total the quarter included net sales of $239.3 million increasing 23.3% from last year and diluted earnings per share of $0.08 excluding a severance charge of $0.01 and including incremental costs of $0.03 per share related to pre-opening expense and an added marketing event. This compares to $0.10 per diluted share last year. During the quarter we achieved balanced sales with both new and existing brands contributing to our comp sales growth and a continuation in strength of Prestige color and skin care which as you know is a key growth opportunity for us. The Prestige category continued its positive performance posting significant sales gains in the quarter. In addition we are also pleased with the strength in salon which is benefiting from increased traffic and from strategies in place to maximize productivity. And finally we are pleased with the addition of new brands. During the quarter we added several new brands including La Roche, Pureology, Oscar Blandi and Warren Tricome. We also continue to test prospective brands consistent with our strategy of having one new brand test and one roll out every six months. First quarter delivered a 3.9% increase in comparable store sales driven equally by traffic and average dollar sales. We were pleased with this result especially given that it follows a 9.2% increase last year and that we continue to execute our balanced long term real estate strategy including opening 30 stores in existing markets and 33 in new markets over the last 12 months. Regarding our store expansion we opened a record number of first quarter stores with 17 new stores and one remodel completed in the quarter. We continue to be pleased with the performance of our new stores which continued to deliver on our new store model. Our openings were also well balanced, two were in major metro markets, six in medium sized markets and nine opened in smaller markets. We entered 12 new markets and ended the quarter with 265 stores in 32 states. Some of you may recall that we originally targeted 14 new stores during the first quarter. However we had the opportunity to open three stores just ahead of schedule resulting in them opening in the last week of the first quarter rather than the first weeks in the second quarter. While the sales impacts were not significant to the quarter we are pleased to be slightly ahead of our annual opening schedule as we begin the second quarter and remain on track to attain our goal of 63 new stores and eight remodels for the year. We successfully opened and are operating our second DC. We opened our second distribution center in Phoenix in April on time and on budget. We were distributing to 24 stores from this location as of quarter end and we expect to be shipping to over 100 stores entering the fourth quarter 2008. Regarding e-commerce we continue to improve the functionality of our site. During the quarter we added 4,000 products and three new micro-sites, Smashbox, Bare Escentuals and Stila to the www.Ulta.com site. We believe we are well positioned to optimize this site during the remainder of the year. As we begin the second quarter we recognize that the retail environment remains tough. We are nonetheless optimistic about our ability to deliver the year and would point to four core drivers of this expectation. First, our sales have continued positively and we enjoyed a strong Mother’s Day holiday even against heightened promotional activity from other retailers demonstrating the increased preference for our Ulta shopping experience. Second, we have opened nine new stores so far in the second quarter, they are performing to our store model and we remain on track to open 63 stores and expand square footage by 25% this year. Third, our sales growth is balanced across new and existing brand categories and salon. We will continue to add new brands while maximizing our current opportunities. We are also encouraged by our strategies to increase salon productivity going forward. And fourth, in this tough economy our marketing machine remains flexible enough to respond to trends and our strategies to provide motivation and value will continue to drive traffic and sales always of course with a balanced item margin. So with that I’d like now to turn the call over to Gregg to review our results and guidance in more detail.
Gregg R. Bodnar : As Lyn mentioned we are pleased with our start to the year. For the first quarter double digit sales growth and gross margin expansion enabled us to achieve earnings at the high end of our guidance we provided which excluded severance costs that totaled $0.01 per share. Beginning with a review of the income statement net sales increased 23.3% to $239.3 million from $194.1 million in the first quarter last year. Sales growth was driven by a 3.9% increase in comp store sales which followed a 9.2% increase in comp store sales last year resulting in a two year comp store sales gain of 13.1%. Higher average ticket led by continued expansion of our Prestige brand assortment and customer traffic drove the comparable store sales growth. We continue to achieve a good balance between average ticket and positive traffic through the successful execution of our marketing strategy and overall consumer proposition. The additional marketing event in the quarter that we referred to in the last call was successful and helped drive additional traffic over and above already positive traffic results. We opened 17 stores ahead of our commitment of 14 stores as we continue to focus on balancing our new store program through the first three quarters of the year. We also closed one location and remodeled one store in the first quarter. We ended the first quarter with 265 stores which represents a 31% square footage increase from last year. Gross profit in the first quarter was $73.9 million or 30.9% of net sales as compared to $59.5 million or 30.7% of net sales last year. Gross profit margin increased by 20 basis points due to a 40 basis point increase in advertising allowances offset partially by a slight de-leverage of fixed store operating costs in line with our expectations. As you may recall advertising allowances partially offset our advertising expense which is included in SG&A. We also successfully opened our second distribution center with operating costs in line with our expectations. SG&A expenses were $62.1 million or 25.9% of net sales compared to $48 million or 24.7% of net sales in the prior year. Excluding severance costs SG&A was 25.6% of net sales reflecting incremental costs of $1.1 million related to the additional marketing event and an additional $0.4 million in stock compensation expense compared to the prior year quarter. Re-opening expenses were $3.8 million or 1.5% of net sales compared to $1.7 million or 0.9% of net sales reflecting the opening of 17 new stores and one remodel during the quarter as compared to seven new stores and three remodels in the first quarter last year. As a result operating income totaled $8.1 million or 3.4% of net sales versus $9.9 million or 5.1% of net sales in the prior year. Interest expense decreased to $0.9 million from $1 million in the first quarter last year reflecting lower interest rates from the same period last year. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 40.3% compared to 40.1% in the prior year. The resulting net income was $4.3 million as compared to $5.3 million last year. On a GAAP basis income per diluted share was $0.07 or $0.08 excluding the severance charge versus $0.10 in the first quarter last year. EPS this year includes $0.01 per share in severance costs for the previously announced management change. Adjusted income per diluted share was $0.08 which excludes severance and compares to adjusted income per diluted share of $0.09 in the first quarter of last year. Merchandise inventories at the end of the quarter increased 39.7% to $212.6 million compared to $152.9 million last year. Of the $59.7 million total increase approximately $44.7 million came from the addition of 62 new stores opened in the past year. $6 million for 12 of the 18 stores that are planned to open in the second quarter and $9 million related to bringing in inventory for our new distribution center. On a per door basis excluding the additional planned distribution center inventory average inventory per store was flat to last year which is consistent with our expectations. We are pleased with both the level and composition of inventories we began the second quarter. Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $30.5 million. Regarding our outlook, we are introducing guidance for the second quarter and reiterating our full year fiscal 2008 guidance based on current business trends and the current retail and economic environment. For the second quarter of fiscal 2007 we currently expect net sales in the range of $248 million to $252 million compared to actual second quarter fiscal 2007 sales of $200.4 million. Comp store sales are expected to increase in the range of 3% to 5% compared to a 6.5% increase last year. Income per diluted share is estimated in the range of $0.04 to $0.05 which is impacted by expected additional pre-opening costs of $2.1 million or $0.02 per diluted share due to the increased number of new stores opening in the quarter as compared to the prior year. We plan to open approximately 18 stores and remodel five stores during the second quarter of fiscal 2008. in the second quarter of fiscal 2007 we opened eight new stores and remodeled four. For the full year fiscal 2008 we continue to estimate net sales in the range of $1.12 billion to $1.4 billion as compared to $912.1 million in fiscal 2007. Comp store sales are expected to increase by 3% to 5%. Income per diluted share is forecasted in the range of $0.52 to $0.57. We remain on track to open approximately 63 new stores and remodel eight stores in fiscal 2008. Capital expenditures are expected to be in the range of $115 million to $120 million. As a reminder our full year guidance does not include the $0.01 per share severance cost for the previously announced management change. As a reminder our long term annual growth targets which are unchanged include comp store sales increases in the range of 3% to 5%, square footage expansion in the 20% to 25% range and net income growth in the 25% to 30% range. And now I’d like to turn the call back over to Lyn.
Lyn P. Kirby : In summary we continue to provide great value and 21,000 products all under one roof because that’s our business and we continue to provide an approachable experience that makes women feel confident and beautiful because that’s our passion. We are pleased with our start to the year and equally excited by the many opportunities that lie ahead. With our resources, talent and infrastructure we believe we are well positioned to attain our goals while advancing value for all of our stakeholders even in a tough environment. Our marketing machine is flexible enough to respond to sales trends, our team is disciplined to balance both sales and margin, our inventory position is healthy, our new stores are on time and on track with our sales expectations and we have a strong balance sheet to support our growth.  So with that I would like to turn the call over to the Operator to being the Q&A portion of the call.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Lyn Walther – Wachovia Capital Markets, LLC.
Lyn Walther – Wachovia Capital Markets, LLC: A couple questions for you, just a little bit more color on the comp, the older stores versus the newer ones, are you still seeing the new stores perform to the model that we’ve talked about the first few years really ramping up or is this moderating given the environment out there?
Gregg R. Bodnar : Actually the new store model, first year model and the ramp for the next couple years of the model is performing consistent with our expectations and consistent with the model we published. We are not seeing a macro impact on the ramp from stores that are opened in the last couple years.
Lyn Walther – Wachovia Capital Markets, LLC: Given the environment and all the pressures on the consumer what changes have you made to get her into the store? I know in Q1 you talked about adding additional marketing vehicle. What do you have planned go forward and then once she’s in the store, what are you doing to try and convert her? Is it getting more difficult?
Lyn P. Kirby : Let me that the first part first, Lyn. First of all we do believe that we continue to have the momentum of that macro shift to our brand experience away from other channels of distribution so we always have that wind at our back. But specifically for first quarter as we have done with all other quarters and will for the quarters ahead we take a look at our marketing calendar at the beginning of the quarter, we shuffle it around where we believe it’s appropriate either relative to a trend that we’re seeing in the market or relative to some learning experience that we’ve had in prior year or the prior quarter. Then of course what we do is spend a lot of time coming up with some creative consumer propositions that are very motivational to drive her into the store and obviously offering a great value proposition and last but not least, we continue to search for newness into the store. And newness is not necessarily big brand newness although we are happy to do that at an appropriate rate, but just newsworthy new products, new line extensions that provide that E for entertainment for her as she comes into the store. It is really a business as usual approach for us just tweaked specifically to the most recent learning. Once she’s in the store again it is really again for us what we have been doing for a while. As I think you know it’s not a new startup company in early stages of maturity. We’re eight years into this journey and our store execution is excellent around the execution of both the marketing calendar as well as the execution of some of our newer strategies such as the events in the store around boutiques and just the great customer service in stores. It sounds a little like business as usual but that in fact is what it is. But the biggest different I think is just the continued search for creative motivating consumer propositions that get her up out of the chair.
Lyn Walther – Wachovia Capital Markets, LLC: One just for Gregg, how should we be thinking about inventory at the end of Q3 given you’ll probably be stating some more for the DC as you ramp that up?
Gregg R. Bodnar : The initial $9 million of incremental inventory that we put in at the end of the first quarter to open that DC was really just a transition of those new stores. So as we flow into the end of the second quarter including total DC inventory we expect it to be in line with our comp store sales growth.
Operator: Our next question comes from Lizabeth Dunn – Thomas Weisel Partners.
Lizabeth Dunn – Thomas Weisel Partners: My first question is really to the distribution center, did I understand correctly that it didn’t have an impact on the gross margin in the quarter? And if not, are we not to expect one going forward? And then my second question relates to the salon business, you noted that it’s making progress. Can you provide any color on the best performing salons versus the worst performing salons, what sort of volume they’re doing and what strategies are in place that are driving that improvement?
Gregg R. Bodnar : Liz, I’ll take the DC question and then I’ll take sort of part two of the salon question and I’ll let Lyn talk about strategy on the salon business. Distribution center startup this quarter was management of those costs in the startup was well within our expectations. You may remember last year this time we actually did have some incremental costs in our distribution center to do the conversion for the software for our first DC that allowed us to open the second DC. So we are actually comping that if you will in the first quarter this year compared to last year which is one of the reasons why you didn’t see a significant increase. But those costs were well managed within our expectations. On the going forward basis as we compare to prior year same quarters we still do expect to see about 20 to 30 basis points full year effect on gross margins as a result of the incremental fixed costs for the full year for the second DC.
Lizabeth Dunn – Thomas Weisel Partners: At what point will we start to see leverage on that second DC?
Gregg R. Bodnar : It starts to leverage next year. Because think about, we’re actually adding 63 new stores this year. Our existing facility last year was servicing 250 stores. So we’ll start to leverage from the startup phase this year, next year. And then as it relates to just the volume breaks on the salon we actually don’t break out the salon business separate and we really don’t comment on individual store salon performance, but I will let Lyn talk about the individual salon strategies that we use to macro level.
Lyn P. Kirby : In terms of the strategy on the business there are a couple of components to it. The first is simply a continued drive for high quality headcount. Without the great stylists in the store we can’t drive our sales but then in addition to that we continue to focus on ways to improve the productivity so we have invested money in training in terms of different ways to drive that productivity and we continue to invest in more technical training that will continue to improve their ability in terms of their skill to deliver great service for our customer which benefits certainly the customer and the experience but also will continue to derive the retention of our stylists. Continued education and training for them is a critical piece of what drives their loyalty and their commitment to the company they’re working for. So that’s at the heart of the strategy that we have been working on for the last few years and it continues to deliver very nicely.
Operator: Our next question comes from Brian Tunick – JP Morgan.
Evren Kopelman - JP Morgan: First question is on real estate, at the ICSC conference a few weeks ago we were hearing that it’s getting more difficult to finance and lease new development projects. Can you talk a little bit about what you’re seeing and if that concerns you regarding your square footage growth plans especially in some of the newer centers?
Lyn P. Kirby : It’s pretty much a continuation of what we have been saying. When you take a look at that 2008 program there is nothing that will get in the way of us delivering our commitments for 2008. As we take a look at 2009 we’ve seen a little bit of slowing down at some anchors, larger anchors making commitments to the development community but programs in developments that had started earlier are going to be finished in 2009 so we’re not seeing lots of programs that there was already sign ups and commitments to. But we certainly heard at ICSC a little bit more of a slow down in the beginning of new programs and new projects. But the flip side of that as we have been saying for a while is that we do believe that there will be existing real estate that opens up on the flip side of that economic trend and that is what we are beginning to see and so we are not anticipating at this point in time a slow down in our 2009 commitment. But it will shift a little bit from new centers to existing. We have as I think you know often had a significant piece of our program in existing boxes. We don’t always get to build to suit, very rarely actually do we get to build to suit. So we’re very used to designing our stores into different footprints if that’s the trend that we end up riding.
Evren Kopelman - JP Morgan: Secondly on a different note can you talk a little bit about if you’re seeing any differences in the competitive promotional environment and maybe comment a little bit on Mother’s Day and how that was versus your expectations?
Lyn P. Kirby : Mother’s Day very much met our expectations so Mother’s Day we saw actually a continuation of the further trends we saw during the holiday season. We certainly saw fragrance a little softer than what it had been trending in third quarter last year but our fragrance sales at Mother’s Day were in line with what we saw during holiday which were significantly better than marketplace trend. Relative to the competitive activity in marketplace we certainly continue to see some heating up in the mask categories. We watch very closely and we have responded appropriately. As you know our marketing is on a fairly short lead time so as we see that heat up we do respond there and relative to the broader macro competition for traffic we did see some certainly heated up activity amongst some of the major department stores in some of the larger chains during Mother’s Day but not to the extent that we saw during the holiday season. So Mother’s Day was not as heated up during holiday. But nonetheless it was competitive and heated up from the trends at the beginning of first quarter.
Evren Kopelman - JP Morgan: Finally on interest expense that was lower than what we were expecting for the quarter. What do you expect for the second quarter and for the year?
Gregg R. Bodnar : Interest expense for the year, Evren, will be approximately $6 million. And then for the quarter you should be plan to be $1.5 million to $1.7 million second quarter.
Operator: Our next question comes from Erin Murphy – Piper Jaffray.
Erin Murphy – Piper Jaffray: Just had a quick question actually, Lyn, for you to begin with on the Spring Beauty Event, how did that perform relative to your expectations? If you could speak a little bit about what you’re seeing from a customer shopping behavior perspective, whether it’s trend or just what you’re noticing about her when she’s in your store? And then I have a couple follow up questions.
Lyn P. Kirby : The Spring Beauty Event is certainly one of the most significant events for us where we do offer some newness and excitement from both our existing brands as well as our new brands and we do events in our store where we pre-book for customers to come in for very specific education with the brand that they’re interested in and that combination effective delivered right on our expectations. We were very happy with it, we had not seen a slow down in our Prestige color and skin category to any significant extent. The category continues to perform at very significant comp growth and the event was pretty much on track but it is a combination I think of both what we’re offering in the marketing as well as the in store experience.
Erin Murphy – Piper Jaffray: Then I had a quick question of what you’re seeing thus far in Q2. Are you seeing any impact from a comp perspective on the rebate checks? I know they’re still early in trickling in, but just thus far is there any impact from a traffic perspective?
Lyn P. Kirby : We don’t normally comment on the quarter we’re in but on the rebate piece we’re not anticipating any impact from it. We haven’t seen anything yet. We’ll be delighted if it comes as gravy for us but it’s nothing we’re expecting or have planned.
Erin Murphy – Piper Jaffray: So it’s not in your guidance?
Lyn P. Kirby : No.
Erin Murphy – Piper Jaffray: Gregg, a quick follow up question to actually Liz’s question earlier on about the full year impact from the second DC, the 20 to 30 basis points, are you looking for anything else to either offset that from a gross margin perspective or is that what we should model for gross margin overall for the full year?
Gregg R. Bodnar : For the full year, Erin, I would model gross margins down slightly about 20 basis points and remember the other macro piece in there is as we add square footage we lose a little bit of leverage on the fixed costs and then gross margins, product margins will continue to improve with the penetration of Prestige which will offset that which leaves you a net impact from the DC.
Operator: Our next question comes from Daniel Hofkin - William Blair & Company, L.L.C.
Daniel Hofkin - William Blair & Company, L.L.C.: Just a couple questions either for Lyn or Gregg, if you could just maybe clarify a little bit what drove the better gross margin rate performance in the first quarter? I think you had expected flat to down slightly. Was it greater ad spending in there for the rebate helping the gross margin and impacting SG&A or was it something else? Second, if you could comment a little bit on the composition of average ticket, whether that’s more average unit retail which it sounds like it is, or number of items per basket? Any additional color on that and then with regard to the second quarter, obviously you had not previously provided guidance on that, but can you indicate generally the guidance that you’re providing right now has that changed at all internally relative to what you might have expected going into the start of this fiscal year?
Gregg R. Bodnar : I’ll take them one at a time here Dan. As it relates to gross margin, gross margin was up 20 basis points during the quarter. As we mentioned, about 40 basis points of that was driven by advertising allowances which partially offset our advertising costs. As we expect for the quarter and the full year, we also see some deleverage in fixed store occupancy costs. Our original guidance anticipated and we did a much better job of managing distribution center costs for the start up of the second DC, so that’s the primary difference there. As it relates to composition and increases in average ticket, you are correct, it is mostly average unit retail price growth driven. And then the third point on second quarter guidance, this is the guidance that we feel is prudent and appropriate at this point in time based on the current business trends. 
Daniel Hofkin - William Blair & Company, L.L.C.: Can I read in to that last comment that would have changed internally even if not at the EPS level in terms of the line items or any color you can add on that?
Gregg R. Bodnar : I really can’t comment any further on that Dan.
Operator:  Our next question comes from J. David Cumberland – Robert W. Baird & Co.
J. David Cumberland – Robert W. Baird & Co.: Lyn, can you elaborate on some of the new brands you added in the quarter? You talked about La Roche on a previous call, how do you see Pureology and the other two fitting in to your assortment?
Lyn P. Kirby : Actually all three of them are great fits. We have not seen any significant shift away from higher price point to lower price point in the mix shift of the business. As I said, our higher price point Prestige color and skin care brands continue to grow very strongly and Pureology has also opened very strong as well so we’re not seeing any price resistance if that’s what you are thinking. And, there’s plenty in the room in the portfolio for all of these. Pureology is a brand that has different product performance versus some of the other brands that we have in our hair portfolio so we’re seeing very nice incrementality from it and similarly over in the color and skin we continue to see as we add brands to that whole category mix that there is significant incrementality. I think as we continue to add brands we further strength our positioning as a great destination for selection in that category so all of these brands are absolutely incremental.
J. David Cumberland – Robert W. Baird & Co.: Then one for Gregg on the increase in advertising allowances. What caused that level of increase in the quarter?
Gregg R. Bodnar : David, as we’ve talked about in the past, the structure of our vendor terms does allow for some allocation of gross margin, if you will, to support our advertising strategy. So, as we see some incremental advertising costs during a particular quarter we work with our vendors to help support advertising their brands and that results in typically some additional advertising allowances which get recognized in gross margin. So, it’s a function of advertising.
Operator:  At this time there are no further questions. I would like to turn the floor back to management for closing comments.
Allison Malkin: I very much look forward to seeing many of you at the upcoming investor conferences. The dates and locations will be posted on our website. And, I look forward to speaking with you on our next quarterly conference call. Thank you very much for your time today.

Operator: Greetings and welcome to the Ulta Salon Cosmetics & Fragrance Incorporated fourth quarter and fiscal year 2007 results conference call. At this time all participants are in a listen only mode. A brief question and answer session will follow the formal presentation. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host Allison Malkin of Integrated Corporate Relations. Thank you Ms. Malkin, you may begin.
Allison Malkin:  Good afternoon. Before we get started I’d like to remind you of the company’s Safe Harbor language which I’m sure you’re all familiar with. The statements contained in this conference call which are not historical facts may be deemed to constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual future results might differ materially from those projected in such statements due to a number of risks and uncertainties all of which are described in the company’s filings with the SEC. With respect to each reference we make on this call to adjusted net income per diluted share as a result of the IPO, reconciliation of net income per share on a GAAP basis to adjusted net income per share has been provided in exhibit three of our earnings release which is also available on our website and has been filed with the SEC on Form 8K.  Now, I’d like to turn the call over to Ulta’s President and CEO Lyn Kirby. 
Lyn P. Kirby : Good afternoon everyone. Thank you for joining us to discuss the company’s fourth quarter and fiscal 2007 results. On the call with me today is our Chief Financial Officer Gregg Bodnar and following my opening remarks Gregg will review our financial highlights and then I will provide closing comments and turn the call over to the operator so we can answer the questions you have for us today.  As you all know this was an incredibly challenging retail quarter with 2008 looking to be even more challenging given the state of the global economy and the general economic slowdown. We are seeing that virtually no segment of the economy is immune from what is happening and even the strongest of retailers are being impacted. Although, the Federal Reserve action yesterday hopefully will provide some momentum for consumer spending. Despite this, our focused execution in merchandising, marketing and store operations along with the resiliency of the beauty category enabled us to deliver fourth quarter sales and earnings in line with our expectations. I am very proud of the efforts of our associates who helped to generate our positive fourth quarter performance.  As some of you might have heard me say before, women get up in the morning, they shampoo and style their hair and they put on their makeup. This makes beauty products a repeat purchase that is more resilient than the fashion business. However, this resiliency is most challenged in the holiday season when we compete with all retails for all gift spending. So, during the quarter, as we said we would, we flexed our marketing muscle and emphasized our value proposition which we believe resulted in market share gain. So, very briefly touching on the numbers, for the fourth quarter we delivered a 23.4% increase in sales on a comparable 13 week basis. We increased our comps stores sales by 4.5% and we grew operating income by 47% to $23.9 million. We were equally pleased with our annual results. For the fiscal 2007 year, net sales rose 23.5% on a comparable 52 week basis to $912.1 million. Comparable store sales rose 6.4% and operating income increased 16% to $46.7 million. The fourth quarter marked our 32nd consecutive quarter of comparable store sales growth and was driven by increases in both customer traffic and average ticket. At the beginning of the year we knew from the calendar that the difference between Thanksgiving and Christmas would result in an additional full shopping weekend. A once every seven year occurrence that, as you know, retail describes as a late Christmas. So, we planned investment in a bigger and better holiday gift with purchase for the two weeks before Christmas that was favorably received and drove traffic into our stores. In addition, at the beginning of fourth quarter when we realized the retail holiday season would be more challenging than expected, we made the decision to add a newspaper insert three days prior to Christmas to ensure Ulta’s value message was top of mind for last minute shoppers. Finally, we expanded our mailing list to our customer club members inviting more customers to shop with us. I am delighted with our comp sale performance of 4.5% as it follows a 15.7% comp store sales gain last year. Both this year’s results and the two year performance compares extremely favorably to other retailers. In addition, as we had mentioned in our last conference call we focused on achieving the appropriate balance between sales and margins and are pleased with the outcome. Lastly, we were pleased with the improvement in operating income in the quarter which reflects the solid increase in sales and leverage in SG&A.  Turning now to the full year, we also achieved several note worthy accomplishments. We completed a record number of new store openings and remodels during the year. I continue to be pleased with the results of our new stores our 2007 class delivered to our new store model. We opened 53 new stores and the class was well balanced with 20 stores opened in major metro markets, 17 in medium sized markets and 16 in smaller markets. We added 23 new markets and ended the year operating 249 stores in 31 states. In addition, we completed 17 remodels during the year. Now, speaking of 2008, our plans include 63 new stores and eight remodels. Based on a better than expected performance in our smaller market stores, we have modestly increased the proportion of openings for smaller market stores this year. Despite the economic environment, we continue to be confident in our store opening schedule. All of our leases for 2008 have been signed and 60% of the 2009 pipeline has been approved which is a great place to be at this point. As we finalize 2009 we continue to focus on careful selection of sites, aggressively negotiating terms and ensuring the commitments from co-tenants. For the first quarter we have opened 12 new stores to date and we are pleased with their results.  Throughout the year we continue to drive growth through our merchandising strategies. The Prestige category generated double digit comp growth and continues to drive average order. In addition, we have continued to flow fresh new products into our stores. During the year we introduced new brands such as Dermalogica, Juicy Fragrance, Frederic Fekkai, Nick Chavez and Brookstone giftables. In addition, we launched two private label brands one in professional makeup tools and the second in sun care. For the first half of 2008 we are introducing Lorac which is a Prestige brand from QVC and Stila which was rolled out just prior to year end. For fiscal 2008 we are on track with our goal of one new brand test and one launch every six months. We will also continue to expand our private label category in first quarter with a hair care line and additional bath line and expansion of the Ulta Professionals line.  I am pleased with the ongoing development of our [inaudible] strategies which are generating strong comp store sales growth. This growth underscores our continued focus, dedication and commitment to this business as a core component of our competitive advantage. Regarding our website, we launched our second generation ecommerce site in the fourth quarter. Ulta.com is meeting our expectations and we are pleased with the improved features, functionality, efficiency and look of the site. We are now focused on maximizing Ulta.com and are currently testing a new marketing campaign to attract new customers. In February we launched our first microsite on Ultra.com for Bare Essentials and have seen a positive response. Going forward, we will continue to build microsites for other Prestige brands.  As we begin fiscal 2008, we recognize that the environment remains challenging yet we believe our strategies have us well positioned. Currently, we are focused on continuing our successful strategies of 2007. To this end, we plan to open 63 new stores, continue our track record of positive quarterly comp store sales growth and continue to expand our Prestige offerings. In addition, our second distribution center is on track to open in April this year. We also believe the environment will remain challenging for the remainder of the year. We have planned our sales, expenses and earnings prudently and fully expect to deliver this year. In summary, we expect fiscal 2008 to represent another year of significant accomplishments for Ulta.  With that I’d like to turn the call over to Gregg to review our financial highlights in some more detail.
Gregg R. Bodnar : For the fourth quarter double digit sales growth and leverage in SG&A more than offset higher pre-opening expense and fueled a 41% increase in fourth quarter net income. Now, I’d like to review the income statement beginning with sales. For the fourth quarter net sales increased 15.9% to $309.3 million from $267 million last year. Excluding the 53rd week last year net sales increased 23.4%. Sales growth was driven by 4.5% increase in comparable store sales which follows a 15.7% comparable store sales gain last year resulting in a two year comparable store sales gain of 20.2% on a realigned calendar basis. Our comparable store sales growth was fueled by higher average ticket driven by the expansion of our Prestige category as well as growth in consumer traffic in a very challenging holiday environment. We attribute this increase in customer traffic to the success of our fourth quarter marketing strategy. Non-comp sales during the quarter contributed $55 million to total sales and as Lyn mentioned, we opened 12 new stores in the fourth quarter which included one opening at the end of January which was in line with our plan. Gross profit for the quarter was $97 million or 31.4% of net sales as compared to $84.3 million or 31.6% of net sales last year. Gross margin declined by 20 basis points due to a slight increase in distribution costs with our DC operating and capacity. We had slightly higher promotional activity in January which resulted in a slightly lower gross margin rate but drove favorable customer traffic. As you know and as Lyn mentioned, we are opening a second distribution center in April this year which we expect will be more efficient to accommodate our shipping needs for holiday of 2008.  SG&A expenses were $70.4 million or 22.8% of net sales compared to $66.3 million or 24.8% of net sales in the prior year. Last year’s fourth quarter included a $2.8 million one-time stock compensation charge. Excluding this cost from last year SG&A as a percentage of sales improved by 100 basis points which was driven by our ability to leverage our cost structure on higher sales despite this increase in marketing expense to drive traffic in a very challenging holiday period. Pre-opening expenses were $2.7 million or .9% of net sales compared to $1.8 million or .7% of net sales reflecting the opening of 12 new stores and three remodels during the quarter as compared to nine new stores and no remodels in the fourth quarter last year. As a result, operating income increased 47.1% to $23.9 million or 7.7% of net sales from $16.3 million or 6.1% of net sales in the prior year. Interest expense totaled $1.1 million as compared to $.8 million last year. This reflects a $26 million increase in average debt as compared to last year driven primarily by new store investments.  The effective tax rate for the quarter was 40.5% as compared to 37.4% in the prior year. The increase in the effective tax rate largely reflects a one-time reduction in the prior year rate representing the recognition of state tax benefit of our net operating loss carry forwards. The resulting net income was $13.6 million as compared to $9.7 million last year representing an increase of 40.8%. On an adjusted basis, excluding the impact of the company’s preferred dividends in 2006 and adjusting for the additional shares for the IPO in October 2007, income per diluted share for the fourth quarter for fiscal 2007 was $0.23 as compared to $0.16 for the fourth quarter last year. For the full year, net sales rose 20.8% to $912.1 million with comparable store sales increasing 6.4%. This follows a 14.4% comparable store sales gain last year on a realigned calendar basis. The two year comparable stores sales increase was 20.8%. Excluding the impact of the 53rd week, net sales increased 23.5%. Operating income for the full year was $46.7 million as compared to $40.1 million last year which was driven primarily by the 20.8% increase in net sales. The increase in operating income this year includes the effect of a $2.8 million cost associated with our warehouse management software implementation and $4.7 million of additional new store pre-opening cost on our expanded new store program. Total square footage increased 28%. On an adjusted basis excluding the impact of our preferred dividends in 2006 and adjusting for the share count for the IPO, income per diluted share was $0.48 compared to $0.43 last year. Merchandise inventories at the end of the quarter increased 36.3% to $176.1 million compared $129.2 million last year. Of the $46.9 million total increase, approximately $40.9 million came from the additional 53 new stores opened this year and $6 million for the 14 new stores that are planned to open in the first quarter 2008. On a per store basis, average inventory increased approximately 3.6% which is consistent with our expectations. We are pleased with both the level and composition of our inventory as we begin the first quarter. In line with plan, we opened a total of 53 new stores in fiscal 2007 ending the year with 249 stores. Gross square footage increased 28% in fiscal 2007 to 2.6 million square feet from 2 million square feet at the end of the prior year. Capital expenditures totaled a $114 million and depreciation, amortization was $39.4 million in fiscal 2007.  Regarding our outlook, we are introducing guidance for the first quarter and full year fiscal 2008 that reflects our current business trends and the current retail and economic environment. For the full year fiscal 2008 we estimate net sales in the range of $1,120,000 to $1,140,000 as compared to $912.1 million last year representing a growth rate of 24% at the midpoint of the range. This assumes comp store sales growth of 3 to 5%. Income per diluted share is forecasted in the range of $0.52 to $0.57 as compared to $0.48 in fiscal 2007. This represents a net income growth rate from the high to low of this range of 25 to 38%. For the first quarter of fiscal 2008 we estimate net sales in the range of $236 million to $241 million as compared to $194 million last year reflecting a growth rate of 23% at the midpoint of the range. This assumes comparable store sales growth in the range of 3 to 5%. Income per diluted share is forecasted in the range of $0.06 to $0.08. First quarter income per diluted share is being impacted by costs totaling $0.03 per share. These costs include approximately $0.02 per share for $2.3 million of additional pre-opening expense given the increase in new store activity in the first quarter and the beginning of the second quarter and a $0.01 per share or $1.1 million due to adjusted marketing calendar resulting in one more marketing vehicle which is expected to allow us to more effectively drive customer traffic with an earlier Easter this year.  For the first quarter we plan to open approximately 14 stores. Our first quarter earnings guidance assumes an effective tax rate of approximately 40% and approximately 60 million shares outstanding. For the year our earnings guidance assumes an effective tax rate of approximately 40% and approximately 61 million shares outstanding. In fiscal 2008 we plan to open 63 new stores and remodel another eight locations. Gross square footage is projected to increase approximately 25% while capital expenditures are estimated at $115 to $120 million and depreciation and amortization is estimated at approximately $52 million for the full year. Our long term annual growth rate targets are unchanged and include comparable stores sales growth in the range of 3 to 5%, square footage growth in the range of 20 to 25% and net income growth of 25 to 30%.  Now, I’d like to turn the call back over to Lyn.
Lyn P. Kirby : In closing, we believe we are well positioned for success in fiscal 2008 and beyond. Our team is focused on delivering the year and maximizing our long term potential of 1,000 US locations over the next 10 years. With that, I would like to turn the call over to the operator to begin the Q&A portion of the call.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Lauren Levitan with Cowen and Company. Please proceed with your question.
Lauren Levitan – Cowen and Company, LLC: Lyn and Gregg I’m wondering if you could give us a little bit color on some of the factors that you mentioned relative to the retail backdrop, maybe give us some sense of any differences you’re seeing by region or even by class. I mean you obviously have many younger stores rolling into the comp base that are helping to drive the comps, if you could give us some sense as to how the older stores are performing and then I’m also wondering if you could give us some sense of what you’re assuming about the type of promotional activity and level of promotional activity that will be required to drive the comp that you’re factoring into your Q1 in 08 guidance. Are you assuming that there’ll be incremental marketing events and greater emphasis on value that could pressure margins and increase costs? That would be helpful.
Lyn P. Kirby : All right, Lauren, let’s see if we can break it down a little bit. Let me take the first one which is in terms of the regions of the country, again we continue to see some slowness California and Florida as we did last year but we are not seeing any other slow down outside of those trends that we already had in fourth quarter. Gregg, do you want to answer the question on comp stores by age?
Gregg R. Bodnar : At the top end of the range, Lauren, when you get to some of the older stores like stores that are eight and nine years old, you will start to see those stores go into single digit to flat comps. So anything older than eight years we’re assuming in that 5% comp range that they’re flat to slightly positive.
Lyn P. Kirby : And then, Lauren, the question on the amount of promotional activity, as Gregg mentioned we did put one additional event into the first quarter time period. It allowed us to move the calendar around to optimize the Easter timing this year and in terms of the rest of the year, again we are planning same promotional calendar as last year but as we always say, one of our competencies in strength is flexibility with this machine that we have and so we will flex it if we see a need to but right at this point in time we are not planning additional activities for the remainder of the year and the impact of the additional event in first quarter is fully contemplated into both the guidance for the quarter on the sales and the margin line of the business.
Lauren Levitan – Cowen and Company, LLC: Last thing, with respect to the new stores, can you give us some update on their performance? I know in the third quarter call you talked about some trends that you were seeing in new stores and I know you said you refigured the mix of where those new stores will be in 08, but could you give us some update on how those are performing in the fourth quarter and into the first?
Lyn P. Kirby : The stores that were in the early trade areas in the back end of third quarter emerged through the fourth quarter time period and are back on track with exactly where we would expect them to be relative to the model. The reason for it, just a little bit of color, is we went into the fourth quarter time period, our traditional marketing calendar and cadence during that period of time called for a much heavier newspaper insert scheduling and the new stores responded extremely well to that level of marketing activity. So it was not heavier than a prior year, it’s just the nature of what we do in fourth quarter. And, Lauren, I’m sorry the second part of your question one more time?
Lauren Levitan – Cowen and Company, LLC: If you could give us an update on how the new stores are performing? It sounds like you’ve really given that already.
Lyn P. Kirby : And, Lauren, just to answer that question, yes, we’re very happy with the openings this year. We’ve opened 12 and they’re right where we need them to be.
Operator: Our next question comes from Brian Tunick with JP Morgan Chase and Company. Please proceed with your question.
Evren Kopelman: This is Evren Kopelman calling for Brian. I was wondering if you guys could talk about your store pre-opening expenses? This number came in a little higher than what we were expecting for the first quarter, so how should we think about it for the rest of the year? And then in addition, Lyn, you talked about this business model being very resilient, could you guys maybe talk about how has this business done in the previous difficult economic times?
- JP Morgan Chase and Company: This is Evren Kopelman calling for Brian. I was wondering if you guys could talk about your store pre-opening expenses? This number came in a little higher than what we were expecting for the first quarter, so how should we think about it for the rest of the year? And then in addition, Lyn, you talked about this business model being very resilient, could you guys maybe talk about how has this business done in the previous difficult economic times?
Gregg R. Bodnar : For the first quarter, we’re projecting that pre-opening costs will be about $4 million, that’s on the basis of 14 stores. The other most significant impact that you should be aware of is we have a little heavier opening schedule at the beginning of the second quarter so some of those second quarter pre-opening costs are flowing into the first quarter which is the reason why we’d be guiding you to a $4 million pre-opening for the first quarter.
Lyn P. Kirby : And then on the second question in terms of how have we done in economic downturns, if you go back and take a look at the history, we were certainly in solid mid to 6% comp numbers during the 2001 – 2002 time period which I think was probably the closest to the economic scenario we’re in right now and hence the 3% to 5% I think we think this economic environment is a little more challenging than that time period and that’s reflected in the 3 to 5 versus what we did back in those other years.
Evren Kopelman: And you guys mentioned you just recently rolled out Stila, how has that worked versus your expectations and any other new Prestige brands that we should expect in 08?
- JP Morgan Chase and Company: And you guys mentioned you just recently rolled out Stila, how has that worked versus your expectations and any other new Prestige brands that we should expect in 08?
Lyn P. Kirby : The first one, Stila, is absolutely meeting our expectations as is the second Prestige brand that I also mentioned Lorac is in its very early days, so that one we’re actually about to advertise for the first time in about two weeks but we’re also delighted with its performance even pre-advertising. So we have those two brands and relative to what we have coming, again we remain on track with the formula that I speak to which is that we’d like to have in any six month one brand in test and one brand rolling and we are on track with that formula for the back half of the year. We don’t want to comment on the brands that we have in test as much at their preference as ours. They don’t want to upset their distribution networks but we are on track.
Operator: Our next question comes from Lyn Walther with Wachovia. Please proceed with your question.
Lyn Walther – Wachovia Capital Markets, LLC: Following up on the last question, given the difficult environment are you seeing any sort of trade down to maybe the masstige or any resistance to maybe the higher price point items that you have?
Lyn P. Kirby : No, we’re not. We’re not a mix shift in the business. The biggest impact is versus a more robust economy is more on the customer traffic into the store. If we were in a more robust economy we would see higher traffic. Nonetheless our traffic is positive versus prior year. But the mix shift is not shifting. We are not seeing that down trade in the gain, I think it goes back to what we usually talk about which is that the category itself seems to satisfy her need for affordable indulgence and she’s not trading down to the personal preference in this category, she made trade off those shoes and the handbag, but within the category she does not appear to be trading down.
Lyn Walther – Wachovia Capital Markets, LLC: And your new store opening plans for 2008, what new markets are you entering, what percentage is backfill and maybe just a little bit more on the single market stores that you’re opening?
Gregg R. Bodnar : Lyn, on the single markets as we’ve mentioned a couple times we are doing a slightly modest shift, heavier emphasis in the single markets. It’s about five stores incremental to what we did in the 2007 program. We have about three new markets which we don’t disclose markets in front of opening them, but we have about three new markets in terms of state that we plan on opening in, in 2008. And then the flow of openings by quarter as I mentioned, 14 in the first quarter and then as you look at the rest of the year, one of the things that we talked about is we’re trying to balance our opening schedule throughout the course of the year versus how the stores flowed in 2007. So the fourth quarter as an example you’ll only see a couple stores opening versus the 12 we opened in 2007 and then the second and third quarter I would expect the rest of the program which should be about 48 stores to be balanced between those two quarters. That’s our objective.
Lyn P. Kirby : And if I could just add first quarter we have opened one new market in first quarter which is Alabama and we are delighted with the performance of both stores in that market.
Lyn Walther – Wachovia Capital Markets, LLC: And then just finally can you just maybe update us on current business? I know Valentine’s Day an important holiday for you in the fragrance business, just wondering how things progressed.
Lyn P. Kirby : We are mid-quarter and so we’re not giving too much information on the quarter itself other than to state that the guidance is certainly predicated on the trends that we are experiencing in this quarter to date. But Valentine’s Day specifically, Valentine’s Day was actually a good performance. The fragrance business showed some nice response during the Valentine’s Day period compared to a little bit of the softness that we had seen during the holiday period.
Gregg R. Bodnar : And we saw some nice success for the very innovative GWP, gift with purchase.
Operator: Our next question comes from Neely Tamminga with Piper Jaffray. Please proceed with your question.
Neely Tamminga - Piper Jaffray: I have a couple questions, but just following up real quick on Lyn’s question, I think in the spirit of transparency, since you are this far through the quarter are you guys tracking at the low end of your comp guidance and hoping that it lifts with respect to upcoming holiday spring beauty floor set or are you tracking at the high end and you just want to build yourself a little bit of margin? And then I just have a couple follow ups.
Lyn P. Kirby : Neely, we’re not going to get that specific in terms of where the performance of the quarter is at relative to guidance, but again I will repeat that the guidance is absolutely predicated on the current trends as they are performing.
Gregg R. Bodnar : Neely, I would just say we believe this guidance is prudent and we believe this guidance is prudent given the visibility we have at this stage of the quarter.
Neely Tamminga - Piper Jaffray: So just a couple follow up questions, in terms of the pre-opening I think historically, Gregg, over the last two years that we have the quarterly data Q2 pre-opening dollars do typically trend up relative to Q1, so are you suggesting with some of the early, early Q2 openings that the dollars from Q1 to Q2 could actually be flat in terms of pre-opening?
Gregg R. Bodnar : Here’s the way it’ll flow, Neely. Q1 will be approximately $4 million and then Q2 and Q3 as we’ve tried to balance the program will be about comparable but slightly up about 10 to 20% up from the first quarter and then in the fourth quarter we also have some additional pre-opening costs, about $2 million that primarily relates to as we rebalance the quarterly flow we have more stores in the first quarter of 2009 so we will incur some additional pre-opening costs associated with those in the fourth quarter of 2008.
Neely Tamminga - Piper Jaffray: So the guidance for the year is –
Gregg R. Bodnar : About $16 million of total pre-openings costs, $4 million of which occurs in the first quarter and then we’re estimating we’ll spend about $2 million in the fourth quarter a large part of which is related to early 09 stores. And then the balance –
Neely Tamminga - Piper Jaffray: Incremental two or two even?
Gregg R. Bodnar : Two.
Neely Tamminga - Piper Jaffray: Two total?
Gregg R. Bodnar : Two total.
Neely Tamminga - Piper Jaffray: And then in terms of when you’re talking about a test of a store or just a test of a brand, is that historically limited to a single store test or is that more you consider a test like a 30 door test?
Lyn P. Kirby : It actually varies depending on the brand but the tests have ranged anywhere from 30 doors which was actually Stila, we have had some brands that want a very limited test down as low as one, but I’d say the norm is more like around six to 10 because it’s rarely a test of are we rolling forward with the brand, it is usually a test of what are the operational aspects of the brand, let’s make sure we’ve got the resale strategies right and let’s make sure we understand the inventory mix on the brand.
Neely Tamminga - Piper Jaffray: And is there a generally good rule of thumb of when you guys are in test on a brand and then what time lapses before you start rolling it out to additional doors?
Lyn P. Kirby : Historically it has been test for six and roll in the next six is what we have done up to this point in time.
Neely Tamminga - Piper Jaffray: Is that kind of what you’re expecting for this year? The brand whatever you have in test right now is that the thing you would expect to roll out in the back half of this year?
Lyn P. Kirby : Yes, we are certainly expecting at least one of the brands to be ready to roll out in the back half of the year.
Neely Tamminga - Piper Jaffray: And then maybe could you guys just comment on Bruce’s departure, kind of what functions are going where and then more specifically other than we’re absorbing his functions and maybe explaining how if you’re going to add another 24 hours to Gregg’s day because he’s probably one of the busiest CFOs I know to begin with, so I’m just wondering how this is all going to play out.
Lyn P. Kirby : Let me give you some forward stroke, maybe not quite as specific although we do have a very specific game plan but I’ll try and keep it at a broad enough level but enough to give you some color. The first thing I probably should clarify is that, just for anybody who does not understand how we have organized all those responsibilities, Bruce has never had responsibility for real estate or site selection during his tenure with the company. That has always reported into me before Bruce joined the company and during his time with the company because it was such an integral part of our brand strategy and as you may recall us talking about on the road show we have a very seasoned Senior Vice President on that business who comes to us out of the Borders business. So that piece of our responsibility will stay where it always was which is reporting in to me. Recruiting for new stores has always gone through our HR team which have always reported in to me and it’s also headed up by a very seasoned player who has been with the company now for I think six years and that will stay right where it is and stays reporting in to me. And the rest of the team we have in terms of the responsibilities that did report in to Bruce which is around the distribution and the supply chain side of the business is again a very experienced team that were in place before Bruce joined the company, they are still in place today and I have great confidence that we have the right team in the right place to continue with the strategy of the business. I think if I could summarize the company is very dynamic and at this point in time, Bruce was just not the right solution for us and was not the right structure for us at this point in time. But I hope that clarifies enough. There are other smaller pieces of responsibility that reported in to Bruce but I suspect that most of your concern was around real estate and distribution and distribution will report in to Gregg as we go forward.
Neely Tamminga - Piper Jaffray: That does answer that question and thank you for taking the time to explain that, it was certainly a little bit of a surprise so I certainly appreciate that. And then just one more final question for Gregg here, in terms of what you’re seeing in average ticket or I guess for Lyn, average ticket and traffic are both up, I’m just wondering within ticket is it pricing because of Prestige or are you also seeing an increase in UBTs? Can you give us a little sense of how that ticket looks?
Lyn P. Kirby : The primary driver is definitely the Prestige mix on the business. As that business continues to grow in double digit comp numbers it is our fastest ramp business and you know we don’t comment on categories specifically but I think that particular category since it is such a growth platform I’m always comfortable continuing to give you a little bit of color and flavor on that one, the growth is not out of UBTs, it is definitely just out of the average ticket price of that category and as we did say we are putting positive traffic numbers on the table in fourth quarter and quarter to date first quarter we still continue to put positive traffic numbers on the table as we continue to just, I always say flex, but to creative, it’s not just flexing that marketing machine, doing some very creative marketing events both in store as well as in our print medium.
Operator: Our next question comes from Liz Dunn with Thomas Weisel. Please proceed with your question.
Lizabeth Dunn – Thomas Weisel Partners: Just a little help on the model, are we still looking for gross margins sort of flat to down slightly in 2008 and SG&A leverage and what sort of share count should we be looking for? And then I have a follow up question on the brand test strategy?
Gregg R. Bodnar : Liz, for the full year as we’ve previously mentioned the cost of the new distribution center is going to put a little downward pressure on gross margin along with our increased square footage puts a little bit of downward pressure on fixed cost leverage in the stores. So we are expecting gross margin rates to be down slightly to last year and then SG&A leverage is the primary driver to improving operating margin from there. So we’re expecting about 70 to 80 basis points of SG&A leverage at the top end of the guidance we described.
Lizabeth Dunn – Thomas Weisel Partners: And the share count?
Gregg R. Bodnar : And the share count for the first quarter 60 million, for the full year 61 million.
Lizabeth Dunn – Thomas Weisel Partners: And then my question related to the tests, how many brands are you currently testing and help us understand how you decide what to roll and then also Neely was sort of focusing in on what would be the determinant of when to test in one store versus 30. To the extent that there was a larger brand that you didn’t have big concerns on distribution strategy for and you didn’t have big concerns on whether or not it would resonate with your customers, what exactly would you be testing for?
Lyn P. Kirby : Let me see if I can get them one at a time. The one store versus 30 stores is primarily a reflection of what the brand would like to test with us and for them to get a sense of whether this is a good fit for them as well as for us so one store test is more on the brand making sure it’s a good fit for them, getting to know us. For 30 stores is a brand that has a comfort level that this is going to be a business fit that is right for them relative to the rest of their distribution channel. So that is probably the broad parameters of what causes us to make that decision. So it is done pretty much in concert and partnership with the brand and what works for both them and for us. In terms of the brands that we either have or expect to have in test in the first half of this year, I think it could be up to three that we will be able to test in first half of this year and I think the last question was and what determines whether we’re going to roll it or not roll it, it is most obvious which is just to make sure that it does have the resonance with our customers and the acceptance with our customers as demonstrated by the sales numbers as well as the brands comfort that this is a good time and fit for them relative to the rest of their distribution channel.
Lizabeth Dunn – Thomas Weisel Partners: Is there anything to constrain you from rolling with say three brands in one six month period or would that be overwhelming?
Lyn P. Kirby : It’s actually an excellent question. We want to be very prudent in how many we would want to roll and so we may pace that out particularly in a back half year roll where we really only have a quarter to roll, we certainly wouldn’t want to be rolling a brand during the holiday season and hence Stila as an example is why we held that until January. We did not want to distract our store from delivering the total business as opposed to just the more complex roll out of an individual Prestige brand during the holiday season. So we are not at the point of making that decision but I would say to you I do not see us rolling three brands in the back half of this year. We will pick and choose the ones that are the best fit for both the brand partner as well as us for the third quarter time period.
Lizabeth Dunn – Thomas Weisel Partners: And if I could just squeeze one more in on real estate, do you see any opportunities opening up on the real estate front, because there are some more mature retailers that are starting to announce some closings. Does that open up space in existing centers which wouldn’t have [inaudible].
Lyn P. Kirby : We are seeing it at fairly small level at this point in time, not a complete big bulk opportunity of real estate sites that come up although I will say to you we have done some work and analysis in case that opportunity arises on some opportunities that we think may become available. So we have done some homework already so that we would be good to go if the opportunity was to arise but there is nothing significant on the horizon right at this point time for the 2009 or 2010 year and nothing that we see for the back end of this year right at this point in time. But we certainly are watching.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Our next question comes from Daniel Hofkin with William Blair. Please proceed with your question.
Daniel Hofkin - William Blair & Company, L.L.C.: Just wanted to follow up a little bit on the same store sales specifically average ticket, how much I guess on the cost side how much cost inflation are you seeing and to what degree are you able to pass that through such that that might also be benefiting the comp store sales on the increase in average selling price aside from the benefit to average ticket that you’re seeing from the greater mix of Prestige? That would be my first question and then with regard to gross margin as we progress through the year, if you could just give a little bit of color as to how that might flow particularly relative to the third quarter where I believe that you had a bit of a change in the marketing calendar and so the third quarter gross margin of 07 was higher with a partial offset on operating expenses, how might that affect what you’re expecting for 087 as a whole?
Gregg R. Bodnar : We’ll take those in two pieces. One we haven’t provided quarterly guidance for two, three and four specifically. What I would continue to remind is for the full year we expect gross margin rates to be down slightly. For the first quarter we’re expecting gross margin rates to be flat to just up slightly and then as we flow throughout the course of the year it’s really more about the store opening schedule, it drives the most significant fluctuations in gross margin rate.
Lyn P. Kirby : Dan, on the first half of your question –
Daniel Hofkin - William Blair & Company, L.L.C.: Yeah, the first half of the question was just regarding I guess the average ticket component of same store sales. Obviously packaging and other cost pressures for many retailers selling consumer packaged goods that has been accelerating to what degree are you able to pass on cost increases if you’re seeing them and how much might that be lifting the reported same store sales or the average ticket component of same store sales?
Lyn P. Kirby : Dan, the answer is none and none at least at this point through the first quarter numbers we are not seeing any increases from our major partners on the business nor is there anything assumed in the three to five related to any price increases.
Daniel Hofkin - William Blair & Company, L.L.C.: Is I guess with regard to your comp sales guidance for the quarter and the year and recognize fully that we’re only halfway through the first quarter, I guess given the way that the comparisons flow would you generally expect to be maybe closer to the higher end of that range later in the year and more middle to lower in the first two or three quarters?
Lyn P. Kirby : We have assumed same economy through the quarter, Dan, the one thing that does flow a little bit we do have higher comps that we’re jumping over in first quarter than fourth quarter as you know from our numbers from last year so that may cause some profile in the quarterly numbers but we are not assuming neither an increase nor decrease in the economic environment for the back part, so it’s more about our internal hurdles we’re jumping over.
Operator: Our next question comes from Gary Giblin with Goldsmith and Harris. Please proceed with your question.
Gary Giblin - Goldsmith and Harris: To the extent your sales were a little softer than you expected was that more in products that lacked newness versus brands with a lot of new entries, let’s say would a Garden Botanika have done better than a Clinique because of the pace of new product introduction?
Gregg R. Bodnar : Gary, what time period are you referring to?
Gary Giblin - Goldsmith and Harris: I’m talking about the fourth quarter, let’s use the fourth quarter.
Lyn P. Kirby : No, Gary, the fourth quarter, again relative to what we had originally expected despite the positive traffic versus prior years that we put on the table to the overall challenging environment for fourth quarter the competitiveness of as I had mentioned in the fourth quarter time period we of course are competing in the market of all gift dollars as opposed to just personal care dollars in the other three quarters. It was far more a reflection of a lower traffic number than what we would have hoped for in a different economy is what I would say to you. But I do want to remind you nonetheless positive versus prior year. And there was no major shift between newness and existing business and response and performance to that although I will say to you I’m always delighted to have newness in difficult economy. I think we always talk about the four E’s in our business and that E for Entertainment and new products is one aspect that. I’m always delighted to have some exciting newness to speak to customers about in a difficult economy.
Operator: There are no further questions in the queue at this time. I’d like to turn it back over to management for any closing comments.
Lyn P. Kirby : Thank you again. I look forward to speaking with you during our first quarter conference call in June if not sooner. Thank you very much for your time this afternoon and your questions.

Lyn Kirby: Thank you Allison, good morning everyone. Thank you for joining us todiscuss the company’s third quarter fiscal 2007 results. On the call with metoday is our Chief Financial Officer, Gregg Bodnar. Following my opening remarksGregg will review our financial highlights and then I will provide closingcomments and turn the call over to the operator so that we can answer thequestions you have for us today. We are pleased tospeak with you today on our first quarterly conference call of thepublic company. As I told many of you on theroad show, UTLA hasbeen on an excitingjourney. For the pasteight years we have been repositioning thebrand, developing our infrastructure, developing our merchandising andmarketing strategies, while growing to 248 ULTAlocations across thecountry today. As aresult, today we are thecategory leader for beauty that we believe there is significant growth that liesahead. We want to thank you for your interest and believe theyears ahead will beequally rewarding.  The third quarter marked a successful period for our company. We delivered a25.4% increase in sales. We increased comp store sales by 6.7% and we grew netincome by 16.3%. The quarter also met with several noteworthy. Firstly, wecompleted a record number of store openings and remodels. To this end, weopened 26 new stores during the quarter. Our openings were well balanced with10 stores opened in major metro markets, 10 opened in medium sized markets, and6 in smaller markets. We added four new markets during the quarter withincluded Alabama, Ohio,Tennessee and Massachusetts.In addition, we complete seven full remodels in the third quarter and atquarter-end, operated 237 stores across 30 states. We accomplished this despite incurring a very slight loss of budgeted weeksfor certain stores due to some permit developer issues in just a few locations.Overall though I am absolutely delighted with seamless ability of our team toopen this record number of stores and remodels in the quarter and furthermore,I am pleased with the results of our new stores. Our 2007 class is performingin line with our new store model. Next year our plans include a smoother newstore opening curve on a larger number of openings for the year. As a result,we anticipate the number of openings we achieve this quarter to represent apeak quarterly opening level for next year. Based on this quarter’s recordnumber of openings, we are very confident in delivering next year’s storeexpansion program. For the fourth quarter, we have already opened 11 of 12 new stores with oneplanned store for January. Looking to 2008, our pipeline is full and 2009 isshaping up very nicely.  Our sales included strong comp store sales growth driven by both average ticketsas solid gains in customer traffic while our in-store experience continues todrive average tickets; our marketing continues to drive excitement and trafficto our stores. Integral to our marketing strategy is our database containing 6million loyalty club members representing a clear competitive advantage for ourcomp {inaudible]. During the quarter we added additional marketing targeted toour best customers which has proved very successful in the quarter. In additionwe worked with our brand partners to support this advertising investment. Wewill continue to flex our marketing muscle going into the holiday seasonfocused on strategies to deliver incremental traffic to the stores. In addition to our marketing, we continued to drive growth around merchandisingstrategies. The Prestige category generated double digit comp growth in thequarter and in addition, we have continued to float fresh new products andbrands into our stores. During the quarter we introduced new brands such asDermalogica, Juicy Couture, Nick Chavez and Jessica Simpson Hairdo. As wediscussed on the road show, a cornerstone of ULTA is our salon business. Wecontinue to be pleased with the ongoing development of our salon strategieswhich are generating strong comp stores sales growth. This growth underscoresour continued focus, dedication and commitment to this business as a corecomponent of our competitive advantage. Following quarter-end we did re launch the ULTA.com site. It is a bit laterthan we would have liked. The new ULTA.com was unveiled on November 16thand it is achieving a very good response rate for customers. As we begin fourthquarter, we are still working to optimize the customer experience on the newplatform yet we remain delighted by the improved features, functionality,efficiency and look of the site. Although we are late, we have alreadyexperienced days where transactions are significantly greater than last year’speak volume days. I certainly invite all of you to take a look and while it isunfortunate that we will not be able to harvest as much sales volume for thisyear, we do expect to fully maximize this platform in 2008. As we ended the fourth quarter we realized that we are operating in a verydifficult environment however we believe we are well positioned. Our inventoryis in great shape. It’s fresher than last year and it’s in the right categoriesand brands. Our stores look terrific and we have a very loyal customer base onwhich to target our high impact marketing. All of this has us poised to maximizethe holiday season. We understand that the season may reach high promotionallevels across all aspects of retail and we are prepared for this. We will beprudent in the way we invest to drive sales for the goal towards maximizingprofitability. Nonetheless, we will flex our marketing muscle by offeringexciting enticements such our great bathrobe as part of the gift with purchaseon fragrance gift sets and in addition we have chosen to go deeper into ourloyal customer list exciting marketing offers and have achieved a veryfavorable response from these vehicles early in the quarter. Again, we believe our strategies areprudent and balanced and have us positioned to achieve our fourth quarter salesand earnings targets. Coming out of theholiday season we will continue our Prestige brand expansion inthe month of Januarywith the rollout to alldoors of Stila Cosmetics which is currently being tested in30 of our stores. With that I would like to turn thecall over to Gregg to review our financial highlights inmore detail.
Gregg Bodnar: Thank you Lyn. As Lyn mentioned strong sales growth and a 210 basis pointincrease in gross profit margin more than offset increased expenses and drove a16.3% increase in third quarter net income.  Starting with the income statement and beginning with sales, for the thirdquarter net sales increased 25.4% to $208.2 million from $166.1 million lastyear. Sales growth was driven by a 6.7% increase in comparable store saleswhich follows a 15.6% increase in comparable store sales last year on arealigned calendar basis. Our comparable store sales were fueled by stronggrowth in customer transactions and a healthy increase in average ticket.Non-comp store sales contributed $17.3 million to total sales and total squarefootage increased by 27%.  As Lyn has mentioned, we opened a few stores and re launched the websitelater in the quarter than we originally had planned. This impacted total salesgrowth by approximately 2% in the quarter with no impact to net income. Importantlyall of our new stores scheduled for the holiday season are currently open andour store expansion plans include one store opening at the end of the fiscalyear in January.  Gross profit in the third quarter was $68.1 million or 32.7% of net sales ascompared to $50.7 million or 30.6% of net sales last year. The 210 basis pointincrease in gross profit margin was primarily attributable to an increase invendor advertising allowances offsetting increased advertising expense. Alsobenefiting gross profit was a decrease in the amount of accelerateddepreciation associated with store remodels, as compared to last year when theremodel program was launched. We do not expect these levels of improvement ingross margins to continue into the fourth quarter.  SG&A expenses were $55.6 million or 26.7% of net sales compared to $40.8million or 24.6% of net sales inthe prior year. Therise in SG&Aexpense is primarily due to anincrease inadvertising expense related to theshift in themarketing calendar given the53rd week last year, which resulted inone additional advertising mailer inthe third quarter thisyear. We also incurred anincremental $900,000 instock compensation expense, primarily related to certain stock option grants thatwere incurred by theIPO.  Pre-opening expenses were $4.5 million or 2.2% of net sales, compared to$2.9 million or 1.7% of net sales reflecting 26 new stores opening during thequarter as compared to 11 opened in the prior year. Pre-opening expenses werewell controlled. This was driven by extensive training and succession planningprogram which promotes new managers from within and we were able to gainmeaningful marketing leverage as we opened a record number of stores in thequarter. As a result, operating income increased 13.2% to $8 million or 3.8% ofnet sales from $7 million or 4.2% of net sales in the prior year. We werepleased to achieve this level of growth even after absorbing incremental costsassociated with stock compensation and pre-opening expenses related to our expandedstore opening program this quarter. Interest expense totaled $1.3 million as compare to $1 million last year.This reflects a $33.5 million increase in average debt levels as compared tolast year primarily driven by new store investments. The effective tax rate forthe quarter was 36.9% as compared to 39.9% in the prior year. The decline inthe tax rate compared to last year reflects an adjustment to our effective statetax rate but had no material affect on EPS.  The resulting net income was $4.2 million as compared to $3.6 million lastyear representing an increase of 16.3%. On an adjusted basis excluding theimpact of the company’s preferred dividends in 2006 and 2007, income perdiluted share for the third quarter of fiscal 2007 was $0.08 as compared to$0.07 in the prior year third quarter. For the first nine months, net sales rose 23.5% to $602.8 million withcomparable store sales increasing 7.4%. This follows a 13.7% increase incomparable store sales realigned for the 53rd week calendar shiftlast year. Operating income was $22.8 million as compared to $23.8 million. Thedecrease in operating income includes the impact of $2.8 million of warehousemanagement software implementation related costs, $1.9 million of incrementalaccelerated depreciation expense related to our store remodel program and $3.8million in additional pre-opening costs.  Adjusted income per diluted share which excludes the affect of our preferreddividends in 2006 and 2007 was $0.20 as compared to $0.23 last year.  Merchandise inventories at the end of the quarter were $219.5 millionreflecting a 62.7% increase compared to the third quarter last year.Approximately $42.7 million of the increase resulted from the addition of 49new stores opened since the end of the third quarter last year. In addition,approximately $15 million of the inventory increase relates to the calendarshift. This calendar shift causes each quarter of fiscal 2007 to begin and endone week later than the comparable prior year quarter. As a result the thirdquarter in fiscal 2007 ended one week closer to Christmas resulting inadditional $15 million of seasonal inventory as measured on an average perstore basis. Excluding the affects of the calendar shift, inventory at the endof the quarter on an average per store basis increased 3% compared to the prioryear quarter end. We are very pleased with both the level and composition ofour inventory as we enter the fourth quarter and the critical holiday season.  Regarding our outlook for the fourth quarter and the full year, for thefourth quarter of fiscal 2007 we estimate net sales in the range of $304million to $310 million as compared to $267 million last year. This assumescomparable store sales growth in the range of 46%, income per diluted share is forecastedin the range of $0.22 to $0.24 as compared to $0.19 last year, reflecting agrowth rate of 21% at the mid point of the guidance range. As a result for thefull year, we estimate net sales in the range of $907 million to $913 millionas compared to $755 million last year. This assumes comparable store salesgrowth of 6.2% to 6.9%, income per diluted share in the range of $0.47 to $0.49as compared to $0.45 last year. Our fourth quarter earnings guidance assumes aneffective tax rate of 40% and 60 million shares outstanding. For the full year,our earnings guidance assumes a tax rate of 39.8% and approximately 55.3million shares outstanding.  We project capital expenditures for the full year, which fund our new storeopening or remodels of approximately $115 million. We plan to open a total of53 stores and remodel 17 locations this year. A year-end we expect to operate249 stores, increasing square footage by 28% to approximately 2.6 millionsquare feet.  Our long-term growth targets on an annual basis include comparable storesales increase in the range of 3% to 5%, square footage expansion of 20% to 25%and net income growth of 25% to 30%.  I now would like to turn the call back over to Lyn. 
Lyn Kirby: In summary, our priorities are focused on optimizing profitability andearnings during the holiday season. We remain excited by our long-termpotential given the power of our compelling in-store experience, brands andcategories, our marketing machine and most importantly the talent andmotivation of our team. This combination has us positioned for success in thefourth quarter and beyond in our efforts to expand ULTA to 1,000 U.S.locations over the next 10 years. With that I would like to turn the call overto the Operator to begin the Q&A portion of our call.
Operator: Your first question comes from Neely Tamminga – Piper Jaffray.
Neely Tamminga – Piper Jaffray: Good morning and it looks like a nice quarter there. I just wanted to ask alittle bit more, if you could walk us through some of the brand introductionsfor next year, kind of what’s in test, what’s going to be rolled out, aboutwhat quarter. That would be helpful I think -- and you’ve got the Stila thingand maybe some other items on deck, but just kind of how should we be thinkingabout the rollout of some of these new brands into next year. Then I will havea follow-up question.
Lyn Kirby: Neely, we’re not really getting into detail on 2008 on the call. Wecertainly have a continued roster of new brands that we will both test androll. As you may recall our goal is to have one rolling and one testing in eachsix month time period. We are on track to do that. We do have a couple of otherbrands lined up for test next year while we’re rolling Stila. But getting morespecific than that would not be the right place to be while we’re still workingout the negotiations for the brands that we’re testing. But rest assured we dohave a full roster of exciting brands to roll with.
Neely Tamminga – Piper Jaffray: Lyn, would these be, the one rolling and the one testing, are theycomparable in terms of size you know, or is it kind of testing a two-footerwhile you’re rolling out a four-footer. I’m just trying to get a sense of themagnitude.
Lyn Kirby: Sure, no the brands that we are discussing and working with are of the sizeand magnitude of the Stila, if that’s helpful for a perspective for you Neely. 
Neely Tamminga – Piper Jaffray: Very much so thank you and then just one follow-up question for me, Gregg,the D&A you might have given it on the call, I’m not particularly sure, Iknow you talked about the accelerated depreciation and amortization, can yougive us what D&A was at the end of Q3 and what you expect it to be at theend of this year?
Gregg Bodnar: Yes, for Q3 Neely it was $9.5 million and then for the full year we expectit to be approximately $40 million. 
Neely Tamminga – Piper Jaffray: Thank you so much. Good luck.
Lyn Kirby: Thanks Neely.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Brian Atonic – J.P. Morgan.
Brian Atonic – J.P. Morgan: Good morning Gregg. I guess my two questions for Gregg are first maybe youcan update us on your IT or DC plans for first quarter or first half, maybejust give us sort of the time table, what we should be watching there. And thensecondly Gregg, it seems like the Q4 sales are coming in a little differentthan we had thought, but the earnings are coming in exactly where we thought.So just maybe help us out there, what’s happening on the sales line and whereyou’re making it up in earnings?
Gregg Bodnar: Yeah Brian, we’ll take that in three steps, DC and IT and then Lyn will talkabout Q4 sales and then I’ll finish it with the earnings impact. As it relatesto distribution centers, we talked to a lot of folks that we saw over the road showperiod. The distribution center is a key focus for us; we’ve already convertedthe technology side of it, as you may remember us talking about in the firsthalf of 2007. We are focused completely on the infrastructure side of thedevelopment. We still remain very focused on launching that new distributioncenter at the end of the first quarter and we are on track to do that. As it relates to IT in the first half and first quarter of the year, otherthan bringing up the new distribution center which does have some network costsand impact associated with it, we’ll primarily be focused on rolling out apoint-of-sale upgrade, which I think we’ve mentioned before. We’ve put that alltogether and then basically put it on the shelf for the fourth quarter to getthrough the holiday period and then we’ll be rolling it out into Januarybeginning of February. 
Lyn Kirby: As it relates to thebrand, comp is coming inas we expected. We’re on track there. Thedifference to what we had expected, as I had mentioned theecommerce site; alittle later than what we had originally hoped for interms of getting that launch up. That’s having about a$5 million to $6 million impact on total sales volume, although as you wouldexpect, not quite somuch on earnings, but Gregg will touch on that. And asmall shortfall interms of our forecast on asmall number of new stores as they go into thequarter. We had forecast some of thestores above model sowe are still veryhappy with the overallperformance of the classof 2007, but that is on arelatively small number of stores versus what we had forecast inthe budget.
Gregg Bodnar: So Brian, newstores performance continue to remain on track with our model as itwas in thethird quarter and then as we were entering thethird quarter, and then looking towards thefourth quarter, we just took some prudent measures on expenses, mostly inSG&A. Just to make sure that we were completely focused on deliveringearnings when we saw alittle bit of sales shortfall coming from thedot com site and theconversion on the dotcom site wouldn’t have been thestore contribution in anyway. But we pulled back expenses there just to make sure that we could manage ano-impact conversion on earnings from that sales shortfall. We’ve done thesame thing in theretail and corporate office, just prudent expense management. 
Brian Atonic – J.P. Morgan: And if I could just follow-up on those comments from Lyn, is there anythingin specific that those couple of stores fell short of your maybe aggressiveplan but was it a region of the country? Was it something that you could maybepoint out that we should be thinking about as we go into ’08?
Lyn Kirby: No, not really, more than anything else it represented us going a littleearly into some trade areas that are still ramping and we thought that we couldbe a little bit further down the track in terms of the model. We fully expectthat they will get back on track as the trade areas continue to fill out. So,no nothing significant, nothing geographic, Brian, some were just a reflectionof that. 
Brian Atonic – J.P. Morgan: Okay, terrific, good luck for holiday.
Lyn Kirby: Thanks very much.
Operator: Your next question comes from theline of Lynn Walther – Wachovia.
Lynn Walther – Wachovia: A couple of questions, can you give us a little bit more color on yourcommentary for holiday? Are you seeing something that is causing for you – justbeing conservative and just to clarify, in your guidance, are you planning tobe a little bit more promotional than last year given the environment?
Lyn Kirby: Certainly we saw the, what I would describe as a rather choppy environmentin third quarter, and going into fourth quarter I think the choppiness hasturned to just a little bit more volatility. Both the economy and consumerconfidence and of course just the calendar shift that causes the sales to comecloser to the last week of Christmas then it does in a traditional holidayseason. So both of those factors are what certainly have us very prudentlymanaging the expenses as Gregg described, as well as a very detailed oversighton our merchandising and marketing. The biggest shift that we have going on isnot so much increased promotional activities, so much as going deeper into our listwith our customer club members. In third quarter we focused more on gettingadditional trips out of our best customers. In fourth quarter we feel that thebiggest incremental opportunity is getting some of our customers that come inless frequently to come in more frequently and that’s where we’ve focused mostof our marketing efforts.
Lynn Walther – Wachovia: Okay thanks, that’s helpful. When you add abrand like Dermalogica or Stila, how much cannibalization is there or doyou see you’reattracting a newcustomer, is there away to measure what happens when you bring out abrand like this? And does itdisplay something else or is there room inthe store to add it?
Lyn Kirby: The bigpicture perspective is itdefinitely adds to thestore totality no question. There’s usually some modest cannibalization inthe short-term ascustomers tend to try thenew brand but we see thebrand stabilize back atthe end, theones that are cannibalized;often we do seecustomers buying from both of thebrands. I think theoverall picture though is very that themore brands that we put into thestore, the greater we areas a destination forbeauty purchases for customers and totality and sowhat we see is anexpansion of total customer traffic and I believe acquisition of new customersto the brand ULTAas we add brands to thestable. 
Lynn Walther – Wachovia: Okay, great thanks. Good luck for holiday.
Lyn Kirby: Thanks.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Lauren Levitan – Cowen &Company.
Lauren Levitan – Cowen & Company: Morning, Lyn I was hoping you could talk a little bit on the comment youmade regarding the challenging environment. Does that have any implications onproduct trends? I know you called out double digit comps and Prestige andcontinued comp growth in salon, so maybe help us understand how thatchallenging environment is impacting the actual consumer behavior in the storein terms of what they’re buying, maybe size of basket, composition of basket,thank you.
Lyn Kirby: As you know Lauren, we’re not going to comment on individual categoryperformance so I’m going to try to answer your question in some broad strokeswithout being too specific. I think what we are most closely watching is justoverall traffic to the store as opposed to category mix and shift. There iscertainly a lot of competition for the customer share of wallet from allretailers, not just retailers in the beauty sector. There is a lot ofpromotional activity going on. So we’re far more cognizant of that issue andbeing competitive in the total marketplace, then we are necessarily cognizantof individual shifts within the categories. We are not seeing any significantshift within that from what we would expect to see. Maybe just a little, theonly thing that I would even comment on, and I do believe this will come late,as the customer patterns shift close to the holiday season we tend to see fragrancecome a little bit later. We have watched this in other years. Specifically whenwe go back and look at our trend seven years ago, same calendar as this year,we certainly saw fragrance come a little late and we fully expect that it willcome late. 
Lauren Levitan – Cowen & Company: That’s helpful. Gregg you also called out that there was an extra mailer inQ3 given the calendar shift, can we assume that that comes out of Q4 and if so,what implications does that have on how we should be thinking about operatingexpenses in the fourth quarter.
Gregg Bodnar: Laurie, it actually comes out of all the way back to the beginning of theyear. It comes out at Q1. 
Lauren Levitan – Cowen & Company: So Q4, we’re a comparable number to last year?
Gregg Bodnar: Q4 we’re a comparable number to last year on a 13-week basis. 
Lauren Levitan – Cowen & Company: But we’re against 14 weeks, so it is still the same number, 13 versus 14weeks?
Gregg Bodnar: Yes.
Lauren Levitan – Cowen & Company: Okay, thank you and good luck for holiday.
Operator: Your next question comes from theline of Daniel Hofkin – William Blair.
Daniel Hofkin – William Blair: Quick question regarding the adjusting for the vendor sponsorship and theimpact on operating expenses, if you could just maybe quantify a little bitmore what those two line items might have looked like excluding that transferand then just elaborating on the last response, within in the mix, are youseeing any shift, I understand it’s pretty much in line with your expectations,but any shift along the good, better, best toward maybe some of the moreopening or mass price points and brands in this more competitive environment,more uncertain consumer environment, thank you. 
Gregg Bodnar: We’re not breaking down gross margins specifically, but what I would say isthat the increase in vendor-supported allowances related to advertising was prettymuch a one-for-one offset between gross margin and SG&A. 
Daniel Hofkin – William Blair: Right.
Lyn Kirby: And as we continue with our marketing efforts in fourth quarter and again,certainly more difficult with counting the back half year and the first half,we will continue with that same strategy in fourth quarter of working with ourvendor partners to supplement the increased marketing that we will do goingdeeper into our list.
Daniel Hofkin – William Blair: And the reason that you wouldn’t expect to see a similar kind of, if youwill, trade-off between those items in the fourth quarter as similar magnitudeas the third quarter, is that just expected to be a smaller amount, or what’sthe dynamic there that you’re looking for?
Gregg Bodnar: The bigger driver in the third quarter was the calendar shift as opposed tothe incremental marketing. So that calendar shift doesn’t occur in the fourthquarter. It’s really to advertising vehicles compared to last year. 
Daniel Hofkin – William Blair: Okay, thank you. Sorry, with regard to the just general comment onpurchasing patterns, obviously not quantifying specific categories, but justgenerally good, better, best.
Lyn Kirby: We’re really not seeing a shift other than ones that we have specificallydriven ourselves. We have been very cognizant of wanting to make sure thatthere were traffic drivers in our marketing mix, so we have put offers in thatare stocking stuffers as an example we have going right now. In the store, ifyou were to go in there, where you’re able to buy five small stocking stufferitems for $10 and get a free Christmas bag to put it in. So we have createdoffers like that to ensure the traffic coming into the store but other thanthat, where we have decided, we’re not seeing any significant shift or pricepoint shift versus last year at this point. 
Daniel Hofkin – William Blair: That’s helpful, thank you very much. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of [Herschel Ellison – Strivel &Company Inc.]
[Herschel Ellison – Strivel &Company Inc.]: If I were to pick up a newspaper and read a headline and it said something, said“boy is that really gonna upset ULTA” what might that headline say? Lyn Kirby One more time, I’m sorry I…
[Herschel Ellison – Strivel &Company Inc.]: If I pick up a newspaper, and I read a headline and I said, “Boy thatheadline’s really going to upset the people at ULTA.” What might that headlinesay? What’s your big fear?
Lyn Kirby: My big fear is that we get snow storms on Christmas Eve. There is noquestion that this Christmas, the last five days of this holiday season as areflection, not of the economy but purely the calendar shift, the businesscomes very late because we had that last weekend in here. But that would be mybiggest fear. 
[Herschel Ellison – Strivel &Company Inc.]: Thank you.
Lyn Kirby: You’re welcomed.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Linda McDonald – ManchesterManagement.
Linda McDonald – Manchester Management: I had a hard time following the line on the gross margin in the thirdquarter, that was a nice improvement that you saw and what you’re expecting forthe fourth quarter gross margin year over year. 
Gregg Bodnar: Yeah, there were two big drivers in gross margin in the third quarter. Oneas I mentioned which was the more significant piece related to the incrementalvendor funding of our advertising expense, which was primarily related to theshift in advertising in the third quarter from the first quarter as compared tolast year. And then the reason why we don’t expect that to continue in thefourth quarter or the magnitude, because it was mostly driven by this calendarshift and now we’re on a comparable calendar in terms of our advertisingvehicles compared to the fourth quarter of last year. So we won’t see increasein gross margin because we won’t have the incremental advertising that’s fundedby the vendors. 
Linda McDonald – Manchester Management: Okay, is there any way for you to quantify what the gross margin would havebeen without that shift?
Gregg Bodnar: You know we don’t break out vendor allowances separately and decompose ourgross margin, so I’m sorry, we won’t do that.
Linda McDonald – Manchester Management: Okay. Do you have any guidance for the fourth quarter for the gross margin,should we assume sort of a similar trend to the previous couple of quarterswhich was flat, just slightly down?
Gregg Bodnar: I would expect a similar trend to last year.
Linda McDonald – Manchester Management: Okay, and how about a little bit of guidance just on pre-opening costs perstore, as you said in this quarter you got some really nice leverage foropening a lot of stores, I think you said on the advertising front, what’s sortof a good number to look for for pre-opening per store when you’re openingabout 10 to 15 stores?
Gregg Bodnar: As we look to the fourth quarter, we’ve got 12 new stores to open plus wehave three remodels, so total of 15 projects and we would expect for those 15projects that pre-opening costs would be about $3 million or about $200,000 perstore on average.
Linda McDonald – Manchester Management: Okay great, thanks very much, I appreciate it. 
Operator: Your final question comes from the line of Liz Dunn – Thomas WeiselPartners.
Liz Dunn – Thomas Weisel Partners: Morning, my first question is for Lyn. You obviously have significantexperience, can you talk about your perception of how this category beauty,performs in a downturn in the business cycle versus something like apparel.Then my second question relates to pre-opening expense, it came in a little bitbetter than we expected, lower than we expected. Could you discuss that Greggin a bit more detail and will those benefits be ongoing?
Lyn Kirby: In terms of the category versus apparel, we are subject to the whims ofweather is it relates to traffic coming into our stores, so hence my ChristmasEve comment, but we are not subject to the whims of the weather gods as itrelates to product purchasing patterns. So we have certainly been moreresilient when we see weather like this. In terms of the economy itself, theeconomic conditions, the category has always performed very well in a softereconomy. There’s a logic for it in terms of a woman being prepared to forego somepart of her purchasing patterns, but not being willing to let go of her shampoobecause she does have to wash her hair. She does have to go to work so she doesneed to wear lipstick. I think the behavior is simply that this category is anecessity for her in many instances and not just a luxury purchase. Theexperience to purchase is an indulgent luxury experience, but the category is obviouslynot a luxury category. So I think we will see some real resilience as we havehistorically in a soft economy.  And of course the other big advantage in an economy like this for ourcategory versus apparel that we don’t have the markdowns that apparel merchantshave to deal with when there is the softness in the economy or strange weatherpatterns. A lot of our inventory is good, basic inventory. We see a lift inbasic at this time of year, obviously for example in the fragrance category, sothere is no markdown there related to our basic. If for some reason the trafficdoesn’t generate quite the way we expect, some of our seasonal purchasing doeshave return-to-vendor rights so we do have that opportunity in terms ofmanaging our inventory and our promotional goods that we purchase for theholiday season, again, has a slightly longer life than I think you will seewith apparel, that apparel merchants have. So the category, the buying patternI think is more resilient and our markdown strategies are easier to manage thanthe apparel merchants.
Gregg Bodnar: Liz, on pre-opening costs based on what you heard me just describe for thefourth quarter, we’re going to end 2007 at about $175,000 average per store.That is slightly below where we expected our model to be. I would say inquarters where we have a similar alignment, where we have this level of volume,we will see some efficiency so I do expect there’s going to be some quarters in2008 that will be slightly under that average of $200,000 per store. Again,most of it driven by, as we get better at building the pipeline for new storesand the general management structure for those stores and our store basebecomes larger, it gives us a better group of managers to be able to float theminto those new stores, which allows us to be much more planful in doing that.Also it allows us to train them on a shorter time period because they’reexisting store management. And then on the advertizing costs, to the extentthat we can get some economies producing our unique grand opening one and grandopening two tabs for those stores, as we have more stores clustered into a particularquarter, we’re going to still continue to see some efficiency.
Liz Dunn – Thomas Weisel Partners: Thank you and congratulations.
Gregg Bodnar: Thank you.
Lyn Kirby: Thanks very much everybody and again thank you very much for joining us onour first earnings call as a public company. I would like to take theopportunity to wish all of you a happy and healthy holiday and new year and welook forward to speaking with you next year. Thank you.
